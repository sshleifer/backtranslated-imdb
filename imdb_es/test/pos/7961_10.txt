The last time I checked here I think there was not more than one comment. I am very happy that more people have captured this movie now, and even more so that all of you are also investigating it. I captured this on Christmas night of 2004, and I found myself unable to change the channel on my TV, even though it was an Asian movie, and unfortunately but very used to not give any opportunity to any Off. Hollywood products. However, I did it that night, and I deeply thank God for it. I have not been able to get that film out of my system since then, it is not that I have tried or wanted to do it, and it still surprises me, in an extremely grateful way, that such a wonderful and wonderful experience has arrived in such a way. In this way, completely unexpected, like a Christmas miracle. Please, if you have the opportunity, go see this movie, buy it or arrange it for contraband or whatever, but look at it. I guarantee that it will affect you. I'm out of time, but I'm far from finished with my evaluation here, so I'll be back as soon as I can.
