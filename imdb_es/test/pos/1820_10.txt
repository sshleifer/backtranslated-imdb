This is the essence of the early eighties! Shopping malls, credit card machines, food, punk hair color, soundtrack ... I'm in love with this movie. This sweet and clever teen movie of Romeo and Juliet is instantly addictive. <br /> <br /> Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. She really employs her actors, like John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so check out -Joy of Sex- and -Real Genius. The soundtracks of -Valley Girl- are great. If you can find a copy of the movie, buy it! It is exhausted and it is very difficult to achieve.
