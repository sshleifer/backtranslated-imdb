Great "documentary" about the behavior of dinosaurs of scientists, captured with some of the most spectacular CGI since "Jurassic Park". Done completely seriously, like a prehistoric episode of "Nation Geographic." Grab your attention from the first frame and never leave you. My favorite part was when the Diplodocus fights the Allosauros. <br /> <br /> 10 stars. This is what science is about.
