I really liked that movie! It was adorably touching and fun. Finally, here is a story about a group of people who face some challenges, they falter a bit and then decide to be themselves and end up happy for them; When was the last time you saw that in a movie? Dealing with the fluidity of life, love and sexuality, the characters face real problems (albeit in often ridiculous situations such as men's camping trip and explicit reference relationships) and manage to learn and grow without the movie has preaching. Darkly desperate, or too unrealistic. You will love and care about the characters that, far from being empty stereotypes, portray real people with just a touch of the truth behind their possible labels. <br /> <br /> A good romantic comedy for a Saturday afternoon. and the only movie I've seen where sexual fluency ends happily, and no one is forced to be something they do not want to be. Much better than Kissing Jessica Stein, a good choice if you're tired of watching gay movies that have a painful lesson and a bitter lesson. Or, maybe you just like a good British romp? James Purefoy looks like always, and Tom Hollander is deliciously funny. So go, look, enjoy; You will not regret!
