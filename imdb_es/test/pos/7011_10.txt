It's funny how time went by and I never saw this movie ... 'until last week, when I was under a spell. I saw it twice in a week and it still was not enough. It's a great movie and I'll love to see it again. The story is great and it really moved me. I would love to live a story like that. The actors are great, the music too, and you can dream about your own love story. I just hope that one day I will find the opportunity to learn to dance like Johnny and Baby. I feel that dance connects people and unites them. I think people should learn to dance ... it helps a lot, especially in a relationship. It's great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body.
