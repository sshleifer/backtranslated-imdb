Great job! It was very exciting and had great acrobatics. A show that really shook. It was a great job for everyone who worked on it; And especially the performance by Bobbie Phillips. This would have been great on the big screen. I would like to see more of these movies of the week or maybe a weekly series. This was great entertainment and I'm glad to have seen it! By far, the best of the three. Keep up the good work of UPN and Bobbie Phillips. I'll be looking for the next one.
