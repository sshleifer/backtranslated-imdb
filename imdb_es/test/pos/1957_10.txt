After reading some of these comments, it is evident that some have lost the point. The wonderful thing about this movie (here comes the point), the incredible thing about this movie, the surprising thing about this movie is that there is no proselytizing. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. Life goes on. It is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for itself. These are just children who do what children do, without conscience. We all went to school with children like these. We are being numbed by fiction / / movie- / tv- / news based on reality / invention. <br /> <br /> Feck's girlfriend (Dennis Hopper the Great) alone and her relationship with her is worth the price of renting this movie. <br /> <br /> There have been few films before or since that are up to the intelligence of this movie. AMEN. <br /> <br />
