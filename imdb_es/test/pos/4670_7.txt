It is not the movie to see if you want to be stimulated intellectually. However, if you want to have a lot of fun in the theater, this is the only one. A lot of quick jokes (and some very cheesy jokes, too). Mos Def and Seth Green are very funny as comic relief. Exciting and creative robberies and scenes of persecution. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron (sexy) are attractive potential clients. And Donald Sutherland!
