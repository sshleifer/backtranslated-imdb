A European musician and composer aims to capture the musical diversity of Istanbul. A lover of experimentation with sound, Alexander Hacke (from the German avant-garde band Einstürzende Neubauten) goes through the streets of Istanbul with his mobile recording studio and "magic mike" to create an inspired portrait of Turkish music. His journey leads to the discovery of a broad spectrum that ranges from modern electronics, rock and hip-hop to the classic "Arabesque". While touring this seductive world, Alex collects impressions and clues from artists such as the neo-psychedelic band Baba Zula, the fusion DJs Orient Expressions, the rock groups Duman and Replikas, the rock hipster Erkin Koray, Ceza (Turkey's response to Public Enemy), breakdance Istanbul-style interpreters, digital Dervish Mercan Dede, renowned clarinetist Selim Sesler, Canadian folk singer Brenna Mac Crimmon, street performers Siyasiyabend, Kurdish singer Aynur, "Elvis de Arabesque" Orhan Gencebay and legendary divas Müzeyyen Senar and Sezen Aksu.
