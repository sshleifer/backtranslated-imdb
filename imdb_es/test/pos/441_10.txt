"French Cancan" is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is an excellent movie. There is color, there is humor, there is music. It is a very good portrait of the so-called Belle Ã‰poque, although Jean Renoir's priorities were always to show a creation, a fantasy. So the movie is not a historical movie. The final sequences in which the girls dance Cancan are unforgettable images. It is a movie that you should not miss.
