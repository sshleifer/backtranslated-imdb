Imagine spending the summer without your family or friends from school and meeting new people. Or, however, it is the first time that you are nobody and the only person you can count on is someone from the camp. "Meatballs" contains a lot of comedy in this movie. In the camp, there is an eccentric counselor (Bill Murray) who knows how boys and girls can have a good time. Enter a child named Rudy (Chris Makepeace) who has no one to admire. It does not fit with anyone, only Tripper can make it fun. The rest of the can are as crazy as Tripper. Camp Northstar is an average camp with an above average team. On the other hand, Camp Mohawk is an elite camp that makes them run for their money. In the game of basketball, the Mohawks put on their pants! And at the Olympiad, the Northstar troll got the revenge they needed when one of the members took out the saboteur. And Morty (Harvey Atkin), this poor soul can never get going if she tries. A very, very funny comedy, and it's a great goalie, I'll say. This movie shows that camping can be fun, if you want to be! 5 stars!
