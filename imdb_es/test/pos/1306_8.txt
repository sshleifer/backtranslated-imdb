Definitely worth renting! Good clean family entertainment. My 4 and 5 years old (and I) loved it. He kept them on the edge of their seats. I recommend that parents sit with their younger children to see this, as it can be quite suspenseful for them. It is not often that you can find movies that you can watch with your children, so this is a rare find. Some of the acting / realism is not quite there at times, or maybe it's a bit corny, but the kids seem not to notice or care, they love it. The parties are predictable, but others are not, like trying to find out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. The movie does not have anything really scary / spooky, and that's why I doubt it gives kids nightmares. Inspire children to dream, which is something that we should encourage and encourage more in our children. Rent and be blessed!
