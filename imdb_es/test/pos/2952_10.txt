For those who still prefer films focused on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must. <br /> <br /> By training attention on his own family, Block covers a field that is forbidden to most filmmakers. He explores a common but often tacit family dynamics, and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the movie has a seemingly low key from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In addition to providing a probing look at a family and, by extension, each family, Block has also described a very specific period in recent history. I do not know if this was intentional, but inevitable due to the archive content. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
