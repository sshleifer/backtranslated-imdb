This movie took me by surprise. I saw her for the first time more than 10 years ago, and she still stays with me. The truth is that they are simple boring points, and I, personally, I would have finished it differently, this has not discouraged me in the least so that I see it again and again and recommend it to others. The acting is fantastic. The cast and director do an incredible job with the script, and anyone who likes "different" movies, who has the patience to sit down and say "What the hell is this?", And get caught should give this movie a chance . If you just want Alan Rickman to be ridiculous or to see you explode, this is not the movie for you.
