Although it's definitely a nice way to spend a couple of hours and it's always worth seeing, this movie never meets the goals it should for two reasons. First, after the first forty-five minutes or so, he concentrates mainly on Helen and Johnny, who are much less interesting characters than most of the others: Janet, Jennifer, George and Miss Scattergoods are much more attractive. Although at first this works, since in life we ​​do not always know everything about everyone else, and because it is being pointed out that maybe Helen is a little involved, it quickly runs out and we want to see more of the other characters. . <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film seems to lose its direction in terms of plot in the second half. The lyrics themselves have much less meaning than in the first half and, once again, although this works well in some way, it seems strange to leave behind much of the potential shown in the first half. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is sweet and good-natured, with some genuinely funny moments, for example, Janet explains condiments to an avid audience. The lazy but quietly desperate atmosphere that Helen feels is heavy and the feeling of living in a small coastal city is accurately portrayed, but the film is not as smart as it tries to be. It simply misses being a light romantic comedy and being an intelligent portrait of life. However, it's still good and if you have the chance, it's definitely worth seeing.
