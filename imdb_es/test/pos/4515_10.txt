The Kite Runner was beautiful, moving and very moving. In particular, I loved the two children actors in the film, as well as the actor who portrays the father. It really made me want to go back and read the book again. <br /> <br /> Music was a wonderful part of the plot of the movie. If there is a soundtrack for the movie, I will buy it to accompany my second reading of the book. It is also a visually stunning film. The cinematography was beautiful and really added to the experience. <br /> <br /> The Brazilian word 'saudades' is very descriptive of how I felt at the end of the film ... "is a deep feeling of longing for someone or somewhere, which is very sweet but also dyed with an inescapable sadness "(definition provided years ago by Antonio Carlos Jobim). <br /> <br /> I saw it in a small cinema here for an advanced screening. I would love to see it again on a very big screen with a trap sound system. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the formal launch. I will definitely recommend the movie to my friends.
