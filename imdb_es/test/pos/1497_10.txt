Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is in this world, but not of this world. His mind simply does not seem to understand things as an average person would and his life is a long mess because of this, getting into constant setbacks and extravagant situations, which he must solve only as he seems to not mix with anyone and rarely speaks . But he never gives up and, even though the simplest task is a constant struggle for him, applying his own quirky methods to solve the problem is always worth it to him in the end. <br /> <br /> Look at the lament State of modern British humor, with all its approach to sex and general vulgarity, you will be forgiven for forgetting that a show like Mr Bean was performed at the same time. There is nothing inappropriate here, just a clean good mood, classified as U, Tommy Cooper and the like in the 50s. And I find it as fun as laughing out loud now in my first 20 years like when I was a kid at the beginning of the 90. <br /> <br /> Although now I can see it a little more deeply and see that it must be more for this character than what is seen with the naked eye. There must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to go wrong for him. As others have said, it seems that you may have a type of autism. In fact, I am so convinced that I really believe that a professional psychologist analyzed it, I think Mr Bean could be the first famous and fictional character to be diagnosed with something like Asperger's Syndrome. <br /> <br /> If you would like to see some really hilarious British humor in all its splendor before everything becomes obsessed with sex and vulgarity, then this would be highly recommended. Programs like Little Britain work because it is well done, but in reality it is as vulgar as the rest. In programs like this, we were once more moderate and civilized, and hopefully we can start putting this kind of humor up sooner. *****
