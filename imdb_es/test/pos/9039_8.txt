As a fan of Wm. Faulkner from the university, I was especially pleased to see Intruder In the Dust and for other reasons. My grandfather, also named Clarence Brown as a director, grew up in the Oxford area and was born nearby in 1888. We attended a week-long family reunion in Oxford in July 1964, just 15 years after filming the film. It still looked like the movie, but I was going through a period of civil rights upheaval then like Ole Miss's site. My memory is that it was a small university city that summer, but I was just an 18-year-old university. second and white. Right at that moment I was beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice, but I still had a long way to go. Anyway, it's worth watching the movie, but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tightrope to finish it there and I'd love to know more about that story. <br /> <br /> Now, Oxford is a bigger and more modern university city with all the ills that accompany those things and I hope to come back to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 years or more. Juano Hernandez should have been nominated for an Oscar that year, but Hollywood was still too fanatical to allow that to happen. Other Faulkner stories have been filmed, so look for them and compare them. One of the best was a treatment with PBS from The Barn Burner since about 1985, starring Tommy Lee Jones. He really captured the intensity of rural southern whites that Faulkner wrote so incisively so often.
