As I write these comments, I'm watching a DVD of this movie that I just received from a mail order seller, and I realize that it stays extremely well, with solid characterizations, credible situations, and well-organized action scenes. . <br /> <br /> It's been a good 45 years, maybe 50, since I saw HELL BELOW, but the only scene that made a deep impression on me was the Sterling Holloway death scene, which other commentators have mentioned here . . I have not reached that scene yet in this visualization, but I can answer for what other comments have said: once you see the scene of Sterling Holloway's death in this movie, you will never forget it. Judging by how strong the film is so far, I hope the scene lives up to its memory, as one of the best scenes of death in the history of cinema. The movie is worth watching only for that moment, but even without it, it would be a first class underwater drama.
