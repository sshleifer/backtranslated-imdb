Sometimes, you get up late at night rummaging through the stations, you get bored and want a light and fluffy romantic comedy that does not make you feel bipolar. And this movie fits that exact billing. Of course, the plot started in the 1930s ... the writing was as mean as the legendary poetry of the Hallmark Greeting Card company, and the one-dimensional characters were played by a cast directly from Central Casting, but it was CUTE. And exactly what I needed last night. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly and Costas Mandylor have a great chemistry together. I liked "Picket Fences", and I'm happy to say that they still have it more than 10 years later. Costas Mandylor, 41, is still possibly one of the most handsome men to adorn the screens since Rudy Valentino, old Rudy, kicked the bucket 80 years ago. RRROWRR! Extra points for choosing that funny man who used to be on the skates in that show about the cartoon lady. I always thought it was something out of a Hepburn-Grant comedy. BRAVO! <br /> <br /> Some people will probably say that this was the most jovial piece of cinema ever made, and probably would have to agree, but come on! It's on the Hallmark channel. What did you expect? Just lie back, relax, eat some sesame sticks and watch a sweet movie with two cute people and a bottle of Zinfandel. Trust me, you will love and accept much more the schmaltz, and then you can go to sleep dreaming of Costas Mandylor swimming in a sea of ​​tempered chocolate that feeds petit fours with fresh chocolate mint. YUMMO! (PS Now I have a longing for petit fours, THANK YOU, HALLMARK!) <br /> <br /> I really wish the evil girl had been chosen with Rachel Ray, and maybe that food nerd, Alton Brown , as the announcer instead of the spooky guy with Van Dyk's beard. Shudder! <br /> <br /> That would have made my night. But hey, take a look at "just desserts."
