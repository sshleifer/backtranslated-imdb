This is my favorite love story because it has all the elements that a good love story should have. Poetry, jazz, friends, the ups and downs in a relationship. Finally a film that shows positive aspects of the black community. Larenz Tate was great. I can not imagine anyone else playing the role of Darius. He recited that poem as he had written it and it meant every word. I own this movie and if I had the time to watch it every day, it always makes me feel better and that's what a good movie should do. In addition, the character of Savon could not have been better in dealing with the subject of marriage. We would all like to find a Darius, but most of us just settle for watching this movie. My vote is 10/10
