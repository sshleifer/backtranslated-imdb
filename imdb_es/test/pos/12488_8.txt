A pleasant and humorous mix of music-hall (in the first third mainly) and the mystery of the police procedure as the stories of the various suspects begin to collapse. The final exposure of the murder can come as a surprise if you do not look closely. A rough look at Paris of the time. You can ignore the final scene (the Hollywood ending). Louis Jouvet is the best police inspector that seems to be going on, but he is really aware of things.
