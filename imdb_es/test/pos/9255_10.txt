For all the homicide addicts, this movie was great! Each character that was once on the show made an appearance in the movie. It helped solve some (but not all) of the problems in the series. Unfortunately, unless you actually watched the series, most of the enjoyment would be lost, since the film made strong references to each season of the program's existence. This would probably have been appropriate as a series finale instead of being a separate film, but we have to take what we can get. I hope they make more movies and continue to present Homicide characters in Law and Order.
