*** SPOILERS *** Anything else you can (or can not) say about it, SUPERFICIE is superbly designed. The cinematography is simply impressive (to say the least) and the fx is nothing if it is not cutting edge. Conceptually, the program offers a little of everything, and for almost everyone (parents, children, fanatics of fantasy and / or fantasy). CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD TYPE through CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON with a bit of JAWS and GODZILLA in good measure, for example. And neither was there a single bitter note played in terms of acting, either; Some surprisingly solid casting, here. This series SURFACEd, apparently, out of nowhere and, purely because of its simple narration, took the viewer through most of the season. After all, a job very well done. I just hope it resurfaces next season ...
