I saw this movie when it was released in theaters. It is definitely one to remember, I had forgotten the title until recently. A friend found him through the online search. <br /> <br /> One Dark Night is quite unusual for the suspense / horror genre of the era when it contains no blood. It is of the variety of adolescent fear, however, adolescents are respectable in their own way. It's a nice old school movie with accessories and scenes that reflect the times. Our hero rides a motorcycle without a brain, for example. <br /> <br /> As mentioned by previous critics, One Dark Night is currently available on DVD. The original negative was not available for the DVD transition. Some reel changes are a bit harsh, but this does not take away the story. That said, the colors are vibrant and the lighting is very good. <br /> <br /> Adam West plays a rather small role in this film as RayMar's son-in-law. Fortunately, his role as a dominant and indifferent husband is short. <br /> <br /> The story is constructed throughout the film. Unlike many horror films of the time, One Dark Night is a great suspense story that gives the viewer time to absorb what is happening. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes or so of One Dark Night are the ones that do it that way. memorable. RayMar's telekinetic abilities are used to open old tombs in the mausoleum, remove the coffins, open them and move the corpses. Attention was paid to the great details in the final scenes. The bodies rotten and full of worms seem quite real.
