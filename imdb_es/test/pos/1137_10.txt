I saw this movie once a long time ago, just once, and I did not know where it came from, and I looked for about six years to find it, and finally I found it here on IMDb.com! The whole concept of the film is great, I think it has something to do with a race of biological engineering beings that are watching us and our planet, but there is a person who does not assimilate to conformity. And the way he does it, to avoid being tracked and located, is what keeps the movie entertained. I do not remember exactly how it ended, but I remember it ended with a great climax and a good turn.
