This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. His physically aggressive behavior is seen more often in men than in women, so it made me even more uncomfortable to see how the main actress behaved. I think women can think about this behavior, but I do not think they act accordingly. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that had to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I had hoped that the end would bring a satisfactory solution, but it was not so. Maybe that's more realistic. Life seems to run in the same direction instead of creating a new river bed that runs towards the hill.
