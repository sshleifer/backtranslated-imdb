This movie has inspired me to be a better person. In life you do not know who you will cross and, sometimes, our prejudices will make us prejudge a person wrongly. I have learned to give a person the benefit of the doubt because of this movie. I also learned that hard love can build a stronger person. Now I want to know where to find the soundtrack of the movie. There are songs on this soundtrack that I've been trying to get for years. I can comment on the performance for a second. Jamie Fox was outstanding. Man has risen to be the actor of the actors. Also the performance of Regina King was impressive. If I can get a woman to look at me like she did with Ray ... I can only dream. I took $ 18.00 for this movie and I do not have much money, but I'm willing to watch this movie again and again. This movie moved me.
