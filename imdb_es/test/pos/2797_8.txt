As a European, the film is a nice reminder of my time as a student in the 1980s and of the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982 to 1985, so one might think he is taking advantage of this experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how the film balances the message that "one should not generalize" with the idea that "for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth". For example, the Italian character is based more on the unpleasant aspect than on any known Italian stereotype. The German character presents some more proven and tested stereotypes. But the most stereotyped aspect of the film is not a character, but the central theme of infidelity. As one critic noted, infidelity is as crucial to French cinema as the class for British cinema. <br /> <br /> Both the main character and his girlfriend are interpreted as not entirely pleasant, which I think is deliberate and great. <br /> <br /> It may be involuntary, but some of the nationals have elements that could be taken as a metaphor for the perceived role of their countries in the EU. The British woman has an affair with an American (who is an artist, like a president of the United States in the 1980s), while the Frenchman shows himself as the natural leader (when the owner appears). <br /> <br /> Although Europe is not. As diverse as New York, it is surprising that we only see two non-white characters. One is a Chilean woman with indigenous features, which despite appearing the age of our main character is not presented as a potential object of interest. Another is a Gambian-Spanish man or, rather, Gambian-Catalan, who seems a bit invented. <br /> <br /> One might ask why Klapisch chose the protagonists who were all from EU member countries in Western Europe. While these nationalities reflect what he and I would find ourselves as students in the 1980s, I believe that exchange programs in contemporary Europe are much more diverse. The Erasmus program covers some 30 countries from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of which are not members of the EU. However, I understand that the choice of nationalities that are most familiar to most viewers may have been considered necessary in order not to distract from the contrast that Klapisch wants to create between the Europe of Peoples and Bureaucratic Europe. <br /> <br /> Despite the minor complaints, a great movie that made me consider returning to Europe to live. A French friend of mine, also expatriate in the USA. UU., Captured our shared feelings in this piece of contradiction: "If Europe were more like the US, I would go in the blink of an eye."
