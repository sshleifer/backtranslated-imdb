The Cure is a fantastic movie about a child with AIDS. I cried about 4 times watching this movie and it's very sad. I can not promise that everyone will cry when they see this, but they will make you want to do it. Very emotional and very sad, The Cure is a must-see movie. It shows you the meaning of friendship and love and it is an extremely good movie. <br /> <br /> At first I did not think it was so great and I wondered why my mother always cried when she saw her. But now I know it's an awesome movie that is so original and so close to real life situations, unlike most other movies that do not make sense. Words can not describe the greatness of The Cure, you just have to see it.
