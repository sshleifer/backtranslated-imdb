To solve a difficult problem, you must start by asking the right questions. Without these, even the largest information library is useless. This film does just that: where other films guide their thinking along a storyboard, this film attracts their emotions and their understanding of justice and what is allowed. These questions will catch you all the time, challenging your assumptions as the characters unfold. This movie is important. It is relevant, and a must for anyone who stays informed of current issues. The fact that it is very entertaining and includes a lot of movie stars just improves the execution. My advice: see it with a serious crowd or, better yet, alone, not unlike how you would read an editorial in your favorite news magazine. In this case there is a difference: the answers will be yours.
