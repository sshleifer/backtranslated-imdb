Blue planet ... Wow ... Where do I start? The years of hard work were translated into what, without a doubt, is one of the best documentaries ever created. <br /> <br /> The sights and sounds presented at Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and have not even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious guy who "wants to know". <br /> <br /> However, Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary. It becomes a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode. How many different ways can different sea creatures swim, kill, poo, mate and lay eggs, and do you really need to explore all these forms? But if you have a deep interest in marine life, this repetition should not become a problem for you at all.
