The movie has begun, the wheels are spinning, your car has entered a race against Fox ... You are behind, you can not be ahead, you imagine, "if I go out, I'll take you with me ..." You smash the cars parked on the side of the road, you turn to hit Fox but your aim is bad ... Bang, you've climbed up the back of a VW, and you've smashed into a reservoir. Your car lights up in flames. You could go out if you wanted, but the shame of losing has led you ... BANG! His car explodes, everyone looks desperate, some cry ... The sound of a siren tells him that the police are coming. Everyone gets in their cars and bolts, leaving you to burn. The charred remains of the frame of the cars are there, stalking the spectators ... You're dead. <br /> <br /> This is one of the scenes; Actually, it's the first scene in the movie. There are many more that they like. Upon entering the Fox cabin on his ford, Terry Serio in his crazy GTHO, and many others in this explosion of the past ... JOHN CLARKS 'masterpiece, "WORKING IN EMPTY" ": will win at any cost-"
