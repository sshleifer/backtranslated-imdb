"Oh brother, Where Art Thou" is a joyful account of Homer's "Odyssey," set in the 1930s Mississippi and rampant with a quirky extravagance that is the trademark of the Coen brothers. Three convicted wretches escape to find a treasure, and more than their own adventure, in this delightful movie. George Clooney is in a fine and witty way as the talkative and friendly leader of the trio; but the congratulations of the real performance go to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as their idiot but adorable cohorts, nicknamed the 'Soggy Bottom Boys' by the character of Clooney after they received the baptism by total immersion in a river. The three recorded a record under that name for the cash, and without realizing it became sensations overnight with a true state of "rock star". The movie is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical. And there are some incredible feats of filmmaking here: the scene at the KKK rally is really amazing, and it's so similar to the scene where Dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in 'The Wizard of Oz' that almost looks like cinematographic plagiarism. And what an incredible job of plagiarism it is! Without revealing the end, I must say that the climax of the film is one of the most impressive sequences recorded in recent memory (along with the spectacular finale of 'Magnolia', another of my favorites). 'O brother' is a must see, a perfect 10!
