Wales seems to be producing some extravagant movies recently. Actually, Wales seems to be developing its own small film industry. I recently saw Very Annie Mary, which I thought was very good. But Plots with a View is not only peculiar, it also laughs out loud, has a cast of wonderfully talented actors (Brenda Blethyn is incredible) and a plot that, although not entirely original, is so ingeniously written that it always He is choosing happily. Up to what could almost be disposable lines. It was the kind of movie I wanted to see again immediately after it was over, and one of the few that I would really like to have. Although many of the characters are caricatures, and you must have gone to a Welsh village to appreciate that, they are also very human, and the relationship between Blethyn and Molina is a pleasure to contemplate.
