Italian work is a real marvel to see. It is a genuinely entertaining movie, something that is seen only for the simple pleasure of enjoying it. It is not loaded with dramas or emotions, it has no cosmic statements about life and it is neither violent nor profane. It's just a funny movie. Between seeing the little Mini Coopers fly through the crowded streets of Los Angeles and the big fragments of stereotyped computer experts turned into criminals (played happily by Seth Greene), I had a lot of fun watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Special congratulations to the background music. They really set a masterful tone for a movie of this kind, so subtle that it keeps you on the edge when necessary. Apparently, many artists contributed to the music, I thought it was the most elegant part of the movie. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. It's not impressive, but it's a great movie to watch at the end of a terrible day at the office. <br /> <br /> Barky
