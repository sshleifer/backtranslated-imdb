This movie is the Latin godfather. An unlikely mafioso closes the gap with some unlikely alliances and forms an empire. I enjoyed the action and the shootings along with the cheeky performance and the colorful characters. This movie is not an Oscar winner, but definitely entertaining. Hey, who needs an Oscar anyway? <br /> <br /> Chapa has some balls to direct and act (I think that also produced it?) this movie. It reminds me of another filmmaker who likes to do everything, Robert Rodriguez. Keep it up, is there any sequel in the works? There are a lot of ropes that must be tied. Son comes and comes the death of the parents?
