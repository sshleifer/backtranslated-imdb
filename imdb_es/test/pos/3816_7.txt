This movie interested me enough to see it several times. The plot has holes, but the main artists make it work. <br /> <br /> Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge), does a great job as a 37-year-old woman who has sacrificed everything else to become a doctor. He worked years to earn money to go to medical school. She is performing brilliantly at her residence and is about to take the board exam and make her dream come true. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Julia's sister and brother-in-law are murdered and as the closest living relative is forced to take her niece Amanda (Arlen Aguayo-Stewart) to prevent her from becoming a ward of the state. Amanda is about 7 years old since her appearance. Amanda is so traumatized by the murder of her mother that she has remained speechless. Needless to say, Julia's 16-hour days become more caregivers for Amanda. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney, a charming neighbor in his apartment building who makes his way into the lives of Julia and Amanda. He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda deal with her anguish. Amanda really starts warming up Kevin as the movie progresses, perhaps more than her aunt. Julia begins to trust that Kevin will take care of Amanda while trying to handle her case load and prepare for the board exam. Kevin is always there when a crisis arises for Julia. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great. You keep looking to see them meet before the end of the movie. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was also good. Arlen managed to transmit a lot without the benefit of the words. The plot made Julia and Amanda gradually warm up. You can watch them develop a relationship as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> We discovered that Julia's sister and brother-in-law (the Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft. Julia discovers that the Meyers planned to omit the country under assumed identities. The plot is not clear if the Meyers had the intention of doing a double crusade with their associates or if they themselves were double crusaders. <br /> <br /> In any case, the Meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates. The killers do not try to extract the location of the Meyers' microchip before killing them. The murderers search the house and can not find their prize. They leave a living witness of their crime, Amanda. The murderers then spend the rest of the movie making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from Julia and Amanda, who have no idea where the prize is. Finally, the murderers kidnap Amanda with the hope that she knows something about the location of the microchip. <br /> <br /> Finally, Julia discovers the truth about Kevin. He is a researcher hired to recover the stolen microchip. After some difficult moments in the relationship, they manage to rescue Amanda and dispatch the bad guys. The predictable ending has the three of them forming a family and moving happily towards a future together. <br /> <br /> What caught my attention was a big hole. Kevin moves into the same apartment building as Julia and Amanda the day after the Meyers' murder. How do you know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the murderers? The killers gladly leave fingerprints at the scene of the murder, without worrying about hiding their identity. The murderer who claims to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by the red paint remains of the murder scene on his shoe soles. He was not shown at the murder scene at the beginning of the movie. There are other weaknesses in this sense too numerous to mention. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been much better if the script had been refined more before filming. Filling the holes in the plot would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort.
