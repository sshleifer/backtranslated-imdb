Apparently, this is the first movie with Gloria Swanson, the movie that made her a star. While she was good at the movie, I can not see how this particular performance was so remarkable at the time, but it was still a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Gloria interprets the wife of a rich Poverty who continually takes her for granted. He cares little for his cleanliness, eats onions and forgets his anniversary! And, at the same time, a Lothario enters their lives and begins to pay much attention to Gloria and her husband does not realize or give him any reason not to deceive him. Ultimately, she divorces her husband and marries Romeo, who speaks without problems. However, while the film could have been an exaggerated melodrama (they were quite common at the time), it takes some interesting twists and turns and is an imaginative and funny movie. While it is not the best silent film I have seen, it is outstanding and deserves to be remembered. <br /> <br /> By the way, the DVD release of Image Entertainment is surprisingly good, with decent print and music. This has not always been the case in the case of other Images releases (in particular, the way they handled Chaplin's releases).
