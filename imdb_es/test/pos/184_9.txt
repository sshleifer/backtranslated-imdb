Last night I saw this movie at TCM, all excited expectations, the last time I saw her (twice) at her memorable 1957 premiere in Toronto. I told my wife, who had not seen him before, to watch the thrilling long shot, uncut, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris. In a hand frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot is raised and the cranes (involuntary play of words) on the street when it leaves the bus, and is thrown between the tanks to cross the street. THEN I remember that, without cuts, we followed her close to the fence while she looked through, looking for him anxiously, but could not find him. But we continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of the harassed recruits and their emotionally insane women, all extras, and each of them is a jewel of Stanislavskian's fascinating behavior. How, one wonders, Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky established this extraordinary sequence. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene ended abruptly, and he trimmed the scenes in the apartment, before continuing with the soldiers and their families on the fence. It seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also reissued. What a disappointment!
