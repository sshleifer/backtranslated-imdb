This is a kind of lovely movie, they do not like to make them more like this. Well played by all and full of actors of interesting characters. A clever and witty script acted with the right combination of broad comedy and underestimated humor. Supports repeated visualizations (annuals?). <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** the renewal of this film with the same name, directed by Arnold Whatwashethinking, is an unbearable disaster, painful to watch, without a spark of the charm and wit of the original.
