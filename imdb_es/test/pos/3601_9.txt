This film gives us some history of World War II along with a touching romance, a little fantasy and significant emotion, and beautiful landscapes. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again he does a great job. And so do the other main characters. A key character, the doctor / father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've heard. Some of the events are a bit coincidental to be real, but I apologized, knowing that this is partly fairytale and fantasy. My wife and I really liked the movie. And it's good to see people take the risk of loving the enemy. A man who left the theater near us told his wife: "That's the way to make war!" I think you'll see what it means when you look at the Italian occupants of this beautiful Greek island.
