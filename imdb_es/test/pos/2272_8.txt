This is beautiful Everything Is Illuminated is sweet and sublimemente fun from the first and delicious line of dialogue. Oh, how I've been waiting for this to come to Austin. While Elijah Wood is as charming as Jonathan Safran Foer (the author of the real life of the novel Everything Is Illuminated), it is Eugene Hutz (playing the guide and Ukrainian translator of Jonathan, Alex) who truly steals this film. Alex is a Ukrainian dancer who loves hip-hop-lovin and who, together with her grandfather, helps Jonathan find the woman who saved Jonathan's grandfather's life during World War II. The Ukrainian field has never looked so impressive. I'm thinking of packing everything and moving to the old Soviet state. <br /> <br /> However, the tone of the film changes when Jonathan and Alex finally meet the woman they are looking for, and Suddenly, this adorable comedy becomes a heartbreaking historical drama about a Jewish people that was annihilated during the Nazi occupation. Everything is illuminated has to do with history, heritage and wisdom that can be obtained by discovering the past. It is perfect.
