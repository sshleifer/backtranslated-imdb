So well done, there is no CGI garbage. Has anyone else been to the "Jumping Crocs" tour of the Adelaide River in Darwin before? Black Water was very realistic; Rogue was a little shy. <br /> <br /> I thought the blonde girl was excellent at that, I had not seen her before. And the other girl is a baby, she is always excellent. <br /> <br /> V. suspenseful - I would compare it to Jaws about any other animal film that ate a man. <br /> <br /> I grabbed the hole of the Australian thing without going through OTT with struths and crikeys, too. <br /> <br /> I loved it!
