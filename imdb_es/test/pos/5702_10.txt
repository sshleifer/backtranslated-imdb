... and my reasons why they are simple: here many great films are presented and discussed (most of them by their own directors and stars), many clips of infamous moments in the cinematographic history of the 70s and, in fact, Several movies that I have not yet seen, it would not be fair to rate this work. Because of this logic, I should not have given notes to other film documentaries such as Martin Scorsese's personal journey through American Movies and My Voyage to Italy. But while those films were based on a man's film vision, narrating through most of the way, Richard LaGravanese and (the deceased) A Decade under the influence of Ted Demmes let the films and the creators speak for themselves same. <br /> <br /> What makes 'Decade' worth at least one watch for movie lovers, or just anyone who likes movies from the late 60s and 70s in the United States, are the levels to those who go, who have not been cut. version (three hours, not the theatrical version, about which I do not have comments) covers a lot of ground. The interviews include Scorsese, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Julie Christie, Jon Voight, Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Schrader, Pam Grier, Bruce Dern, Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper, Robert Towne, etc., and there is a constant Knowledge flow from beginning to end. The way the clips and the directors / actors appear, edited together in a striking and fast style, is also fascinating. <br /> <br /> The only comment I have about the documentary is that most of the information presented has been reported in several books, such as Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, and although I have not seen the film version of that book, however, I'm sure I would have covered many of the films and directors and incidents like here (in fact, that book is one of the best I've read.) HOWEVER, this documentary serves as something special for amateur filmmakers and occasional film fans of the future: you can see this and learn not only about such well-known images as Easy Rider, The Last Picture Show, Annie Hall, Coming Home, and landlords known as Scarecrow, Panic in Needle Park, The Owner, Joe, they shoot horses, they can not, they can also learn about who influenced them (new waves of Europe and Asia), who they served as influences and how the issue that created the controversy after the controversy still Irve as an intriguing and chancy material for the contemporary crowd. Look for this or Utah!
