Everyone told me to see "Flor de cactus", and finally I did. What a wonderful movie: the perfect place for a Sunday night / scary Monday morning. Matthau and Hawn were good, but Ingrid Bergman really made this movie, after all, it was really about her. The real great actors can do anything, and Miss Bergman proves it. She shows us, in the course of a movie, a range that few people show throughout her career. The scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was moving. Even when the movie came to its obvious conclusion, I found myself cheering Miss Dickinson as if she were the Boston Red Sox. Fortunately, she did (did not pretend) much better. ;)
