I loved it. <br /> <br /> The camera angles are great, it's not as nervous as a Blair witch. And I thought they did a great job with sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Too much fun. Many people shouted on the screen! <br /> <br /> Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. It is much less one-dimensional than most terror heroes. <br /> <br /> Kane is much less scary and more believable than most of the movie's psychopaths. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations. There are not many twists here, but it's smart and original in its own way. Well, spooky, b-movie slasher fare.
