The quality of the animation here is decidedly inferior to the IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters do not. <br /> <br /> This may sound tricky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by live machines, would you feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, myopia and greed so effectively? I doubt it. There are some indications of this in the film, but only when the team can bother to put them, in general, the 'bioroides' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters. I seem careless. <br /> <br /> The main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement, although no light is thrown on this. Little light is thrown on the background story, a great pity. The short duration of the film along with the focus on mecha and crime means that we do not see any depth of character. The base work is down, however, we are left without finished product. A cut-out version of this OAV would have been a great television episode, once some subplots of characters have been established. <br /> <br /> The highlights of this short film are the wick designs and the action / espionage. <Br /> <br /> Faults really start showing up once you've had a chance to digest all the events, so I could not recommend this to own, but it's certainly worth a watch or two! While this review is mostly negative, I really think it's worth spending time to see this, but it's not something to rush and buy. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: an observable, measurable opportunity.
