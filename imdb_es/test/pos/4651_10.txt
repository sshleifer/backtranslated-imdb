Hilarious, clean, cheerful and worthy of a date. What else can you ask for in a movie? This is my favorite number one movie of all time. Since I was a child, I dreamed of having a blue van with flames and an observation bubble. <br /> <br /> Clich√© characters in ridiculous situations are what makes this movie so fun. The wonderful comic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) make up most of my favorite parts of the film. And who did not love Flynch's desperate awkwardness? Do not forget the antics of the airport of Leon's friends, disguised as Hari Krishnas: dance, sing and play the tambourine, unbeatable! The tracks are great, the locations are classic and the plot is timeless. <br /> <br /> A word for the wise: if you did not see this movie when you were little, you probably will not win anything. Place in your heart today. But nevertheless, give him a chance, you can find that "No matter what you say, no matter what you do, you have to play."
