Greta Garbo stars in 'Anna Christie', a 'talkie' from MGM very early in 1930, the first time 'Garbo Talks'. 'Anna Christie' is a powerful film but not for everyone. The film is filmed as a play, with scenery and cinematography, much with dialogue and dramatic characterizations. Eugene O'Neil, who wrote the play "Anna Christie", is known for his dark work and the character of Garbo, Anna Christie, is a grim figure with a tortured past. <br /> <br /> The sound quality on the DVD was mediocre. What does not help is that George F. Marion, who plays Anna's father, Chris Christofferson, is verbally difficult to understand. Marion performs well as the old drunken sailors who teeter on madness with their fixation on the evil "devil's sea." But his dialogue is written with a strong Swedish accent, this is true for the original work of O'Neils. The dialogue of Marie Dressler as Marthy Owens is equally difficult to understand. Dressler credibly represents an old drunk rotten, a "dock rat." His dialogue is also true to O'Neils' original work, as is Charles Bickford as the Irish sailors, Matt Burke, who pursues Anna in a problematic relationship. Garbo is actually the easiest to understand. <br /> <br /> The strong point of the film is Greta Garbo. She offers a harrowing performance as a victim of negligence and abuse, leading to a life of prostitution. Garbo was a great star at that time and was considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Here her gaze is not glamorous, she is tortured. The posture of his body almost doubles in agony. She wrinkles her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. Garbo transmits these feelings full of anguish to the spectator so that he convinces us of his misery. <br /> <br /> This is a dark subject and Garbo gives it life. It's not light food, it's not fun, it's not for everyone. "Anna Christie" are strong emotions that arise from the depths to be examined, this is a hellish journey.
