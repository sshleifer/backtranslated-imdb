After many, many years, I saw this beautiful love story again, thinking how I would react, half a century later, to a movie that made many girls cry and sigh at that moment, when I was just a teenager trying to understand. Behaviors of women, in a small city in Brazil. <br /> <br /> This time, however, what caught my attention in the film was something very different, namely, the insistence with which the doctor, Dr. Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) makes clear to the journalist Mark Elliott (William Holden) his special ethical condition as Eurasian. In fact, she is constantly putting an emphasis on this point in their relationship, repeating that she is willing to assume her love for him and continue in a "Western" manner, provided that, in doing so, she is not betraying her Chinese side. . It seems to the viewer that Suyin is making a great effort to establish a very subtle conciliation between these two unstable and opposite aspects of their culture, since they will immediately engage in a manifest conflict in their mind with minimal failure in their attempts to control them. <br /> <br /> So, Suyin's attitudes always leave poor Elliott? A determined, courageous and extremely practical man? anxious and perplexed, not knowing how important it is to give her words. For him, whose love for her is simple and simple, the situation is totally clear: if we love each other, let's make a couple and start a life together immediately. "Not so fast," is what she seems, verbally and non-verbally, to answer all the time. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Chinese portion of Suyin would never allow such a level of pragmatism. And, as it advances and reinforces this balance so directed between those two worlds within itself, it also frequently points out that also a very peculiar trait of Chinese culture is deeply ingrained in their mind, namely, the constant "incursions" " in the world. Real world by invisible beings of a spiritual or non-physical world. Suyin always warns Elliott about how dangerous life is, not because of an objective and concrete threat (such as the perpetuation of English colonialism or the eminence of a Japanese invasion), but because of the threats of a lot of cruel and harmful. Gods and other mystical and mythical beings about poor, fearful and vulnerable human beings. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems that a lot of Chinese deities are permanently monitored to make people's lives totally miserable. Therefore, mothers should dress their precious baby boys with girls' clothes, so that the jealous gods do not take them away; all must always be ready to make loud noises to drive away the clouds, in order to prevent them from covering the view of the moon; Farmers are advised to shout "Rice is bad! Rice is bad!" to protect their crops from being stolen by the deities; and, in a funeral, it is recommended that the family of the dead be isolated from the other people with curtains, so that the gods do not take advantage of their pain and fragility. <br /> <br /> In other words, Suyin introduces us into a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence, as if a rather disturbing pantheon of evil and sadistic gods was always on the verge of interfering negatively with the most banal in anyone's daily life. <br /> <br /> As the story takes place in Hong Kong in 1949, it should be clear that China really was, at that time, almost a semi-feudal society, while the country from which Elliott came was still not dominated for the ferocious capitalism that, launched by the United States after the first oil shock in 1973, took over the whole world. Therefore, at least in one respect, both sides of the Eurasian Eurasian personality were still far more innocent than they would be today. <br /> <br /> Much of the story came from those old days. As for China, the main fact is that, after several phases of a communist regime, the country finally achieved, in the last two decades, the condition of a very aggressive economy, much more properly described as state capitalism. And what happened to that old spirituality that so captivated Suyin in Hong Kong in 1949, and with which he used to impress Elliott so passionately, under that tree on the hill behind the hospital? It's gone, it's gone completely! In short, if that story took place today, Elliott would not have to go to China to propose to Suyin in the presence of the Third Uncle and his entire family. In fact, both men would now be incomparably closer to each other, in their great pragmatism, speaking as usual!
