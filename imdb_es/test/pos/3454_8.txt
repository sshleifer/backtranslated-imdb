I rented this dark Australian relic a few years ago to show it at a friend's house and it was an instant success. The classic story of the oz wizard with a decidedly 70-year-old Australian touch. Acting is not exactly Shakespeare. Society stuff here, but later, the "Mad Max" star Bruce Spence is a beautifully underestimated surfer / scarecrow and there are some wonderful comic twists by Gary Wadell and Robin Ramsay as a delightfully 70-year-old fairy godmother, fairy godmother / paternal character. Musical contribution of former Daddy Cool leader, Ross Wilson, in the title song. In a vein similar to Australian comedies like "Priscilla queen of the desert". Good fun.
