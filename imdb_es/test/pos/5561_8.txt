An astronaut is lost in deep space and is traveling through unknown territory aboard a living spaceship accompanied by a group of aliens. This incredible installation of traced and pleasant TV appears as a fantasy of positive birth. The individual characters, in conflict at the beginning of the series, have to learn to get along and eventually evolve into a powerful group. Most of the action takes place inside the uterus of Moia, the living spaceship (which even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). While science fiction stories are often interested in negative fantasies of birth (see movies 'Alien', for example, especially in the fourth part 'Resurrection'), this is a surprise. It is also pleasant the absence of military hierarchy on board the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human body (and strange). One of the female characters that is actually a plant experiences photoasms while being exposed to sunlight. The crew even has to go to the bathroom. Would not that be impossible in 'Star Trek'?
