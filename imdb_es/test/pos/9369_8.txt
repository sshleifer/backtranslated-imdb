Crossfire remains one of the best Hollywood message movies because, unlike the admirable intentions of the Gentleman's Agreement, which hit theaters for a few months, it chooses to send its message through the excellent black thriller instead of having an indignant star constantly saying, "It's because I'm a Jew, is not it?" It's much easier to get the message that hatred is like a loaded weapon when the corpses are real rather than metaphorical. "Something shameful, the brief article on Warner's DVD he mentions that the novelist Richard Brooks rejected the film for the change from a homophobic to an anti-Semitic murder, but it is interesting to note that although the victim is murdered mainly because he is Jewish, there is little doubt in Sam Levene's performance that the character is, in fact, also gay? it's not an annoying caricature, but there's definitely an aspect of two lost souls in their scenes with the confused soldier of George Cooper: There's not much mystery to who the killer is: although the murder takes place in the classic noir shadows, the murderer's body language is instantly recognizable, but then the film has its characters to the same conclusion before the midpoint . : the tension comes from trying it and saving the man who falls. <br /> <br /> There is an element of Ealing Films in the gang of soldiers who come together to take their friend out of a situation (you could almost see that aspect as a plane for Hue and Cry), but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir. Set in a long, stifling night, the film has a great look full of deep dark blacks and shadows born both out of economics and style (cut out the lighting time and gave the director Edward Dmytryk more time to work with the actors ) and The excellent cast makes the most of the excellent script: a relaxed but quietly charismatic Robert Mitchum, Robert Young's detective with Maigret, Gloria Grahame's vagabond and the perpetually creepy Paul Kelly as his compulsive liar admirer, a guy who deals with stories in the path. Other people try the ties. But the lasting impression is of Robert Ryan's excellent performance as a boy who would do well to leave him alone, as he goes to great lengths to help the man wrongly accused to death row. As a big surprise in 1946, as a reward, Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott were investigated by the HUAC, which in turn had a remarkable tendency to attack the Jews. So much for the crusade?
