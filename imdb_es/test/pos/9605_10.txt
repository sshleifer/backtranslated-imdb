Having obtained a copy of Bostocks Cup, I must confess that it is not as fun as I originally thought. IS BETTER!!!!! Charlie Williams ... eat your heart. ¿¿Match of parties ???? Never! Slope slope to 45%? Ronnie and Reggie Kay? George Best? The pilot who thinks Pontefract is in South Wales (it's all Ponty this and Ponty that) the lucky hat of the Bertie Masson Cup (Tim Healey)! (not that it is in tricks) Sugar Plum Fairy ????? Confused???? Look again. The innovative use of real footage with Bostock players was brilliant and the producer should be proud to give us a MASTERPIECE. Come on, ITV, do the spectators and yourself a favor! Please>
