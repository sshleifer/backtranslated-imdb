I do not know what the last critic is talking about, but this show is pure entertainment. Basically, 2 types are put in competitions in a club to pick up the girls in 3 different scenarios. They mix the stages for each show, so it's not the same every time. The panel of 4 judges is not afraid to call people or admit it when they recognize the game. They will break down what the boy did wrong and what they did well. Some contestants are weak, others are strong, but what happens is always entertaining. If you are a boy that goes out, you can relate. I've seen a weak game, I've seen a strong game, and this show is real. Definitely.
