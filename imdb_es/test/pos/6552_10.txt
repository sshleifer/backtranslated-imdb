Uzumaki has a formidable reputation within the Lovecraftian circles and now I know why. <br /> <br /> Uzumaki is based on a Manga title (which, incredibly, is supposedly better than the movie) and follows the strange events that precede a typhoon in An isolated Japanese town. I'm not going to tell you anything about what happens in this movie because it's a movie you can not miss. I saw it for the first time last night and I was impressed. It was filmed in my best movies of all time and jumped frog Pans Labyrinth as the best fantastic movie (literally and photographically) that was released in the last decade. <br /> <br /> This movie is very Lovecraftian by nature. without having any direct connection with the Myths of Cthulhu. It has been done in the same way that Lovecraft composed their stories; exudes power when an aura of "something is not right here" intensifies through a phase of uneasiness to terrorize and, ultimately, horror through subtle progressive changes in soundtrack and cinematography. This is, in fact, a "strange tale" par excellence. <br /> <br /> Simply awesome.
