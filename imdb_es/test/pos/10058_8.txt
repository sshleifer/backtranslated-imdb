When I watch a movie, I usually look for entertainment. But, of course, if I know what kind of movement is, I'll look for what I'm supposed to do. For example, if it is a deep film, I hope that the film clears the thoughts in my skull and makes me think about what it is saying. But who is that girl? It is not a deep movie. But it is entertaining, however. It is a kind of movie that is a joy to watch. There is hardly a dull moment in the movie and there are many funny parts. I've seen it when I was younger. The cast is always entertaining as always. He was in love with Griffin Dunne even though he was not the typical male gallant at the time. Haviland Morris also stars. And the Austrian actress Bibi Besch is here too! In general, a delight!
