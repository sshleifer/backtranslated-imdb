I always loved French films because I think they are filled with much more emotion and meaning than Americans. This movie is a jewel. <br /> <br /> Starting with the wedding, which is so fun that you just want to join them and at the end, where the little children of the family tell us who is with whom what is extremely fun. Catherine Deneuve is simply good and so good that it is quite possible for a young man to fall in love with her, and Vincen Lindon is perfect for that role. The best scene (except the wedding party) is at the family reunion where Antoine gets angry and yells his feelings to Leah in front of the family. It is a pity that I could buy this film only from French and not from English (so I have to learn in French to enjoy watching it)!
