Jack Webb's film 'The DI' grew out of real-life research on the death of several apprentices in a swamp on the Isle of Paris in the 1950s. As usual, Webb, being the patriot he is, came out defense like all other shows. In fact, I found this film domesticated by the standards of 1957. I served in the Army and I can understand the intensity of the training on Parris Island (Camp Death by some), so this film can never be approached as it does' Full Metal Jacket '. I think this is a good movie that is more patriotic than real. But once again, think about the period of time it was made (1957) and what could be allowed and said in the movie at that time. I have always found that Jack Webb is very clean and very loyal. I know that many have criticized the film as a one-sided propaganda and government. If you feel this way, look at 'Full Metal Jacket' with R Lee Ermey. I'm a Webb fan and I enjoy the movie because of its merit, not because of its accuracy. As I said, Webb believed in this country and kept institutions with high moral standards (LAPD-Dragnet, Adam 12, Emergency, etc.). Just sit down and enjoy this from a very strict moral time in this country. Do not judge Mr. Webb too much. Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas ..
