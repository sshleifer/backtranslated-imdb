This is a wonderful thriller that I've seen many times and I never get tired. It is about the obsessive love that 5 people have with each other in Paris, (dis) lucky coincidences, false identities. The music makes it really exciting. There are almost no flaws in the characters, only the end is not very credible, but a "what you have to see" definitely.
