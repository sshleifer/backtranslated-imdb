What a crazy movie! It lasts 12 (!) Hours and you do not understand who these people are and what they are doing! The main plot is about a group of clueless actors who try to stage "Prometheus", but there are many subplots, like the disappearance of Thomas and a madman looking for Monsieur Warok ... what does all this mean?
