Clyde Bruckman borrows the premise of this short from "Seven Chances" by Buster Keaton, recently declined as "The Bachelor". In the original, Buster has 24 hours to marry in order to inherit a large sum of money. In this version, the music teacher Prof. Shemp has only 7 hours (after all, it's a short!). This is one of Stooges' best shorts because of the plot and the wonderful routines (which include the phone booth scene with Moe & Shemp, reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy's "Berth Marks" and the famous cabin scene of the Marx Brothers in "Night At The Opera - here the boys are steadfast in their variation of this routine." I'm not a big fan of the Stooges, but any comedy student should point out that it's one of their best since early shorts. the 30s.
