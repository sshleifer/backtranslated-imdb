Oh, so beautiful, so tearful and so heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> It makes everything look so superficial, so pale, so meaningless in comparison. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen is not a true saint. <br /> <br /> She is a true human, with flaws, raw and forceful, but passionate and with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> What I found most interesting is that this handful of miserable and miserable people found the meaning and the laughter. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most is how the documentary portrays the polarity of human nature.
