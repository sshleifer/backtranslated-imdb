** SPOILERS ** A beautiful love story of World War II versus life with paintings by Norman Rockwell at the beginning and end of the film about how a "war hero" is not just someone who kills for his country, It also thinks. for himself and is not corrupted by the war propaganda that constantly wobbles in his head.

The conversation with Richard Hedge is shocked to discover that not only are he being sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the battles he fought in, and the combat medals he won, but he also has completely gray hair and the appearance of Richard in his mid-thirties. Be 21 next month! That's what made him be in the Marine Corps and World War II! By buying a variety of Hedge drinks, Richard takes out the Baby Blue drunk and knocks him down, takes his Baby Blues and leaves his impressive US Navy uniform with some money for Hedge to buy. <br /> <br /> As soon as Hedge puts on Richard's uniform, which fits him perfectly, he confronts this great drunken paratrooper from the United States who calls himself Cement-Head and wants to fight the Marine Raider Hedge does everything possible to avoid problems, and Cement-Head forces him to tie him up, after he himself broke two bottles of beer on his cement head, to heat the great fight between Marine, Hedge and Paratrooper, Cement-Head. The hedge incredibly covers the great buffoon with a cement head and knocked it down with a single blow! "I guess the trick is not to hit him over his head," said a surprised Hedge to his, Cement-Heads, G.I. <br /> <br /> Hitchhiking this small town of Bidwell Hedge warns this US military internment camp. UU for Japanese Americans who are there because it is considered a threat to the security of the United States. UU It is later in the film that Hedge shows everyone what a true hero is, not whom the townspeople think he is, by risking his life to save one of the hated "Japanese" of those who escaped without thinking, along with two of your friends. the burial camp, where the hell did they think they were going anyway? Hedge risked his life by saving Americans from fear and death drowned in the dangerous rapids of the city. Coverage in their actions taught the people of Bidwell that not all "Japanese", even those who are American citizens, are bad and treacherous banzai who scream suicide bombers as if newspapers and magazines were thinking at that moment to think that they were. <br /> <br /> Hedge engages in a conversation with the very cute and pretty waitress at the local restaurant Rose Hudkins, Glynnis O'Connor, who is crazy about him, that even Hedge at first thinks it's his uniform, not him . It impressed her Later, when Hedge confesses to Rose that she is not what she and her parents think, A US Marine Raider, that he is that Rose had come to know the sweet and affectionate sailor so well that he did not care. everything he was supposed to be, a sailor, a paratrooper or an employee of the post office, was what was inside his heart what really counted. <br /> <br /> The movie has a number of touching and beautiful scenes between them. Hedge and Rose, which shows how films were made years ago without the sex and the bad words we see and hear in today's movies, which involved two people in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The way the film is accurate is not a false falsehood, it shows the true feelings of average Americans, back then in 1943, about war in general and about Japanese people in particular, not It could have been done more authentically and accurately, as well as in good taste. "Baby Blur Marine" does his best not to be too politically correct by not showing the protagonists and actresses of the hero or protagonists of the film who have the same feelings and ideas in World War II as most people do now, that would have seemed false as a three dollar bill, for those people who saw the film and who lived during those historic and momentous moments in which the film was going to take place.
