There have been approximately 60 different movies and television games, in addition to the classic opera of this story of a sex-madwoman and her unfortunate soldier-lover. This story has been done so many times, in various ways. <br /> <br /> Vicente Aranda directs Joaquin Jorda's script adaptation of the classic novel and work by Prosper Merimee. <br /> <br /> This is the story ONLY of Bizet's opera Carmen <br /> <br /> Pas Vega is an exciting Carmen, full of passion and the ability to lead simple men to do terrible things and tragic Leonardo Sbaraglio is the unfortunate soldier who is trapped in Carmen's poisonous network and led to do bad things. <br /> <br /> Jay Benedict is the author Prosper who tells this story. <br /> <br /> There is not much action, BUT there are some very attractive sex scenes. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is almost an NC-17 movie. <br /> <br /> Since I have seen this story so often in so many I was not too impressed. <br /> <br /> It is a very well made film and will be of interest to those who may not know it, <br /> <br /> My not too enthusiastic criticism could also be that I missed the fantastic score of Operates Bizet. <br /> <br /> Look at this as you may like it more than me. <br /> <br /> Qualifications *** (of 4) 82 Points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
