SPOILER ALERT - AND I REALLY MEAN IT! DO NOT READ MORE, UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO REVEAL AN ELEMENT OF MAIN PLOTS! <br /> <br /> Well, first I must say that I have a relatively high tolerance for depressing movies. I will see and appreciate movies about the horrors of real life (like the war and the holocaust) or where death and sadness are important for the plot BUT I hate movies like STEAL MAGNOLIAS and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, where the film is based on a death manipulative a main character. So, no matter how well this movie is done, it has a great attack on it because one of the main characters dies because of an illness at the end (although they never say WHAT it had in the version subtitled in English). <Br /> <br /> So you can ask yourself: "So, if this hard blow hates this kind of movie, why did he see it in the first place?" I would have an excellent point to ask this, although I hope it is not really hard! Well, when I found it in our local library, I had no idea what it was. The film was not designed specifically for export, since the subtitles were in Korean, English and Japanese and the box was printed in Korean. Well, as I am a fan of the test films of any country (I've seen movies probably at least 30-40 different countries), I tried. <br /> <br /> Well, apart from mandatory death, I loved the movie and hated the way it ended. Although I usually hate the miraculous ends of Hollywood, I wanted to see the guy saved through a new drug or experimental surgery. I was very disappointed that he had to die, especially because he seemed to be one of the nicest people I've seen in movies in a long time. His smile was contagious and he really wanted him to get the girl in the end. Oh, well, at least I can appreciate the message of the movie that you need to seize the moment. Good acting, music, etc., but it is not the most satisfying ending for me. This movie was good enough to encourage me to try more Korean cinema.
