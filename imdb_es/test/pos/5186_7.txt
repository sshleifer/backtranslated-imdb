This is a catastrophe film set in London. From multiple hurricanes, superstorms and tornadoes in Scotland move eastward, toppling the coast of England and later the south. After several hours of heavy rains, the London barrier over Thames falls short and makes its way to disaster. Then, a colossal journey of relentless tides to the east causing the devastation and lives of millions of Londoners are in danger. At the center of the story is a climatologist (Tom Courtenay), a climatologist trying to save London from the effects of a giant wave, trying to convince the authorities that the city's embankment was not safe, in addition to a marine engineer (Robert Carlyle) and his ex-wife Samantha (Jessalyn Gilsig). They are trapped in the barrier and fallen to the sea. Meanwhile, the secret government agency HQ governed by Nash (Joanne Whalley), under direct orders from the deputy minister (David Suchet), tries to control many displaced people and prevent more deaths, approximately 200,000. They have a little time to save London from a total catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Perfectly acceptable drama-disaster with good acting. The magnificent Tom Courtenay as a climatologist who predicts a catastrophe and the excellent Robert Carlyle and Jessalyn Gilsig as an ex-couple rekindle their love. The film gathers impressive flood scenes that come to life thanks to the impressive special effects of computer generators, better than the classics of the 70s, such as 'Earthquake, Inferno Towering' and similar to 'Armaguedon and Day after tomorrow'. Although it is not a clear complaint, we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and the global warming caused by the ozone hole. The movie is well directed by Tony Mitchell. I would recommend this movie to people who like disaster films. Other adaptations on the floods are the following: 'Flood (1976)' directed by Earl Bellamy with Robert Culp and Barbara Hershey; 'Hard rain (1998)' directed by Mikael Salomon with Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater; 'Flood: The Riot of a River (1979)' directed by Bruce Pittman with Richard Thomas
