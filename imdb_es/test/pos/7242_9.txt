'Nemesis' was the last book in which Miss Marple appeared, written by Agatha Christie (the last official case 'Sleeping Murder' was written in the forties) and I always had a weakness for it. I loved the characters and they gave me life with love in this excellent adaptation of the BBC with Joan Hickson, amazing as always, as Miss Marple. <br /> <br /> In general, he is very faithful to the book. Some characters are removed, the first (new) murder is slightly different and a couple of new characters are presented. Personally I felt that the added character of Lionel Peel was unnecessary and quite annoying. The tour guide Madge was irritating in a different way but often quite funny. It's largely because of Lionel that I did not award 10 out of 10! The other characters are very well made, especially Helen Cherry as a worthy Miss Temple and the three strange sisters, but particularly Margaret Tyzack, who presents a stunning performance as Clothilde. She threatens to go through the top towards the end, but she simply avoids it. The bodyguards also have a good value and the episode contains one of my favorite lines of Hickson ... "An archdeacon?" <br /> <br /> This is another relatively early BBC, Marple, which looks wonderful and has a gloriously nostalgic feeling. Highly recommended
