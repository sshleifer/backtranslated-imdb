"L'appartement" has to be among the best French films I've seen (along with "Hatred", also starring Vincent Cassel, and those great films by Gerard DÃ©pardieu / Pierre Richard). Cassel and Bellucci are incredible in the leading roles. Apart from "Brotherhood Of The Wolves" and "Dobermann" I still have not seen a bad movie with this couple. "L'appartement" absorbs you from the beginning and the twists and turns keep you excited until the end. The narration of fragments has not really worked so well since "Pulp Fiction". Let's hope there is not an American remake of this unique romance / mystery thriller. (EDIT: Guess what! A great American remake has been made!)!
