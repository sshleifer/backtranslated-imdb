Another "old but good" from almost the same time as "Out of Towners" is "Cactus Flower", with a great cast: Goldie Hawn, in her first appearance in the film (before the renovation), Ingrid Bergmann in one of his last ones , and the always fun Walter Matthau. The story is about a dentist who pretends to be married to have an excuse not to marry his girlfriend, which leads to the need to find a fictitious wife as proof. He coaxed his receptionist (Bergman) to take the role, which led to multiple comic disasters and surprising romantic twists. It is in the same line as the comedies of Doris Day / Rock Hunter. The fans of those, like me, will like this movie; If not, do not bother.
