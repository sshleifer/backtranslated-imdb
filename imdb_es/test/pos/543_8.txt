Movie for girls? Of course ... Has it been done before? Many times .... Predictable? Yes ... Is it worth seeing? You bet I loved the portrayals of Sarandon and Portman of otherwise characters in a family story. I'm a big fan of mother / daughter stories. What makes the difference between the good and the weak are the performances and the development of the character. Although this is not the BEST of its kind, I will buy it and see it again. I felt that the characters were credible and that the performance was superior.
