Try to find another movie that is a journey without having a story or a plot and it will be difficult. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentation. In less than 90 minutes, it manages not only to be a time capsule of an era, but also an experimental feature film that challenges time, space and conventions in a way that only the underground films of the 1960s could achieve. Reflection of those films. No matter what one feels for the Monkees, this is a film that every filmmaker should see, since it opens the infinite possibilities of cinema as an artistic medium. If it had not been for the unorthodox publicity campaign of the film (and for the fact that when the Monkees came out so oversaturated the media that the public had grown tired of them and each critic was ready to attack them), this could have had an impact Much greater impact. Studying how the film was edited is much more important and exciting than what is really in the film, and yet there are some great things (great songs, great cinematography, etc.). You should see yourself after midnight for maximum effect due to your general dreamy feeling. 1968 was a time of social instability and a call for change (hence, the working title of the movie "Changes") and HEAD perfectly reflects that moment.
