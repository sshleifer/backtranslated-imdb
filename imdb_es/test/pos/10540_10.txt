(This review contains a great spoiler, but I do not know how to explain how great it is without giving it away). A while ago I saw "The Revenge of Pinoccio". <br /> <br /> Now, you may think it's just a children's game scam. In fact, there are similarities. <br /> <br /> However, Chucky was a possessed doll that works independently of the child. It is POSSIBLE that Pinoccio is possessed by a demon or a damn or something. However, the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate. The KID is crazy, and THE KID is the one killing people! Everyone, including the audience, the survivors and the Kid herself think it's the doll. But it is the KID. <br /> <br /> Nudity is almost a shame, because otherwise I could tell everyone to see it, because it really is an interesting horror movie.
