A very good film about anti-Semitism near the end of World War II. The scene that really speaks out loud of the ignorance of these people is the meeting in the church when the priest is giving his speech against the "international enthusiasts and communists". It sounds amazingly like the speeches that Adolph Hitler used to force the throats of his people, but none of the attendees at the meeting seems to make this comparison.
