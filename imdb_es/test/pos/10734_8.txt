The marriage of an exclusive couple from New York City with a son collapses when the wife wants to leave ("it cost us a lot of courage to go out that door!", A neighbor tells us); the busy and distracted husband assumes the "maternal" responsibilities and gets closer to his son, but soon the wife returns. The highly manipulative image does not give us a very realistic family unit (with young Justin Henry it certainly does not look like the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!), But the dynamic is intriguing and involving, and director Robert Benton follow the rhythm by blowing up with a lot of intelligence, wonderful classical music, canny editing and safe bits of humor. Streep's character is designed to be a cold, self-centered witch, but she was ready to feel a lot more for her than Benton probably wanted. Everything has to be painted in terms of black and white, good and bad, with Hoffman learning how much it cost his wife and having a second chance to be a good father. The film never falters in its preconceived trajectory, and a very good performance almost saved it, but I'm not sure where Benton was directing the film in the final act, and the final scene is very abrupt. *** since ****
