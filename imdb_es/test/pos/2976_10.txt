I saw this movie when it premiered for the first time and I enjoyed it a lot. What movie I am now 40 years old and I have 2 teenage children and I would like you to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romantic movie or the old music of Elton John. <br /> <br /> I have searched in most stores that sell new and old movies, but have not found any. <br /> <br /> I bought some old movies like "Melody" in Hong Kong, they had a pretty old collection, but they did not have this one. <br /> <br /> I'm also watching the sequel, Paul & Michelle. <br /> <br /> Can someone tell me how to get a copy of the VHS or DVD or VCD? <br /> <br /> I really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
