It contains spoilers. I recorded it a while ago when I was on PBS, but I never had the chance to watch it (probably due to the prejudice of having to sit for 5 to 6 hours at Masterpiece Theater, with its BBC made for the TV production style (not Music, settings all in one room, without outdoor scenes, TV aspect ...)) But after watching the movie Traffic (which at that time I thought was pretty good), I could not help but dig up Traffik's tape to see what otherwise, they could have talked with the additional 2 1/2 hours. <br /> <br /> Boy, my preconceived ideas were wrong about this TV series. It is much more immersive than traffic. The characters develop better so that their actions are more credible. And the whole secondary plot that involves Pakistan completes everyone's point of view in the entire supply chain, from the farmer to the end user. In Traffic, the history of Pakistan was rewritten and reduced to a plot of good police against bad guys. <br /> <br /> There were many more meaningful discussions and debates about alcohol and other forms of drugs, whereas in Traffic they became mainly unimportant Passenger references. The same with social problems, which in Traffik, were realistically transmitted without sounding predicate. While in Traffic, the characters simply broadcast it as a statement like the way they do in the "theme of the week" movies on television. <br /> <br /> There was not a bad guy or a good guy in Traffik, even the merchant introduces himself as a drug addict who sells to support his habit rather than the kind of person in Traffic of "nobody bothers me". <br /> <br /> The only negative part is that since I observed Traffic not long before seeing this, it was difficult not to compare scene by scene, and although the scenes were not the same, I already knew what the result would be . Thank God for the history of Pakistan, which is different enough to allow me to enjoy it completely without thinking about what scene it is compared to. Although they made me think that the drugs were fused in the ceramics of the statues that Helen brought to Germany (as in Traffic's story). Thank God, Traffik was not so preposterous and far-fetched.
