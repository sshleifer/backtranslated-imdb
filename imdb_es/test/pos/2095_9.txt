The third film I could see at the Philadelphia Film Festival was this outstanding drama from Japan. After leaving prison, nine escaped convicts plan to find the "key to the universe" of which a tenth convict who did not escape spoke to them. On the way we get to know each of these men quite well. Everyone has their own dreams. For much of the film it seems to be mainly a comedy, but there is a change in the fact that the film ends in tragedy. All the actors give great performances. I can not say much more without spoiling the film, but suffice it to say that you end up feeling sorry for some of these people. At 2 o'clock, this movie is a little long, but good, nonetheless. I have no qualms about recommending it with the warning that it has a bit of disturbing violence for the tenderhearted. Toshiaki Toyoda hit a homer this time, and it makes me want to look for his previous films, as well as to wait anxiously for his future ones. <br /> <br /> My rating: A
