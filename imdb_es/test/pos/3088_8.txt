After watching this movie, I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs to the top 250 of all time, but in its genre it's a great movie. I know, not many people find it fun to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' turns into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things should not be laughed at ... they are wrong. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights. I've also seen the original Robin Hood movies, but I never had such a good time when I saw them like this. It's just a continuation of hilarious moments and parodies about famous people and movies (Winston Churchill, The Godfather ...). <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone who wants to laugh to watch this movie. For those who think that Robin Hood should not get into the trap, you are wrong, but it is better not to look at it because you will probably be offended. I give this movie an 8/10.
