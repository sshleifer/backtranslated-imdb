It is worth getting rid of the Hindu pantheon before watching this movie. Three main female deities are alluded to: Sita, who nourishes Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer, as well as three main male deities: the tomb of Rama, the playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender. Knowing the folklore as surely all the Indian members of an audience lends a richness to the story of the current history. In fact, a popular story is represented first on the stage, as part of a spirituality lesson, and then in the "real life" of the film. The "fire" speaks against misogyny and homophobia in the society of which its producers are native, and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message in multiple levels of the viewer's conscience, which makes it an extremely satisfactory presentation. This is the best movie I've seen in the last ten years; highly recommended!
