This movie was recently shown subtitled, not dubbed, in Australia's Special Broadcast Service. I thought I read here that sometimes * Revenge of the Rats * is supposed to be a sequel. In fact, rats get revenge for something that is done inside this movie or in the history of mankind. There is no prequel, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> Now, let's get The Pied Piper of Hamelin out of the way. Maybe this story crossed my mind when I was watching the movie, but that's it. There was the use of the word "chests" at the end of the movie. A stunned mayor tries to justify his actions by saying that "the coffers were empty." "Cofres" is not a word that is heard a lot these days, unless you read popular stories to your children, as I do. Since I saw * Revenge of the Rats *, I have read two versions of The Pied Piper of Hamelin. Now I see the comparison. A fat metaphorical but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford, getting rid of rats. This is as far as I can follow the analogy. The children are not driven to a door in a mountain, with a lame child left behind to talk about a land of winged horses and fountains, where it is always spring and everyone is always happy. <br /> <br /> There is a lot that is quite common about this movie. Romance and resolution especially. Female characters have potentially powerful roles in society, but in reality they are quite impotent. Where this film is quite rebellious (compared to American cinema) is that it is anti-authoritarian. The helicopter pilot is fired by the mayor for "doing good". The mayor and the local government are portrayed as corrupt and complacent with large amounts of money. Finally, a doctor is left in Frankfurt to solve an epidemic of a fatal and contagious disease. Apparently, there is no national Infectious Diseases authority to coordinate things or send back-up copies. <br /> <br /> I'm not a horror aficionado, so any horror you see is often mixed with humor. From the rat in the blood bank you can see that this will have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers; The huge number of rats is impressive and horror fans also seem satisfied.
