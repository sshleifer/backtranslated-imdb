from the plot as Vertigo or the obsession of Brian DePalma, to the score of Peter Chase that recalls the sounds of Bernard Herrmann, this pearl seems to be seen by few. Notable game by Romane Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in a bohemian Paris played by the famous Thierry Arbogast. A little cult! It is a pity that the only version available on DVD is French and English. Directed by a controversial artist like Gilles Mimouni, it could be considered a small tribute to the masterpieces of cinema. It is a French film, and like all of them, not for everyone, we could say a cinema d'essai. Even if it is not advertised like that, it could be remembered for several reasons.
