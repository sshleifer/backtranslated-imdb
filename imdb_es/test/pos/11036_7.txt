FEELING of the need for someone to play the role of Referee of public taste and political correctness always manages to get under our skin. It seems that these self-appointed, self-superior, pseudo-intellectual types appear everywhere; whether in the family, in the church or in the bowling league. <br /> <br /> THESE are the types that would make society ignore completely and ignore everything that preceded us; unless, of course, whatever 'it' is not opposed to today's "acceptable" language, customs, and general "standards" of "appropriate" behavior. <br /> <br /> So it is that these last days The engravers of high-tech books have focused in large part on what was Hollywood's greatest achievement; namely, his participation in our Allied propaganda through his messages and thematic films produced selflessly. <br /> <br /> FRUSTRATELY brutal in their generation, the Prohibited Code and the Unacceptable Now List extend to the Comics of War that do not match the new "official", sensitive and socially designed attitudes; that these "thought police" imposed on us. <br /> <br /> We were very surprised to see that there seem to be volumes of short songs so animated. The majority of which we are aware are of LOONEY TUNES and MERRIE MELODIES of Warner Brothers; with Bugs, Daffy, Elmer & Porky, all in conflict with Hitler, Goerring, 'Il Duce', Tojo and the like. However, surprisingly, we found a wide range of cartoons from MGM, Walt Disney, Lantz, Paramount-Famous Studios and Brothers Fleischer. <br /> <br /> YOU ARE A MR. FROM SAP. JAP (Famous Studios / Paramount Pictures, 1942) is an excellent example of what we are talking about. <br /> <br /> Being virtually unchallenged from the cartoons that were the output of Max Studios and Dave Fleischer before the 1941 business coup that brought them out, bringing the new name of "Famous" Studios, YOU ARE A SAP MR. JAP did not present any of the bland argument elements that would reduce the Popeye cartoons of the past few days to the level of the last short film formula. <br /> <br /> We all remember how we would have Popeye and Olive Oyl together. Enter Bluto, usually the exponent of the wolf whistle and an acceptable screen version of a masculine reaction to feminine neatness. Olive falls in love with Bluto's less than honorable attentions; until it gets too physical and invariably lets out: "Hey, Babe, how about a kiss?" At this point we hear "Help! Help, Popeye and the tiny sailor appear to save the day, full of the obligatory can of spinach!" We exaggerate, Schultz ONCE, this cartoon of JAP SAP does not look like anything like that Oh sure, the plot continues to have Popeye now in the US Navy The Fleischer Brothers put the little man in service in 1941 to adapt to the mood of the country and as an open gesture of support to the men who They are now recruited in the first draft of the peace season in the history of the United States.Max and Dave even put Popeye in service aboard the mythical Battleship, the USS Pensyltucky. <br /> <br /> OUR point it's just this.You are an SAP MR.JAP and other similar SPINACH FER Great Britain are not cartoon vehicles for comic relief in the theater program at all in the true sense.They are rather a kind of editorial cartoon grouping mu and similar to those of any "Great metropolitan newspaper." These animated shorts, very similar to the ones There is still a panel of illustrations, we have charac. States that are highly symbolic and representative of Nations, Ideas and Ideals, as a just and lasting Peace. In most cases, the hero (Popeye, Bugs Bunny or whoever) is alone with the enemy's symbol. Both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors for the abstract concept and thought; even if they are wrapped in humorous ornaments for greater palatability. <br /> <br /> OUR liberal stupidity (the antithesis of intelligence) may not see itself in this way; but for this type of behavior, they are nothing more than burners for neo-Nazi books. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, allow future generations to see and appreciate a vision of past events that are historical and humorous. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
