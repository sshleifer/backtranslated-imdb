Many Americans are lazy, and this has manifested itself even on our DVD. Many of us do not like to spend time reading subtitles of an hour and a half (or more), so we decided not to watch many foreign films. However, a film that is TOTALLY worth your time, no matter how routine a task you might think it is reading subtitles, is "The Green Butchers." It is by far the best foreign film I've seen, and it's the headline of many of the American films I've seen lately as well. It is a complex situation told in a remarkably simple and funny dialogue. The depth of the character derived in this movie is INCREDIBLE. The way in which Svend and Eigel (sorry if they are misspelled) feed on people who contrast with each other is absolutely spectacular! The actors were well chosen, and I have high hopes that a sequel will be taken into consideration ... it needs very little of Bjorne and what his face looks like ... just give me Svend and Eigel some kind of trip with support characters and the most incredible dialogue! To the author of this fine script, I say: Write more! The story itself is quite twisted, but you will still find yourself supporting the bad guy ... without remorse. Please, take a look at this movie!
