In my personal opinion, I think this is the best video game ever created. The first time I played this game in my friends' house, the next day I went out and got mine. Since that day almost seven years ago I have not stopped playing it. I can not help it, I just can not get bored of it. I have been addicted to other games in other much newer systems, but I keep coming back for more Goldeneye. Each mission is incredibly fun and challenging, the multiplayer mode was like no other. I hope you can be as lucky as if I had played the multiplayer mode for four players because I had brothers and friends who met and played this game all the time.
