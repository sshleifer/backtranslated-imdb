John Schelesinger's career as a film director was extraordinary. We had seen this movie when it first came out, but we wanted to see it again when it appeared on cable recently. The film has a faded look, as it is seen today, but still, it is interesting because of the intense performances of the two directors. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, do not read it. beyond. <br /> <br /> Chris and Daulton were two childhood friends who came from upper middle class backgrounds. Chris went to enter a seminary to be a priest, but he gives up. Daulton became a small drug user and trafficker. The two lives seem to run parallel as the couple engages in an illegal activity that will test their short vision. In fact, it shows how both young men miscalculate in their attempt to deceive the CIA and the Soviet Union. These two, in a way, were so naive to think that they could get something bigger and that better equipped people could not even imagine what they could do. <br /> <br /> Chris's motivation is legitimate, since he feels outraged. to discover the dishonest role of the agency for which he works in dealing with other nations, in this case Australia, something he finds by pure coincidence. When it involves Daulton, we know that everything is condemned because no one in drugs, as he is, will never be equivalent to anything. In fact, Chris and Daulton did not have an idea of ​​the scope of what they are trying to do, nor of its consequences. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton was in this period of his career, an actor who was going places. He had shown that he had talent with his work in other films, so it was a natural choice for Mr. Schlesinger to select him, a worthwhile option. Sean Penn, was also a young actor who showed an intensity, as had not been seen before. In fact, sometimes, Mr. Penn reminded us of a young Robert Mitchum in the making. The contribution of both actors to the film is incredible. One can not think who could have played this duo, but them. <br /> <br /> "The Falcon and the Snowman", although not on par with other great films by John Schlesinger, is an interesting aspect for us. passed too far
