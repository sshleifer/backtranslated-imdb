This movie was really a breath of fresh air from the load of Hollywood trash I've seen recently. The acting is excellent and the characters are attractive and strangely attractive. There really is not much in the story, it's simple and it works well. An easy movie to just sit back and enjoy. The atmosphere was fantastic and the sets really helped to propel the film and offered some nice images. The film obviously has aspects of horror, but is oriented a little more towards the comic side of things. You will not laugh hysterically with this, but you will be smiling all the way. The humor works very well with the characters and the excellent performance does not hurt. I really saw this movie based on the fact that Ron Perlman was in it. Your paper is a little smaller than I expected, but it does not matter; The rest of the cast does more than enough to keep you occupied. If you like horror, look at this. If you like comedies, look at this. Just go ahead and look at this anyway, it's really excellent.
