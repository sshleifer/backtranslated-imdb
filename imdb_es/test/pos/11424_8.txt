It has been noticed that Stan Laurel made a real name by appearing in short parodies of popular movies in the 1920s. Without a doubt, he is shown to be an excellent actor and comic actor here in "Mud and Sand" (a parody of "Blood and Sand" by Rudolph Valntino), but I think a movie like this really works not because Laurel was a great satirist but because it allows the audience to jump into the comedy already familiar with the situation and the scenes. Laurel can let go with her inspired gags without having to create a context or dispense with it. I saw this the day after I saw "Blood and Sand" itself; It certainly improved the experience to know what was being parodied and where. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Laurel's character (Rhubarb's Vaseline if you believe in the title cards, or Rhubarb's Vaseline if you think how his name is written on the chalk board) takes away money his mother with a trick of two for you, two for me is funny on its own because it is a great joke, but it is very funny if the viewer is aware of how it is getting the air The extravagant and melodramatic promise of Valentino to give your mother the luxuries you want. <br /> <br /> This is Stan Laurel's best solo work I've seen. It's just funny, even more so if you had the opportunity to see the source material.
