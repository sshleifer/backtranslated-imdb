Are the coastal resorts the sad and sad places that are always described in movies and novels? Certainly, this film, along with the almost contemporary "Do not look now," represents Venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more casual approach, see "Just married" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). I have not been sure that I have ever been to Venice, but it is the perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous show by Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema. Having seen the film, I would now like to be able to read the Thomas Mann novel on which it is based (which also inspired an opera by Sir Benjamin Britten). As I do not know the background story and the film has little to do with the plot or the exhibition, I wonder about the obsession of Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) with the young Tadzio. Is he a homosexual? A pedophile? Or is your longing for the beautiful youth something more innocent? Maybe Tadzio reminds him of what could have been and now he knows that he never will be. Those who complain about the slow pace of this film should stick to car crashes and kung fu: at 2 hours and 15 minutes it is not particularly long, and it moves at a slow but hardly slow pace. The film benefits from the dazzling music of Gustave Mahler, on whom the character of Aschenbach is clearly based. Dirk Bogarde offers a moving performance, and the film features the presence of Silvana Mangano, one of the great beauties of Italy, as the mother of Tadzio.
