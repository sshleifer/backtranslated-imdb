I saw the longest version and I could not take my eyes off the screen. 219 minutes passed and, however, it seemed that only an hour had passed. The characters were very believable and entertaining, and the photography was excellent. The story attracted me and caught my attention. I will definitely see this again and again. This true story is the best thing to tell ... not the cheap and usual Hollywood emotions and the glow of the skin. I've seen a lot of criticism in this movie. Most seem to wander through the movie or give it a slight compliment. Basically, it's a great movie that received unfairly harsh criticism. Watch it for yourself with an open mind. If you like westerns, historical pieces, although historically inaccurate, you will enjoy the movie. Magnificent!!! 10/10
