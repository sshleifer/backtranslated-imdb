I remember that I went to drive with my parents and my sister. I was in fifth grade, and I was still a child, and the record was closed 4 years later, but the film still remains in my memory. An adult film, which a child finds entertaining. That is a mark of excellence. Hoffman is one of the best actors in Hollywood, and this movie proves it. I like that Billy has dropped the ice cream scene, and I remember the SCTV version in the movie I Factory. Remember Joe Flairty crying. Please send me an email if you like the SCTV sketch. It's not a bad movie, it's a story about a father and his son. Touching and entertaining, I love the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy and how the streets change. It is worth a second watch. 7/10
