I have never seen a program with so much history, mystery, suspense and forceful emotion. I already watch barley television but I have all the seasons of this program and it's amazing. Each episode is extremely well acted, written and plotted. towards the end of the show I felt that the stories were becoming too far-fetched to be in a prison, but the actors succeeded. Sopranoes sucks huge compared to OZ. In fact, any program that is on a cable network, HBO or simply can not contain a candle to OZ. I would like him to come back for another season. if it happened, they would probably kill all the characters in the show, but well, we all have to go sometime. As for the characters, I would say that O'Reily and Alverez were my favorites. both were together in one scene, but their individual stories, I thought they were the strongest of all, except Beechers, of course, but anyway, the best show in history, the best channel in history, some of the best actors of the story, PERIOD!
