The basis of this dynamic docudrama is the true story of one of the most extraordinary card players of all time. <br /> <br /> STUEY is a tight and cohesive biopic of a true poker ace whose life is a one-way trip in the world. Highway to Hell with few detours. <br /> <br /> This dramatic feature is distinguished from other movies about poker. It represents a rare and serious attempt to bring to the silver screen a true story of the maximum compulsion of the game. The complete obsession that annihilates any proximity of spirituality and nullifies any possibility of redemption. This is the least likely movie that a Vegas Casino executive would recommend. And it's the only poker DVD you're likely to find on the shelves of Annonymous Gamblers. <br /> <br /> There are scenes in this movie that poker fans will surely refer to as some of the best game scenes of all time. Stu is reading his opponent's hand and, particularly, a Texas Hold'em bluffing scene. <br /> <br /> Prophetically, at the beginning of the film, we see a young Stu harassed from his pocket by a group of neighborhood thugs. Poker is for loners seeking revenge. It's a game of patience that bullies lack. 'You can not intimidate me!' It may very well be an underlying feeling of the punishing force that a champion poker player unleashes on his adversaries. <br /> <br /> Conservatives will see this movie as a warning story of a soul lost in sin. They can evoke Mark Twain: 'The best shot at the dice is to throw them'. The young and liberal masses will inevitably have a more simplistic and comprehensive perspective. You may not have heard of Twain's appointment, but you will certainly remember an observation made by Stu's stunned friend, who learns that Stuey had won a car from a local character at a night game. 'Tell them to go to hell and look forward to the trip.' <br /> <br /> The Las Vegas vignette mosaic that we see in STUEY will linger in your memory. Frank Sinatra, the most generous tipper? Forget this! No one bends as extravagantly as a hot-shot player. And for Las Vegas visitors who do not know the impact of the tip on the quality of their stay, check Stu's scene at a Las Vegas hotel! <br /> <br /> 'This is what I was meant to do, this is where I was going to be. 'Movie stars in Hollywood, politicians in Washington and players in Las Vegas'.
