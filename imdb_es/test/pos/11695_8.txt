Crackerjack is a hugely successful movie at the Australian suburban turf club of Cityside. Mick Molloy plays a scammer who has been scoring free parking spaces in Cityside. When the club is under pressure to install poker machines in its facilities, they must raise $ 8,000 to prevent this from happening. The club needs new members to help and this is where the character of Mick Molloys comes in and he has to play bowling to save the club. With many Australian actors in development, Crackerjack is a hidden gem. Keep in mind that most of the jokes are for people with knowledge of bowls of turf, but there are many jokes in sight that provide comic relief. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy are co-stars. In general, the film should be recommended for people who play in bowls or who have played, but there is enough other material for a fun play if you have a little understanding. If you like Australian humor, I suggest you go bowling whites and go to the theater because this is the best bowl of turf comedy of the year (also the only one).
