Easily one of the best Indian movies ever. Of course, that does not say much (I came to this conclusion after 15 minutes of observation). But I can really say that Fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant movies that I've seen. <br /> <br /> Beautiful for your images. The best example I can give is the parallelism between the two female protagonists (Radha and Sita) and the characters of the same name in Hindu mythology. Sita, for example, is the wife of the revered Lord Ram. As legend has it, Ram subjugates his wife by making her walk through a Fire to demonstrate her "purity". Sita, in response, cries and leaves him, reuniting with his mother (the Earth). This story has all kinds of crazy links to the stories of the 2 Indian women (Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi). Suddenly, the word "Fire" has many meanings: marriage, tradition, religion, motherhood and probably some others that I did not catch. <br /> <br /> Brilliant for its social connotations. Many of those who were offended by the premise of this film should, in fact, be the first to see Fire (for example, my mother, who really loved it). Why? Because although Fire is an attack on tradition, it is also an attack on tradition. In other words, that is your strength, NOT your weakness. Traditional conservative social customs (whether Indian, Canadian, American or whatever) are useless if they enslave you. Gender roles and self-denial can do this. <br /> <br /> These are the things that I took after seeing Fire. Congratulations to Deepa Mehta?
