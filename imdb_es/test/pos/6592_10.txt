This is an excellent criminal thriller, and with a great cast as well. Victoria Abril and Federico Luppi, the best and most popular Spanish film actors in the last two decades, join in one of the best crime thrillers in Spanish from 2004-2005. <br /> <br /> The film starts focusing at thirty years old, Ernesto (Ernesto Alterio), an elegant, attractive and astute thief who learned from his childhood friend Gypsy, and more recently from Manco, an experienced old con man . Manco presents Ernesto to Federico (Federico Luppi), a methodical thief who is also elegant, but more cunning and experienced: the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> The only known weakness of Federico is Pilar (Victoria Abril), his former lover and companion. She appears suddenly and proposes a fabulous scheme of swindling her former lover, a crime on a large scale, which will eventually require the help of Ernesto, Manco and Gypsy, among others. <br /> <br /> The script is complete of twists and surprising twists, particularly towards the end of the movie. One criticism about the movie I heard a lot is that there are too many twists in the plot towards the end, but I do not agree. The film captivates the public so much that all the unexpected events are not too much to follow. In fact, these are what make the film stand out. I highly recommend it.
