The graphics are far from being the best part of the game. This is the best TH game number one in the series. Next to the subway. He deserves a strong love. It's a crazy game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters ... it's just a massive game. Waste your money in this game This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even if the graphics are stiff, that does not make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at that time. Today the graphics are shit. WHO CARES? As they say in Canada, this is the fun game, yes. (You can go to Canada in THPS3) Well, I do not know if they say that, but they could. who knows. Well, Canadians do it. Wait a minute, I'm leaving the subject. This game is great. Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it. It is BRIGHT PURE.
