George C. Scott offers his best and most wonderful wonderful drama in this screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky. Diana Rigg is an attractive and quite complicated young woman. This film is diverted between tragedy and chaos in a New York hospital in the late 60's with amazing consequences. Barnard Hughes is charming as always (great theater actor too). <br /> <br /> An 8 out of 10. Best performance = George C. Scott. Chayesfsky was a blow when he left Vanessa Redgrave at the 1978 Oscar ceremony, but he is a good writer. A true cast that works wonders, even the smallest paper. This won the best script at the Oscars and Scott was nominated. I should have won for this instead of PATTON the previous year (which was also brilliant). Look for this!
