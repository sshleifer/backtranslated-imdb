I would give this TV series a 10 more if I could. The writers were "ready" and I think the best actors and actresses were an asset to the program. These characters were so real. It could be said that of the two main actresses, Mrs. Toussaint and Mrs. Potts, their relationship inside and outside the chamber was genuine. It was not over when he heard those familiar words "Cut" at the end of a "Take". The program has thought a lot about life, for example. The historical struggles, the tragedies and the triumphs, the relationships, the everyday situations, all the homes have the same situations, no matter who the members are, it really became a wonderful family show that at the end of each episode, you can sit in its the couch in the living room and telling yourself "now what I learned from this particular episode". <br /> <br /> I must say that I have recorded most of the episodes and I find myself watching them again and again. <br /> <br /> Now you know why I gave him a 10+!
