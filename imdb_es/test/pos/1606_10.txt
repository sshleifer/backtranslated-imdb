It can be difficult to explain how, but this movie is a masterpiece. Maybe, because I never imagined that a plot like this or a movie with so few words would transmit all this poetry. The true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. Bogard is amazing and it goes without saying that Venice is used as a perfect setting: dark, sunken and gloomy as the soul of Bogard. And classical music is more than a simple background accompaniment to human feelings. In my opinion, a classic masterpiece of European cinema.
