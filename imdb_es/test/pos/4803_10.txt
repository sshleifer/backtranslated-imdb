Running Out of Time is probably a perfect movie like the one you'll see in Hong Kong. All the elements click: an excellent script (by the French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud) that even manages to subvert the strange clich√©, the faithfully imaginative direction of Johnnie To, and the excellent central performances of Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan, this Last showing his great comedic moment for a wonderful effect without ever crossing the line in parody (especially in his exasperated reactions to his superior's abysmal negotiation skills). The cast of support is also fine, with Yo Yo Mung making a strong impression on a small role, and even the often theatrical Waise Lee (with a remarkable appearance, and very aptly, like a bald Andy Lau) holding him back with good results. Is it better not to know much about the plot that goes beyond the basic configuration? With only a few weeks to live, Lau engages in a criminal game with Wan's police officer for no apparent reason. and just sit back and enjoy the trip: it's definitely worth it. It also has one of the most perfect love stories from recent movies, and it is played in just three scenes (the second bus trip is one of the most magical moments of cinematography I've seen in a long time). There is also a good Raymond Wong score too. The most fun playing cat and mouse in the cinema in years.
