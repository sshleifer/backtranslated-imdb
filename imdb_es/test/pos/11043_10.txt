The magnificent Greta Garbo is in top form in this, her first talkie. He gets good support from the rest of the cast, which includes Charles Bickford, the sturdy sailor who captures his heart. Mrs. Garbo offers a great performance, as she is usually the daughter of a ship captain who returns after fifteen years. Also in the cast is that great actress Marie Dressler. A good movie!
