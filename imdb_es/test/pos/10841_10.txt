Andrew Davies 'adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel was excellent. The characters of Nan and Kitty were magnificently represented by Rachael Stirling and Kelley Hawes respectively. The whole series was a total joy to see. It captured the imagination of everyone in general, whether heterosexual or homosexual. I wish there could be a sequel!
