Therefore, it is important to talk about the release of the DVD instead of just the movie. Tales from the Crapper is a film that only a studio in the world could offer. The one that has brought us real and innovative and original independent films for more than 30 years: Troma. This is truly a very special movie because it is certainly not my favorite of the Troma productions, but it was released on a disc that, from what I have just said, is one of my most valuable and favorite DVDs. Not only counting the countless Troma albums that I have, but also my entire movie collection. The film itself is the result of an unfortunate plan to produce a television series directed by a director who entrusted a large amount of money (especially for Troma) to do something wonderful and delivered a large amount of unfinished and incomprehensible material before. Quit smoking (or be fired, I'm not sure which one at this time). To avoid having to throw a huge investment into the toilet, Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz decided to bring together a team of directors and actors and use the material as the backbone of a movie. A film that really consists of two, in the beautiful and ancient anthology of the history of the crypt, presented by the Crapkeeper played by Mr. Kaufman himself. But, as I said, it's not my favorite of all his films. That's largely due to a strange sense of discipline in the various sets, forgetting Troma's harsh rule of "do not drink alcohol on set" that was discovered by a furious Lloyd and other less respectable employees that Troma had in the moment of the filming of the added scenes. All this made it almost impossible for Mr. Kaufman to make a worthwhile product in the editing room. But Lloyd Kaufman is a genius, and with the problematic scenes added to a starting product already deformed, he created not much less a masterpiece. The film itself is as good as the circumstances would allow the brightest filmmaker to come together and it is certainly entertaining, totally confusing, loaded with those elements that made Troma great and certainly unique and one of a kind. However, like a movie itself, it is not as bright as many other Troma productions. However, the genius of independent cinema made the DVD of this film much more than a premiere of a movie with some extras. The film is, when the moment of truth comes, in reality only a part of the whole DVD that is a document of the difficult situation in which serious filmmakers have to survive in a world monopolized by the Very Large few Do not really allow any other player in your territory. A document of the problems you have when you trust that people are at the level, only to discover that freedom is sometimes difficult to achieve and realize that access to a movie budget when the boss is not present it can corrupt even those who really should know better. The brightness of this DVD is that the movie is not perfect, and that Lloyd KNOWS it, and does not want anyone to think he thinks he is. The full commentary is a show in itself (as is often the case with Mr. Kaufan's audio commentary), mixes humor, mocks those who deserve it, and very interesting information for anyone interested in independent filmmaking in such a way That seeing the movie again with this comment immediately after seeing it on its own merits is so interesting that it is difficult to stop it. The feature-length documentary THE THICK BROWN LINE takes us behind the scenes in the different places where Lloyd visits the sets only to sometimes take control and make the most of what he finds there. Sometimes we see something disillusioned, different from his appearances in other documents of Making Of, such as Fart of Darkness and Apocalypse Soon, both found on the set of the box "MAKE YOUR DWN". <br /> <br /> The scenes added with James Gunn (who started his career in Troma only to find success as a writer and now director in Hollywood) and Trey Parker (again someone to start with a work published by Troma, to later be a national hero with his series South Park) are entertaining and probably (as is much more in this release) a reason to get this album only for anyone interested in the work of these two characters. Loaded with much more than I could mention here (including a SECOND audio commentary) this is one of the best Troma DVD releases.
