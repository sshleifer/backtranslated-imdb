'Never Been Kissed' is a movie that makes you feel good. If you have not seen it yet, then pick it up. I'm going to buy it when it's released because I loved it. Drew Barrymore is excellent again, she does her part well. I felt that I could relate to this movie because the school days I had were just as bad. I thought the plot was well written, there was comedy and romance, which are the kind of movies I love. I loved the ending because, even though you know what's going to happen, it still leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting, anticipating!
