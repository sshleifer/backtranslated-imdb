Crossfire is one of those films of the forties that cries out for a new version, if only because it is time for it to be done as it was originally written. The story on which the film is based is about the murder of a gay man. But anti-Semitism was certainly a hot topic in the days after the Second World War, with the holocaust fresh in everyone's mind. <br /> <br /> In Robert Mitchum's biography of Lee Server, he interviewed director Edward Dmytryk and said bluntly that the film could never have been made about a hate crime against gays at that time with the Code firmly in place. However, it could have been because the character of Robert Ryan is such an equal opportunity for everything that deviates from his social norms. <br /> <br /> Mitchum was told in no uncertain terms that he was in the film strictly for the movie. walk. Robert Young was chosen as the police homicide captain in Washington, DC, who is aware of the case and, although Mitchum received a second bill, he knew from the beginning that the movie belonged to Ryan. But it was the new RKO star due to his performances in The Story Of GI Joe and Till The End Of Time, so he was there for the box office insurance. Mitchum's part was as a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case, George Cooper. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not a whodunit, although we do not see the crime, it is clear that Montgomery is the one. who kills Sam Levene, the Jewish salesman par excellence. And it's clear to Young and Mitchum that Ryan is to blame almost as quickly as it is for the audience. It becomes just a matter of getting the evidence. <br /> <br /> Ryan earned one of several Academy Award nominations that the film won, his Best Supporting Actor category. Although he lost to Edmund Gwenn, the film was Ryan's breakthrough. Similarly, Gloria Grahame was nominated for a brief role as a party girl for Best Supporting Actress, but lost to Celeste Holm for the Knight Agreement. In fact, Crossfire faced the Knights' Agreement and lost for Best Film and Best Director for Dmytryk against Elia Kazan. It's the fifth Best Screenplay nomination and Crossfire fell short again, and the winner was Miracle on 34th Street. <br /> <br /> Gloria Grahame also had her own problems on the set that shed from her personal life . She was having big problems with her husband Stanley Clements, who was an abusive husband. I was hanging around the set causing Ed Dmytryk a lot of trouble. Fortunately the part of Grahame was small. In fact, the entire film was shot in the typical Korean Republic economic style in 20 days. <br /> <br /> Robert Young has a particularly good scene with William Phipps, a Tennessee boy in Mitchum and Ryan's outfit, which Ryan constantly belittles. Young is very eloquent when talking about the corrosive nature of hate and how it affected his family as Irish Catholics who arrived in the years of potato famine. It was one of Robert Young's best moments on screen in his long career. <br /> <br /> Like a good movie like Crossfire, it's time to remake yourself as a story about a hate crime against homosexuals. Especially with Barry Winchell's actual murder of the last decade and the debate about homosexuals in the army. <br /> <br /> That's a movie whose time has come and it's almost gone.
