I've been a fan of Amanda's since All That, and she's still fun. Also me, it's as simple as that. If you like Bynes, you will like this movie. It's harmless fun and pretty fun in parts. The flamboyant Sebastian accent and his manners are totally unrealistic, but they made me laugh so hard at some points almost choked on my popcorn. <br /> <br /> And anything that makes teenagers read Shakespeare (maybe) is a good thing for me. <br /> <br /> On a superficial note, Tatum Channing is pretty * ahem * damn hot. He also does a good job with some of the most difficult scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the supporting characters are VERY wide, but they are wide in "Twelfth Night", so it's great.
