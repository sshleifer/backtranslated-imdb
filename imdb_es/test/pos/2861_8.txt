With Nurse Betty (2000), the acclaimed indie filmmaker Neil LaBute (in the Company of Men, Your Friends and Neighbors) makes his breakthrough in the big budget (the $ 24 million Betty compared to the paltry $ 25,000 of the company ), the main kingdom - and yet remains true to its roots. While his cast is now comprised of top-notch Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman and comedian Chris Rock), his material remains as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he may be the next big thing . Nurse Betty is one of the darkest comedies that has been announced to a majority audience in years, and considering her moderate box office and critical success, viewers may not have been as stupid and brainwashed as we thought. The story follows (figuratively and literally) a naive waitress (Zellweger) who has fallen in love with a beautiful telenovela from the distance (Greg Kinnear from As Good As It Gets) but is trapped in a loveless marriage with a salesman sluggy cars (Aaron Eckhart, who made his big-screen debut at Company). When her husband is killed by two assassins (Freeman and Rock), she is shocked and goes to Hollywood to find his object of affection, not knowing that he is just an actor. When Freeman and Rock discover that the car they took contains 10 kilos of cocaine, they also hit the road and a scandal occurs. Fans of LaBute's previous work may have difficulty understanding how this might be the same guy who directed In the Company of Men, a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs who make a joke to a deaf co-worker. but when you think about it, the connection is quite clear: in the Company, a vulnerable woman does not realize that she is being ruthlessly exploited. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife ignores that the man she is persecuting thinks that her true adoration is nothing more than a joke. Some may begin to wonder if LaBute is actually a kind of misogynist, considering that his recurring theme involves the fall of innocent women. But personally, I think he is defending good sex and is dealing with abusers more harshly than the abused. One of the many charms of this film is that its absurdity is full: most directors, when they handle a script like this, leave the story in the hands of two hit men who persecute a woman who pursues a dream. But LaBute knows better, and one of the hitmen (Freeman) is also obsessive with Betty. This was an interesting role for Freeman, as it allowed him to play with his characteristic "this is the last time" character (see Undemiven, Se7en and the stinking Hard Rain of 1998); the cast of support also includes people like the famous Weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the future), Allison Janney and Kathleen Wilhoite of Mad Mad You. The script, written by beginners John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is deliriously exaggerated (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy, or ANY movie, in this sense, in which a man is involved?) Your own dining room? ). You could argue that the ending is a bit too perfect, but it really is not worth denying everything good about the movie because of a trivial complaint. If Nurse Betty is a sign of what LaBute has for us, you can bet that I'll be lining up for whatever he decides to follow. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
