Simply the best and most realistic movie about the Second World War that I have seen. Not only because the German soldiers speak German and the Russians speak Russian (not English in a German or Russian dialect) also because of the realistic decoration in which the film was shot. The performance is outstanding. No Hollywood feeling at all, not even a love story ... Stalingrad was supposed to be one of the most horrible battles during the war, and in that context there is no place for feeling or romantic scenes. What you get is a movie that will make you excited to the bone and that will have one of the best unhappy end that a movie could have.
