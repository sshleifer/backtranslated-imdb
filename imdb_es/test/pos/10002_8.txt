I saw this movie in a preview, and it's a delight. The cinematography is unusually creative, the acting is good and the story is fabulous. If this movie does not work well, it will not be because it does not deserve it. Before this movie, I did not realize how charming Shia Lebouf could be. He does a wonderful, autonomous job, as the leader. There's something incredibly sweet about him, and it makes the movie even better. The other actors also do a good job, and the film contains moments of great suspense, more than one would expect from a movie about golf. Sports movies are a dime a dozen, but this one stands out. <br /> <br /> This is one I would recommend to anyone.
