I saw this movie when I was much younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured with the love story of Orry and Madenline. I'm a desperate romantic, so it really affected me. I especially liked it when he met her. I just wish he had more time with her and her baby. So you know that in book three he was so hurt that he died. I really did not understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie. I just bought the three books together and I can not stop seeing them. My 12-year-old son is stuck in it. He likes fighting in the war. I cry every time. I would like to meet Patrick and Madeline in person! It was a wonderful movie and cast!
