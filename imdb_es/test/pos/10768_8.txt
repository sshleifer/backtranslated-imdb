In the second of his Historical Martial Arts films, Chiba portrays his real life sensei, Mas Oyama. The film even recreates Oyama's incredible feat of killing a furious bull with his own hands (Oyama did this feat more than 50 times in real life). Dynamic choreography of struggle with authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. Ironically, this is one of Sonny Chiba's rare films in which he does NOT tear off or rip the opponent's body parts. A must for fans of Sonny Chiba definitely one of his 5 best films.
