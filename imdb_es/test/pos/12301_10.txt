This is possibly the most perfect movie I've ever seen: in acting, adaptation and direction. It is autonomous and of a kind, so it makes no sense to say that it is better or worse than other great movies, only that it can be a perfect work of art. <br /> <br /> And it was fun to see the confused terror fans get up and go!
