For those who loved "Wayne's World" ... "The Blues Brothers" ... and hell, even "Raiders of the Lost Ark", you'll find many things to like (but probably not love) in "Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny, "a fictional epic about the formation of the band JB (Jack Black) / KG (Kyle Gass). Two losers who are out of work and fall in love with rock n 'roll find themselves in a quandary when KG's mother, for a long time, stops sending him rent checks; JB and KG make tracks for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after a wise music store employee (an inspired Ben Stiller) tells them about the headline selection (a fun animated upholstery sequence gives background story ). Along the way, our zeros meet a stranger with broken teeth (a game by Tim Robbins), Sasquatch, security guards, chicks of the sisterhood of women and Satan himself (a Dave Grohl ironically), in a climatic sequence that must be seen to be believed (and preferably played at high volume). I rarely see comedies in the theater, but "Pick" is an extremely good change of pace ... it may not go up to 11, but it sounds a bit raw and intelligent for a good 90 minutes. And the songs are inspired by the hilarity of the low brow. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10
