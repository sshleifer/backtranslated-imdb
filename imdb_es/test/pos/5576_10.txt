I love this show. It is a refreshing version of some older styles and styles of science fiction. They are not afraid to shoot, and when they do, people tend to die. Too many shows are afraid of this and end up simply pointing guns and then making it a showdown. Farscape is also complete with a lot of moving characters. They all grow in you to the point where it confuses you to hear them talk about taking out some of the animatronics from their box to make the miniseries. From start to finish, the farscape leaves you with a feeling of hope and despair, as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die, surprising you every time. It's worth watching even if you do not have time.
