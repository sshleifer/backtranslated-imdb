This is a great movie for pure entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. It's nice, and a vaguely nice movie. <br /> <br /> A minor, but nonetheless irritating thing about the movie is that we do not know why Justine and Chas separated. Well, most of the first relationships do not work for one reason or another, but more or less they seemed like a good couple. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it's worth looking to escape reality.
