"Saturday Afternoon" is one of Harry Langdon's best known short tracks, and with good reason. It is one of his best and funniest movies. The plot, as it is, is a basic element: a chicken husband escapes to spend a night with his friend and a couple of other girls. It's a solid and well-used comedy plot, but the difference here is Harry Langdon himself. His slow, inefficient, dazed and innocent nature has somehow failed on his way to a marriage with a woman who feels that he should be ruled with an iron fist, and that he is only forced to cheat her because he can not say it. "No" to the exhortations of the girl Vernon Dent and the cute flutter of the girl. <br /> <br /> It is a very adult problem that must be pushed to a childish and helpless character. Harry does not want to cheat, but he can not do anything about it. In a wonderful comic book business, he does not dare to fire the new bride with a kiss: he pushes the kiss towards her with his hands and shamelessly wipes his hand as if to reprimand him. The film is a three-reel comedy, ten minutes longer than the two reels that Harry Langdon had previously starred in for Mack Sennett, without further argument. Maybe it was even designed to be a double reel. This works perfectly, since it gives him all the time he needs to inject the slow reactions and the dazed flashes and half actions where he lives much of his comedy. <br /> <br /> Here it is at its best, and the show is really the curious magic of Harry Langdon and his ability to make the comedy come out of next to nothing. His little half smile, his look as he handles the money he has hidden under the carpet, the childish attempts to get into the fight at the end. I think his comedy makes us recognize something fundamentally innocent and confused in ourselves that makes us feel that the whole world is too much for us, but at the same time, by allowing us to understand what Harry does not understand (like the fact that women who good-hearted he brings his friend to cheer him up after he thinks the date has been frustrated are actually whores) forces him to realize with a little sadness that we are no longer so innocent. His comedy is so capable of making us say audibly "Awwww" how it makes us laugh, often at the same time. <br /> <br /> Here Harry wants to refuse to cheat on his wife, wants to tell his wife whose boss and regain some power in their relationship, wants to fight against the two violent men at the end of The Movie, but he does not It can affect your environment so much, and sometimes we all feel that way. <br /> <br /> The film is perfectly directed by the frequent director of Langdon Harry Edwards; it moves at a rapid pace and never stops, while at the same time it takes time to present the motionless and reactive comedy of Harry Langdon. Vernon Dent, a frequent friend of Langdon, plays one of the roles here where he becomes almost a comedy partner in his very effective partner with Harry. The gags were spaced in a way that gives the maximum effect as well, and Harry gets his own version of a Lloyd or Keaton-style trick at the end. Here the comedy is not in the great reactions of Harry to the danger of sitting between two cars in motion, but in his slowness to assimilate it. <br /> <br /> This is a hilarious movie, and a perfect example of comedy. From one of the most unique and talented humorists that I know has existed.
