'Apocalypse Now Redux', a work of war by Francis Ford Coppola is probably the most beautiful war movie I have ever seen. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a soldier from Vietnam who is appointed to lead a very dangerous and highly classified mission in Cambodia to "finish the position" of Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a highly qualified and respected Army man who Apparently, he has gone completely crazy and has deserted the army, creating his own small society and helped by a cult of soldiers. Accompanying him down the river to Cambodia is a handful of navy men, and along the way, they meet several interesting people (in particular, Robert Duvall's Kilgore, a lieutenant colonel with a few loose screws) and some horrible situations. <br /> <br /> 'Apocalypse' is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study. It's more 'Full Metal Jacket' than 'Platoon'. The execution time of 'Apocalypse' is more than three hours, but the film has such a wonderful and convincing rhythm that when the end of the film came, I was surprised at how much time had passed. However, the beautiful cinematography is what stood out the most to me. After watching this film, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in the history of cinema. The 'Godfather' films were stained with an almost sepia tone, and the shadows created the feeling of a baroque composition. With 'Apocalypse', there is an incredible use of natural light, and the shadows, particularly in the scenes involving Brando and Sheen, almost become a living character, are so penetrating and effective. Another beautiful scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes and they met a tiger. The enormous enormity of the surrounding foliage (leaves as big as a house) made the characters almost Lilliputian, but the colorization of the scene was incredible. While everything else was almost dull gray, the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green, an effect that was particularly surprising. Another really minor positive moment in the film was the big scene when the helicopters carrying Duvall and company attack the small town while playing against Wagner. This could have been an ultra dramatic underlying soundtrack of the scene, but instead Coppola makes the song a real part of the scene, with Duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to scare them. ' <br /> <br /> The performances in 'Apocalypse' are first class. Much has been made of the amount of money that Brando earned for the film and the amount of problems it caused. Regardless of this, it obtained a powerful performance during a relatively short screen time. Sheen is completely outstanding: this is the first time I've seen him really unleashed in a movie. and Duvall is very fun to watch as crazy Kilgore. 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that is so widespread in pop culture by now (most know several lines of the film, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' and others), but I knew enough that there were many surprises to discover. I have not seen the original cut of 'Apocalypse Now', so I can not compare it with this new cut, but this is a movie that should surely be experienced. 8/10 <br /> <br /> - Shelly
