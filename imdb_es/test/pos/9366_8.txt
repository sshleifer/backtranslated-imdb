"Crossfire" by Edward Dmytryk is a rare movie that comes from Hollywood in the forties. This was an innovative territory for Mr. Dmytryk and the studio due to what the director and his adapter, John Paxton, decided to do with the novel, on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> If you have not done it. seen the movie, stop reading now. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks's novel was about the murder of a gay soldier. In the film, the subject became a prejudice against the Jews, a subject that was a taboo subject during that time in American cinema. It is merit of Mr. Dmytryk having the courage to get involved in this film project. <br /> <br /> The film is an exceptional cinematographic piece due to the way the director presents it. Obviously influenced by the style of black cinema, they take us to Washington after the war. The opening scene about the brutal killing of Samuels shows that such an unusual cruelty has been inflicted on a decent man, that we do not yet know, or why he was murdered, but that he did not deserve to die in such a horrible way. <Br /> <br /> The basis of murder is prejudice, pure and simple. We realize how in the mind of an ignorant man, the mere fact of being successful and different, plays in the mind of the murderer. Samuels is the sacrificial lamb, in the same way that the gay soldier is the victim in the novel. The parallels are well drawn. <br /> <br /> This movie makes a convincing display due to the brilliant turn of Robert Ryan's star, like Montgomery. Mr. Ryan was an actor who always played interesting roles, but never as well as in "Crossfire." In addition, there is a great appearance of Gloria Grahame, since Ginny, the prostitute with her heart in the right place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast plays as a whole. Robert Young, as interpreted by the police detective in charge of the investigation, is a decent man who has known prejudices first-hand in his own family and speaks out loud against him. Robert Mitchum plays a great sergeant. Keeley, who is deeply moved by the crime when one of his men is accused of committing it. Sam Levene is excellent in his small role as Samuels. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to watch, as it is probably the first one to speak out against ignorance.
