I enjoyed 'Den brysomme mannen' http://ow.ly/PTTp (my wife did not, so I saw it in fragments for a few days). <br /> <br /> The reviewers are confused, most agree that it is allegorical. , but not of what; 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'Socialism', 'Capitalism'? <br /> <br /> That most people do not want to escape, and is essentially forbidden with most of those options. <br /> <br /> Therefore, you are supposed to project your favorite Preoccupation / prejudice / fear about it. <br /> <br /> So I'd say it's an epicurean life. A live desaturated color, literally in the film, figuratively in the interpretation.
