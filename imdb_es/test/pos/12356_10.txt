Yes, I suppose this movie is a bit boring compared to some of Pam Grier's other films. The plot is too familiar, the dialogue has been forced and some of the performances are not very good. But it's worth seeing the long stretch near the end of the film, where we see Mrs. Grier in a sexy blue suit, with the zipper half open. Yes, it seems a frivolous point when talking about an actress with the talent of Pam Grier, but she is also an extremely beautiful woman, and in the past, she had a body that would not give up. It's nice to see it displayed in a tight suit. Rent the DVD, and then tell me I'm wrong. You can not. That's because you know I'm right! :-) And yes, I really gave a 10 just for the neoprene wetsuit scenes! ;-)
