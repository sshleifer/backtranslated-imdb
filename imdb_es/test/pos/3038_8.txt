This movie is a piece of the time it was made ... Realistic. The films were not covered in candy in the late '60s and early' 70s. The producers did not try to create a happy ending that did not exist. The lack of a happy ending would create a stir in the audience that, with luck, would propel them into action. At least that's what it seemed at that moment. In today's film world, this movie probably would not be made. Definitely, there would not be this end, however realistic it may be. The sad fact is that the film showed a situation that could not be improved without an action based on the improvement of the relationship between the traditional thinking of the white south and the progressive movements of that era.
