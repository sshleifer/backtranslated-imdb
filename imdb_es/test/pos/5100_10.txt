I first saw him in the theater in 1969 when he was 9 years old and I immediately fell in love with him. I am sad that Sony did not consider it appropriate to release this on DVD ("but one day, one day ..."). I recently got a VHS copy of this on eBay and I sat down to watch it 39 years later. I am happy to report that there is still the test of time. The performance is accurate, the orchestrations of John Williams are exuberant and the songs of Leslie Bricusse memorable ("When I Am Older", "You and I", "Fill the World with Love", "London Is London" are just some of The highlights, and you can not say enough about Peter O 'Toole, Petula Clarke, Michael Redgrave and Michael Bryant as an actor, Terence Rattigan deserves an A + for his update on James Hilton's story. I like the fact that they have released the original soundtrack as a three CD game with many extras, I wish Sony would hurry and do the same with the movie.
