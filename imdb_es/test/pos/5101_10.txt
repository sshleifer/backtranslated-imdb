I wish I had been exposed to this for the first time in a movie theater when it premiered, as some of the commentators had done. It really is a treasure. To be fair, I have not seen any other version of Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and I do not want to do it either. For me this is a perfect version. I saw it for the first time at TCM years ago and I never forgot it. Yesterday I had the pleasure of seeing him with my girlfriend, although I had recorded him from TCM days before. There were parts of the movie in which we were both tearful, it really is a moving movie. <br /> <br /> And should not that be what the movies are about? <br />> The music is beautiful, the film was beautifully shot. The acting is first class. And the story is delicate and timeless. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite movies of all time.
