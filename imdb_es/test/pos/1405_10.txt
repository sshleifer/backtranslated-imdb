An impetuous and egocentric Army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a wise and dangerous attitude toward the Corps. <br /> <br /> In an obviously custom-made paper for him, William Haines shines in this extremely pleasant honor tale. and friendship Haines, a grade A scene thief, during the first half of the film is up to his usual behavior of Silly Billy, which under normal circumstances should have confined him to the guard house. The last half, however, becomes very serious, leading to the moral redemption of Haines and giving him a good opportunity to exhibit his acting talents. If WEST POINT does not reach the caliber of the previous version of Haines TELL IT TO THE MARINES (1926), this is undoubtedly due to the absence of a charisma character and the quality of Lon Chaney so that Haines can interact. However, this tribute to the Army is a very effective entertainment and should be appreciated for its own merit. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford appears as the love interest of Haines, playing the virginal daughter of the local innkeeper. Joan is pert and pretty and shines especially in her first scenes, when she meets Haines on a ferry from the Hudson River and is subjected to her usual immature pranks. Haines and Crawford made five feature films in silence and were tremendous friends for life. He was the much bigger celebrity in this period and gave him many tips to get ahead in Hollywood. She herself was a superstar in the early 1930s. She was reciprocated after her expulsion from MGM in 1932 by encouraging her career change to interior decoration. <br /> <br /> Little William Bakewell is considered a Plebe who idolizes Haines; their relationship actually receives a more sentimental treatment than that of Haines & Crawford. <br /> <br /> The film was made with the full cooperation of the War Department. The extensive filming of the location in the Academy helps enormously with the production environment, which MGM granted splendid production values. <br /> <br /> WEST POINT has recently been restored and David Davidson has given him a new score.
