I'm new to this, so be patient with me please. I'm a huge Surface fan. I thought the script and the computer graphics were exceptional, as good as any sci-fi movie I've seen in the theater. In February, the television guide said Season Finale, the announcer of the program said something in the sense of "... and now for the end of season of Surface". End of season, not end of series! I could not wait for autumn to come, to see what would happen next. So autumn arrives and is nowhere to be found! If NBC is not going to pick it up, what about Sci Fi or USA? It seems to me that Bay Watch did not last long on ABC and then in the United States it picked it up, and it went to the gang members! (I bet ABC was drowned) Ha! If it is not a series, then at least a mini series, to give all the faithful followers the closure. What happened to our guy stuck in the church steeple? Was the creature in the Nim chaple? Did you have a spouth grouth? Does the cloned guy come to our side? There are so many unanswered questions. Thanks for listening to me babble!
