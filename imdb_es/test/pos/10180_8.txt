When one watches the animated shorts of Superman from the 1940s, the similarity of the plots can get a little boring: the adversary is more often a mad scientist in a hidden barracks, who threatens Metropolis with an evil invention: Death, mechanical monsters, electrical earthquakes, magnetic telescope, what do you have. <br /> <br /> This is refreshingly different. The bad guys drive in a car, shooting and bombing, but the center of action is the golden train (in which Lois Lane travels, as the only press reporter, apparently). The films of the trains have their own typical ingredients, from the great train robbery of 1903, and some of them are presented here: decoupling of the cars in motion, running on the roofs, pulling the steam locomotive from the tender in the back, fighting with the engineer, a switch turned to divert the train on a side road, the fall (of people or the whole train) from a high bridge ... everything is in the few minutes of this beautiful piece. <br /> <br /> But I would not do it. Do not be a Superman movie if you did not do some incredible feats (which include balance and high precision placement) to win the day. If you are a fan of train movies, do not miss it.
