especially considering that I can count on one hand the romantic comedy movies that I have enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is very good as a heart transplant patient, who has a mysterious connection with the recently deceased wife of Duchovny. (I can think of several horrible movies that used this story line, I think there was an LMN movie with Jane Seymour). This movie, however, is an archer. <br /> <br /> Duchovny is nice and the scenes With his dog are cute and sad, the dog misses his late wife. All his friends want him to find a replacement, and there's a funny scene where he's on a blind date and Driver is the waitress. His date is horrible, and he is intrigued by Minnie Driver. <br /> <br /> Caroll O'Connor is also good at one of his last roles, as the grandfather of the house. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi (this is the only movie I liked) complete the comedy aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie because the story works, it's not too romantic, and it does not insult the public's intelligence. Highly recommended 9/10.
