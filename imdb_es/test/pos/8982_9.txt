Mike Nichols in the best shape. He was not a fan of "Closer", so it's comforting to see him again at the top with this comedy set in the darkest circumstances. Just a slip in the tone could have ruined this compelling image, but Nichols and his very strong cast of the A list never set foot wrong in this biopic of a deeply imperfect but absolutely convincing Congressman. Philip Seymour Hoffman as The usual is brilliant and brilliant: here is played a manipulator of the CIA damaged but ultra intelligent, and it is in the exchanges between the characters of Hanks and Hoffman where the comedy is triggered. Rarely the humor of the film laughs out loud and is also intelligent ... This hits the place again and again with a satirical touch that makes you laugh and cry in the state of the world (often simultaneously). <br /> <br /> Another important advantage is the length of the image. The movie is based on George Crile's fat book of the same title. The temptation for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (his claim to fame is "The West Wing") must have been to make a fat movie, but what we get is an impressive 90 minutes of a great story with broad implications. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be seen and recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darker dark theme and the lightness of the touch of its witty and brilliant script, even if it fails to eliminate the obvious link between the help that Herring and Wilson provide and the final consequences (9/11).
