This is a harrowing movie, and it moves relentlessly. Still, it is absolutely unique among war films in that it focuses exclusively on civilian experience, the loss of humanity that ordinary people suffer during the war. The two young married musicians undergo a slow process of degradation at the hands of both sides of a civil war. Completely devoid of sentimentality, the film offers a grim vision of the modern world, and I think it is particularly recognizable to many Europeans. With courageous and intense performances by Liv Ullmann (never better) and Max von Sydow (equally). For my money, the most indelible film that Bergman created.
