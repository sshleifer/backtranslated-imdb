A poetic examination of the human condition carried out without dialogue. The antihero, The Man, manufactures a contraption to escape a band of marauders, out of the wastelands of what was once a civilization, to the ruins of the city to seek their survival. There it crosses the way with The Brute, interpreted brilliantly by Jean Reno, of "The Professional" and "Mission: Impossible". Man is rescued by an old crazy genius who lives in a fortress of his own design. By using their ingenuity, The Man and the old genius are able to keep the Brute and their peers at bay, but they realize that it is only a matter of time before their defenses are compromised, so they take a respite. This is a very underestimated story of the desperate struggle for life, with excellent scenes of action and intelligent humor. Of all the films of this type, like "Road Warrior", "Omega Man", and even "Ultimate Warrior" (with Yul Brenner as a suede knife fighter), "Le Dernier Combat" is the most ingenious. The copies of the video are hard to find, I would give a ball of the left eye for one. If your local art house ever renews this film, I sincerely recommend that you break any commitment to see it big.
