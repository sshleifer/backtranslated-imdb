This was my second experience of the Monkey Island series, seven years after I was shown the first game. What was my response? "Oh, great, we're playing a caricature." I'm glad that my brother kept quiet and kept playing, because the jokes caught my attention once again, as well as the wonderful performance of Guybrush in the voice of Armato, not to mention that everyone else did well (I still believe that the Elaine from CMI sounds better than EMI's). Cut scenes do well to illustrate something that happens, and the art of both the game and the cut scenes are excellent. When we found the CD with the originals, Secret and LeChuck's Revenge, we were both ecstatic and spent hours working on Revenge. One of those moments was when we sat down and cast him half a day. However, CMI has to be the most played Monkey Island game, especially for the return of the sword fight and the offshore combat. That moment when you meet Kenny and he tells you he's gone straight and then, "I'm running guns!" I had my brother and I crying with laughter. And that's not the best part of the game, far from it.
