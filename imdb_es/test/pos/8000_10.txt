It has been said that Batman begins in the first Batman movie to "get it right", but I think it's a horrible exaggeration, because I think the new Batman movie, although it's bigger than Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, pales in comparison with the classics of Tim Burton. being this the best of the five. The darkness is beautiful, as is the music and the stage, creating a Gothic City shrouded in mystery, unlike Batman Begins, where the Gotham City is a normal-looking city. The villains are great in this movie. You literally can not take your eyes off the penguin and the cat woman. I applaud Tim Burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a monster, rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old Batman television show. In Batman Begins we have the scarecrow, which is not as demanding on the screen as the penguin or the cat. The film does not need to focus only on Batman, because we already know its history, and it is the villains we are exploring and trying to find out, and they are the ones who create the plot, with the penguin running for mayor. and seeking revenge for the abandonment of his parents by killing the firstborn of Gotham, a task in which he fails. Danny Devito offers the best performance of a superhero villain in any movie, surpassing even the Nicholson joker. The final scene where the penguins drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is moving and powerful. It is a tragedy that Tim Burton could not complete his trilogy, as Warner Bros., interested in marketing appeal, wanted to "lighten" the Batman movies. And they got their wish ... unfortunately. Tim Burton planned to direct the third film, using Riddler as the villain, without Two-Face and Robin to ruin it, and I'm sure that Michael Keaton would have signed. So this is the last great Batman movie. Batman Begins is dark, but boring, tedious, ordinary, full of dull villains, and a playboy Bruce Wayne. A decent Batman movie, but the best Batman movie? Never. Batman Returns has that crown.
