Cleopatra (the delightful Monica Bellucci) is challenged by Caesar (Alain Chabat): to prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans, she promises to build a luxury castle for Caesar in a period of three months, without delay. She calls the one-armed architect Numerobis (Jamel Debbuzi) and gives her two options: to be covered by gold if she fulfills her mission, or to become crocodile food if she fails. Numerobis will ask for help from Panoramix (Claude Rich), Asterix (Christian Clavier) and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideiafix). This movie is very funny, especially the parts where Obelix and the Pirates led by Red Beard participate. However, the scriptwriter and the director should have noticed that French is not a universal language like English is. Therefore, jokes with words (as in the Austin Powers films, for example) do not work well for people who are foreign to the French language. French people and fluent French speakers will like these jokes, but they do not make any sense to me, they do not speak French. My vote is seven.
