The best romantic comedy robot of all time, which uses robots as romantic characters, which leaves Short Circuit out of this category. This was Andy Kaufman's best effort. Bernadette Peters shows her versatility here with incredible performance. While it is not a great movie in many areas, I will grant you a 9 in value and extravagance.
