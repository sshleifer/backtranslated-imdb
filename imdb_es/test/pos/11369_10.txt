This series has recently been discovered and you can see excerpts, at least within Britain, through http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html Presumably, there is some hope that the series may become more widely available. The problem is that this series was followed by the series THE WARS OF THE ROSES that had a similar star cast and that has been available for cable television, or at least for the market. <br /> <br /> The two series are quite different in dramaturgy; THE WARS consolidates the works through an extensive rewriting and displacement of scenes; AN AGE OF THE KINGS follows Shakespeare more closely. Both series benefit from integral casting.
