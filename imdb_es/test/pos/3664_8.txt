Have you ever wondered how it feels to be FREE? I am sure that each one of us knows the meaning of freedom and we never seriously think about using it for our benefit. HARI OM shows the public what freedom really means. In this film, freedom is described in the form of style represented by Isa's discovery of India. Isa discovers her true inner love when she is on a Rickshaw trip with Mr. HARI OM. She sees life in a different way and portrays the freedom that each woman restricts herself when she is in a relationship. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely "worth seeing", and I saw it for the first time at the international cinema in Dubai. Festival (DIFF), and I left the movie theater with total satisfaction. <br /> <br /> "Look at it"!
