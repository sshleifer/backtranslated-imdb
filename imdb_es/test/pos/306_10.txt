Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) was sent to a mission classified in Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), since he has gone completely crazy and is no longer receiving orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is difficult for Captain Willard to understand how Colonel Kurtz could go as far as he has done, kill without authorization and take the war into his hands. What could have pushed this great man over? Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his goal, he tries, with some success, to understand why. But what will you decide to do once you find it? <br /> <br /> Any movie that can start with "The End" by The Doors is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood and images shown with the song. Apocalypse now does this perfectly. I can not think of anything better for it to be established, the Vietnam War and the madness in the minds of the solidarians that it created. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through the hairiest jungle in Vietnam, whose final destination is murder. Through the use of music and the score alone, we throw ourselves into a dark world of mystery, violence and madness. A perfect example of how to set the mood through music alone is this movie here. <br /> <br /> A great cast in general, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of whom Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread the bread of our desire for the film. I just do not like Fishburne, since I discovered that he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse, my contempt and hatred towards this man have multiplied tenfold. I realize the pettiness of this, but I just do not care. We need to get Gary Oldman sick with him. Brando is excellent as Colonel Kurtz and I can not think of any other actor who could have played the good man crazy and have so much presence on the screen. It is also fun to see Sheen as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and war in general. My favorite character in the movie has to be Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore by Robert Duvall. Before this movie I never imagined Duvall as a war cowboy, but he's honestly my favorite of his parts to date. He just nailed his character, who is one of the best in the whole movie, as the commander of the Gung-ho Air Cavalry who loves to surf. Maybe a little exaggerated but still brilliant. I also love the smell of napalm in the morning. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple and it does not take much mental capacity to discover what is happening. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, plain and simple. But it is the journey of the film that really is his heart and also the extreme situations of war. In the Redux version we are forced to sit in the long scene of the French plantations and in the Playboy bunny scene, which really adds nothing to the whole movie, apart from it being a longer trip. However, I do not think they take anything, it's just a question of whether you want to watch a three-and-a-half hour film or the original one. Through this trip, the film points out the absolute uselessness and irrelevance of the war for the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it ... in fact, that is the point. On top of that, the troops were not supported by the public and that could have helped a character like Kurtz go completely crazy. <br /> <br /> A great lover of war movies, this one is up with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all of them classics. Sometimes I try to compare movies of the same genre with each other, but in my reviews I have got into trouble in the past, since I had to go back over what I said. The three have their own strengths and add their own spin to the Vietnam War ... so to say that one is better than the other is pretty useless ... even if after having seen AN more recently, I think it's a bit best. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in any of the versions and is worthy of the state that has been granted. As one previous critic has said, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.
