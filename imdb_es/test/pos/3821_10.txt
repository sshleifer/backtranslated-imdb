"Think like a Dinosaur" was a well produced and executed program from the "Outerlimits" series. The actor (Enrico Colantoni as Michael Burr) plays an impressively good and convincing lead role. You can really identify with him and his "introspective" feelings about what to do with the girl he has fallen in love with (because he has been alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels desperate until "Kamala" comes into his life with a shy fear to carry out the task of being transported, then he comforts her and tells her that everything will be fine, which ends up being a deception for both of them, more or less something bad happens and she (the prototype) returns ... and her (clone) Although it is sent to the other inhabitant planet, although -Dino- and "Micheal" still have to discover this, when they do it, it is up to Michael to decide whether to kill her or let her live in. However, what happened before he met her (kamala) was very related to what happened to his wife, his wife died in a similar way, this show professes irregularity and sadness for the most part After the show, you stay thinking ... about what you SHOULD have done and you stay with 50/50 of what is right of wr ong Therefore, the equation of "equilibrium" is that there is no one. <br /> <br /> 10/10 I highly recommend watching this program.
