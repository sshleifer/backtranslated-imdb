Televised in 1982, of a production of Los Angeles, this is probably the best example of a filmed stage musical that you will probably find. Published on DVD in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer, it is quite impressive. Hearn and Lansbury give the performance of their lives and the rest of the cast is obviously stuck in the electricity generated. Of course, it is the music and lyrics of Sondheim that make this possible. If anyone doubts that he is one of the "greats" of the American musical form, listen to this. The sets are rigid, as corresponds to the plot, and intelligent to allow the rapid changes of scene required and the cameras capture the action without eliminating the fact that it is a production on stage. A central, movable and revolving platform is Mrs. Lovett's pastry shop, with the hairdresser upstairs. Around it there are several porticos and escalators to allow the rest of the action to take place. The brutal tale of injustice that leads to revenge, murder and chaos is flavored with black humor and comic moments. Sondheim does for hairdressers what Hitchcock did for the showers. An important work in the American musical theater is here an electrifying performance.
