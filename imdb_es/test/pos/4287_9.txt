Now this is the kind of movie we used to get weekly. Nowadays it is rare to see a drama that depends on the cast that speaks to each other. <br /> <br /> There are no explosions, car chases or persecutions, there are implicit sexual situations. This is not a film for the younger audience, it is for those who appreciate the people who talk to each other, they argue a lot, since we have married a couple who have problems in the middle of their lives. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson are apparently a very happy loving middle-aged man and wife. Now that he lives in this small suburb of London, handsome, Rupert Everett returns home to visit his wealthy father. <br /> <br /> Of course you meet Emily Watson. It would be easy for anyone to be hit by Emily. I do not say more, except that when the credits begin there is a fatal accident, the rest of the film is about the repercussions of this accident and all the lies told by the various characters ... <br /> <br /> The performance of This trio and the others are excellent. <br /> <br /> Julien Fellows wrote the script based on a novel by Nigel Balchin. He also directed, this was his first attempt at direction and he did it very well. All the production is first class. <br /> <br /> The film had a theatrical career of a few months at the end of 2005, it has less than 80 movie theaters. For me this is a shame, the stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens but really good dramas, as this and many others open up in just a few. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are some very funny lines with regard to certain situations. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
