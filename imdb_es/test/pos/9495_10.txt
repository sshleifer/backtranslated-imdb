I really liked that movie. He manages to make the characters sympathetic (well, most of them) regarding the problems they have with their relationship. <br /> <br /> Gloria Swanson, like Leila, is in a dusty marriage with a husband who is barely aware of his presence (although he notices his absence). The film shows very well why she is tired of married life, and why she is susceptible to a sweet con man, without making her selfish or demanding. Leila's reaction shots at the dinner table on her anniversary, while her workaholic husband (late at dinner again) eats salty onions with gusto and pushes the boyfriends dolls out of the way of his plate, they are perfect. <Br /> <br /> Elliott Dexter steals it, and steals it effortlessly, like Jim, Leila's negligent husband. After losing Leila to another man, Jim literally cleans his act, shaves his mustache, exercises to lose the spread of middle age and dresses perfectly. There are several photos of Jim at home, alone and thinking about Leila, including a powerful scene when he finds one of his old clothes in the closet. The film gives the audience the advantage of seeing Jim's transformation with Leila. It is not only the exterior that is most attractive; We get to know a lot more about the kind of person Jim really is, and we see how completely different it is from Leila's second husband, Schuyler (Lew Cody). Dexter shines like the before and the after Jim, who is determined, after discovering the true character of Schuyler, to recover Leila, if he can. The most touching moment of the film comes when Jim and Leila discover that they are under the mistletoe, and Jim talks about what he has lost. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
