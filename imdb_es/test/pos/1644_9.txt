A truly outstanding episode of season 1 is what ice is. A location, claustrophobic conditions and a general feeling of paranoia looming in the icy air makes this an episode of the first season. Former occupants of the artic station Mulder, Scully and four others kill each other or kill themselves. A virus is causing a murderous aggression and is responsible for causing deadly paranoia and fear. Mulder and Scully really begin to question each other's sanity. The tension is so high. The writers have to receive great credit for creating that kind of scenario in which the atmosphere is so tense. Mulder and Scully come into conflict in such a direct way.
