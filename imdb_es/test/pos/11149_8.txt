Having recently purchased Universal's Marlene Dietrich DVD collection, I was a little reluctant to see "Gold Earrings." The idea of ​​a 40-something Marlene Dietrich as a gypsy in a war romance seemed unusual and implausible. I should not have worried. With all the professional talent that went into these old movies, it's really hard to lose it. The movie was a joy to watch; Its a classic. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film was Dietrich, who plays the role of gypsy to perfection. Makeup, lighting, photography and his acting add up to make a character really surprising and memorable. I've never seen Dietrich play a "good" woman convincingly before, but he does it here! She played many disheartening vampires in those great Sternberg films, so it's refreshing to see her in a more relaxed role, with an exotic but very human character. <br /> <br /> In general, very good romance The love story is credible, optimistic and the happy ending is extremely satisfying.
