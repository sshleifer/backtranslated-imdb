The viewer who said he was disappointed seems to be missing the point here. This is an excellent movie, excellent and realistic representations of a middle class Jewish family in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, a long time ago. The nuances are perfect and I felt that everyone's casting was superior. Especially, the performance by Judith Ivey was simply perfect, especially the speech she has with her daughter when the daughter comes home late one night. That scene was worthy of Oscar. But, in reality, the whole performance was fine. I recommend this movie. It's a fun, familiar and lovely movie to see how a lovely middle-class family lived in Brooklyn so long ago. See it and you'll be glad you did it. It has some very funny lines and Eugene's character is a real comedian, very funny.
