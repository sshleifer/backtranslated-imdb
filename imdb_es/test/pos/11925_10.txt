Brief summary of the book: The boy, Billy Tepper, approximately 12 years old, is the main cause of school problems, and if they kick him out of one more school, he will be sent to a boarding school. Your high-level children's school in Switzerland (or a similar place) is taken over by Arab terrorists, so I'm not really sure. Billy has no friends, and he likes to use his laptop to hack into his school's database. He, with the help of two teachers, frustrates the plans of the terrorists and saves the whole school. The book was not bad, but it was a very good cliche. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie; They changed the Arab terrorists to the Cuban terrorists, and they turned Billy into 17 and the leader of his group of friends. They like to get into trouble, but they are normal things for teenagers. This movie was believable. It may not be realistic, but the characters are real. You can see Billy, Joey and the rest of the boys and see real kids acting the way they did (or at least wanting to). <br /> <br /> Great action scenes. Not everything goes as planned for either side. To overthrow the terrorists was disorderly, and the good ones got hurt. I will not say who, but it is heartbreaking (I know, I use that word a lot). Sean Astin is excellent. As a teenager he usually played the best friend of fools. This film proved once again that I could play the protagonist, child, whatever. The only performance that could have startled was that of Wil Wheaton, who played the only son of a man from the New Jersey mafia. He hated his father, and everything he represented. (Far from Wesley Crusher) Usually, this genre of film is one that I observe with the soul's purpose of mocking; but not the toy soldiers. The story line flows, the dialogue is usually credible. I can not think of a single moment in which I found myself screaming at the television "Oh, that would not happen" Great movie that should be in everyone's collection.
