It was evident until the final credits that this film was made in 1989, since all the elements of its production were made to look like in the 1960s: the performance, the characterizations, the sets and the accessories had an aesthetic of a previous era . <Br /> <br /> The film opens to the moments before the fall of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and how this tragic incident affects a family: a young woman, Yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. Even in black and white, and using special effects that are quite primitive by modern standards, but emotional and effective, the descriptions of the immediate consequences of the bomb are quite horrible. Family members become unrecognizable to each other, others look like zombies as they roam the streets scruffy and in shock. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the rain that fell shortly after the bomb, which was mixed with radioactive ash, and in which Yasuko is trapped. Rumors that Yasuko is in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing affect his marriage prospects and then it is discovered that the black rain is causing illness. The film deals not only with the physical effects of the bomb on the Japanese, but also with the social and psychological damage that occurred. <br /> <br /> The film seemed compassionate and a fascinating journey towards a unique culture. While the film is primarily concerned with the pain a family feels, the film's soft political message is relevant today and probably for all time: wars have horrible consequences and should not be accepted unless absolutely necessary. It is said that history repeats itself, and the current leaders of the "Coalition of the Beloved" have learned nothing. While atomic warfare has not resurfaced since 1945, other deadly side effects have. This movie is compelling visualization.
