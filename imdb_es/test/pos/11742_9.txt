The beautifully appealing song with the same name as the movie won the best Oscar song in 1955. <br /> <br /> Love is something splendid. <br /> <br /> It is the April rose that only grows in early spring. <br /> <br /> Love is the way nature gives a reason to live. <br /> <br /> That golden crown that makes a man a king. <br /> <br /> Once on a high and windy hill <br /> <br /> In the mist of the morning, two lovers kissed and the world stopped. <br /> <br /> Then his fingers touched my silent heart and taught him to sing. <br /> <br /> Yes, true love is a thing of many splendors. <br /> <br /> How can we forget such a beautiful song? Henry King, the director, had the privilege of working with Jennifer Jones twice that year for this film and the highly underestimated film "Good Morning, Miss Dove." Jones was nominated for "Splendored Thing", but could also have been easily nominated for Miss Dove. <br /> <br /> William Holden is great as the war correspondent sent to report on the communist revolution in 1949 in China. His love for Jones, an oriental doctor, was endearing and memorable to see. <br /> <br /> While the ending is not pleasant, this is one of the best romances that have been seen on the screen.
