Great book, great movie, great soundtrack. Frank Sinatra shows in this film that when he wanted to make an effort, he could act. The ending is a bit clumsy, but at the moment it is understandable that the studio wanted a happy ending. The graphic nature of heroin addiction (innovative for the period) is an advantage. Add the excellent soundtrack and you will have one of the great American movies.
