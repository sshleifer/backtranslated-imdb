I remember seeing this movie in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 years old (you do the calculations). Absolutely loved it. I went to Tarzan during the 2 weeks after seeing him (climbing the furniture, jumping making monkeys sounds). A fascination for Tarzan and the monkeys began, but oddly enough it seems a more lasting love for Christopher Lambert (keep in mind that I saw Highlander soon after this). 1984 was the last time I saw that movie, until about a month ago. It happened that I was on the wire, since I was getting ready to go to bed at 3:30 am and although it was late and I was tired and had to be at work at 9:00 am, I was awake to see this movie. loved as a child <br /> <br /> When I saw her, I realized that it was not such a good and even stranger movie, that Andie MacDowell's voice was dubbed by someone else. Ian Holme, of course, was solid as always, and surprisingly the monkey suits were still there, but the most surprising thing was how good Lambert was like Tarzan. He was cool! The depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primordial body language and, most importantly, his ability to carry this character through his extremely large ark, was simply incredible. <br /> <br /> As I said before, I'm a Lambert fan, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this movie it was really good and it's a pity that I've never had the opportunity to portray a character with such depth again. <br /> <br /> So to make a short story too long, I was a bit disappointed that the movie was not so good, but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I do not regret staying until 6:00 am to see it
