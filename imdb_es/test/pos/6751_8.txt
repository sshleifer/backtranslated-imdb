I found this little gem as an additional feature on my DVD of Vampyr-Der Traum Des Allen Gray, and I did not expect much from that. It seemed like it could be a little interesting, so I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I am very happy that I did it. It was really amazing! Despite having been made more than 70 years ago, the animation was, in my opinion, better than part of what was done today with all the effects and computer experience available now. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: a newly armed toy dog ​​hears the owner's cries for not being able to pay for an orange and goes in search of it. In the process, he runs into the underworld of a toy with all kinds of infamous creatures and toys supervised by the devil himself, who also want the dog's orange for themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie precedes, but does it remind me a lot of Mad Monster Party? (1969, Jules Bass), a film I've always enjoyed and, to a lesser extent, some of Tim Burton's animated works: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993, Henry Selick) and Corpse Bride (2005, Tim Burton). Fans of any of these movies, I'm sure, will also love The Mascot. <br /> <br /> In general, an amazing piece of short animation that is worth seeing.
