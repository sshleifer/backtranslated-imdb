William H. Macy is great in this Alfred Hitchcock movie. Macy plays a movie critic who accidentally kills one of her girlfriends. The resulting characters are hilarious. James Cromwell offers an excellent performance as a private blackmail detective. As always, Macy is incredibly fun and offers phenomenal performance. Watch this movie every time you are on t.v. and check your video stores because this is one you do not want to miss.
