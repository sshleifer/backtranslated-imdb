Last night I saw 'Begotten', and I have two minds in the movie. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I appreciate it for being the total investment of a Michael Bay movie. Without dialogues, very stylized black and white photographs, some of the most horrible images ever filmed, and a very convincing use of sound (which no one else seems to have grasped yet). It is a reflection on a subject, and dares to go where most filmmakers do not only do it in terms of images, but also of production and concept. It is a film that most people do not understand, and if you read these comments you will find many people whose lack of ability to solve this film makes them scream about "pretension" with the fervor of a gibbon noise. The bars of his cage at lunchtime. It really surprised and bothered me, and the last time a movie did it was a while ago. <br /> <br /> In the other, this is a short thirty minutes that extends to more than an hour and a half. half. I understand that there may be artistic merit in the use of repetition and monolithic rhythm like a club, but in this case it just does not help that everything is united. Imagine being approached by a ragged man in the street who grabs you by the shoulders and says something that completely confuses the core of your being ... but then, instead of leaving your mangled and babbling in his wake, he keeps talking and talking. and talking. At the end of the movie, I found myself looking at my watch from time to time. <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment, people. This is misunderstanding. This is how you deprogram the people who have just seen "Glitter". If you watch movies to entertain yourself, this will frustrate you, confuse you, and possibly anger you. You do not approach 'Begotten' like a chocolate cake that you want to eat because it tastes good. You approach him as something in the menu that you've never heard of before, something you see furtive looks through the kitchen door, something that is dark and shines on your plate; something that you order not because you will know well, but because you only have to know how it is.
