The standard bearer of all the movie series, the final good boy, Flash Gordon, against the bad guy, Ming the Merciless. Although special effects seem terrible by today's standards, by 1936 they were top-notch. But the essence of the story is the battle between Earthman Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) against Emporer Ming of Mongo (Charles Middleton). Crabbe and Middleton are great in their parts. And the supporting characters who play Dale Arden, Dr. Zarkov, Princess Aura, Prince Barin, Vulcano and the rest are all very good. This series is far superior to the 1980 film, basically because Crabbe is far superior to Sam J. Jones as Flash Gordon. <br /> <br /> This series is the standard carrier of all movie series. No doubt about it.
