I remember ignoring the television series when it debuted for the first time because of its 'look' with Jim Hensen's muppets. However, recently a friend lent me his Farscape DVDs, and now I'm realizing how terrible that mistake was. <br /> <br /> As with any television series, there are episodes that shine and others that do not. I drive the adrenaline and the emotional race during the big episodes and I suffer for the mediocre ones. However, I resist regardless of the central story that unites all the episodes. What I mean is the growth of the main characters and their mutual love. Let me warn you, it is something that is absolutely irresistible to see. I can not remember any other television series (Babylon 5, Buffy, Angel, etc.) that has created in an intelligent and intelligent way a trip so heartbreaking (sometimes) and suspenseful. <br /> <br /> I think at the end of the In the fourth season, things were finally focusing narrowly and I was surprised at the decision to cancel the series. I look forward to the launch of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible jewel.
