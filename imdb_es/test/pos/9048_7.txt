OK, I'll admit from the start that the Inki cartoons made by Loony Tunes are quite offensive and I can understand why Warner Brothers has pulled them out of the market. Seen today, the Inki with huge lips and very stereotyped is not politically correct. However, the cartoons were well done and it is a pity that they have not been published with some kind of explanatory prologue (like the one by Leonard Maltin that was included with some politically incorrect recent Donald Duck cartoons that were recently released on DVD). In other words, getting rid of cartoons completely is forgetting our story. In addition, Inki, Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons are available, especially on the Internet. <br /> <br /> This Inki caricature has our little hero hunting. At first, he is chasing a cute little caterpillar, but then accidentally collides with a lion, a lion who is more than happy to prepare Inki for his dinner. However, through all this, a strange Minah appears again and again ... and finally you will see why this bird is so important to the story. <br /> <br /> Cute, well done and intelligent. I like Inki's cartoons. In addition, I am pleased to show you liberal friends of extremely thin skin only to see them with apoplectic attacks or even heart attacks. A lot of fun, friends!
