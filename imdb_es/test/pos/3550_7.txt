Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like the house of art, the live action Fantasía, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Bus movies are always a problem, but they have always interested me a lot. Now I will qualify the segments individually. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg - "Un ballo in maschera" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole group. It is difficult to follow, especially because it tries to adhere to a clear plan (a trick). The photograph is not fulfilled. Best of all is the bit of homoerotic lesbian that never does enough. This segment made me very nervous to continue. 2/10. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - "La virgine degli angeli" - an unclear segment, but it does not matter. The film has the best picture of the group, mainly because it is in an impressive black and white. The segment is dreamy and beautiful. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - "Armide" - I chose to challenge this highly defamed film for the Godard and Altman segments. With Godard, I was much more impressed than I thought. I can not say that I have seen so many of his films, since he did so many that almost nobody has seen, but, judging from what I have seen, this may be his best work since the sixties. It's the funniest segment of this movie, and the most artistic one made. Bravo, Jean-Luc! 9/10. <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - "Rigoletto" - a very fun segment, it is also quite predictable. Even so, this story about a husband and wife who are deceived in the same place was filmed wonderfully with complex and long follow-up shots that depend on the precise choreography of the actors. He also has a great joke about omnibus movies. The final scene is very weak. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - "Die tote Stadt" - this short segment also involves lovers in (I think) Venice. It's nice, with some good pictures of pigeons flying around the city. It's light, but nice. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - "Les Boréades" - is not one of the best segments, unfortunately, this is more a music video than a short film concept. These are the occupants of an insane asylum who attend a theatrical performance. The music and the images work well together, so at least I can give it credit for being a good music video. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Franc Roddam - "Liebestod" - something unfortunate for the Beresford segment, this segment is very similar to this one. As you can guess from my phrasing, this impacted me much more. It's about a young man and his girl who go to Las Vegas on a fatalistic journey. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - "Nessun dorma" - perhaps the most striking segment, plays in a fantasy world more than in reality. It is a beautiful story of a fallen angel. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - "Depuis le jour" - I've heard a lot about Jarman, and this is the first cinematographic work I've seen of him. Hopefully, I'll see more in the future. This is also musical, but it's better than the Altman segment. It refers mainly to an old woman who remembers her younger days. The editing and use of different films to represent both time and emotion are very beautiful. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Bill Bryden - "I pagliacci" - the sad clown, possibly one of the most famous arias (particularly memorable of a Seinfeld episode), this serves as the material that separates each segment and the ending. It is simple and effective. 7/10. <br /> <br /> In general, I give it a solid 7/10. It's not as bad as you've heard.
