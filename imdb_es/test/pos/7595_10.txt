I think Never Been Kissed was a totally amazing movie. The casting was really good and they performed very well. I really like Drew Barrymore and of course it was excellent for me. At first I got scared because I said I was not going on video. Wow, I'm happy it's because it's a movie more than great. Go see it if you have not already done it!
