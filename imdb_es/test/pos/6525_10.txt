For a film shot in 18 days and a budget of less than 2 million, this little film that could deserve a prize "the best we could". An interesting premise (apart from the typical things of meteorites) with solid perfs by a cast of familiar faces. 2 thumbs up. Advice for the other critic: Do not be afraid to say that you liked something.
