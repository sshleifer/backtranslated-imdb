Excellent movie in many aspects. Vicente Aranda has managed to represent time (1830) with meticulous care. The light, the places, the feeling, are perfectly perceived from the beginning of the film. And along with this, in opposition to what happened to "Mad Love" (Juana la Loca), a rather episodic historical film, all this beautiful photography / music / clothing is enveloping a very fluid script that reaches its climax from the only possible way. By way of. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, Paz Vega as Carmen is outstanding: liar, seductive, aggressive, totally sexual, so beautiful Carmen. Sbaraglia is a little less convincing to the audience about his instant love and crazy about Carmen, but manages to convey the appropriate tragic mood to the entire movie. I recommend it to all: the best Spanish movie of the year.
