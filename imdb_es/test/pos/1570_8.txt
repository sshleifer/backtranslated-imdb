It's a sad state in corporate Hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you've been seeing in the movie theater since the first day. Literally, I had no idea how this film was going to end, because it went to the left when I expected it to go well, zigged when I expected a zag, etc. This could easily have been unraveled in a generic suspense thriller, or in a depressing drama of white trash. but a proper course was maintained until the end. However, it is a sad story. Not because of what happens to Alicia, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and guides her down this path. <br /> <br /> The plot has a quiet dignity that is usually reserved for the theater, but the pace could use a little adjustment. Either way, it is a very good movie and, for some reason, I suspect that the sour grapes come from those who have rated it low.
