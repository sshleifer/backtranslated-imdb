The first critic is right: in this film we see ourselves, cuddling the majority, being nice, trying not to get into trouble, just trying to live our lives, and we see how easily these human traits, so fundamental to The functioning of society can lead us to be accomplices of a great evil. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds during World War II, with radio, newspapers and films reminding us of Hitler's attacks on Jews to underscore the irony. of the same kind of violent anti-Semitism that takes place in the United States. Sometimes that seemed a little awkward. <br /> <br /> It feels more like a play than a movie, but it is so suggestive that such problems are not very important. Perhaps less trivial is the fact that the whole plot is based on a small fact that seemed quite implausible to me. Larry has lived a life without incident until middle age; however, all you need to do is start using a pair of glasses for everyone, EVERYONE, to, at first glance, take it for a Jew. I voluntarily suspended disbelief because the plot kept me going, but improbability bothered me throughout the movie. (And, frankly, I did not understand why his wife was also taken by a Jew.) Larry seemed to think so because it was called "Hart." And later, when he married her, I do not know why his neighbors assumed She was Jewish For the first part of the film, I was wondering if there were fantasy elements. "Larry's modesty seemed exaggerated, almost to the point of grotesque, why not call the police to see the rape, even if the attacker was A neighbor? And I thought that the lighting seemed to suggest something a little unreal: the red of the houses seemed too red, the entrance of Gertrude seemed deliberately overlit, the colors were usually almost like crayons in their intensity. <br /> <br / > In the credits I see that it was filmed on Campbell Avenue and Wallace Avenue in Toronto, so I plan to drive today (near Bloor and Dufferin) to see the colors, really :) It was good to remember that the clergy at that time often led the evil of the ra cism. (Remember how the Pope refused to speak against Hitler, seeking only to obtain protection for the Church?) It was the Pope himself, by the way, who, when Rome was about to be liberated by US troops, asked the first Soldiers entering the city, do not be black, check your history, I do not remember hearing this movie before, it's a pity, it's certainly of great interest to all the people who think, to all the people interested in the story or Racism in the United States: It is one of the clearest illustrations I have seen of Bertrand Russell's opinion: "Do not go with a crowd to do evil."
