This movie is one of the most fun I've seen in years. A film that deals with death and funerals without being depressing or irreverent. Christopher Walken offers much of the comedy in this charming romance and I could hardly breathe for laughing so much. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie a preview, and when it was over, the audience not only applauded, but also applauded. . I'm telling all my friends to watch your arrival in the United States. I definitely plan to see him again at the theater and buy it on DVD as soon as it's available.
