Nice doco Stuie! <br /> <br /> Although it did not work out what you wanted with the original movie, it has a fantastic job and a great visualization. <br /> <br /> It is self-evident how much it puts. at. <br /> <br /> That also goes for everyone else. It is great to see the warts and the whole explanation of the process without being "too nice". <br /> <br /> I loved it! Well worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Too bad, the writer of the 'original' movie could not appreciate what you've achieved. <br /> <br /> Love the attitude too. Great piece I'm anxious to see the next job. <br /> <br /> Keep going, brother! Paulista
