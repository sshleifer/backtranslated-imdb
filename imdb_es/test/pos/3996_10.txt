Despite many films dealing with great artists or a genius, Chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is crowned ... <br /> <br /> the decision to alleviate the demands of popularity or create something new . and to define your own style. <br /> <br /> Chiahweson's desperate search for inspiration and broadening his conscience led him to live as he did, restless, scandalous and, yes, very drunk! <br /> <br /> But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect for his Master, respect for nature and the gradual search for improvement and perfection.
