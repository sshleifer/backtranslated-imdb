Frogs that wanted a king or a frog is the most cautious account of Ladislaw Starewicz about people who want the government to solve the problems I've seen. The ironic thing is that they pray to the god Jupiter for his answers. Jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork. None works and the stork is especially dangerous for amphibious creatures! Frogs have some human qualities when we see them getting dressed in the latest fashions of the day and we see some pictures or we use a film camera when the stork arrives! As I said, this short is a political allegory more suitable for adults than for children. In fact, I saw it for the first time in the Rhino VHS that Bambi Meets Godzilla had. That alone should tell you what to expect here!
