While I keep his predecessor, "Fast Times At Ridgemont High," as a standard for comparing other teen comedies, "The Wild Life" is one of the lesser-known films of that era, and a worthy sequel, if you can call it A) Yes. I think his motto says: "From the creators of FTARH, something even faster." This is definitely true. Although it may lack the depth of the above that addresses issues such as first dates, teen sex and abortions, "The Wild Life" is, however, a great movie. It's pure chaotic fun, especially due to Chris Penn's character, Thomas Drake. If Spicolli had a high content of coca instead of grass, he would be Drake. Eric Stoltz, in his first major role, is as good as Bill Conrad. The two characters work well with each other. Think of a younger and more modern odd couple, complete with the brightness of the 80s. Outside of them, there are many other great things about this movie that are worth mentioning. Lea Thompson has never looked cuter, especially during the scenes of her work in the donut shop. Jenny Wright is simply delicious and fun to watch. Rick Moranis plays a great nerd / pervert who is dying to get into his pants. The fighting friends of Thomas Drake are hysterical, especially Benny, the little Puerto Rican, who says some pretty memorable lines. One in particular who shouted during a night in a strip club had me on the floor the first time I saw him. That is saying something! Finally, the film ends with one of the best party scenes of the 80s in the movie, ever. Watch for the special appearances of Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones, Leo Penn (Sean's father and Chris Penn) and a random Michael Jackson likeness at the party. Add a score no less than by the man himself, Eddie Van Halen, and you can not go wrong. For Van Hagar fans, keep your ears open for the riffs that will be found on albums like 5150, OU812 and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. <br /> <br /> If something interrupts the flow of the movie, it is a small secondary plot. involving Randy Quaid as a burned veteran of Vietnam. It just seems out of place and unnecessary. Apart from that, it's almost perfect. If you are a fan of the movies without sense but fun of the 80 and you have not seen this yet, something special awaits you. RENT NOW !!! <br /> <br /> p.s.-The credits say that Cameron Crowe has a cameo as one of the cops in the movie. Do you turn your back during your scene because I still have to find it? Someone help me please.
