First, to rent or watch this movie, something is expected in the B-horror range. What this film offers the cunning fan of this genre is a hilarious romp through the Nordic flavor. Sometimes, reminding me of the humor of Jackson's Dead Alive and others from a Stuart Gordon movie, this little find should be the most fun. <br /> <br /> The f / x reach a high level of terrifying (the first time Ed meets his nemesis), but in general they have the feeling that this film was put together by a team of f / x who decided to use any and all accessories available to other films (gremlins, devils, slasher films, etc.) had a pretty good effect and worked through the use of hallucinations. <br /> <br /> The jewel in the movie is humor. The gore works most of the time but more for the laughs. In his heart is a parody and a fun in that.
