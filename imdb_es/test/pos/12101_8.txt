Faith Akin has made me understand once again the depth of my passion for this city called Istanbul. As a city of cultural mosaics, Faith Akin has contributed to this through the mosaics of music presented in the film. What's more, the highlight of the film, in my opinion, is the scene in which Muzeyyen Senar (a diva of Turkish music) sings at age 86, as she had in her youth and rolls the Raki glass in the air without spilling. A drop, which is a traditional act in the raki culture. She is simply wonderful. Sezen Aksu (a Turkish pop singer), with her mystical and meaningful looks at the end of her song that gives the film its Turkish title, makes the scene nothing short of a climax. Last but not least, the wonderful landscape of Istanbul can make you feel nostalgic if you are out. Beware!
