We saw La Spettatrice last night at the Chicago International Film Festival and we were both very moved. This is a disturbing story of loneliness and lost connection in which the longing for intimacy comes into conflict with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to others. The three tracks (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are excellent and the dynamics between them is very surprising. <br /> <br /> After all the films that devalue older women, it is wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful and sensual, as well as seductive and powerful. We are conditioned to believe that when a younger woman enters "the mix", the older woman will become jealous of the younger woman, the man will leave the older woman for the younger woman, etc., etc. In this film, however, Emotional truth is considerably more complex. Highly recommended
