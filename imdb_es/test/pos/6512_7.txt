I do not understand why this movie has such a low rating. He deserves totally more! Sure, it's completely ridiculous, but that's what it was supposed to be. Do not expect a cinematographic transcendence of a movie about contestants of beauty contests stranded on a Caribbean island! What you should expect is a great parody of almost all the relevant films of science fiction, fantasy and block-buster in film history, and even references to other spoofers. All completely exaggerated and, sometimes, totally unnecessary, but that is exactly what makes this film stand out. If you like skits and enjoy, for example, Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers, you will love this. I made it!
