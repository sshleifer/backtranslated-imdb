I do not think the world was ready for this movie. I know it was not. I was expecting a standard Schlock low budget potboiler. Instead, I got the smartest review of Shakespeare from the "Books of Prospero" by Peter Greenaway. This should become the definitive film version of Romeo and Juliet. It will not, of course. But that is the loss of the world.
