I guess when I saw this episode, I had seen enough Twilight Zones to resolve it before time. There is this strange set of characters that are on the bottom of a cylinder. They are fine until a too enthusiastic soldier appears in their midst. His first directive is to escape, so he gathers the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. There is a lot of discussion about purpose and reason and speculation about their pasts, but nobody can remember anything. They represent different jobs: a piper, a dancer, a clown, a man with a tattered hat. Why are they there? It leads to an adventure and resolves in the end, but I think I had a good idea before everything happened.
