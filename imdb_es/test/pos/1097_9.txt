Yes, maybe there are parts of this movie that require a little suspension of belief, but that does not take away from the charm and wonder of the film. It was shown as part of the youth film festival of our city and was the favorite of the organizing committee. What is not surprising. The theme: meet in a South Africa torn by the race, although after apartheid is highly current and the treatment of the subject is inspiring. Of course, as mentioned in the previous commentary, the film has its flaws, but the realism of the environment and the way in which the director deals with his subject denies these flaws. I saw this with my wife and we returned that night with the children. A movie to see, meditate, discuss and act.
