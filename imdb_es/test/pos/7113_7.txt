This is a very entertaining entertainment movie in the Universal Horror series with Dracula, the Wolf Man and the Frankenstein Monster. The plot revolves around Dracula (John Carradine) and Larry Talbot, the werewolf (Lon Chaney Jr.), visiting separately a revolutionary doctor. Both ask if they can be cured, and the doctor tries to devise a way for each one. Under the doctor's castle, they find the Frankenstein Monster buried in mud (apparently it is a reference to the previous film of the Frankenstein series). <br /> <br /> Of course, if things had gone according to plan, the movie would have been incredibly boring. In contrast, Dracula can not suppress his appetite, and the doctor eventually becomes infected with a blood transfusion, with vampirism. As a semi-vampire, the doctor goes crazy and wakes up the Frankenstein Monster. As with all the Universal Horror series, the ending is completely unsatisfactory. A beautiful woman with a hunchback, one of the two medical assistants, has a particularly frightening end. Also, you should only feel sorry for Frankenstein's monster in this movie: he's awake for about two minutes, he kills a police officer and then another building (what's this, the fifth now?) He collapses on top of him and is consumed by llamas It is also unfortunate that the great character created in The Wolf Man (1941), Larry Talbot, is really reduced here. People underestimate that movie and Chaney's acting in it. Here, I would be justifiably criticized as being of wood. However, in general, it's a pretty funny movie in just 68 minutes. A good waste of time. 7/10.
