Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater is not very different from the previous games (excluding Tony Hawk 3). The only new thing that is presented in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is the new selection of levels and the adjusted graphics. Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater offers a new career mode, and that's the 2x race. The 2x race is basically the race of Tony Hawk 1, because there are only about five challenges per level. If you missed Tony Hawk 1 and 2, I suggest you buy Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater, but if you've played the first two games, you should still try this one. In general, there is really nothing new, but still it is very fun to go through the game. Hopefully this review will benefit your needs. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10 In general, clean images are not really one of the main features of Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater. The environment has changed a lot since Tony Hawk 1 and 2, and the character models seem a bit improved. When you remember Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 on the old PS1, the idea that those old graphics are ugly goes through your head. In Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater, the graphics are MUCH better. The character models are no longer full of jaggys, the textures are softer, but not as much as possible. The graphics of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x do not compare with the graphics of Tony Hawk 3, but Activision probably did not want the Pro Skater 2x of Tony Hawk had extraordinary graphics. In general, the graphics deserve an average score of 7 because they did not put all the power of the Xbox to use here. The graphics are nice and clean, that's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Sound: 8 of 10 The sound effects are not transmitted much to the imagination, but the skateboards that come out of the ground sound very good. The main reason I assigned a rating to the sound factor was that you are not forced to listen to the Tony Hawk soundtrack, below average, because there is a custom soundtrack feature. The sound effects sound much better than the sounds of Tony Hawk 1 and 2, mainly because it is clearer and the fact that everything sounds good. One of the main reasons why I bought this game is the personalized soundtrack. The sound effects of the routine still sound the same as the first two games, just a bit tight. One of the main problems of the sound factor, is the fact that if the song ends, it will NOT go to the next track, the song that you just heard will simply play again. I do not like the soundtrack of the game, but as I said, you are not obliged to listen to it. <br /> <br /> Controls: 10 out of 10 The controls are the best part of the Tony Hawk 2x Pro Skater. The configuration of the control is wonderfully comfortable and easy to get used to. In the days of Playstation, people thought that the controls were the best of all, but it seems that 2x has done a better job with Xbox control. Surprisingly, it is very easy to use the control lever to execute tricks. Activision has done a great job with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x controls. They have made the Xbox controller the best for Tony Hawk games. You will not be disappointed with the control style, and that is a guarantee. <br /> <br /> Game: 10 out of 10 Excluding the fact that Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater is basically Tony Hawk 1 and 2 together. The game is still incredibly fun. The game factor has changed a bit. This time, you get a LOT more air than in the first two games, and it's much easier to perform tricks. In Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater, each character has three race modes, which consists of the Tony Hawk 1 race, the Tony Hawk 2 race and the 2x race. The career of Tony Hawk 1 is quite easy because in the first game, you get NOTHING for air. The career of Tony Hawk 2 offers the same difficulty as the PlayStation version. The only difficulty that is applied to the 2x race, is to discover where all the elements are, but after doing that, the 2x race is not difficult at all. In the 2x race, there are a total of 3 levels, and the first two levels consist of finding the secret tapes, collecting S-K-A-T-E and doing whatever is necessary for that particular level. The third level of the three is the level of competition, in which you must obtain a certain amount of points to obtain the gold. In the first two levels, the secret tapes and the collection of the letters S-K-A-T-E, appear in both. In general, Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater still maintains the vibes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. <br /> <br /> Story: - <br /> <br /> Fun Factor: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater is by far the most fun Xbox game today. I played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2, and at the time I did not like them, but for some reason, Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater is really fun. There really is not much to say, except that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is by far the best game for Xbox today. One problem is that if you have already gone through the game once, you will play it a couple of times more, but it will be repetitive. <br /> <br /> Replay value: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk 2x professional skater offers a lot of play value. There are many tricks to unlock, and many character videos. In general, Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater has a lot of repetition value, mainly because it's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Best feature: you are not forced to listen to the horrible soundtrack of the game. The worst feature: the personalized soundtrack is a little messy. <br /> <br /> Final statement: Many people have complained in the past that they did not like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x because there is nothing new, but you should stop complaining because you get a lot of games by $ 50.00 <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 of 10. Sound: 8 of 10. Control: 10 of 10. Game: 10 of 10. Story: N / A Fun Factor: 10 of 10. <br /> < br /> Overall score: 9 out of 10.
