I just want to say that I loved finding these comments about the program. I have tried online searches to get information about the program in the past with no luck. I loved the show. I find it hard to motivate myself to exercise, but this program made it fun. As another comment said, it was not as complicated as the routines of today. It was an ideal workout that did the job! I would give anything to buy a copy of a single workout. I remember many of the movements but not almost all of them. Somebody, please, try to put it back on the air and also put it on DVD. It's so good to know that I was not the only one who loved that show! Thanks for making my day!
