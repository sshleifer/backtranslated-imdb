The best years of our life are often compared to It's a wonderful life. They should never be. Their only coincidence is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives. It is difficult to know what value individual life can have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? With what statistics do we have to live?). Also our feelings about the war have changed in 60 years. Progressively we have gone from thinking that war is just if the enemy is right to believe that no war is just, especially those that have been fought recently. <br /> <br /> I have been a pacifist all my life. . I oppose all war. Not long ago I had that proven position. It happened while I was at the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4 times the community in which I live. It is a powerful experience, moving through its covers. She had seen a lot of action. Someone gave me the right to be a pacifist and it was not bought at a low price. <br /> <br /> I can not see The best years of our life without thinking about things like the Lexington. <br /> <br /> Each of the three veterans paid their dues. And they also paid mine. <br /> <br /> None of them got off more easily than another. The Navy, the Air Force and the Army paid equally, albeit in different ways. Everyone had problems directly related to the war. And each one had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face their civil environment than to deal with the war, because everyone had to do it on their own. Everyone can understand and sympathize with the problem of others: ultimately, no one can help. <br /> <br /> The moving part of the movie (this could be the initial part of the spoiler) is the following information when one of the male leaders found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Do not hesitate, do it tomorrow. It's hard for Harold to believe that someone could love him when he had been a football hero and an athletic star before the war. But for your credit, Harold listens. <br /> <br /> The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Fix your relationship with your wife? Standard fair for 30/40 films. Derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film arises when we consider that the daughter feels the same for Derry. Real emotions of real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and feelings and honor. Sometimes I think we believe that these values ​​do not exist. Maybe that's why the people watching this movie have problems. <br /> <br /> Al is not exempt from advice that he does not want at all. Every time his boss speaks to him, Al is tied with knots. That's right. There are some things that can not be judged by occupation standards: they must be judged by immense general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are. <br /> <br /> All this leads to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought with such bravery are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon to be recycled: their function, courage and pride are as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucence that he does, doing it in form, in his mind, for the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> I gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few movies that I feel that way about. This is not a movie for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We have the privilege of dropping something as private as the lives of these wonderful people. We must be careful not to abuse that privilege.
