I really liked that movie. Great, realistic looking combat images for one thing and also a touching and genuine story. The calm and discreet way of the main character, Franta, makes it very pleasant. Human relations in history seemed very typical and possible than might be expected in times of war. The link between Franta and Carel shows the loyalty that war mates can have with each other and that is often described in books and interviews with veterans. The subtitles do not detract from the story and actually serve to underscore the problems that the Czech pilots had in the RAF. The postwar history is a great reminder that for many the suffering of World War II did not end in 1945, especially in the countries occupied by Russia. The cinematography was also very good. I wish I had seen it on the big screen.
