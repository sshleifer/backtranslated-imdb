I can not describe the feeling when I received this horrible VHS rental cassette in my hands about 20 years ago. Somehow I got my father to rent it to me and I saw him twice with my little brother. Yes, we have nightmares. This movie was originally classified as PG in the USA. In many other countries, including Finland, it was restricted to 18 or 16 years. The film was aimed at teenagers, but this must be the biggest movie rated by PG in history. There is no bad language or nudity in that. Originally made in 1981, it remained on the shelves for a couple of years before launch. <br /> <br /> This is a class A movie, a horror movie from the 80s, true and well made. A group of college girls decide to spend a night in a mausoleum, not knowing that a supernatural evil awaits ... <br /> <br /> You can almost smell the rotten flesh and feel the atmosphere of this movie. It's corny, completely stupid, but you can not make these movies anymore. Definitely, there is a certain feeling in this horror genre of the 80s. This is still really creepy and entertaining after all these years. <br /> <br /> The effects are only quality by Ellis Burman Jr and Thomas R. Burman. Makeup effects play an important role in this movie, otherwise, it would only have been a boring slasher for teenagers. <br /> <br /> Now it's available on DVD and it's a special edition DVD that includes some extras as well. The comment track is interesting. <br /> <br /> (In fact, this version is not so special after all, transfer below average on DVD, some glitches and scratches here and there) At first it was going to be released by The Blue Underground, but unfortunately it was canceled, so Shriek Show launched it without restoring the impression. Too bad!) <br /> <br /> Great date movie! <br /> <br /> Recommended! <br /> <br /> Note! Just give 8 out of 10 for the "nostalgic values", otherwise 6 of 10
