It's not a bad MOW. I expected another film based on women's themes, but I was pleasantly surprised by the element of suspense. Sure, some parts of the plot were pretty clumsy, but for the most part the movie kept me guessing. Was the nut bar connected to the ex-husband, someone in the tavern, or was it the man (person) she cut? Daniel Magder was excellent. I've seen him on Mom's on Strike and Guilt by Association, both MOW and he is very credible, especially because of the way he challenges his mother in the way that a pre-teen would act. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton also played the typical mother (ex-wife) with whom both men and women can relate. I was frustrated enough to seem real. <br /> <br /> See it if you missed it. Worth it.
