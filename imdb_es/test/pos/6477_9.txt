At this time, it is difficult to imagine how popular and how shocking was the impact of a Norwegian immigrant and chemist on the American public, and of the national tragedy in which his sudden death was seen in 1931. But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary individual who revolutionized and popularized college football and put on the map a small and dark Catholic university. <br /> <br /> I've heard clips from Rockne's famous talks and it's amazing how Pat O Brien perfectly captured the voice and the inflection. In what turned out to be the role of his career, Pat O'Brien captures the integrity and fighting spirit that was Rockne. Rockne has the help of Gale Page as Bonnie Stiles Rockne, who complained that her house was a training ground for Notre Dame, but never expelled anyone from her home. <br /> <br /> Rockne's first impact on football was as a Player with Notre Dame is not a coach. One fine day in the second half of a football game lost against the heavily favored Army, Rockne and his teammate Gus Dorais, played by Owen Davis, used the forward pass as an offensive weapon. Before that, football was simply a game in which you had bigger players for your side and you went through the defense. Rockne did not invent the advanced pass, but it became popular and football became a game of strategy and strength after that. <br /> <br /> Rockne also knew how to work with the media. Those well-publicized chats about him were not just to inspire his players. They were well publicized and in large part because of it, college football became an important sport in the Golden Age of Sports in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> Playing a small role, but key is Ronald Reagan. Like George Gipp, the first player Rockne trained to achieve greatness, Reagan not only got a good performance, but also forever a name that was useful in his later political career. That scene on the deathbed that Rockne swore was accurate became a Republican battle cry, as many of the Republican Party supporters came out to win one for the Gipper. of recovering President Ronald Reagan at the Notre Dame graduation with his old friend Pat O'Brien. Reagan always recognized O'Brien and Dick Powell of all the stars of the Warner Brothers era as those who were most kind and encouraging to a young player in the lot who tries to do good. <br /> <br /> Notre Dame Its prestige is due to Rockne. It is very possible that Notre Dame is a dark and small Catholic College without the reputation that football has given it. <br /> <br /> Although George Gipp and the later famous backfield of the Four Horsemen certainly had their place under the sun. It was Rockne who had the reputation. It is no coincidence that Warner Brothers was able to get Amos Alonzo Stagg, Glenn 'Pop' Warner, Howard Jones and William Spaulding, Rockne's contemporaries and coaches with a reputation in their own right for appearing in Knute Rockne, All American. It was the way to honor the man who was number one in his profession. <br /> <br /> I think more than soccer fans will enjoy Knute Rockne, All American. Although you could become one after watching the movie.
