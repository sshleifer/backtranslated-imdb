If there are people who do not like this movie, I do not think they are human. This film unfolds all the emotions and shows many aspects of Judith Light's character. Made in 1997, this is one of the best movies I've seen and really the movie that Judith Light has starred to make me a big fan of her. This movie, although sometimes you want to upset the child by trusting her so much, is incredibly moving. I cry at the end every time and I have a hard time doing that! The plot does not have much to do, but the performance provided by Judith Light is incredible. It looks beautiful all the time and in the end, you do not want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to you. In general, a movie is worth my highest praise! Thanks for doing so and redefining my opinion on the death penalty. I am looking forward to this movie being released on DVD or some other medium, as Lifetime is starting to broadcast some movies to customers. Although I do not have much hope for this because this happened almost 9 years ago, which is still hard to believe, since this movie is still rooted in my head after all this time.
