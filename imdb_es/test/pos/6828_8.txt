"Confirmed Dead" is an important episode of the series, as it features four new characters: the rescue team that Naomi contacted before Locke gave him a knife in the back. However, as the quote in my line summary indicates, your true purpose of being on the island may be something completely different. All the new characters seem intriguing (especially Miles, some kind of psychic / exorcist), but at this moment it is still too early to make solid judgments. I felt that this episode was a slight step down from "The Beginning Of The End" (no flash-forwards this time; short-term flashbacks in its place), but it still has its breathtaking moments and is filled with steam near the end. *** of 4.
