After finishing the Zero Woman series, I was looking forward to the Female Prisoner Scorpion series; Both based on Tooru Shinohara comics. Unfortunately, I could not see them in order, since this is the third in the series. <br /> <br /> It starts off very well as The Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) escapes from the police. Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) managed to put a bracelet on her, but she proceeded to cut off his arm and escape. If that's not bad enough, later a dog digs up his arm and they see him jog down the street before finding a place to enjoy his snack. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Scorpion returns to prison as if it were life. There is no picnic abroad. First, a local Yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to return it if it does not; and then the leader of the gang catches her when she gets rid of Tanida. But, they do not hold her for long before she escapes and seeks revenge. <br /> <br /> Soon they fall like flies. Some undoubtedly deserved it for wearing attire with shirt collars so big that they reached up to the shoulder. The lady (Reisen Lee) is delivered to avoid being killed. <br /> <br /> The police arrive at her last murder and traps her in the sewer. She is there for a week and the police discover that a friend (Yayoi Watanabe) has been providing her with food. (The story O Yuki (Watanabe) and his brother is a secondary plot that is very interesting, but only incidental to the film). They try to exhaust it, but this is The Scorpion, and she has some pending issues. <Br /> <br /> It's not the usual mix of sex and violence, this is a slow story that is beautiful at all times.
