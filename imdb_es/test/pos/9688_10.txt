These movies had to be the funniest I've seen in my entire life. I laughed so hard I almost threw up. After finishing the film, I laughed for an hour, thinking about the last thing that had been seen in the movie. It is definitely 100 times better than the first Jackass movie. I loved seeing them all together again. If you are apprehensive or do not like the childish mood risen, you will not like this movie. If you can enter with an open mind and not take it so seriously, then you will laugh. It's amazing that nobody died in this movie. Everything you see in this movie is so original and so different from the next that you will not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> Mike Webber
