I liked this movie. Unlike other thrillers, you learn to know the murderers very well. You can also meet the two detectives who hunt them. The killers are two high school kids. They are very intelligent and want to show that they are smarter than the police, so they plan the "perfect crime". We all know that this crime will not be perfect. What we do not know is whether they will be captured, or it may be just one of them, or even none. In a way, I expected both to get away with it, although I do not know if this was the intention of the cinema. <br /> <br /> The story is told in a pleasant way. You are starting to get to know the people involved. Sandra Bullock's character is nice, but she has her own secret, which works against her. Ben Chaplin is pretty good since Sam and the two kids are great. The scenes between them are the best scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> I think you can say that the movie is quite good and not as predictable as you think. For a nice evening with a movie, 'Murder by Numbers' is a good idea.
