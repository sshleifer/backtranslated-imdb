My favorite story about 'Tales from the Crypt'. Brion Jones was born to play the role of the maniac lumberjack, the crazy maker Steve Dixon. Having seen it before in Tango & Cash, I can say that this actor never got the proper credit he deserved. A jealous husband is offended because his wife shows interest in a young worker with whom he has just worked. And you know when Dixon discovers there will be hell to pay! The young worker Ted (Billy Wirth) receives an almighty beating from Dixon, leaving him blind. How is a blind woodcutter supposed to work? A tribute to black humor if there ever was one! The cast stars also do a good job of supporting Ted when Dixon, when he has his initial suspicions that his wife wants another man. Dixon's behavior makes the bond between colleagues stronger. He even told himself that he became a different man when he got married. Although Ted should have done the wise thing and left when he could!
