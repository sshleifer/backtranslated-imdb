I saw this movie when I was a kid and I've been looking for it ever since. It is classified as Cabin in The Sky, Stormy Weather and Carmen Jones as a must-see in films that show the incredible talent of African-Americans. In the 1960s, local TV stations in Los Angeles would have a movie of the week and some stations would show the same movie for 5 days. One of them was Porgy and Bess, and my whole family would be there all 5 nights in front of the TV and only moved to the commercials. South Pacific, Oklahoma and The Sound of Music are all musical classics that you can find in any video store. It would be a shame to let this collection of some of the best talents that America offered be forgotten or locked in a vault. Make the movie available to the public.
