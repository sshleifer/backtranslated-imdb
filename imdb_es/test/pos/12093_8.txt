The Turkish-German director Faith Akın ("Head-On" and "The Edge of Heaven") follows the German musician and the composer "Head-On" from the soundtrack Alexander Hacke from Einstürzende Neubauten to Istanbul for this documentary that goes deep in the modern musical scene from city of arabesque to indie rock and was exhibited out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival 2005. <br /> <br /> Alexander Hacke becomes a friendly guide while traveling through Istanbul with a studio mobile recording and a microphone in his hand where he encounters and records characters such as the classic rocker Erkin Koray, the rapper Ceza, the Kurdish singer Aynur Doğan, the arabesque singer Orhan Gencebay and the pop star Sezen Aksu, as well as the rock bands Baba Zula, Duman and Replikas. <br /> <br /> The director has assembled a diverse collection of popular artists and pioneering acts of what was at that time a highly competitive restricted list to give an eclectic description of modern Turkish music seen from the streets of its capital cultural, that will be charming and entertaining although sometimes it seems a bit hasty and out of focus. <br /> <br /> "Music can reveal everything about a place".
