I entered "The Night of the Hunted" without knowing what to expect. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> It is essentially a thriller / mystery in which this girl who can not remember anything is "rescued" by a guy who passes by. The two become fast friends and lovers and, together, they try to discover what is happening with her. Through some vague flashbacks and somber memories, they finally reach the bottom and the end is pretty good. <br /> <br /> I really liked the setting of this: a desolate and postmodern Paris is the backdrop With many gray skies and tall buildings. Very metropolitan. Groovy soundtrack and a lot of nudity. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly it was done in 1980; It seems a bit ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
