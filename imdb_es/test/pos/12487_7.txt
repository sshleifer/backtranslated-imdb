The extraordinarily adorable Suzy Delair plays a sculptural artist obsessed with succeeding in the theater. Her husband and companion, played by Bernard Blier, is a compound but jealous man. When he discovers in a less than preferable way that his striking wife has planned an appointment with a lusty old businessman with the intention of advancing his career, he loses all control and threatens the businessman with murder. Now, at that point, I must stop describing the film because it skates on such fine ice with its twists, revelations, ambiguities and suspense that implying any of them would endanger it. I'm not sure how good or bad this French police procedure is that emanates from the singing and dancing community, although it's certainly interesting that what we do know is who did not do it. We just do not know who did it. <br /> <br /> The story depends on the procedure of following the clues, where the ideal alibis fail and where the fabrications and tricks created with caution disintegrate. Interestingly, this is a suspense film in which the suspense is generated despite the knowledge that traditionally would be thought too soon. <br /> <br /> Quay of the Goldsmiths is the least obscure of Henri-Georges Clouzot's films. It is not as sinister as the shocking Les Diaboliques, as tragic as the fascinating Wages of Fear or as mysterious as Le Corbeau. Perhaps it is due to the vibration of the dance halls and theater stages of the 1940s in France, which function as the setting for this thriller. <br /> <br /> Clouzot understands and approves his characters, even the most rotten. A few, where he has a more vengeful streak with his other films. Where he could have understood the intriguing women in Les Diabolique or the truckers who sink to the level of risking a horrible death to expel themselves from the miserable life in The Wages of Fear, there is not necessarily support or agreement on the part of the filmmaker, since that these are characters that clearly made the direct decisions that determine their destiny. All the characters in this settlement film have scenes and moments that appeal to us, including the tough and cold detective played by Louis Jouvet, who cares for his young adopted son in the midst of all the problems and despair that occur in his life in any moment. with the fall of a hat. <br /> <br /> There is humor and a carefree sensuality, the latter mainly by Delair, which neutralizes the pressure to some extent. Clouzot was quietly practicing his craft, patient until he performed his relentless later films, in which he would not allow his audience to forgive the tension.
