After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is that it was worth the wait! "Rush in Rio" may be the best rock DVD that exists. I'm not kidding. Is incredible! All the fuss that the sound is horrible is true, however, it does not make the concert unappealable. I find that it makes you feel like you are really in Rio watching the concert of the audience. That's one of the reasons why I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you are really there. Also, Geddy, Alex and Neil have never been in better shape. Geddy's voice is impeccable, the interpretation of Alex's guitar is still incredible and Neil, there are no words to say. The camera work in this concert was very good, I must say. We got a good look at everything that was happening on stage and in the audience. Congratulations to the cameramen! Anyway, enough of my ravages! Go see "Rush in Rio" for yourself. You will be surprised. I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
