"The devil in the dark" is the favorite episode of William Shatner. It is also one of my favorite episodes. The program is pure Star Trek because it deals with one of the main themes of the series: respect for other forms of life. I do not think you can get a clearer example of one of the most interesting ideas in the program. In this episode, Kirk and his team have to face a monster that is killing the miners on a distant planet. History is an excuse to explore the right of humans to destroy creatures that are a vital part of the environment. Today's concerns with environmental causes make the show more relevant now than ever. It is extremely well written and performed with gusto by our beloved cast. A memorable sequence implies that Spock joins the monster's mind. A lot of tension between Spock and Kirk (they want to solve the problem using different methods) adds to the fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy do their best work here.
