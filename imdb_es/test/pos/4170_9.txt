My friends and they went through a period of time in which we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good thing that came out of this was this movie, "Take it to the limit" Just when the movie started, we could see that we were in a true classic. The music is probably made by white guys from Colorado, but it sounds like the rap of the early 90s. The star of the series, the actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad guy very well, especially wearing a great buzz throughout the film . This film is based on climbing, and I'm not a climber, but I even think it's very funny when they have the climber struggling to climb and there is a guy in the background who is basically climbing the "cliff". You do not want to miss this movie, you can watch the same clips over and over again. You will have surprises at every step. You will find yourself quoting the unforgettable lines. I recommend this movie to anyone. Take it snow. Disclaimer: this movie is wrong, but that's what makes it great
