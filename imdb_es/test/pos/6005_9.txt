This production was quite well made for an original television, providing a very appropriate original inclination in the work of Swift. To make the story of the frame work well, the movie begins when Gulliver comes home. Everyone who has read the book knows that it will happen anyway. The frame story of the book has Gulliver's crazed confusion in sections. For example, he is horrified that he will trample small people in England because he has just returned from a land of giants. But the movie has all the book sections within a long journey. When Gulliver narrates his trips, the cuts of edition of England to the trip are very effective. I confess that I found them intrusive and irritating at first, then they became natural. In the end, in addition, they have become a welcome addition to history. While he tells his adventures to an increasingly large audience, more and more people listen to his fascinating fantasy, although they doubt its truth. For example, his hatred of the dirty Yahoos and the admiration of the pure logic of the fourth section is well manifested when defending his own sanity. The relationship between events in England and similar events or scenes in the story is very effective. For example, filming the fabric of the table to suggest the movement of dragging a group of boats is inspired. The addition of the Gulliver family threatened by the lascivious doctor works well. Swift only insinuates this by making the suffering wife protest against future travel. It becomes a natural part of this story. The casting and acting were competent at all times. Some papers were exemplary. The mad wizard of Omar Sharif is excellent. The little Emperor of O'Toole is dodging deliciously towards senility. Many specific complaints presented by other writers here seem to me simple personal preferences, which, after all, is what we are here for. I read the abbreviated version several times a year from the fourth grade. I may have escaped from the full version to a college class, but I have read it several times since then. And I had to start over when I started reading about this movie. While Danson's version is superior to any previous film, it does not replace the book. However, I think it will bring many readers to the book. If you have not read the book, enjoy this movie and then go to the source. If you appreciate the satire on it, find "A modest proposal" by Swift and his "Drapier Lyrics". Both are satires that attack the miserable treatment of Ireland and the Irish during the time of Swift. The drapier protests cheap and inflated copper coins that are thrown in Ireland. These were Wood's light coins, which were not good for the nominal value in the payment of taxes and official debts. The clamor of Swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another battered British territory, the American colonies. The universal satire in Swift's book and this movie simply makes fun; They can not change human nature. Give Danson's tortured experiences a chance. I think it will be stimulating and entertaining.
