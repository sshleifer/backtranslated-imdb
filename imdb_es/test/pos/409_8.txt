Red Skelton (in her first leading role) plays Wally Benton, who plays 'The Fox' on a radio show. He writes the mysteries of the murder and how 'The Fox' solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform someone's perfect murder. He kidnaps Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Gray). He tells Benton to write the perfect murder ... or that his girlfriends get it ... <br /> <br /> Very funny and funny movie. Fast (only 77 minutes), a good script and a perfect casting really shows it. Skelton is very good in his first leading role: very funny, fast, handsome and intelligent. Veidt is excellent as the evil Jones. Rutherford and Gray are very funny like the brides of Skelton. The three face perfectly: their verbal combat is the highlight of this photo. It's also fun to see Eve Arden in a small role. <br /> <br /> It's worth your time.
