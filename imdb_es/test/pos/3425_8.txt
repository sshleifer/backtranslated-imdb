I watched this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I came in with the assumption that if it was starring Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank, it had to be at least decent. Well, after a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite satisfied with the final product. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the accented English of Afrikaaner and Xhosa (?) of some of the actors was somewhat difficult to understand but I liked watching "Waking Ned Devine", "Trainspotting" or any other movie with actors with a heavy accent that I adjusted after about 15 minutes. And I was trying to figure out why Hilary Swank was supposed to be South African and it sounded like she was trying to put an accent but it sounded very American ... like she was making a weak attempt to put the accent. But later in the movie, as more is revealed about his character and how he moved to the United States as a teenager, you begin to understand how he might have lost something or most of his accent. So it started to make sense that only certain words could have an Afrikaner touch. <br /> <br /> I know it's a bit weak for a movie to use education, but one of the great things about this movie is that it was interesting to see a dramatization of a Truth and Reconciliation trial. I heard about the T & R process in South Africa after the fall of apartheid, but I really did not know how it worked. <br /> <br /> The final verdict is that although some of the scenes felt a bit designed, this was generally a very strong movie. The final sequence in which the "truth" comes out was the strong end that all the films expect. A must for anyone who cares about what happens outside their borders.
