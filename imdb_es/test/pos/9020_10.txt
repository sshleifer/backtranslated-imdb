I watched this movie a week ago and I had to persuade my friend to come with me because this movie seems to be receiving such bad reviews. Of course it is not a 'Traffic of people' or 'Blocking, actions ...' but in no way is a failure. I think the fact that there are so many big budget movies at the moment means that it has been ignored, but it should not be like that. I recognize that he intends to do what he wants to do: entertain us for an hour and a half and let us feel happy and happy. I would much rather go to see "La mumia", which seems boring. And no, I'm not a teenager. Do not listen to the critics, the Star Wars fans did not. It's worth watching this movie, just to see the gorgeous Luke of Lacey and Rupert Penry-Jones. Go see it!
