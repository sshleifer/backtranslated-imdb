A few thoughts before reaching the heart of the film: 1) I had never seen so many breasts discovered in a movie, shown in so many non-sexual scenes, it was strange; 2) Joseph Fiennes, where have you been? You loved us in * Elizabeth * and * Shakespeare in Love *, and then you left for a while. The mainstream of the United States wants more! Well, I'm a university professor of English, I've read this work many times and this is probably the best film version I've seen of her. While the individual aspects of other productions may have stood out, this is the overall package that has been well crafted. Pacino is not Olivier, but he does not need to be, so get over it! The cinematography of the film is impressive and not only because of the naked breasts. Venice is portrayed in a surprising way, and gives you the feeling of really being there. The residential island of Portia is incredibly beautiful, and the lighting is always tinted in the right way for the appropriate mood of the scenes. <br /> <br /> The antisemetism in this movie / game is hard to see, especially at the end. The fact that Pacino has knelt and clung to his religious artifact is perhaps the most powerful moment of his filming since "The Godfather Part III * (when Michael's daughter is murdered on the steps of the opera.) Is the work antisemetic? Of course, is * Othello * racist? Of course, take it for what it is: a comment on the Elizabethan era, not a comment today. <br /> <br /> Fiennes is underused in the movie, but It's a pleasure to see it Women in the film are fine Nobody really stood out here, but they blend in nicely with the landscape Jeremy Irons and Pacino are excellent in the two juiciest roles, opponents to the end. I was underestimated (I still feel chills when I hear his voice from * The Lion King *), and Pacino is Pacino.
