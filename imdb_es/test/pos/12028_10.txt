Spend an hour watching this brilliant Dan Finnerty and his "Dan Band" playing his special in Bravo is the most pleasant time I've spent watching television. This young man (Dan) is an incredible talent, as a singer, performer and even a dancer. It can range from the most popular pop ballad songs, all sung only by women, to hip-hop, rock, and songs written for women. This boy can do anything. I've seen it live at least 11 times, so I did not expect how well its program would fit into a television or movie format, but all reservations disappeared instantly when the program started due to the overwhelming quality of Dan's star . A favor and look at this, or better yet, buy it.
