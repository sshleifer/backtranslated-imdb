Even if I had never seen or heard of Georgetown, CO, this would be a sweet little movie. But my dad was born and raised there, and those are my uncle's horses that you see pulling the sled! So this movie is very special to me. Many of the interiors are shot in buildings and houses that I recognize, and they are very realistic. The story is a little hokey, but Georgetown is that kind of magical place where things like that COULD happen. John Denver was a better actor than many people give him credit for. Mary Wickes interprets the kind of "lady of common sense with a lot of cheek" that she played so well in many other films, especially "White Christmas". Usually, I do not go outside in the winter, so I like to watch this movie at Christmas to "dizzy" until my next trip.
