This film is fully immersed in the surrealist kingdom of Lynch and Jodorowsky, with a strangely convincing atmosphere that calms the viewer with the dreamlike intensity of their images. <br /> <br /> The narrative is to be tasted: the narrator is trapped behind a painting (adjacent to the bed), which often speaks for it, vocalizing his wishes and reasoning. Yes, Beardsley would sound like that. <br /> <br /> There are some flaws, but their strengths outweigh their weaknesses. The sequence with the woman getting out of bed and crawling on the floor, trying to escape, will leave you breathless. <br /> <br /> The film has an air of the end of the century; and it should be read as a disarming cry from the bowels of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and bathe in it.
