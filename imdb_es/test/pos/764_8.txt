Me, being a fan of Rupert Grint, I rented this movie a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written movie with a lot of great actors. It was entertaining and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his best-known character Ron Weasley. His subtle interpretation of Ben and the excellent performance of everyone else made this movie very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Ben, a very shy boy with an extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. Find one and become the, I suppose you could call "assistant" Evie, a retired actress. At first, it's just a way to earn some money. But after a while, he and Evie seem to develop a friendship. Evie helps Ben out of his shell a little and makes him have fun and be happy with himself, and in the end they both seem to need each other. <br /> <br /> Whether you are a Rupert Grint fan or not, this movie is really entertaining, with some very nice moments. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors.
