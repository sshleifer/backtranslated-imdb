Good. To enjoy this silent comedy, you MUST suspend disbelief about the main starting point of the movie. If you can not, chances are you're more likely to get this much lower movie. Charlie Chase has a great sobriety and his wife has a nose large enough to have her own area code. Unknown to each other, both have been saving to undergo surgery to correct these defects. Apparently, plastic and dental surgery was better in the 1920s because none of them seemed to have any need to recover from these major surgeries and they looked smart right away !! Okay, remember I said you ignored this, right? Well, you must also ignore the hard-to-believe idea that they could both meet and have no idea that the other is their spouse. Well, now that you've allowed yourself to accept these two silly premises, the movie really gets really good. <br /> <br /> Charlie gives her a pass and she gives him a pass. Both are shocked and excited because nobody has considered them really attractive. Then, due to this new vanity, they agree to go on a date. But, they both sneak back home - not wanting their husbands to know! Anyway, they meet later and feel very attracted to each other. But what about poor husbands supposedly at home? Well, both learn that the other is married and both anticipate that their marriages will result in a divorce because they really want to be together. At the end of the film, Charlie realizes that the woman is really his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence in which he plays both the boyfriend and the old husband, changing clothes and putting false teeth when he plays the husband . It really is a laughing riot to see him jump in and out of the room when he seems to be fighting with another person! You really have to see it to believe it. However, the wife sees an ad with the before and after photos of Charlie and knows what is happening. In the end, both feel quite foolish!
