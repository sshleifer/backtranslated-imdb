I think this film has become an important record of the most frightening aspect of the East German regime: the imprisonment of its people for what the regime called its antifascist protective wall. It is a document of despair and courage that should not be lost. However, I would like to comment on the actual location of this escape. It did not happen in Berlin or its surroundings as some respondents assume and has nothing to do directly with the Berlin Wall. The escape balloon flew over the Iron Curtain, which not only divided Germany but divided all of Europe at that time. The balloon took off from PÃ¶ssneck, 170 miles southwest of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and flew 14 miles to Naila in Bavaria and freedom in West Germany. The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year. While the balloon flight created an entertaining suspense film, it should remain a monument to those who lost their lives while trying to escape from East Berlin, other parts of the GDR or other Soviet-controlled states.
