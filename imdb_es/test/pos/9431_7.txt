Not so bad the entry into the series, loaded with propaganda war, but the sincerity of Rathbone and Bruce keeps me happy. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty fantastic story from start to finish, how many McGuffins are there? Holmes (and Moriarty independently) retrieving the Dancing Men code without coding so fast was Amazing Watson. Why did not you get surprised? The publication that explained the vision of the pump / enlarger tickled me, it was just the kind of cheap trick Universal would play; once again he reminded me that they did not expect people to be seeing this critically more than 60 years later. This (and I think all of Universal's other potboilers in this period) were to be seen once or twice and forgotten. Maybe they should have realized that, basically, people do not change, that what was entertaining for ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain a select group now (2005) and it would fit the script and the sets! <br /> <br /> Lionel Atwill was reviewing his case in Hollywood's rape court at about this time, I wonder if it was that or the particularly effective makeup that made him look as gaunt as Moriarty? <br /> <br /> The important thing about SW is that this was the first Holmes film directed by Roy William Neill, I think he directed all the rest and produced all but one, thus establishing a wonderful environmental continuity.
