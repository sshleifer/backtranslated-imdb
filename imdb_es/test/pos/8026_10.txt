This is the classic case of an excellent film that is being seen by the American public simply because it did not have Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger as protagonist: Adrian Quinn has a better dual performance, it is true that he heard it double. The performance in this movie that either of you has achieved in your careers! Well, anyway, now to the review ... <br /> <br /> The assignment is loosely based on the story of Carlos the Jackal, a radical of the 1970s who terrorized Europe for years before being finally arrested by French agents. In this adaptation, a United States naval officer (Adrian Quinn) is on leave in Israel when he is arrested by the Mossad (Isreal's anti-terrorism intelligence agency) and interrogated due to the fact that he looks EXACTLY like the jackal (This is the extremely cheesey part of the movie, but believe me, it does not detract from the great value of this movie). However, when it is discovered that Mr. Ramírez is not the Jackal, he is recruited by a hardened CIA agent named Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, who performs his usual mysterious figure of government authority, but in a great way) that He has spent his life hunting the Jackal, and the next series of events will captivate anyone who watches this movie; is full of great performances, without all the clichés of action movies and a single line, and a great plot that will surprise everyone. . The three main men, Quinn, Sutherland and Kingsley, take this film much further than their modest budget would have allowed someone else to fill their shoes. Also congratulations to the director and his staff, the angles of the camera and the cinematography are first class, especially in the action scenes. The Assignment is better than anyone who rented it could wait, it's a pity that the movie was bad enough at the box office, otherwise we could see a sequel to this great espionage thriller. <br /> <br /> 9/10 stars, this reviewer HIGHLY recommends it to all potential viewers!
