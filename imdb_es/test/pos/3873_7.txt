I saw this movie for lack of something else at that time. Quickly the film caught me with the depth of the characters and the subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars. <br /> <br /> I will not give any spoilers to the plot or the result, but most of the characters had at least some redemptive value. Until the last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Often, you can pick up the formula and predict the direction of a story. I could not do that with this movie. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this as one of the best movies of this genre.
