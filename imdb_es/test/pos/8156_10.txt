This is an excellent movie for everyone. A moving experience full of real life emotion. There are lessons to be learned here about love, sex, work, religion and American culture, regardless of one's sexual preference. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is also a scathing accusation of the belief of the Mormon (Church of Latter Day Saints) system, any conservative faith could easily take its place. But it is a little ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by Mormons in very clear terms. Here is a faith that sent for generations that believers practice polygamy! And these true believers just abandoned this practice because they were forced to do it by the federal government so that Utah would join the Union. Talk about a unique form of hypocrisy! <br /> <br /> The sex scenes portrayed in the unrated version are tasteful and surprisingly brief. There is nothing here that offends someone with an open mind. <br /> <br /> What this film makes so obvious is that homosexuality is perfectly natural for homosexual people, as is heterosexuality for heterosexual people! While love and sex are obviously very different needs, it is absolutely beautiful, beyond words, when both occur at the same time between two adults! Deep erotic love is one of the most precious gifts of life! My congratulations to the filmmakers for a job well done!
