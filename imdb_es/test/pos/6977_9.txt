The newborn gentleman says goodbye to her husband for non-specific reasons that are apparently related to themselves. On the way, she becomes entangled with Caan, the former soccer star with brain damage, and Duvall, a crazy but abusive cop. The kind of film that could only have been generated in the 60s. It is worth seeing for its plot without formulas and for the first performances of future stars. <br /> <br /> The disappointing resolution does not take away much of the rest of the movie, which shows an interesting part of life.
