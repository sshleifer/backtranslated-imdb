Fantastic movie! One of the best black movies ever made. Bad guys, bad girls, a jewelry heist, a twisted morality, a kidnapping, everything is here. Jean Servais has a face that would make Bogart feel proud and the rest of the cast is full of character actors who seem to know they are in for something good. Get some popcorn and have fun.
