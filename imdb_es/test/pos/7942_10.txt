Alexander Nevsky (1938) is a brilliant piece of cinematographic propaganda. The people of Russia are threatened by two main enemies, the Mongols and the Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. In order to unite the war, the rival Princes in the Russian Kingdom, Nevsky takes charge and fights the lesser of two evils (The Teutonics). This influential film was copied many times and still remains to this day. The soundtrack of the composer Prokiev and the direction of Eisentstein are a sight and a sound for the sight. Many years later, John Milius used many of the scenes of films, pieces and disguises of this film and incorporated them to Conan. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite lines of Conan was taken from this movie. "It is not the strength of the iron in a weapon, but the strength of the person who handles it, what matters." The comparisons are unmistakable. The armor worn by James Earl Jones and the Teutonic Knight Leader is virtually identical. A true tribute paid from one director to another. <br /> <br /> I give Alexander Nevsky one of my highest recommendations. The film plays as the final act of Richard III. The presence of Prince Alexander on the screen is truly amazing.
