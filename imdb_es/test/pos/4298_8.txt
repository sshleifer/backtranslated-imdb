SEPARATE LIES is an elegant, intelligent and stimulating film, and I could have seen Tom Wilkinson forever on the screen. The locations in the English countryside, the wonderful London locations, the interiors, the smart wardrobes and, of course, the writing and dialogue made SEPARATE LIES an exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> That said, and perhaps this is only one From the American point of view, as the British are much more sophisticated in the handling of sexual adventures, it was difficult for me to see Tom Wilkinson just waiting As his wife walks happily on her way on a sexual journey that really brings her little joy, she creates a lot of despair for her husband, with the cad that Rupert Everett is. Yes, I saw the defects of Wilkinson's character, his goal of perfection, the desire for everything in his place, but in Emily Watson, he should have deepened in his true character and solid goodness, to realize what he has thrown away. br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson turns SEPARATE LIES into a powerful movie by watching him experience all the pain, shame and despair on the screen when his wife leaves with another man. And he makes the trip in SEPARATE LIES to understand their faults, hug his wife, despite everything that has happened, and take her back to London. Bravo, Tom!
