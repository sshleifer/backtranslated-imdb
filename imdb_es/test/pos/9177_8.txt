Love is hard to find in this fast-food society we live in, so the man named Hitch has a duty to help men find love with women they are more than madly in love with. His rules are that he only helps you find love and not just some casual sex, which seems to be a great thing, but soon the word gets out and people start to get the wrong idea of ​​what he does, what that begins to complicate the relationship with the woman. I just found out that he is madly in love. <br /> <br /> - I have to say it's very nice to see Will Smith in a movie that does not have him trying to save the world from aliens or robots. There are no effects of falling jaw nor is he showing his reinforced body. He is just a normal human being in this movie that was really nice. He does not necessarily stretch his acting muscles in this movie, but again the story does not require that, but anyway it was nice to see him relaxed and not show his torn body to make those of us without six packs of envy. Your character here is like with all your nice, witty and very charming characters, which is something that almost all the characters in this strange love story seem to share. The character of Kevin James is just a normal boy who needs help to connect with the girl of his dreams that really makes you feel for him and supports him every step of the way. the only character that hurt me was the character of Mendez because he is so cold and calculates that it is hard to believe that Smith could fall in love with her. I guess you'll love a challenge. <br /> <br /> -Now this is the part of the review where I'll make a joke about how I would never need Hitch because I'm a gamer, but I just finished writing about 16 reviews for another website and I'm still working on a small project, so I'm a little tired at the moment. While the film is full of charm and friendly characters with funny lines, it slowly falls into the sea of ​​romantic formula films in which after the great scene in which the terrible secret comes to light, everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before. But hey, there are about 4000 movies about the disadvantage of overcoming adversity, so I guess that one more movie with a predictable ending that has been done almost to death does not cause much damage. I also really like the message of the film because in the end you do not need a formula to get the right girl, just be yourself and everything will fall into play, which is the theme of the film and why it works so well. I am sure that if he had realized that the character of James stays with the girl after having followed everything that the character of Smith said, it would have to be a fairly empty movie, but in its current form it works very well. <br /> <br /> -Although predictable, this is a perfect date movie. It's sweet, fun and romantic, so anyone who watches this movie on a date should receive it after it's over. and by some I mean sex
