Excellent silent version of the story of Francois Villon. Although it is remade in the thirties as IF I AM KING, with Frank Lloyd directing, the scripts of Preston Sturges and Ronald Colman starring, this version is even better. Barrymore, with a cohort of comedians, plays the comic fool and the depressed wine villon with an enthusiasm that Colman could not match. Photography is striking for its beauty and innovation and the cast of support, particularly Conrad Veidt in its US premiere, the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day, and the support comics, Slim Summerville and Hank Mann, steal all the scenes in which they find each other. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that Barrymore has done so few first-class comedies. Among his sound films, only his leadership in TWENTETH CENTURY and his secondary role in MIDNIGHT can be compared with this, and those are highlighted only by his excellent voice. In this silent film, Barrymore must tell his story without the benefit of words, and he does, alternately, hilariously unrecognizable as the King of fools and tenderly as Villon in love. It even comes to jump in the style of Fairbanks, the most convincing. It also allows your cast of support to have their share of glory, addressing this ensemble that works like any comic with talent of the time. <br /> <br /> Finally, a few words about Alan Crosland, a director known today just for directing the first conversation feature, THE JAZZ SINGER in the same year it was released. Crosland was a careful, innovative and delightfully original director, and it is a pity that they do not know more about his works. Perhaps this film, much more interesting as a film than his best known work, is his introduction to his other talents. If so, you could do much worse.
