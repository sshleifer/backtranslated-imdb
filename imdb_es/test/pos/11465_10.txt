This is a great horror movie for people who do not want all that dripping and sensationalism. This movie has equal amounts of horror, suspense, humor and even a little light nudity, but nothing important. Linnea Quigley is not exaggerated as she was in "Return of the Living Dead", where she danced naked in a crypt, but is still essentially the same whore character. Cathy Podewell is a chaste, virginal character before moving on to "Dallas," and we're also introduced to Amelia [soon Mimi] Kinkade, the sexy and sinister dark matron wannabe in the house. While she and Linnea are possessed and take over the house, they reanimate the bodies of their dead friends to scare the survivors. I've heard many people compare this movie with "The Evil Dead", but in any case, this movie is a rival for that in the same way Freddie rivaled Jason. This series of films is far superior to that!
