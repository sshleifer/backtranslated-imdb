This is a movie that will leave you thinking, is it him or not? While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending, it gives the audience room to think and interpret it from the signs. This is my interpretation and theory, and I think it is very solid. <br /> <br /> First, here is the plot. One day, Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the middle of a busy train station. After trying to help a woman of the robbers, they arrest him and send him to Bellevue, and then transfer him to the hospital of Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges). Prot talks freely about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to make a report about the Earth. Naturally, he is classified as a madman and is locked in a room with a low level of security. He befriends the other patients and convinces them quickly of his story. In fact, he tells them that he can take a person with him. Soon, Dr. Powell begins to question the folly of Prot and, as the plot progresses, it is increasingly difficult to prove that Prot is wrong. <br /> <br /> In the end, Dr. Powell learns that Prot is Robert Porter, an intelligent man who worked in a slaughterhouse in New Mexico, when his wife and daughter were murdered. Prot says he plans to go to K-Pax at a precise moment on the fifth anniversary of the killings. Time comes and goes, and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and he is never found again. <br /> <br /> To my theory: Prot is not crazy. Prot is from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a friend of Prot. On one of Prot's previous visits to Earth, Robert was a child, learning about his father's constellations. Prot and Robert became best friends. After the death of his family, and Robert killing the murderer, Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot is in K-Pax at that moment, but rushes backwards (in multiples of the speed of light) to stop Robert. So Prot takes Robert's thought, taking his body so to speak. A while later, Prot (still inhabiting Robert's body) arrives in New York and is locked up. When he goes to K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he must leave Robert's body behind. So, now we have the catatonic Robert. <br /> <br /> Explanations or clues: <br /> <br /> THE KNOWLEDGE OF PROTECTING THE PLANETS AROUND THE POUND: As Prot says, any child knows his own system. Only a few people on Earth had an idea of ​​the system, and Prot added to his knowledge. Robert Porter, although intelligent and knows his constellations, was not an astrophysicist. <br /> <br /> DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT: It's true. Prot could have left the institute at any time, but he did not choose too. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell are: "Now that you've found Robert, take care of him." Prot would probably stay there to secure a place for Robert when he left. <br /> <br /> SUPERHUMAN SKILLS: It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provides its usual K-Pax ratio, but no earthly reason was given. It was also mentioned that Prot received extremely high doses of medication without any effect. <br /> <br /> HELPING PATIENTS: Throughout the film, you see Prot helping other patients (or patients who discuss Prot's suggestions) to a Better Healthy World. While the psychologist resists the help of Prot, Dr. Powell speaks at the end of the film about the new lives that patients carry. <br /> <br /> THE SPRINKLER SCENE: The sprinkler is associated with Porter's house in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is she trying to protect Powell's daughter from that horrible fate? I have a different point of view. Porter was supposed to have committed suicide in a river. In fact, Prot (under hypnosis) is very worried about Robert. I think Prot associates the danger with the water, not with the sprinkler. He is trying to protect the girl from watery death, as he did with Robert. <br /> <br /> HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell feels that, under hypnosis, he can discover the true identity of Prot, but while Prot gives a lot of information, he never did. abandons his personality Prot and the homeland of K-Pax. <br /> <br /> THE SECURITY CHAMBER: Why does the camera simply give up for no apparent reason? <br /> <br /> MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES: First, Prot disappeared for a few days on his journey north. Curious, patients are not alarmed at all. In fact, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Naturally, the most revealing disappearance is that of Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does it disappear at about the same time, but the only clue left is your winning essay. <br /> <br /> This is just my humble theory. You can conclude what you want. You can take Dr. Powell's theory that Prot was simply a person that Robert Porter took to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would be giving up too many holes in the plot.
