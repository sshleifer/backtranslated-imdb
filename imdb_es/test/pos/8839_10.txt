When the masterful version of "The Thing" by John Carpenter was released in the summer of 1982, it was criticized by critics and bombed at the box office. The audiences could not handle another 'bad' foreigner, they wanted ET. Your long-term loss <br /> <br /> I would love to see this great movie on the big screen. This is a movie that was far ahead of its time; Now he has influenced a new generation of filmmakers, showing his traces in things like "Se7en", "Alien 3" and even "The X Files", which without certainty were ripped off page by page. And the structure, which prevents the development of the character in favor of the incredible SFX, is commonplace in today's blockbuster films. <br /> <br /> Carpenter shows the same skills he perfected in "Halloween" by using the camera to create a disturbing and claustrophobic image. atmosphere. The performances are fine, and the ending is fantastic, still unique today. <br /> <br /> A paranoid masterpiece.
