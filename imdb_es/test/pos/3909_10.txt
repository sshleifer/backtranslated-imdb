I thought this movie was pretty good! Well, maybe I had some scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but I've seen a lot more pathetic movies that have much higher ratings than this one! Many films today have been remade to a more modern version and there is nothing wrong with that, keeps the story alive. I do not think this movie was pathetic at all and I do not just say it because I'm a big fan of Chad Michael Murray, but because I enjoyed it. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and I enjoyed it very much, and we were talking about it all the way home! I would tell my other friends to watch this movie. I'm not saying it's the best movie I've seen at the box office, but it's much better than some people say it is. Everyone has their own opinions, so if you really want to know if it's good or bad, look at it and then decide.
