One of the myths of the era of the first sounds is that they could not do westerns because they had trouble recording sound in the location. In fact, it was the financial constraints of depression that temporarily eliminated gender, at least in the "A" budget range. However, in the period between 1929 and 1931, before the economic recession had really begun, the Western "A" flourished, among the notable examples that included The Virginian, Billy the Kid and Cimarron. The Big Trail was perhaps the greatest of all? a gigantic Western pioneer filmed in an early widescreen process, appropriately titled grandeur. Thanks to a recent DVD release, we can now see the widescreen version next to the full screen that was shot simultaneously. <br /> <br /> The director was Raoul Walsh, a man for whom the spirit of adventure was in vast open-air views. And so, in many ways, a perfect choice. It makes great use of the wider frame to show the western landscape in its most impressive form. Very typical of Walsh are several shots towards the beginning, like the one that a woman is cutting firewood. Most of the screen is completely filled with wagons and other disorder, but in a corner we see the desert extending invitingly. When the wagon train starts up, the open plain gradually reveals itself to us, and the wagons move away like stage curtains. These shots are not as effective in the full-screen version, but in the larger canvas, Walsh's expression of the outdoors was never better. <br /> <br /> But there is an unfortunate disadvantage in this. When it comes to dialogue scenes, Walsh's tendency is to place the actors in the middle of the shot, as if they were in an imaginary full screen picture. Does the extra width become that? extra. It may seem logical at first, because it means that in terms of height we see both the actors as we would in a full-screen image. However, it makes the players look small and insignificant within the frame, while the whole background business dominates the shot. and there's a lot of background business on Big Trail. When the widescreen formats reappeared in the 1950s, many directors made the same mistake, before realizing that in the spoken scenes it is better to frame the actors around the chest, losing some of their height, but allowing them to fill the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because The Big Trail is an especially well balanced effort with a fine script. The subplots of romance and revenge are simple but well-defined, and do not threaten to unbalance with each other or with the pioneer story. It could have been a great intimate epic, but it loses dramatic weight because every time the characters start talking to each other we get distracted by herds of cattle, drifting cars or whatever else is filling every inch of frame. Still, Walsh's sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display, and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable. There are also some nice touches of comedy, largely courtesy of the "Swedish comedian" El Brendel. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is also notable for being the first leading role of John Wayne. While Wayne is another victim of distant framing in dialogue scenes, at least we see his strong physical presence and listen to his warm but firm vocal speech. He betrays his lack of experience, but the potential is clearly there. Unfortunately, that potential was not realized to a large extent at that time and he spent the rest of the decade shooting him down in B-images before he finally achieved stardom. Wayne's friend (and later prolific character actor) Ward Bond also appears in this image. It is not accredited, but you can see it in several scenes, mainly in the 80 minute mark where it is to the left of Tyrone Power. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is a glorious epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama. And it was this great scale that would put the Western (and the wide screen) on the bed for some time. And although the 40s and 50s are now regarded as the golden age of Westerners, it was then a changed genre, with stories of individual adventures and heroisms in an established West. Neither better nor worse, but in a different way. The first period of conversation was the end of an era in which westerns could be truly gigantic.
