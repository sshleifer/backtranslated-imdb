I just watched a couple of episodes of "Eleventh Hour", but I must say they were enough to impress me. This series is so impressive and interesting ... I will definitely follow it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say that the performance is top-notch. Patrick Stewart plays his character, Ian, the scientist, credibly and coldly, and makes the audience believe in the character. Other characters, like Rachel, are also believable and, although sometimes they are a bit cold, due to the way the series was filmed, they are interesting. <br /> <br /> The stories told by this series are also interesting. For example, one of the episodes I saw was about cloning and a man trying to clone humans. The way the Episode was developed and how Ian - Stewart - followed the clues and saved the people was incredible. Also, it made you think about ethics and how good or bad this might be. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think this is one of the good TV shows. I just hope it stays that way, interesting, stimulating and with good performance. Although it is filmed in a cold way: small rays, cold photographs, many close-ups, it never ceases to be interesting. Highly recommended
