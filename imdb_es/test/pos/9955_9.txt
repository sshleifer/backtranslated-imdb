one of my favorite lines in Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> that is, * We have not finished with you for a long time * so that not only Shylock does not get his pound of meat, nor the 3,000 or 6,000 or the 36,000 ducats (each of the 6 parts they were duchies), in a matter of minutes he was ruined by having to give up all his possessions. and his daughter has already abandoned him. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a dish that is served cold. but Shylock's attempt at revenge is totally counterproductive. <br /> <br /> I suspect that this work was and is popular because it satisfies the desire we have for justice. But the harsh reality is that the world is involved in injustice and most of it remains. Some big names are thrown into jail, small gang punks lose their territory to the "good guys," but in reality most of the time it's the other way around. <br /> <br /> but not in this work. the long howls of racism and anti-Semitism forget that it could well have been any other marginalized social group that gets revenge, it's just that the money lenders of the time were Jews and, therefore, the needs of history put the role of the Jew Shylock of villain. <br /> <br /> Merchant of Venice is my third favorite work of Shakespeare, 1 and 2 being Hamlet and Macbeth. This production gives an excellent treatment of the moral of the story. the scenes with the suitors are only worth seeing. also the discomfort of the new husbands writhing and minimizing the fact that they let the rings slide so easily that they had sworn to keep forever. In real life, this trick is what husbands use timidly to remind their best half that promises MUST mean something and should not be done frivolously. There is a much deeper meaning to this work than just the comedy / dramatic aspect. It's about loyalty, commitment and love. <br /> <br /> it's worth seeing it again and again.
