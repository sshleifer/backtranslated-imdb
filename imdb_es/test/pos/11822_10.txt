Incredibly close to the real life feelings and emotions captured by Joseph Mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by AIDS and his new young neighbor, a very strong redneck that Brad Renfro played to perfection. Although the story may seem a bit far fetched (the two children try to paddle in the river several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure for AIDS), the emotion, actions and interactions of all the characters involved are tragically close to real life. Being a "big brother" of a child in a similar situation who died a few years after this movie was released, I recommend this photo to anyone who has wondered what really happens in the life of a child with AIDS. The excellent direction of Peter Horton creates the perfect environment and stage for each scene and draws the viewer to the various emotions affected by friendship, illness, prejudice and the final farewell of two friends who fought to overcome adversity.
