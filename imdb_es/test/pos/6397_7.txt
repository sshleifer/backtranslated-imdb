This show was shit when it first came. The first actress who played the daughter did not fit into the role, the writing was unpredictable, and Damon Wayans CLEARLY did not feel comfortable making such a friendly family show. The chemistry between him and Tisha Cambell (they have been friends for a long time, like all clans of the Wayans with the husband of Tisha and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett) SPOKE, so they did a rethink of the show. Once they returned, they rethought the daughter, made the son much more foolish (to the Eric of "Boy Meets World") and turned the youngest daughter into a genius ... (later, they gave him a little genius boyfriend to make appearances as a comedian). ). The show, while often a roller coaster from the top of the buffoonery to being cheesy, runs the line long enough to show that Damon Wayans is comfortable with his own skin on set (especially since the top writers , directors and consultants were ALL members of the Wayans family) and in character. Once everyone was in the program for a while, they worked for everyone in the strengths of the releases and were able to make a consistently fun show in the air. <br /> <br /> However, there are MANY buffoons, too many during the most important antics, and often too much chaos occurs in the life of the Kyle family. They made Junior TOO STUPID, they also made the older daughter an attractive and clumsy idiot from time to time and the smallest daughter was not even spared by the writers. I feel they jumped the shark and signed the death sentence when Junior left his girlfriend pregnant, she moved and he married her and her parents were introduced (the character of Junior's wife's father makes me to WINCE just thinking about the). The show continued to be fun ... but it was a UPN program on ABC if that made any sense to the reader. <br /> <br /> The reps are pretty funny, but I'm relieved that it's over ... there's no room left to go with him. When it's bad it's REALLY BAD. Sometimes, it is usually a corn ball, but at least he was a black man who had a situation comedy and came to syndication in an important network. Who can say that for himself now? (Given the merger of CW and the "blackout" on television networks lately, that's it). One.
