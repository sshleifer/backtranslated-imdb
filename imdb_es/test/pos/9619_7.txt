Having recently seen Grindhouse, he was browsing Video USA in search of some movies that could have been played in real grindhouse theaters in downtown areas during the 70s. The Hong Kong action movie Five Fingers of Death looked like that. The sound effects of cartoons and the quick jump cuts seemed to distract a bit at first, but after a while I got involved in both the story and the characters that did not matter to me. Parts of the musical score sounded like the "Ironside" TV theme that was later used in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies. Some scenes that involved the hero's boyfriend seemed to be on the verge of parody, but they were so brief that they did not ruin the movie. The most exciting parts involve the tournament and some revenge segments after that. It's worth seeing for fans of kung fu!
