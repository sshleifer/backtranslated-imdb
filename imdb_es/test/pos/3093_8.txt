Undeniably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the limits of cinema, perhaps more than any other commercial filmmaker. I have known Herzog for some decades and I have never been impressed by man or his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and I was a bit surprised at how the film was relatively conventional, but I could not help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew to the real jungle not only to make the film, but to live it No other filmmaker is so maddened by the purity of the filmmaking process and the subsequent history of such productions as Fitzcarraldo has become a film legend. <br /> <br /> Today I sat with Fata Morgana, a Herzog from 1969. Film that could be described as an allegorical cinematographic postcard. Without investigating the actual locations, I assume that it was shot somewhere in Africa, both on the coast and in the desert, a region that could have been the infant's cradle, the infant civilization, the infantile life on earth. A Herzog refers to these origins, the biblical notion of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse, as expressed by the narrative that is distributed throughout the execution time of 79 minutes. <br /> <br /> Watching FM I could not help, but I feel like I was a passenger on a deep trip. In the opening sequence, the title translates as "Mirage" and Herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple repetitions of commercial aircraft landing on a runway. These images are perverted, their three-dimensionality crushed by a long lens, accumulating layers of escape, heat waves and aberrations of light, all on top of each other. The effect left me to conclude: things are not as they seem. <br /> <br /> FM is divided into 3 very different chapters: 1) Creation, 2) Paradise and 3) The Golden Age. Chapter One opens with innumerable languid images, where desolate and desolate landscapes they move, the dead animals rot, the broken shells of the crashed planes and the abandoned cars slowly disintegrate in the desert sun. The people who populate this inhospitable landscape are ragged desert prisoners, smiling and apparent. The narrative speaks of a time before life, a time when the canvas of the earth was blank and all that existed was the heavens. While the narrative recalls a simpler and purer time, the portrait of a child holding a foxlike animal by the throat evokes a chilling representation of a man's cruel and relentless attempt to impose dominion over nature. <br /> <br /> In the next chapter we are presented with more of the same, but the images and people are more animated and seem infused with a minimum of life and vitality. We hear a stunned biologist talk about the difficulty of a monitor lizard in search of prey in such a lifeless environment. While holding the monitor that is twisting, its tongue hits the flies, it also describes how difficult it is to capture these creatures in the scorching heat of 140 degrees. The parallelism is duly noted and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated and sincere portrayals of individuals mistreated by the sun, the desert and the laborious efforts that are required to exist in this cruel realm. It also drives the issue that, if not in control, man affirms his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant way. <br /> <br /> The last chapter takes us from the desert's blast furnace and takes it to the more familiar territory of Herzog populated by eccentric and absurd behaviors. Nobody seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the strange bugs of the world than Herzog, possibly this is where he feels most at home. Like Errol Morris, Herzog chooses to place his camera in the most objective position before shooting the film. The subsequent flirtation that Herzog has with his subject is the result of which he could continue shooting far beyond the point where most of the directors had shouted. As Morris does, this extended roll pushes beyond the "on" moment that subjects feel obliged to offer and due to their discomfort of being pushed to overtime, their facade yields to something real. The most comical portrait of this chapter is that of the 2-person band playing a strange polka-style song that Herzog recycles throughout this chapter. The drummer of the band wears the same glasses as the biologist, as does another guy who does a magic trick, and asks: what about the glasses? They definitely add some levity to the movie, but you have to wonder if they have any deeper meaning or meaning, or this is just another example of Herzog's joy. <br /> <br /> Aside from the narrative, Herzog uses folk and blues Music as the soundtrack of experimental documentary. Leonard Cohen takes most of the time on screen, two of his beautifully melancholic songs "So Long Marianne" and "Suzanne". Accompany perfectly the displacement landscapes, which adds to the convincing feeling that we are really prepared for the trip. At the end of the trip, Herzog returns to one of the many shots that are repeated throughout the film: the distant framing of a solitary vehicle that crosses the infinite desert surrounded by a mirage of water that fills the horizon. Despite the general desolation of FM, the crescendo of the film and the mirage motif leave you with a hopeful spirit, believing that against all odds, life will persevere and possibly even flourish. <br /> <br /> Having finished writing this post I made reference to FM to discover that Herzog shot him in Sahara Cameroon just a few weeks after a bloody blow. True to his legend, Herzog and his crew were arrested, beaten and imprisoned. While in prison, Herzog became ill with schistosomiasis, a blood parasite. It's really hard not to love a film as hypnotic and austere as Fata Morgana; Knowing that the filmmaker was willing to die to do so only makes you respect him even more. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
