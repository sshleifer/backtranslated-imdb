I went straight to the big screen to see this kicker. This is the only movie I know that Tarsem Singh has directed, but it was intense. This movie was a total mental stimulant and one of the best special effects movies of its kind. <br /> <br /> The characters were vibrant and nothing less than beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This film is terrifying and interesting and totally bombards the senses with fear and euphoria. This movie does not compare to any other I've seen, except for the level of being beautifully weird. In this sense, it is a pretty big step above 'The mechanical orange'. Definitely watch this movie on the big screen and do not wait for it to come out on tape. It will not be half as good on the tape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for those who are easily scared. It will entangle your mind and leave you with images that take a while to forget. But for those who like to be scared ... ENJOY!
