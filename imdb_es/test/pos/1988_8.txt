After his previous film "Videodrome", which definitely shows similarities with this film, director David Cronenberg again ventures into the world of virtual reality, which mixes truth and fiction. It is a virtual reality taken to another level. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a very original film, well directed and represented, but above all very well written. The film presents a fascinating and well thought-out concept, which director David Cronenberg executes to a large extent. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a movie that knows how to cheat you constantly. Just when you thought you had discovered things, another surprise awaits you around the corner. Things are never the way you think them, especially when you explore the line between truth and fiction. You just never really know what the reality is and what the game world is, until the end. It makes the characters and events very unpredictable and also provides the film with a great ending that will leave you thinking even more. <br /> <br /> The movie has a perfect type of game narrative, mainly with its character. Appearances and their disconcerting events. They must complete a certain step or task before being able to continue in the world and discover what their purpose in the game is. <br /> <br /> The film knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism. without ever reaching the top with either one. The narrative keeps the film as simple as possible, although, of course, the film is not always so simple to follow due to its unusual events, dialogues and environments. <br /> <br /> The movie is not only rare, however. In fact, I was surprised to see that "Videodrome" has a higher rating here, I thought it is a much more inaccessible and "strange" movie. The film also remains entertaining and has a good fast pace. It never allows the film to get stuck in its most philosophical moments and deeper meanings. It also makes this film can be seen perfectly for people who do not normally see this type of movie. <br /> <br /> The film is attractive, with subtle and effective special effects a great visual aspect, which also gives the film a certain feeling of "game" required. <br /> <br /> The film is well organized, with Jude Law in a role where you do not see it very often, that of a shy and insecure person. Once again it shows how versatile Act really is as an actor and that it is much more than just another pretty Hollywood face. Jennifer Jason Leigh was also a great female protagonist. He has not really played so many important roles in major productions, but with this film he shows why, however, he has always been considered a great movie star. The film also features some other well-known actors, in much smaller roles, such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe. <br /> <br /> A very original film that is worth seeing, especially if you have seen "Videodrome" before. . <br /> <br /> 8/10
