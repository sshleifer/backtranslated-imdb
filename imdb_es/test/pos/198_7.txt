The Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me a lot of the young Audrey Hepburn and the camera of THE CRANES ARE FLYING seems to love her as much as she does. She is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance in the context of World War II in Moscow. <br /> <br /> The film is almost poetic in its magnificent black and white cinematography, which was the main reason to see the film in the first place, since I had never heard of it and decided to try it when it was broadcast by TCM. <br /> <br /> It's a very moving love story about a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly dragged down by his role as a soldier recruited in times of war in Russia. She is unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him, but inexplicably marries another person who has forced her, a pianist who soon realizes that he still loves the soldier he hopes to hear. His marriage is problematic because he can not help but remember a happier moment with his soldier girlfriend. <br /> <br /> At the end of the story, accept the idea that he will never come back. and is able to face reality and deal with the situation. There is a very touching final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of returning soldiers by giving some flowers of her bouquet to happy families. <br /> <br /> The elegant and eye-catching camera work is what the film takes, as well as the story reproduced honestly. <br /> <br /> Made with good taste, but maybe the English subtitles did not tell the whole story because some of the elements of the plot seemed a bit blurry to me as if they had been overlooked. <br /> <br /> Summing up: It's easy to see why he won prizes at the Cannes Film Festival. It reminded me, with style, of another great Russian film, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER.
