Finally I got the excellent Sazuma DVD of this movie that is full of interesting extras. I have read a lot about it, and unfortunately I missed it at the Stockholm Film Festival. It does not work as I thought, but it's worth seeing if you like strange and unique movies. I'd rather watch this again than any of the recent so-called horror films vomited out of Hollywood these days. For me, what remains of the experience are certain music tracks that sound dated and rely too much on cheap synthesizer sounds. For me, all these tonal / harmonic elements of the score could have been removed and replaced by David Kristians' excellent sound design. But that's just my opinion. Otherwise, this is a bold and angry image with welcome meditative and poetic parts, such as the fading of the sequence of photographs, which is beautiful. I hope to see Ascension, and I applaud Mitch and Karim for their efforts in producing unconventional film. They are a great inspiration as I soon embark on my own short film production.
