This movie comes from Turkey, where you can not find any tradition of horror movies. First I was afraid to see only one adaptation, but after seeing it I changed my mind. It has an original scenario. A love movie using a horror theme. Most players are not famous youngsters, but their performance is proof that a new generation is looming. Maybe this is a sign that Turkish cinema is returning after 20 years.
