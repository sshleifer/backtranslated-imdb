The Seven-Ups is a good and fascinating movie. It's packed with credible performances by Scheider, LaBianco and an effective terrifying performance by Richard Lynch, although most of the characters are tough cardboard cutouts. The development of the character does not evolve at all on the screen. The only thing we know is that the good are the good and the bad are bad. By deviating from the norm of the crime story, The Seven-Ups manages to throw Scheider and his team in the middle of a building site in a unique writing touch. The locations on the New York City site and an excellent car chase with choreography highlight the film. The only drawback of the movie is the slightly confusing plot at the beginning. They give the spectator little evidence that the men who were kidnapped are related to the mafia (until later in the film). If someone had started blindly watching the movie, I might be a little confused with the story. Otherwise, The Seven-Ups is a nice time full of testosterone.
