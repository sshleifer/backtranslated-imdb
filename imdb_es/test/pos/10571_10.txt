When I started watching this DVD, I never dreamed that I would be totally hypnotized by him in a matter of minutes. The story was completely absorbing and entertaining. The performance was excellent. The biggest surprise of all was that I would love the love so much that these two young women radiated through the screen. Their first physical encounter for me was, by far, the most tender, romantic, charming and captivating love scene I have ever witnessed in the film. I literally stopped breathing. I could not believe the chemistry between the two actresses. Without nudity or graphic sex, they transmitted more passion and enthusiasm than any American production could hope to demonstrate. Bravo to the author, the scriptwriter, the director and the cast.
