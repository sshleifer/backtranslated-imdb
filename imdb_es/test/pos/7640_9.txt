I do not understand why all the people are giving negative reviews to this movie. I really liked that movie! Bled is an abstract art form, and if you do not appreciate art, I can see why you would not like this movie. It was a great twist on the average vampire movie. If you are looking for a new, new and ingenious vampire movie, then this is for you. But if you want one of those to become bats, wolves and melt in the movies of sunlight, go see your old Dracula movies. Sure, it's a bit on the low budget side, but they did a great job with the budget they had. I am very happy to have found this movie, because I was about to give up the vampire genre. I thought this movie was brilliant! I give my approval to the writer, the director and everyone involved in the film.
