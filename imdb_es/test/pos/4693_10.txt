This series of HTV is beautiful. I highly recommend watching the movie. It has everything it should: extraordinary scripts, strong characters, beautiful landscapes and an exceptional environment. Add a little Clannad environmental score and you will receive an unforgettable image. I love all the HTV adventure films that I saw: Return To Treasure Island, Smuggler, Adventurer, but Robin of Sherwood surpasses them all. I would like to thank the entire HTV production team and Richard Carpenter in particular for giving me many adventures and excitement. I have the DVD release in my little movie collection. I really regret that movies like these are not made.
