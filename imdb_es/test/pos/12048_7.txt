I have seen many of Shahrukh's films and this is a very good role for him. It has such versatility, but it remains mainly in positive roles. As Rahul, he is very dark and disturbing, however, I found myself sympathetic to him in much of the film. If it were not for something else, watch this movie for Shahrukh. Play a very complex and real character very convincing. The story is very typical and has been done before, but the development of the character is very strong and entertaining. The opening is a bit confusing, but in the end, it does not matter. The songs seemed very nice to me and give an idea of ​​what the characters think. Very smart. I think this movie was very good and I recommend it to all Shahrukh Khan fans. It is a must see!
