I hate football !! I hate football fans! I hate cars! But this movie was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> I was given the great opportunity to see this movie over the weekend, and all I have to say is that I laughed until I cried, and when it will be available in the UK and Denmark. Girls, this is a soccer movie that will have to see, it's very funny! <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie started as a crazy commercial for a telephone company is simply amazing, maybe the guys are not very well known. actors, but this is a real good mood, with real people, and on the one hand I applaud you for bringing this to the screen. <br /> <br /> WELL DONE!
