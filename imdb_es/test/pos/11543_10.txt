A genius. My genius I remember the exact second in 1994. I sat in a pub in Shropshire, England. I remember the exact seat. "Bill Hicks dies of cancer," said the headline in the NME. I felt that someone had hit me in the stomach. Buy this DVD. If you do not find something in it one way or another, I will be surprised. <br /> <br /> RIP Bill, I wish you were still here.
