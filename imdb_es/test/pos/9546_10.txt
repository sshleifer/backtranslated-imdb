I'm salivating because of the aftermath. I needed something to keep me from being driven crazy by tension, anxiety (what if it's not so good ?!) and the constant lack of information. I needed something to calm down a bit, something to pass the time, plus, of course, The Matrix. This was fair. <br /> <br /> I found it informative (like the part of Keanu's neck ...) and some of that was funny. I felt so sorry for Carrie-Anne when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys. I have found only one problem with him. Since 95% of the people were really men, they just let their mouths run wild, and in that there was language. It's not as bad as the curse racing of The Shawshank Redemption, but that scene where Keanu is describing a bad day, connect your ears if you're small. > <br /> <br /> It was entertaining and it was just what I needed. It's what all Matrix fans who are going crazy need to keep them quiet. They mention a little about the sequels, and someone almost gives up something, but gets caught in time (shoot!). It almost does not give you spoilers, but it's great to have it if you're a Matrix Head like me. <br /> <br /> There is not a spoon.
