I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and I could not watch the original teleplay until a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel. Well, it's not a million miles from the plot of SEVEN, but it's still convincing. Much of my praise has to do with the performance of Ken Stott as DCI Red Metcalfe, a cop who seems to have lead a very unfortunate life and someone who has a terrible secret. It would be easy for Stott to get over the top, but he plays the part quite subtly. In the same way, the murders are very shocking but, unlike the sequel in which the murders are carried out on the screen in a rather OTT manner, in reality little violence is shown. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that the false track was too obviously a false track that meant I had not been caught by the turn of the shock (and you would probably see the turn of the shock coming so I would not mind) with a spoiler alert) and that when it was revealed to the real killer, it seemed a bit far away. It sought and caused some plot holes to appear in the story. If I remember correctly, the sequel had similar problems once it was revealed to the killer, so maybe it would be a good idea not to do MESSIAH 3
