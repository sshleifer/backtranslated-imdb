Love Jones intelligently portrays young African-Americans in a clear, positive and realistic sense. I feel that all the actors and actresses were magnificent and really did a great job capturing the mood. Nia Long and Larenz Tate worked well together and I hope to see more work from both of them. In fact, all the actors / actresses did such a good job that it would be great to see another romantic comedy of them. This movie can be compared to most of any well written romantic comedy. If you have not seen this movie yet, I recommend you do it, it can definitely give you another perspective on life and love.
