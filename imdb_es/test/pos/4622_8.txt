Many other viewers say that this is not a good movie to watch, as they believe it is not "realistic". How can it not be considered realistic? They feel that it is not easy to relate to the incest part, which is not common. I can guarantee you that you have met more people than you think an act of incest has occurred. Many of them are not going to come out and say it, and they are mostly victims. Also, many people are homosexual, and they are still close, because no matter how much they would like them to be, they know they will be ridiculed and possibly even abandoned. And tell me, with how many children have you attended high school who have been pregnant or had an eating disorder? I bet a lot, and although pregnancy is not incest most of the time, it is still easy to relate it. Who can not relate to being an outcast or being bullied? That happens all the time. and many viewers are probably worried about education, like Marcus. Being a fool seems to be quite common these days. so there are many things to relate to. However, more than the rest, no matter how popular you may become, sometimes you feel invisible or alone, you do not notice or ignore yourself, like the suicidal victim, how can you feel that you can not relate to the movie? I think the film may seem useless to others, but I would like to consider it important. It's an interesting way to show that suicide happens, and to be conscious. It comes from people who do not show their unhappy thoughts, it's very surprising. People who show problems there commit suicide at times, but when you hear about suicide, who would have guessed, it usually goes through the minds of most people. <br /> <br /> The end surprised me, I did not expect it. Being the girl that until the end, was mostly an extra in the scenes, did not even show up. The story, even in its description, says that it is about 6 lives of teenagers, when in fact it was 7 years old. My only real disappointment was that it was not one of the characters we learned, it just seems at first that The movie made no sense to see if the real victim is just a random girl. Until I thought more. It made a lot of sense to be a big surprise, since that is how suicides are. In addition, who would choose which of the other students was more right than the other. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has some negative points, most of the films have some, but I would recommend this movie, as long as you can deal with the tragic moments of seeing suicide, and violence and blasphemy that are shown in this movie.
