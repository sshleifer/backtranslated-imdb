In 1983, Michael Jackson's popularity was such that if he wanted to make a $ 1 million horror video with the "American Werewolf" team and with the voice of Vincent Price, that was exactly what he was going to do. And never a music video created such a sensation, sooner or later ... when it was released on VHS, this 13-minute short became the best-selling musical in the world. But most likely you already know, since every time there is a list of the best music videos of all time, this almost always takes the first place. street with your date after your car has broken. He explains that he "is not like other men" (damn right), and then the full moon appears behind the clouds. His girlfriend stays there and screams, and screams, and then screams a little more, during a luxurious sequence of transformation when Michael Jackson becomes a werewolf. He chases her through the woods, he catches her and we ... we go to the movies. Oh, all this is happening in a horror movie that Michael Jackson and his date are watching. <br /> <br /> So, we're five minutes away and there's still no sign of the song "Thriller". Extravagant, a lot? Anyway, you should know how it goes from here ... dance, sing ... cemetery ... Vincent Price ... zombies ... "What's the problem?" ... then the credits end. Final credits for a friggin 'music video. "Thriller" is not one of the most memorable songs of Michael Jackon, but even by today's standards is a bitch of visual experience. If you have not seen it in its entirety, then you should definitely do it soon.
