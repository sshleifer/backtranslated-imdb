RKS, after the success of GHAYAL, started working on this film, which was a comedy. The film was being prepared for 3 years and finally it was released in 1994, but it did not work for some reason. Before this movie, DAMINI (93) released and did well <br /> <br /> The movie is a crazy comedy movie like most Priyadarshan movies today, but it's fun and well-managed. The film has a suitable plot unlike today's movies and makes you laugh. Most of the characters became famous, be it crime master gogo (Shakti Kapoor), Paresh Rawal and others <br /> <br /> The movie keeps you laughing throughout the execution time, although it is too slapstick and exaggerated, but it's one of the funniest movies <br /> <br /> The direction of RKS is very good music is good <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Aamir steals the show and offers its funniest performance, This was her first off-stage comedy Salman does well but seems to be an amateur in front of Aamir, but she does a good job and her chemistry is lovely Karisma is annoying and sounds like a girl Raveena is right Paresh Rawal is too funny in both roles , Shakti Kapoor is very funny in his great performance Shehzad Khan (nicknamed by Ajit) is very good and Viju Khote is also funny. All are good too.
