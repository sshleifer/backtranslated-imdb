A difficult life becomes more difficult when the three children of a single mother are scheduled to be sent to separate foster homes after their premature death. <br /> <br /> To stay together, the older child plans a bold and high-risk escape to find a distant lost uncle, his only closest relatives. <br /> <br /> Your journey takes the three fearful fugitives to a desert chase in a classic beetle, penniless, hungry, desperate, terrorized by criminals and also young people to drive, hunted down by civil authorities they always threaten. <br /> <br /> What the film lacks in the performance and the plot is real, which compensates with the honest human need to be part of a complete and complete family. even if that family is improvised with spare parts of broken lives. <br /> <br /> Of course, the end is forced and too dramatic for the film critic, but each heart beats the same cry for family union and belonging. <br /> <br /> With all its weaknesses, I still give this film a strong recommendation.
