I do not understand all these bad reviews. I think this movie was one of the best in the Puppet Master series. With a low budget, one can understand why special effects and acting were not spectacular, but they were not completely horrible. <br /> <br /> Greg Sestero brought a lot of charisma to the role of Andre Toulon. It has a lot of potential, and I hope to see more of it soon. And although the cinematography was not excellent, and there was a minimum of violence and gore, this movie was very funny. I am a big fan of Puppet Master and I have come to expect blood and blood from the movies in this series, but I can say that I never got bored in the whole course of watching Retro Puppet Master. So, if you ever have the opportunity to see this movie, do not automatically consider it unworthy of your time. Give me a chance. Maybe you like it
