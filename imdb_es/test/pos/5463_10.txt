As a former TV editor, I can say that this is as authentic as it seems. It even led to the producer of Letterman (who was thought to be a source) renounce (eventually) real life. Letterman was outraged (well, one silly thing is he has him throwing softballs at his swing on his farm, total fabrication) but the main information is hilariously true, from the stupid war by Letterman once he decided to leave NBC to the Leno's house. problems with an agent who was not ready for the big moment, but to whom he let the program run (almost to a disastrous exit) of his famous loyalty. If any of you, children, do not understand the reason why Letterman is jealous to this day, watch this tape.
