This movie is about a very delicate argument and if you look for something that makes you think you're right. Tim Robbins has done a wonderful job and the result is a kind of docu-drama that should be shown in the schools (for the important topics discussed). What's up with the actors? Well, they're just great; Susan Sarandon is truly "the face of love" and Sean Penn is amazing as almost always. A must see!
