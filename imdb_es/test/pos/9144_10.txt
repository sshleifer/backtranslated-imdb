As a great horror fan, he had given up the subgenre of vampires due to the fact that in most vampire movies the vampire has become feminine and not threatening, benign and basically weak. This was the attitude I adopted when watching Soul's Midnight and I'm happy to say that the vampires in this movie at least have the hunger to kill old women and sacrifice babies. Armand Assante, one of my favorite actors of all time, was born to play the charming vampire with a wild intensity. <br /> <br /> Another thing that interested me is that the central location is the Hotel Borgo. That's great because (and I went back to my copy of high school to look for this) in Dracula, the Borgo Pass is where Jonathan Harker must pass to get to Dracula's castle. <br /> <br /> Finally, my congratulations to whoever has made the decision to turn the creature into a real effect and not a damn CGI! That's the only big thing in many low-budget movies, they can not afford the computer effects of garbage that affect many Hollywood monstrosities. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell ... this is better than Underworld, especially if you're a purer vampire.
