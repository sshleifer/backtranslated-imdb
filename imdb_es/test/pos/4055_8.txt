It's not really flashy, but this movie does a great job of developing a lot of characters, and letting you know their hopes and desires, while at the same time managing to be fun and bittersweet. A very sweet movie It's also fun to see Vincent D'Onofrio and Mary-Louise Parker so early in their careers.
