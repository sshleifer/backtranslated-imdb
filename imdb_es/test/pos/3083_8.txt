Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much-needed parody of Mel Brooks. It has the mission to supplant the legacy of Robin Hood and the film that deals with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood. He is looking for some good men to join him in his quest to overthrow the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the right hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis) as well. Tracey Ullman co-stars as Prince John's personal witch, Latrine, who has her eyes on the Sheriff. <br /> <br /> Will Robin find his men happy? How far will the Prince go to throw his weight in the absence of his father? Why does the Sheriff hate Robin so much? To discover it, you will have to see ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS! Take a look at the hilarious Cameo by Dom De Luise that plays the Duke of Jersey. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
