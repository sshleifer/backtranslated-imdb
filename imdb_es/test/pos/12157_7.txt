Like most people, I was interested in "More" only because of the Pink Floyd soundtrack, which has become the only Pink Floyd album I still listen to after all these years. It was quite a surprise to find the film in a local video store, in a remastered digital version. It was an even bigger surprise to discover that it's a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> Visually it is quite beautiful, especially when the two main characters are enjoying themselves on the rocks on the Spanish island of Ibiza. And the use of music from the soundtrack, which as far as I can tell is exclusively from Pink Floyd, is excellent. It was a joy to see the film with my copy of the album next to me, mentally marking each song as it was used in the film. Dave Gilmour's short "A Spanish Piece" was the only one I did not hear, and several tracks are used quite prominently, especially "Cymbaline", "Main Theme" and "Quicksilver". That last song is tedious in the soundtrack album, but it works very well during the title sequence of the film, re-emerging at least once more. Maybe now I can appreciate it on the album, now that I have some images to accompany it in my mind. <br /> <br /> The "More" argument is a bit difficult to take sometimes, especially at the beginning. going, when the movie seems to be simply a vehicle to demonstrate the disorder of those involved in its realization. But, finally, the film shows that it has much more to offer, as the plot focuses more. Why does Stefan take heroin? Why does ANYONE take heroin, knowing the possible consequences? The film does not attempt to answer that question directly, but the use of Stefan's heroine seems a logical extension of his pursuit of pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to any Pink Floyd fan who has an appreciation of the very underestimated "More" soundtrack. I also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the counterculture of the sixties and how it was presented in the media. I have no idea how realistic this film is, since I am too young to have lived through the sixties, but it seems that it captures the spirit of the times in a way that no other film does.
