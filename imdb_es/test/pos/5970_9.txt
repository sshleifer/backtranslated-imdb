It is no wonder that Larisa Shepitko was married to Elem Klimov, who would later direct the most heartbreaking war film ever made, 'Come and See (1985)'. 'The Ascent (1977)' ?? The finished film of Shepikto before an untimely death? It is built in much the same mold. Set during World War II, the movie follows a pair of Soviet partisans trying to secure food for their hungry army while evading German occupation forces. The first forty minutes are terribly tense, as the two men crawl through the harsh and snow-covered landscape, the world around them completely devoid of life, warmth and color (in fact, so monotonously monotonous is the scenery that literally It took a long time to realize that the film was shot in black and white). <br /> <br /> After the capture of the partisans by the German soldiers, the film becomes a cold meditation on loyalty and morals. While Sotnikov (Boris Plotnikov) refuses to betray his army, even under extreme pressure, the less determined Ryback (Vladimir Gostyukhin) tries to save himself. Is it wrong to do so? Ryback's betrayal is discouraging, but the film does not immediately condemn his actions are treacherous; instead, the viewer is forced to consider what his own response might be in such a situation. Shepitko sympathizes with Ryback as the Bible sympathizes with Judas. Both men betrayed their allies to the enemy and were forced to see them executed. However, while Judas committed suicide by hanging himself (at least according to the Gospel of Matthew), does Ryback even find that option closed for him? In an unbearably tense climax, the belt around her neck unfastens. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> I have no doubt that the two main actors spent days and hours climbing the snow-covered earth on their hands and knees, and In fact, his misery is so convincing that I actually developed a cold while watching the movie (seriously, I did.). Interestingly, the film intervenes in this reality on several occasions, as Ryback imagines making an offer for freedom, and then is killed by his German captors. This device, although unusual, works well with its biblical allegory; Ryback faces a test of his worth and, at every step he faces a new dilemma, he always chooses the selfish alternative, and his own life is the only decisive criterion. At the end of the film, he is still alive, but the nightmare of war and guilt persists.
