<br /> <br /> Horror movie time, Japanese style. Uzumaki / Spiral was a full breakfast from start to finish. A fun breakfast at that, but sometimes I was a little too dependent on kitsch instead of horror. The story is difficult to summarize succinctly: a normal and carefree adolescent begins to face face to face with extremely disturbing events, since the small city in which he lives seems to be under the control of the spirals. The spirals are everywhere, in the air, clouds, earth and everyday objects. Spirals take control of people and bad things happen to them. Oh, another thing, people are turning randomly into snails. Why? Who knows or cares, people are becoming snails, that's enough for me. This was not as scary as it was creepy, since it does not have much suspense or violent attacks like horror movies often. Uzumaki prefers to crawl and crawl (as a snail would!) Instead of shaking. A favorite scene: a woman sleeps in a hospital room when this thousand-legged centipede creature makes its way into the room and slowly climbs up the bedpost, on the pillows, on the pillow and up to her sleeping ear. I cringed and cringed my toes. Uzumaki has a handful of really violent scenes, but that's also a bit humorous. For example, a man is obsessed with spirals, he gets into his washing machine because he sees a spiral when it turns, he commits suicide in a spiral inside the washing machine. The last shot we see of him is with his body all rolled up and like rubber, a spiral of human flesh with an eye full of blood flashing in the center of the washing machine. A strange image Uzumaki has a brazen psychedelic inclination that adds to his charm and fun. I love horror movies like this one. It is not about killing, at the height of the movies, it is a force of evil (the spirals!) That dominate you and try to kill you, force you to kill others. Movies like Uzumaki show that there are many ways to make a horror movie and thank God for that.
