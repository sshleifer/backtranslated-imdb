I bought this movie in my local box office success for 99p and it has been on my video shelf for at least a year. So, tonight I decided to see it, the movie was very different from what I had expected and I did not find any humor in all I saw was that it was a somber look at people who have love affairs and sexual orientation and I did not. I do not really see that the plot of the psycho killer really has a point, except to add tension at the end of the movie. I felt that the person who plays the lesbian woman did a great job. He was following his emotions and what was happening around him. Some people probably would have seen some of the things that she does so funny, but I could really put myself in her place, love someone but reject you at every moment, no matter how hard you try. I thought it was a very moving movie and dealt well with all the different sexualities. I expected something like Bound & Gagged: a love story, but this is a very different movie. Not for the fans.
