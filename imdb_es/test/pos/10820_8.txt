I think the costumes were excellent, and the hairdressers also performed well. It has the very authentic feeling of that period of time. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it was the magic of the computer or if it was real. Some of the great scenes have hundreds of extras in the background. I was especially impressed by the scene on that bridge. <br /> <br /> the main character that the actress also performed well, showed us a nervous and witty woman who knows how to use her to seduce men to get what she wants. . <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes were hilarious. Although it was about 2 hours long, but it was never boring. A very good movie entertaining.
