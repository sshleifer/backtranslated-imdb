Boogie Nights is full of surprises, nothing prepares you for your soul. Yes, he has a soul, while addressing the most delicate subject, with an ironic smile and respect. With a brilliant cast and a wonderful development of characters, the performances combine in some way the best of theatrical performance with improvisation within a real cinema style. <br /> <br /> The plot was richer than I expected and the underlying themes are explained quite thoroughly as each one <br /> <br /> The dream case study of a sociologist, the film resonates with the crude truth of what we all know about self-esteem, the love of parents and the lack of attention / love deficit and its manifestation in adulthood, the desperate need to belong. Here there is something for everyone ... almost camouflaged as themes of untouchables and their separate environment, but, of course, they are universal. <br /> <br /> The movie works on several levels. The ironic loop is that the environment represented only exists because of the voyeur, who happens to be watching the movie ... <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights does not judge its subject and its characters, a rarity. He deserves all the praise he has achieved and more.
