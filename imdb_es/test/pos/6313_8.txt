Although I totally agree with the previous comment about the wonderful performance of Toni Servillo as Titta Di Girolamo, I would also like to add the beautiful film and editing that makes this film practically a painting. The young director Paolo Sorrentino had the courage to experiment with different types of camera techniques that reminded me of the Requiem for a dream by Darren Aronofsky. Both used the same MTV style filming combined with modern music (alternative / techno), making the film? Le Consequenze dell'Amore: it differs from the other crime / mafia movies of its kind. Although the film can start very slowly at almost "seconds" compared to the fastest Hollywood productions, it should be enjoyed due to its serenity, its wonderful character and its splendid ending. Without a doubt, a must for people who enjoy European / Italian cinema. PS Toni, keep acting like that, we need an encore.
