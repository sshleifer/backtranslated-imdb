Checking Out will be launched on Friday, September 15, 2006. through the AMC theater chain that will begin in New York City. Times Square, 66th and 3rd Ave, West 84th Street. This movie has been one of the heart, for the heart. Mark Lane, Jon Karas, Richard Marcus, Jeff Hare, Dana Harrloe, Matt Jensen Ed Abrams, Nick Pike, Peter Falk, Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold, all the cast and crew knew from the first day that this movie was something special. The intention to comfort the elderly is the intention, the closeness of the family is more evident now than ever. I would recommend this movie to all ages and races. This story sounds true to anyone with or without family.
