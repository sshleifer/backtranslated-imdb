This movie came out at the same time as Pretty Woman. Although the general theme is the same: the rich man meets and learns to love a poor working class woman, the characters of Romuald and Juliette are much more kind and worthy of our time with them. I have never forgotten them and I consider that the film is superior to Pretty Woman in many ways. Juliette is an extraordinary woman and the intelligent ways in which she helps her boss overcome her problems will make you happy. The final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines of the romantic comedy. Romuald's efforts to win Juliette's love surpass Pretty Woman's small climbing scene a hundred times. Watch this movie, it will warm your heart.
