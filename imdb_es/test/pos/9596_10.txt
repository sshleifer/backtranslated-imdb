I caught this movie show about the most unlikely, the success? , from a lower league, soccer team. The plot is thick and presents some large and tenuous twists and turns. Intercut with photos and comments from the 70's. I was surprised by your great fun. <br /> <br /> A great cast includes the excellent Tim Healy as the crazed manager (drunk), who clings to everything that will win his team ...? I keep remembering fragments like the stolen secret file that Don Revie (Super leeds united and the manager of England loved by fans hated by everyone else) has in Bostock United (weaker men) than in his detailed report of his opposition, Bostock United In this, the final of the FA Cup, simply says "Sh-te". <br /> <br /> A long time before the fantastic movie "Mike Basset - Football Manager", starring Ricky Tomlinson. <br /> <br /> Up there with the Gung ho English defeating the Germans in football. Good morally. Although the scoring lines say different, from "Escape to Victory" (I'm still happy when England scores) <br /> <br /> And the ungrateful eternity of following a really bad team at Micheal Palins "Golden Gordon" of the series "Ripping Yarns" (with Terry Jones) the team was called Bostonworth United, in case you are interested. <br /> <br /> I searched for a copy of the Bostock Cup, including the biography of Nick Hancock. Do not include it (probably someone - no m hancocks - error) <br /> <br /> Play again or sell me a copy - PLEASE ...
