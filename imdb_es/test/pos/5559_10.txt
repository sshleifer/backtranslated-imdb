Growing up in the late 60s and 70s, I could not help but become a fan of science fiction. With the US space program going on, science fiction books, movies, television shows and comics fed my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe. Farscape is so different from any other science fiction program, but it has all the ingredients that made programs like Star Trek, Battlestar Gallatica, X-Files and Deep Space Nine. One of the criticisms of Farscape is that the casual viewer can not simply jump in and watch an episode and understand what is happening. There have been other very successful programs that used story arcs of multiple episodes and complicated characters. This for me is one of the charms of the show. I do not need or want to have the whole story tied at the end of each episode, as the various incarnations of Star Trek have done. In general, Farscape has wonderful and funny characters and a story that says that although humans may be the least evolved or advanced intelligent species in the universe, they still have unique qualities and abilities. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, short-sighted people in the science fiction channel have canceled the fifth season of Farscape. They have stated that the cancellation was based on the flaccidity ratings. However, just a few years ago, it was his best rated original series and a critical favorite. It's a pity that all the artists that help create this show can not continue their labor of love because of the fiscal problems of the channel / company that made it possible in the first place. <br /> <br /> Hey, do not trust my word, look at the program, look at the repetitions and make your own decision. Help save Farscape!
