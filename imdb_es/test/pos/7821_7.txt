I saw this movie thanks to Costas Mandylor and Lauren Holly. I adored them together at Picket Fences, so it was a pleasure to see them together again. This was not the best movie ever made, but it was cute. Very predictable, but sometimes funny movies without meaning are just what I need. <br /> <br /> The desserts were wonderful, and I wanted to eat them all. However, I loved it when it fell apart. I bet he still tasted good. <br /> <br /> Costas and Lauren still had the great chemistry they had in Picket Fences, and I fainted when they kissed in this movie. <br /> <br /> I would never see this again, but it was a great fill for one night.
