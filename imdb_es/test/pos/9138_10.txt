THE RED CIRCLE (Jean-Pierre Melville - France / Italy 1970). <br /> <br /> This could be the coolest movie ever made, in the most literal sense of the term. The men here never lose control and never, not once, show their emotions. There are no dramatic outbursts in this movie. Everyone is great all the time. It is an abstract dream world, where men live according to their own code, a gangster code with the values ​​of the outside world clearly absent. In this magisterially filmed saga of robberies, Melville tackles the American thriller in his style clearly dark and desolate, but done in a great way with a considerable budget of ten million dollars and four of the best French stars of the time. Alain Delon as the master thief, Yves Montand as a former alcoholic cop, the Italian star Gian-Maria Volonté as an escaped criminal and André Bourvil in an atypical role as the cynical police chief. <br /> <br /> Melville described LE CERCLE ROUGE as his penultimate film and in fact is a very stylized policeman. He also claimed that he wanted to film a black film in color and in many ways he succeeded. The two main influences of this film were the 1950 film by John Huston, THE ASPHALT JUNGLE and the RIFIFI by Jules Dassin (1955). But unlike these films, where we learn a lot about the backgrounds of individual gang members, with all their small needs and concerns that motivate them, we made it clear that they are not just ruthless types of the underworld, but ordinary people who participate in a world of everyday concerns. Human effort, Melville, however, tells us almost nothing about his criminals. Why was Corey (Alain Delon) in jail? Why was your partner, Vogel (Jean-Marie Volonté) arrested in the first place? Or why the former police shooter Jansen (Yves Montand) left the force, was his alcoholism? We never learn the motivations behind their actions and never discover what drives these men. Women are even more absent than in their previous films, with the "emotional" ties exclusively between men. They do not even seem to have personal lives. A kind of zone of emotional gloom and, although the stage is not as abstract as in his previous LE SAMOURAI (1967), Melville continues to draw a very strange world. Melville's favorite actor, Alain Delon, is perfect and almost excels in coldness, if you can imagine it. <br /> <br /> Of deliberate rhythm and with a duration of more than 140 minutes, Melville takes his time to tell the story, but it is slow. rhythm and duration seem to be a perfect way to show the desolate world in which these men live. Nothing is out of place in the Melville films and here is no different, every little detail seems to be of fundamental importance to the story. Although LE SAMOURAI is still my favorite Melville movie, even with the best movies that have been made, it also belongs to the best. <br /> <br /> Dark camera --- 10/10
