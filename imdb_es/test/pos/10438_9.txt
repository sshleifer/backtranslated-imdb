I loved this movie, I tried to buy it and I can not find it. You have to see it, a movie that you can watch over and over again, fun, but also a tearful tear in one. Very good album for the movie. It is a very good movie from the 80s, I would like to be able to find a copy to buy this movie, because I would, the actors acted really well. There are many people who could probably be related to this movie. That's what makes this movie. the movie so good So go out and try to rent this, you will not regret it. It's an old movie, but it's worth seeing. I would not be surprised if they made a new version of this movie soon, but I'm sure it would not be the same. Who has not seen it, go rent it.
