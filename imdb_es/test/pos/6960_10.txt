I recommend this movie. It blurs the line between childhood fantasy and everyday reality in such a perfect way that you have to see it to believe it. The actors and the director have such a perfect synchronization that, in one scene, a fight of names becomes a kind of dance. I loved the story, the actors, everything. While I think there were one or two decidedly kitschy scenes, in general, the film was impeccably done.
