While investigating Susan Harrison (The Ballerina) in reference to an episode of Bonanza, I was reminded of this gem. <br /> <br /> This episode is the inspiration for Dylan's "All Along the Watch Tower" (the cover of Hendrix is ​​probably as well known and is one of his best), which is one of his BEST. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this episode is responsible for several 'bests', not bad for approximately 22 minutes of television. <br /> <br /> But this is "The Twilight Zone". The additional comment of the series is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 'Snakes' is typical of Serling. Intense, dramatic, towards an ending that is as inevitable in retrospect as it is the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> This episode has been spoiled in a sentence and is too good to ruin for anyone who has not seen it. <br /> <br /> But you will feel ambushed. And you'll never hear Hendrix again with the same ears.
