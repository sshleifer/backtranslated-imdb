Okay, the next revision is more than a synopsis rather than actually contain spoilers, but it is better to prevent than to regret to avoid being included in the blacklist, right? Right! Consider yourself officially warned, and keep reading ... <br /> <br /> In this parody / tribute to the best moment in the history of horror movies, the 1980s, a group of stupid teenagers get together to organize a session in the house of the famous Murder McGee, who murdered his entire family a few years ago and buried them in the backyard. As I'm sure you can guess, things go from bad to worse faster than you can say "Where is the meat?" and in the typical horror movie of the 80s, the deaths are bloody, the dialogue is corny and the beautiful women take off their clothes whenever they can. Good times ... <br /> <br /> No clique or clich√© characterizations of the 80s horror films are left unpresented here. In fact, no stone was left unturned at all? we have the cool hero, his innocent girlfriend, the goth girl, the hard thug (think John Bender), the hot blonde who keeps losing his shirt, the shy idiot in love with the hot blonde who keeps losing his shirt, a pair of beautiful half-naked lesbians and two great geeks. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the cast is quite large. In general, larger molds are where things can fall apart quickly, with one or two sour apples that stir the entire barrel. Although not in this case. Not a single cast member left me disappointed. The performance was very well done. Everyone, from the great hero in his jacket Thriller played by Jovan Meredith to the great goth girl played by Renee Dorian to Geeks One & Two, played by Cory Assink and Jonathan Brett? they all played it right, they brought their game A and they threw it out of the park. If you are a Gary & Wyatt fan at Weird Science, you will fall in love with geeks immediately. <br /> <br /> Director / co-writer Jeff C. Smith is a man you should watch out for in the Future, trust me in this. If this is what you can do with a low budget, there are only good things ahead when you get more money for future projects. The characters were dead; the atmosphere was perfect; The laughter was huge; the blood flowed, and spit, and it was beautifully sprayed? It was like watching a horror movie of the eighties. Call this "THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets NIGHT OF THE DEMONS"! The label line says it all and says it honestly: "EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE, FREE NUDE, ZERO BUDGET": there is no false advertising here, friends! As fans of this genre, we must look at the Indians and support these people who work hard and who are bursting their humps out there and bringing us original stories, so that we do not get caught up in a world full of great studies. 'horror' or useless remakes like The Hitcher. No, thanks, no more of that to me. <br /> <br /> To finish, I honestly have to say that STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE! It is by far one of the best indie movies I've had the pleasure of seeing this year. It's a good time, and it stays in repeated visits. From the dialogue to the characters and the wardrobe ... even the love theme of closure on the final credits (that if that does not make you laugh again when remembering the power ballads of the mid-80s of REO Speedwagon - over- pronounced R in each word beginning with the letter 'R' - then I'll eat my DVD right now ... the bottom line is that, if you're a horror fan of the '80s or horror in general, do not hesitate - this movie deserves be in your collection !!
