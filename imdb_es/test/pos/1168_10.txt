In general, we consider the British as the experts in representing a great adventure of the imperial era, with characters like The Four Feathers (1939) and Zulu, simply because the imperial era was, for the most part, British. Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful representation of the imperial era of the United States. <br /> <br /> The projection of power of the United States under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop of this conventional story of the kidnapped damsel who, in spite of her kindness, is beaten by the manly and virile nobility of her captor , who in turn is disarmed by his beauty and contempt. (The politically correct principles eager to see some "native" people or cultures can rest assured that the way Arabs and Muslims are represented here is much more flattering than the way their modern counterparts are portrayed on stage. current world). This story is different: the magnificent values ​​of production (impeccable photography, composition and editing, the excellent cast, the underappreciated Brian Keith playing an abuser Teddy) and a vivid story. <br /> <br /> Although The Wind and the Lion is told in large part through the eyes of the son, each member of the family can identify with one of the characters, be it the noble bandit of Sean Connery, the heroine fighter of Candace Bergen, the clever John Hay of John Huston or the shrewd, radiant and ruthless lieutenant of Steve Kanaly, "Big Stick" of Roosevelt. There is a transcendent scene at the end, when the little boy is symbolically swept by the Moor who runs on his white steed. This is a great adventure at its best.
