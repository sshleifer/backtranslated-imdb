The film features another exceptional collaboration between director William Wyler and cinematographer Gregg Toland, the first after Toland worked on Citizen Kane. But the talent of these two men was focused on achieving a perfectly elaborated film, understood in the old American sense as a great story. The technical aspects of the film are covered so that the spectator is absorbed in the action that takes place on the screen without submitting to the power of the image. The technique is seen as a vehicle of representation unlike Citizen Kane, where the Baroque style of Welles almost attracted the attention of history to the way in which the story was told. One of my favorite movements with the most focus in this film is the drama broadcast by Homer and Al's homecoming. If Homer's girl, Wilma comes to him perfectly focused, Al approaches his wife also perfectly focused. This is a brilliant movement because it shows only through the use of the image the nature of these relationships, as we will see throughout the film: Wilma loves Homer and she accepts him as he is, Al's wife also loves him but You do not feel ready to do it. welcome home. Also later in the film we discover that their marriage has not always been a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> Wyler is a director whose strength lies in being true to his work without feeling the need to brag. He wanted to show his audience how difficult it was for American soldiers returning from the war to fit into a society that did not understand them or treat them with contempt. With a perfect cast and a great dialogue, Goldwin and Wyler produced a film that will always be the template for any other domestic film that returns. The three hours that coincide with the "rough cut" because the test audience at that time never felt for a moment that the action was slow and, in fact, all the scenes in the film seem perfectly justified. Everything is beautifully built, each character receives a good amount of exposure, nothing is left to chance and it is very unfortunate that Hollywood today never bring so many character conflicts to the screen. TBYOOL explores the depth of the American lifestyle, the American family and society to the point of making other movies look like "children's time".
