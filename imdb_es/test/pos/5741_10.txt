My partner and I sat down to watch this movie with a bottle of wine last Saturday and, although we initially had our reservations once the story started, it was actually quite exciting. The scene in which one of the characters was brutally murdered with knitting needles was particularly shocking and echoed the work of the author of the new Korean wave Park Chan Wook. The weapon chosen was a particular masterstroke and allowed us to see the psyche of "Abuelita", greatly altering the connotations of a warm and loving grandmother in a murderous witch. The dialogue was incredibly moving and lyrical in expressing the protagonist's most intimate paranoia. The selections from Pavlosky's staging enhance the disconcerting and manic atmosphere of the evening events, combined with performances worthy of the Oscar to create a chilling and exhilarating masterpiece. The end, which I will not spoil for you here, reminded me and my companion the institutional masterpiece of M Night Shyamalan, The Sixth Sense, due to his mental alteration that has left me thinking many weeks after seeing. Definitely one to watch, repeatedly!
