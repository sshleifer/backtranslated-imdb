As a child, I was never in a situation where I could introduce myself to Dr. Who, and although I had heard about the series in passing, I never realized exactly what it was. Then, with some hesitation, I sat down to see the ninth doctor and his antics that had told him it was something like Arthur Dent (from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) but cooler. I can not believe what I've been missing, seriously, why has not anyone told me about this before? All my childhood was deprived of the adventures of Doctor Who; I am a big fan of most science fiction and fantasy adventures. Honestly, I enjoyed it and I look forward to future episodes. <br /> <br /> I must admit that at first I was not so sure that Billie Piper was the best actress, but I'm happy to say that she did it very well, I thought, and added a very realistic touch to the series. I think, actually, that was one of my favorite aspects of the series; the contrast between the great scenes of alien conflict contrasted with the exasperating normality of life at the South London Council Estate. I am always interested in cases in which people's ideas about the world face a drastic challenge and how people can take any situation and edit it in their minds so that it fits into their worldly lives. I also loved Christopher Eccleston. I have not seen many of his films and I have never seen another actor like Dr Who, but I thought that his interpretation of the Doctor was brilliant, immensely pleasing and, however, dark enough to make him think. I find that many other characters with their type of character story tend to be a bit two-dimensional; They have all the right emotions and actions, but they always seem a little shallow. This Doctor, on the other hand, gained my allegiance with his stratified personality. I agree with some of the other comments that a larger budget for special effects, extraterrestrials and all that, could have been a little more effective. but, again, this is not about special effects (although they help) of what I've read and heard from Dr Who fans for a long time; It is the spirit of all things that really counts. And I do not think they did a bad job with what they had. I liked all the aliens, but my favorite had to be the Daleks; If I ever knew anything about Dr Who before watching the series, it was that there were things that looked like dumpsters on wheels. Before I saw it, I was quite skeptical that these pepper pots threatened the existence of humanity, but some of them were quite terrifying! Which I loved, of course. <br /> <br /> In general, a good show. I look forward to future episodes with pleasure. The doctor has a new fan.
