I was very happy to know that Hari Om will finally be released theatrically in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International Film Festival and I've been waiting for its release since then to be able to send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India ... colorful, magical, stimulating. Apart from a rather strange scene of Hollywood-style rickshaws chasing, this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood movie and a dance movie, but it has drama, romance and humor. The interactions between the Indian taxi driver and the French tourist are a good reflection of the fundamental differences between lifestyles and Eastern and Western philosophy. The characters are a bit broad but the performance was very good. Visually, this movie is a delight, since you really realize what it is to drive in Rajasthan ... like a dream. Sometimes it's hard to believe that everything you are seeing and experiencing is real ... the movie has the same quality. Great soundtrack too!
