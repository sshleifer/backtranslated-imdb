Well, I admit that it often seems that most of the Sylvester / Tweety pairings have exactly the same plot: Sylvester tries to get Tweety, but fails repeatedly and is always mutilated in the process, often with the help of a bulldog. I guess it's like Wile E. Coyote chasing Road Runner (in other words, mammals should never go after birds). "All a a Bir-r-r-rd" has the same plot and places it on a train. In a way, the best part of these cartoons is to see what kind of schemes Sylvester comes up with to try to go after Tweety. We know he will fail miserably, but it's also funny to see Tweety become an imbecile (if you've seen his first cartoons, you'll see he was not "cute", but he actually had a cruel streak). This works mainly as a way to pass the time. <br /> <br /> By the way, I thought I saw it, I mean, I tensed, taw. Sylvester passes a suitcase with the name Friz Freleng. .
