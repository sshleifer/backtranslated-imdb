This is easily my favorite movie. A tragic romance is intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are almost invisible until they all fall apart at the end in a fantastic race. Pure bright. <br /> <br /> I would love to see a little more of Gilles Mimouni's work, but at least according to imdb, he has not done any other feature. Has the high quality of this work made producing another task too difficult? Have you moved (back) to some other sphere of creative effort? I certainly hope that this is not his last film, but I really can not blame him if he decides to stop with this gem as his only contribution to the world of movies.
