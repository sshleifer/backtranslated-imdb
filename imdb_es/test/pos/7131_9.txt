Dead Gentlemen Productions has created a film with surprising production values ​​taking into account your budget. Anyone who has played any RPG, in particular any fantasy RPG (they play Dungeons and Dragons in the movie), will LOVE this movie. Excellent performances, especially in regard to the dual nature of the principles, interpreting their players and their characters. Anyone who has filmed or acted in a student movie will appreciate the amount of work and love they put into this project. This movie (and its prequel) is for fantasy movies and role-playing games, and Blazing Saddles is for westerns: parody of the first order. I only have a couple of minor complaints about the movie itself, none of which will prevent me from buying the DVD as soon as it's available (just 6 more weeks, I'm counting the days): <br /> <br /> 1. When Lodge is talking to Joanna about joining the play group, he gives her a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Players Manual and says "this will tell you everything you need to know". The camera floats too long in a photo of the book, and the moment really looked like a commercial. <br /> <br /> 2. The jokes are funny, but they seem scattered throughout the film. The last third of the film, after an almost continuous flood of visual and verbal humor that precedes it, slows down a bit, as if the narrative was updated with the jokes. Weird, but Blazing Saddles always impressed me that way. . . And I also love that movie. <br /> <br /> One of the narrative strengths of the story is the unresolved nature of the romantic secondary plot. Will Joanna become the GM's girlfriend? Will she return to Cass? Or will the three maintain a platonic friendship, deepened by the camaraderie of role-playing games? (Yes, that sounds silly, but there are a couple of saccharine moments, especially when Cass and Lodge "get ready" at the end). But the film covers a week: in terms of human relations, those questions could not be answered in a week way. The fact that the relationships of the characters remain undefined seems to me better than the more classic choices that are seen in most movies, as the girl gets her prince and move to the castle, or the prince sinks in The North Atlantic after three years Tedious and predictable hours. The writers seem to really understand the psychology of the characters, and you can see how the characters (both players and player characters) change throughout the movie, but not suddenly, and not in an incredible way. <br /> <br /> I would love to hear more wisdom from Brother Silence. "The man who stands out in the dark is ... fluorescent."
