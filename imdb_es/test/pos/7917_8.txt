"Alexander Nevsky" marked the return of director Sergei Eisenstein to the making of films after a period of exile, and what he produced was a brazen propaganda film proclaiming Russia's superiority over Germany. <br /> <br /> There is very little plot: the Russians unite to fight against the Germans; Russia wins. The film is really an extended montage of mostly battle scenes, mixed with some moments of German brutality (like a pretty shocking scene that shows German soldiers throwing Russian children to a furious fire). This was Eisenstein's first sound film, and it is clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium. In fact, this movie really looks more like a silent movie with some added sound. There are some dialogue scenes, but they feel quite lifeless on the screen, and the rhythm is off, as if the actors were not really on the set together at the same time they were filming them. Eisenstein mainly uses sound as an excuse to superimpose Prokofiev's score on the procedure, and in fact, it is one of the film's most important assets. <br /> <br /> Say what you want about Eisenstein's ability (or lack of it) to direct The actors or tell your movie in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how to edit images and music together to achieve the maximum effect, and "Alexander Nevsky" mostly shines through its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
