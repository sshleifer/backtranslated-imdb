I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before watching this movie. I had just seen the MOOG document, which was fine, the only problem was that Moog led a very happy life, and the document was well ... contained. The story of Haack is full of all the commercial tragedy that people buy these days, but it carries a big heart. Although the film does not focus so much on tragic things, it can be felt that Bruce accepted the price of making music in his own way. There are so many elements that make up his IE legacy. invention of the Peopleodian, where Bruce could play music playing people. It must have been a challenge to document Haack's 'Haatter-Brained' output, which practically fit all imaginable musical categories (even in rap music), but the director cut the piece very coherently and managed to capture the spirit. And the cast ... of what group of characters Bruce surrounds himself, but what do you expect from a telepathic guru, stumbling over kids, fighting the music industry. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the history of music, it is the mainstream, but it is important.
