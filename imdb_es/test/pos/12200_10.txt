Surface was one of the few really unique shows on television last season. I can honestly say that I modified my schedule so I could be home and watch each episode. Tons of action, suspense, science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> The story was of a child who found an egg that became a sea creature. The same sea creature that had killed the brother of the main character and the character of the woman (oceanographer) had seen. Most people think it is a killing machine, but the one that emerged from the egg was very friendly. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that NBC canceled it, so we'll never know what happens ... Hopefully it's science fiction or some other channel will pick it up.
