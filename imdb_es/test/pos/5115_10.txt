This movie brings me so many memories! I was very young when it came out, but I remember the first time I saw it. My dad and I always watched "Ernest's Movies" together. We had not seen any of them in several years and I found a couple of them very cheap. We watched them and we could not stop laughing. I love all the "Ernest Movies", but this is my favorite. <br /> <br /> Part of the spoiler! <br /> <br /> The part I remember most is the "magnet" part. My dad still makes the scene of the electric chair! <br /> <br /> Fin Spoiler! <br /> <br /> This is a very cheesy movie ... but excellent! It's perfect for families (it's not like a lot of junk) but at the same time, adults can laugh too! If you like physical humor (such as facial expressions and the way people move), this is the movie for you!
