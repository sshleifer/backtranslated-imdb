Forget all the spy movies I've seen: that's how life was in the USSR, and still it is in many places in Russia and in the ex-Soviet countries. Vera dreams of a life of leisure, as she imagines it is the West; their reality is very different, with a bitter mother, a violent father and alcohol always present. And their prospects for the future are not much better. She meets a man and they try to arrange a life together, but he is afflicted by the same environment, both socially and physically. The setting of this film is brilliant, sitting comfortably in the company of post-apocalyptic films, but obviously it's done with no special effects; They just entered and shot whatever was in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Forget about your stereotyped and cold Russian spy movies. This is the real deal: people are passionate, vibrant and present in a way you will never see in a Western drama.
