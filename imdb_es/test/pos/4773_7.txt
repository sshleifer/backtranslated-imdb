... But it's also Minnie and Pete's! Yes, the grumpy captain may not look like Pete, but he is! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both are very sweet and nice. Interestingly, Minnie is more a lady in this than she is nowadays and Mickey is less considered in this than he is now. Pete is still the same old man, but he looks a little different. <br /> <br /> In this famous episode, aboard a small steamboat, Mickey, Minnie and some secondary characters have a lot of fun and have a lot of discomfort. Even in his first appearances, the three main characters are highly developed. <br /> <br /> I really like this episode, although in general I prefer Mickey Mouse in the future. I like the animation, the theme of the steamboat and the music, the smart jokes, and of course, Mickey and Minnie! <br /> <br /> Like many initial cartoons, this is very random, Walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to "mesh" along. There is also a character on the parrot side that is very annoying and quite unnecessary. These are the things that I do not like about it. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about this episode is that it has not created a color version for him (or if he has, I have never heard of it). <br /> <br /> Anyone who enjoys Mickey Mouse and Disney will enjoy this.
