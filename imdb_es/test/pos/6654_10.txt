"How can a name, not even a real name, break your heart?" That is how. There have been few movie versions of a celebrated novel that have done better justice to its original material than Anthony Minghella's film Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier. If you have read the book, you will be able to feel most of the main scenes recreated in a moving way. Personally I cried several times while reading the novel and spent much of the night watching the movie in tears. <br /> <br /> Amazing scope, beautiful words, great acting and good music. In the interview on the DVD that accompanies the film, Minghella talks about the multiple layers of history. They all work. One of the best movies I've seen and an invitation to one of the best novels of the last ten years.
