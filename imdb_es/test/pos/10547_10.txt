I love this movie, it's excellent and very funny, Ben is in FIT and I would not mind meeting him on vacation! I rate this movie with a 10 because it's gr8 and I hope they never do it again because it would never be the same. The funniest thing is when Andre looks at the moon, and yells at Nicole to "go out and look at the moon" that makes me laugh and never grow old. Another thing is that Nicole seems much older than 14 ... but she is a gr8 actress. But I need help with something Is not it the name of the song that is played at the end when Nicole and Andre are dancing? It really bothers me because I want 2 not what it is because it's a good song !!
