Considered another of the most recent superpowerful dramas that Hollywood presents to us, this film stands out where others have completely failed (especially considering the most underestimated representation in the recent dramatic representation of the character of Natalie Portman), this film is almost driven by unanimously for the chemistry that Susan and Natalie share. They seem so natural during the movie that you would confuse them with a real family. They go through so many conflicts between mothers and daughters in history, it is difficult not to realize their abilities to act. I feel that the talented performances of these two actresses resumed the place where the story was missing and that it was too familiar (full of clich√©s) and really saved the plot of suffering. I would recommend this film mainly to those who like one of the two actresses or that kind of exaggerated drama.
