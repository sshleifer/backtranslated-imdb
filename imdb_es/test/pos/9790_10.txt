Bobby and Mikey are two small children who move around the country with their divorced mother to start a new life. Shortly after the family sets up, her mother marries "The King," which ends up being an abusive stepfather, especially with Bobby. So Bobby decides that he will "fly away" from the abuse on his birthday present. <br /> <br /> This movie was hard to see, especially the scenes of abuse. It was difficult to see an innocent and playful child abuse him and become a frightened and withdrawn young man. The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> I cried during the last half of the movie. There were also some funny scenes like the Monster Brew and the dog that finds the pop bottles. <br /> <br /> I would not suggest letting young children see it. It was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really flew away.
