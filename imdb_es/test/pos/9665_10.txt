Now we know the films of radu munteans, the excellent PAPER WILL BE BLUE and BOOGIE, but it is worthwhile to see (or at least) this first FURIA, which perfectly shows its initial qualities. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting to see how his talent for beginners became one of the best contemporary Romanian directors. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film itself is excellent, intelligent and professional. Script, safe direction, photography with style. Definitely, one of the best, in the most serious and competent sense. also, the sense of the narrative of munteans is convincing and exciting, and the actors ... well, they are simply incredible!
