Super original Really a great movie! James Franco and Sienna Miller really go so well together on the screen. I hope it comes out soon. The first time I saw this movie in a screening. Due to my age and gender, they asked me to stay to "talk". We all had to comment on the film and many people did not seem to like it. I really loved it and I do not know why so many people did not think it was so good. Go see it when it comes out and decide for yourself! One thing you might want to do if you are going to watch this movie is to enter it without knowing anything about it. When I went to the screening, I had not known anything else, it was called "Camile". It's really worth seeing.
