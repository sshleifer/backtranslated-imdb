This movie does an excellent job of taking us through the dark tunnel of espionage, from the beginning to the final calculation. The impact of the film is further deepened by the realization that it is based on a true story. Timothy Hutton gives us a quality performance and discreet, and Sean Penn shows why he is one of the best living actors in the United States. As with "Midnight Express," this movie should make us think twice before doing something we should not be doing in a foreign country.
