This exit from Knotts includes one of his best cronies, Frank Welker. Welker makes the movie. Knotts and Welker compete for laughter and both receive a lot. Knot works for a small town "where not" where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials. When things go wrong, the parents of the city allow Knotts to fall. The character of Frank Welker befriends Knotts and together they stumble to clear up the clutter and the good name of Knott. This film shows the usual character of Knott's scared to death that made him famous for years in television and film. This may have been the last good outing of Knotts. When you have an additional 90 minutes, get a good laugh of yesteryear, a great icon, Don Knotts.
