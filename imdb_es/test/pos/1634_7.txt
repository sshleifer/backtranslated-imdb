Before seeing today the advance of Angels & Demons, I cleared my mind of any uncertainty that could prevent me from enjoying it; the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because the name of Dan Brown appears on all the posters. I entered with an open mind, and expected the worst, but instead, I got a game of a Roman cat and mouse of 2 hours and a half with Forrest Gump, and that's all good entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The film hangs freely from the novel itself. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) leaves for Rome after the pope's sudden death and re-election through the papal conclave. Fixing all this is the carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However, he soon learns of a new threat, one that involves a secret brotherhood that makes his presence known, a time bomb against the matter to which Vatican City now heads and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon, using his intellects (and trust me, you will hear a LOT of that) is entrusted with the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious Path of Enlightenment. Helping him in the search is the scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer) of CERN, who is also co-creator of antimatter. <br /> <br /> The film itself runs at an uneven pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard rush to save a branded cardinal, the next minute bores him with useless information about each random object that passes, evidently slowing down the long-awaited action / suspense sequences of the book. It makes an interesting reading on paper, but on the screen it can go in any direction. <br /> <br /> The characters are decently written on the big screen. Ewan McGregor makes a convincing performance as the quiet but skilled Patrick McKenna, including the famous accent. Tom Hanks is a bit more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the hard-faced leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither his performance nor Ayelet Zurer's performance are worthy of being valuable, and instead of participating in the story, they are only eliminated as assets. <br /> <br /> However, Angels & Demons achieves what DVC could never do; an exciting fast-paced movie full of satisfying explosions, beautiful re-creations of St. Peter's Square and the Basilica (including many of the churches) and a pulsating bomb that tells midnight. Ron Howard does a decent job directing this second adventure of Langdon, this time receiving a lot of criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense (almost) persecutions. <br /> <br /> While newcomers may call it a "National Treasure 3" with a much greater threat, there is still enough contagious suspense / suspense and sweet still images from Rome to inhale. Fans of the book It is possible that the drastic changes in the film feel differently, but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy that it generates, A & D does very well to keep the viewer blocked on the screen this time instead of in its shoulder asleep. <br /> <br /> A good adaptation of book to film that will attract and entertain. <br /> <br /> 7.4 / 10
