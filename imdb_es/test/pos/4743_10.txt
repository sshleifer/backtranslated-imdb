Things that are just "news" were taken as given in this shocking documentary. I fear that as the investigation progresses, the producers of this film will be vindicated. <br /> <br /> The producers show us the Davidians, the government agents, the researchers, with all their faults and all their humanity. Nothing a critic can say could come close to the impact of looking and listening for himself. Pieces of evidence: Congress testimony, 911 recordings, news images, expert comments, interviews, photos and home videos combine perfectly and tell a disturbing story. <br /> <br /> Do not wait. Watch this movie and tell your friends.
