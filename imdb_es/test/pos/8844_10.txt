I can not believe I've never added my two cents for this movie yet! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies of all time. Many critics and filmgoers talk about John Carpenter's "Halloween" for setting trends and being "his best work". Those people have not seen this version of "The Thing" because it is up to "Halloween." <br /> <br /> John Carpenter's work shines in this movie. He took a film that was already made and instead of "remaking" the film, he made the book on which the first movie was based! Sparkly. <br /> <br /> The casting of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, it scared me, it made me guess, it made me laugh, it made me ask, even until today "Who goes there? ? " in that movie This movie did not have a sweet Hollywood cake or a funny ending, and it was a bold move not to have one in 1982. Another brilliant move. <br /> <br /> I was in the screening of this movie when I was on vacation in southern california. The audience at the screening went crazy! I carry those memories for years, it was very fun! We all thought there was no way in God's green earth that this movie was not going to be a success. But for the box office receipts, it was a failure because "ET, The Extra Terrestrial" and "Poltergeist", two very good family-oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this movie came out. <br /> <br /> This movie was what I, as a horror movie fan, was looking for, a horror thriller with an adult script and real adult actors. No children playing adults. It's not the little screaming miss of the big day of the day running screaming for the title, BUT the real guys with real problems deliver some of the best monologues you've ever heard. Hell, being a feminist, I do not even FUCK the women in this movie! And good for Mr. Carpenter by not putting one there, it really would not make sense! (Unless "The Thing" was really feminine! Something to think about!) <br /> <br /> I saw special effects from that time that I had never seen before, I saw makeup that made me sit down for a few nights . This is what is missing today's horror thrillers. Today, the directors are weakened. Today, studies weaken. Too much CGI and there is not enough belief, too much CGI and there is not enough history, there is not enough imagination. He leaves the theater and in a week, or less, he forgets the movie and goes to the next grand opening. This one stays with you. That is one of the marks of an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> In many reviews I have written that paying $ 10 for a movie is horrible. For movies like this, you would pay and you would not feel belittled. This movie is NOT for everyone. <br /> <br /> I find it horrible that they label this movie as a "cult" movie. It seems to me that the audience is wider than many would lead him to believe and, although it is not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how to release a good movie on the wrong date can make a good movie look bad . After the John Carpenter movie, many people copied many techniques, makeup, special effects and story lines from this version of "The Thing". <br /> <br /> Now I am excited to record and affirm that this movie is one of the best movies of all time, very underestimated. See it without cuts, see it in mailbox and listen to it digitally. You'll talk about that for years, too.
