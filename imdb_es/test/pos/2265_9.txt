SPOILERS A Jewish Frodo? Yes, it will be Elijah Wood again. <br /> <br /> From the final part of "The Lord of the Rings", Elijah Wood, like Frodo, finds it increasingly difficult to get away from that main role. Playing a soccer hooligan, a psychopath and now a young American of Jewish origin, Wood has tried any way to escape this box. Now, with "Everything is illuminated", I could finally have achieved this. Playing a role that is not as radical as other efforts, it really reaches the soul of your character. Still, it's not like Wood does this alone. Aided by a magnificent adaptation of the director for the first time Liev Schreiber and a wonderful performance by the newcomer Eugene Hutz, Wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings. "Everything is Illuminated" is a magnificent and moving piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Safran Foer (Wood), a young American Jew, goes to Ukraine to find the mysterious girl who rescued his grandfather and helped her. he arrived in america Upon arrival in the country, Jonathan meets all those who speak, all dancing Alex (Hutz) and his racist grandfather (Boris Leskin). Traveling all over the country, the three slowly learn more and more about the history and relationships that Alex and Jonathan never knew existed. <br /> <br /> It's a strange feeling when the film moves on to its second chapter (it's actually divided into four in general). The first part, although occasionally a bit funny, is above all serious and intense. So, when they give us a brief history of Alex and his family in the second part, going from serious to hilarious is a strange step. It does not work at all, but as the film progresses, you definitely learn your lesson, as this mixture of humor and sadness is better combined as time goes by. <br /> <br /> Until the last credit of all involved, as the story continues, so we started to fall in love with the characters more and more. Elijah Wood is magnificent, Boris Leskin is so intense and strong that he raises questions about why Hollywood has never noticed it properly. The most notable of all however is the newcomer Eugene Hutz. When interpreting a character with intense problems, Hutz is absolutely brilliant. It shows the division between his relatives and the real world with an almost perfect ability, and when his character is communicating with Wood, he really connects with him at a deeper level. Without Hutz, the story is so strong that the film would still be magnificent, but with it, it will reach the next level. <br /> <br /> As a debut work for the actor-turned-director Liev Schreiber, the story is also a brilliant piece to start with. A work of passion (Schreiber's own grandfather, an immigrant to the United States), he manages to truly embrace the emotion of the content, and by presenting us with a truly beautiful landscape and some magnificent shots, he really succeeds in hitting home. The final half hour, in particular, is so beautifully created, that it is a challenge for a tear not to form in any eye of the beholder. It is a moving story, and with the help of Schreiber, it becomes even more powerful. <br /> <br /> Built with the love of a passionate director, "Everything is illuminated" is a beautiful piece. A road story with a difference, it is superbly acted and wonderfully written. It's a movie everyone should see, and it's the perfect way for Elijah Wood to finally let Frodo rest.
