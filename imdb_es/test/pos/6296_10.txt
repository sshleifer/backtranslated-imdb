Conrad Phillips stars in the series of action adventures of the 50s: William Tell. Settled in the 14th century during the hostile Austrian occupation of Switzerland, William Tell is a fighter for reluctant freedom, who heroically fights against tyranny and the oppression of invading forces. William tell is the Swiss version of Robin Hood. Conrad Phillips plays the protagonist fantastically. It is possible that Pascal Bugnion would have been more successful on paper, but was not available at the time of filming. The classic action show consists of series of 39. The episodes are black and white, but this does not detract from the entertainment in any way.
