If you enjoyed movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you'll love Two Hands. It has the same kind of black humor and will keep you entertained throughout the movie. Like Pulp Fiction, it has the extravagant scenarios in which the characters get involved and how they handle them. Along with Gallipoli and Picnic in Hanging Rock, this has to be one of the best Australian films I've seen. It also stars a young Heath Ledger before it became really big in the United States. <br /> <br /> This is a terribly underestimated movie that I think is as good as Pulp Fiction and those big ones. You have to see it!
