I also had the good fortune to see "Checking Out" with Peter Falk at the Phoenix Film Festival. This is a film inspired by the extremely sweet characters that leaves the audience captivated by the plight of Applebaum in life. More than fun, each character of the family brings an incredible comic relief that not only causes laughter, but also inspires some tears of joy. Peter Falk was born to play this role. He plays a "young" father of three children, aged 90, who reunites his adult children in what could possibly be one of the most important moments of his life and his. The 2-day trip that the Applebaum family takes through the enchanting New York backdrop (with carefully selected characters) not only leaves the audience wanting more, but also nurtures their own sense of family. "Checking Out" is a must-see film, not only for those who appreciate the family, but also for those who do not. My thanks to the director who took the opportunity to bring this GIFT to his audience.
