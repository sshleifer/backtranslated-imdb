As a person who used to spend hours driving through the back streets of North London in an attempt to avoid the horrible congestion, this movie appealed immediately. Put in my interest what London was in the late 70's and has the basic premise for my version of TV Heaven. On paper, the film marked all the correct boxes, and after having seen "The Knowledge", the film itself certainly lived up to, if not exceeded, my high expectations. <br /> <br /> Visually, I was surprised at how different London looked back then (I lived in Islington in the 90s, long after gentrification had transformed the area). He really found himself as grubby, seedy and tacitone. London can still have bad urbanizations, but the general feeling of the place is much cleaner, brighter and more pleasant nowadays (according to what this film shows instead of my own memories). <br /> <br /> As for the story and Acting, the best grades obviously go to Nigel Hawthorne as The Vampire. Absolutely brilliant! It acts in a deliberately unpredictable way, alternating between the total severity of the straight face and the surreal mental games to annoy the Knowing Boys when they are tested on a trial by trial basis. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was an excellent and completely enjoyable trip. Back to a very specific time and place that seems infinitely fascinating. But even if you're not particularly interested in London around 1979, you'll still enjoy the witty dialogue and friendly characters of "The Knowledge".
