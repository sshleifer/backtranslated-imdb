During the preface by Clete Roberts, I was beginning to think that it was an Ed Wood production, however, what is developed here is a very hard material. The story of crime and corruption in a southern city has a cast of Hollywood's Poverty Row, and this makes the film even more realistic. No punches are made here, and sometimes the film is reminiscent of "The Well" (1951). The black and white texture gives it a news quality. By the way, younger viewers will be reminded of "The Blair Witch Project," but this is based on REAL events!
