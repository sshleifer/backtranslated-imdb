Snap, crackle, pop! The discordant sound of every change in the angle of the camera. And that's not to mention the white flashes and the trimmed ends of almost all the spoken phrases. What the hell were they doing in the editing room? Or could it be that this approach was intentional? Probably not. What purpose could it serve? Despite all its technical drawbacks, this is an interesting movie that represents a day in the life of Joe, a con man, determined to win $ 200 for his wife's pregnant girlfriend. Joe Dallesandro is outstanding as the carefree, relaxed and carefree young man who is willing to let the other person do most of the conversation while listening with a distant look in his eyes. <br /> <br /> The story is small and imprecise, and documents the uncertain life of a man who relies on casual sex on the street to support his young wife and baby. One thing is for sure, Joe is uninhibited when it comes to undressing for sex or posing for an artist. Understandably, because he has a pretty face and an equally handsome body. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the movie that is remarkably effective. There is no sound, there is no dialogue. Joe, completely naked, crouches on the floor and gives his baby little cake crumbs. There is a beautiful serenity and tenderness captured in these quiet moments. <br /> <br /> Another scene of fun interest is one in which Joe desperately seeks a $ 100 loan from a friend at the gym, reaching the point of asking. a very tortuous approach. <br /> <br /> Joe tries to seem interested, but he is reluctant to speak when an artist gives him a summary of Greek and Roman art. It's a preliminary stage for another time when Joe strips off his clothes and pretends to be the classic style of the record. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, we get the impression that we have to meet Joe a lot. all right. After all, he has discovered more than his soul.
