The two new OSS 117 movies have a kind of humor that is both smart and stupid at the same time, which I find extremely funny. It really reminds me of the classic Pink Panther movies with a protagonist almost as good as Peter Sellers in Jean Dujardin. And unlike Steve Martin who completely ruins Clouseau, Dujardin is quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> The comments about the fact that films are anti-Semitic, are obviously a case of lack of humor and, therefore, of understanding. <br /> <br /> If you will enjoy or hate this movie it really comes down to what kind of humor you have. I can not wait for the sequel!
