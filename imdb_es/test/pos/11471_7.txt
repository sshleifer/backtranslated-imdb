They gave me a DVD of Public Enemies and I expected it to be the 2009 version, but it was not like that, it was this! Sure, it was not the best movie I've seen in my life, not by ANY medium, but, friends, it was worth more than 2.8 out of 10! When I saw that abysmal rating in IMDb, I asked myself what I was going to get but, since the disc was in the player, I started to see it. As other commentators have pointed out, Public Enemies is NOT a historical film in itself, and I noticed that, unlike the 2009 version (which I have not seen yet), IMDb does not classify it as such. <br /> <br /> Let's go people! It's a HISTORY based on real people, that's all! If I wanted a history lesson, I would sit on this computer and read Wikipedia or something like that. Ma Barker (the current name of Arizona, or Arrie-Barker) was NEVER accused of any crime and, as other commentators have already pointed out, it is likely that she never participated in the activities of her children. They sent her to the movies when they were "working"! (I hope she was not as critical as some of those who watched this movie!) <br /> <br /> Theresa Russell had the task never so easy to portray a woman from the age of 17 to her. Death at the age of 52: from a girl who flees from her home to the hardened mother of four children. I think he did quite well. The cheeky little smile he used in more than one scene was classic! Okay, I'll agree with some of the criticisms that the direction of this film was less than average and I sympathize with the actors about that. Theresa should have told the director to forget about the topless shots, as they did not contribute to the story. Maybe some stars with bigger names could have injected some of their own experience to nullify the wrong direction, while those in the second degree were not so brave. Who knows? <br /> <br /> But, although this certainly was not a block destroyer, it VALUED more than 2.8 !! I have all my DVDs in a personal database where I rate them BEFORE looking at the IMDb score (although that sometimes influences the small changes later). I take what I get for my own merits instead of comparing a movie with others of the same genre, and I think this was entertaining enough to get 6.8. (Yes, I will accept that this practice tends to depend on my mood at that moment, but is not that also true for those who vote in IMDb?) However, you can imagine my surprise when I looked at IMDb. and I saw the pitiful score you got here. <br /> <br /> Given the surprise, I decided to read some of the other comments with the hope of understanding the low rating and noticed that they are quite polarized. I agreed with those who said it was worth watching the movie and came to the conclusion that some people are hard to please. Well, since some were absolutely scathing, why do not they come out and make better movies? I look forward to the gems that must be able to produce! On the other hand, if you can not do that, then why do not you shut up?
