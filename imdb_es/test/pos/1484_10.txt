This is one of my favorite television shows of all time, Rowan Atkinson is just a genius! And it's just that I chose this to be my 1000 revision! I can not begin to tell you how much I love Mr. Bean, he is the man, and what surprises me is how he gets out of these incredibly difficult situations, and he's always so creative, plus Robyn Driscoll also deserves praise! He is also a genius! My favorite part that he has done is Amazing Adventures of Mr. Bean and, while the rest of them are incredible, this is still my real favorite, besides, I wish the show did not stop so soon! Each episode is written brilliantly, and all were directed in a masterly way, more Each episode is a classic in my eyes! This program is incredibly popular, and I can definitely see why, since it is possibly the most fun program in history. The actors of the characters played there very well roles, especially Robyn Driscoll and Matilda Ziegler (as Irma). This is one of my favorite television shows of all time. Rowan Atkinso is simply a genius and an incredibly talented comedian (possibly the best!), And it's just that I chose this to be my 1000th revision if you have not seen it. Show it, stop doing what you're doing right now and go see it , You will not regret, trust me, it is one of the best television programs of all time! And I will continue to watch the show over and over again, I never tire of doing it! , Mr. Bean Rules! ***** of 5
