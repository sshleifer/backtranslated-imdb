I remember seeing this movie as a girl in the 60s. It took my breath away at a young age. I was glued to my seat in front of the black and white television. The cast was one of the best I've seen in my life. The musical was one of the greatest ever written. Please, to the Gershwin and Goldwyn families, publish this in a video or DVD so that current and future generations can experience what many of us have done when we saw this great work of art. It is not the work of this great man that is not seen for years. I am praying and hoping that the hearts of these families will soften and let the world see this great movie again.
