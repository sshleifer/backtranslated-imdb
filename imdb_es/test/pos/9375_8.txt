An intolerant soldier kills a man for being a Jew and tries to accuse him of a fellow soldier. It's not as good as the novel on which it was based ("The Brick Foxhole") in which a gay man was murdered ... but Hollywood would not play it in 1947. That said, it's still a very good movie. Anti-Semitism is handled very well, but it is insinuated in the audience that fanaticism is bad ... well, duh! But this was in 1947. The image is well interpreted by the entire cast (especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan) and the tone is very dark ... as it should be. Very atmospheric too. A great success deserved in his day ... it's worth seeing.
