Hoppity is a charming animated film, albeit a little phycadelic, which considering that it was made in 1941 has stood the test of time incredibly well. Now I have to admit that I have a weakness for "HoppityGoes To Town" (as it's called in the UK) after having watched a VHS version recorded on television by our parents many times with my brothers. I imagine my surprise when I woke up This morning, just in time to catch her on Channel Four (at 0615, however!) The film was as lovely as I remembered it, with time-tested animation and a charming moral tale that should attract parents and children. same. Maybe someday I will share this forgotten classic with my own children. With a good execution time for the children (88 min) and a simple but enveloping story, there really is something for everyone in this story that the little one is good. I really could see this being successfully reworked in CGI. Take note of Pixar.
