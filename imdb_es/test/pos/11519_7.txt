Fascinating and entertainingly bad, Lights of New York is the first totally talkative function and one that almost never saw the light. <br /> <br /> Two naive barbers (Eddie and Gene) from out of town get involved with the smugglers and end up facing a speech. When one of the smugglers shoots a policeman, the police begin to approach and the Falcon (who shot the officer) decides to accuse the murder of Eddie and tells his henchman to "take him for a walk". But it is the Hawk himself who takes the bullet in a turn that will surprise a few. <br /> <br /> Shot in a week at a cost of $ 23,000, "Lights" was originally conceived as a double, but Foy took advantage of Jack Warner's absence to extend it to six. When Warner discovered this, he ordered Foy to cut it back to the original short. Only when an independent exhibitor offered $ 25k for the film, did Warners really look at the movie, which became an astounding $ 1.3 million. <br /> <br /> Seen now, this is an extremely funny piece, with the performance ranging from the passable (Eugene Pallette) to the trance (Eddie's grandmother in a particularly laughable scene) and much of the interpretation is at the vaudeville level. Since it's an early talkie (4 partial talkies preceded it) that's all the characters do, and very slowly. The script feels improvised, the visual style is non-existent (apart from the shooting scene performed in silhouette) and the scenes are endless. The title cards are interspersed and announce characters and places redundantly. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, "Lights" is a convincing experience, since we see the actors and the team that fight with the alien technology and change the cinema forever. <Br /> <br /> Catch it if you can
