Warning: if Coen Brothers or David Lynch define your taste in movies, ignore this review and continue. <br /> <br /> Yes, I borrowed the "summary of a line" from the book about President Ronald Reagan, but among other virtues, this film emphasizes the character's role in the lives of honorable human beings. This movie is full of honest and decent people, and they have integrity to spare. In a word, they have "character". <br /> <br /> A little pinprick: unless you know the history of World War II, you probably do not know it, since the arrival of Captain Correlli on the island until the fall of Mussolini, 3 and a half years have passed . The average viewer might think that the romance was of the "whirlwind" variety. That is not like that. The romance develops slowly, which gives it dignity and meaning. The deliberate pace of the movie may be the way the director sets the time. <br /> <br /> Some critics have criticized Cage's Italian accent. The members of my family who speak Italian assure me that their accent is quite good. <br /> <br /> The story was right at the mark. Yes, the Germans turned against their Italian allies, who, for the most part, were reluctant allies from the start. If you find it striking, keep in mind that the French fleet of the Mediterranean was exploited by the British in 1940, just after the capitulation of France, so that it would not fall into the hands of the Vichy government, or worse, the Nazis. <br /> <The description of the Italians as educated and educated was a complement to an educated and cultured civilization. <br /> <br /> This movie was beautifully photographed, and its story was lyrical. The script did not make you think, nor was it smart, but here was a situation where confusion and intelligence were not necessary, nor would they have been appropriate. <br /> <br /> The story is tender, and the message is uplifting. The characters are honest, brave, serious, friendly and nice. It's a nice little movie. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
