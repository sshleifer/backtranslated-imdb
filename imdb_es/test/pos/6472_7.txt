Knute Rockne led an extraordinary life and his story is told quite well at Knute Rockne All American. We follow Rockne's incredible journey from a young Norwegian to an iconic American football legend. Produced in 1940, the film can sometimes seem a bit old-fashioned and, sometimes, downright boring. And the filmmakers put it a little thick at times as Rockne is brilliantly and lovingly portrayed. He may come out thinking that Rockne should have been nominated for sanctity when in reality he was, after all, just a football coach. But it is undeniable that it had a great impact on football and that it had a tremendous impact on the lives of many of the young people he trained. This movie shows the great impact it had and gives you an idea of ​​why it is so revered to this day. <br /> <br /> Playing Rockne, Pat O'Brien offers an impressive performance. It is indisputable that O'Brien's film must be taken and he makes the film and the character his own. The Rockne of real life was recognized as a great inspirational figure and O'Brien's performance will make you understand why. The only complaint comes at the beginning of the film when O'Brien, in her forties, plays college student Rockne at twenty. All the makeup in the world would not make it credible and the effect is rather jarring. But as Rockne's character ages and begins his legendary coaching career, O'Brien fits in perfectly. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, a name stands out and it is, of course, that Ronald Reagan plays the young. Charismatic, but finally condemned football star George Gipp. In the grand scheme of the film is not really a big part, with Reagan appearing for no more than 10-15 minutes. But performance has become legendary thanks to Reagan's famous "Win One for the Gipper" speech. It is a brilliant scene, full of emotion. It's possible that Reagan has not been on the screen for a long time in this movie, but it certainly had a tremendously positive impact on a winning performance. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film strikes a balance between football and life in general with Rockne having great lessons for his youth in both areas. For football fans (and history buffs), there is a rare treatment as the actual archive images of the Rockne era Notre Dame games are interspersed throughout the film. It is a unique opportunity to see how the game has evolved over the past six decades and an opportunity to see the legendary Rockne strategic innovations put into practice. If you're a Notre Dame fan, you'll probably enjoy the fact that Notre Dame's March of Victory offers a seemingly constant soundtrack for the movie. If you're an enemy of Notre Dame ... well, then you probably are not watching this movie anyway. Knute Rockne All American is an inspiring, stimulating and emotional film. Maybe a little too sentimental, but that's not so bad. It's a very nice movie, it's well worth taking the time to watch it.
