I saw this documentary film at the independent film festival Slamdance of 2005. This documentary is filmed, directed and edited by a son (Craig) of his mother's long battle with cancer. Filmed over the course of a year "The closer you get", it is a documentary in its most authentic form and offers you an inside view of the struggle of a family with the fight against cancer. Both in the family and in the individual throughout the process. I've never seen such an honest movie, this is a powerful and raw movie, and since it was not filmed by a stranger, you get the true emotions of everyone involved. Many documentaries are filmed by a stranger, but this story told by the son adds another emotional level to the film, unlike any other I've seen before on this subject or any other. This is a moving story that everyone should see and relate to. I would highly recommend it
