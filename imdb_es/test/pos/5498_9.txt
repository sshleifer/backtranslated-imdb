Simply a well done movie, well written and beautifully acted. Eastwood is a classic, since Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo has his own partner (and his love interest) Lilly Raines. But the greatness <br /> <br /> of the film rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as "Booth". Capture <br /> <br /> the anger and hatred of this character, as well as his humanity, curiously. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think this was his best performance and he should have received an Oscar <br /> <br /> for that (but I also loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive that year). In general, it's a great movie to see that you want to take a look at the mind of a killer and be <br /> <br /> on the edge of your seat all the way. Enjoy!!
