It's fun to see a young James Cagney doing his thing. Play the player of lowskate weights and measures who takes his work very seriously, stepping on the toes of a group of crooked politicians. He is offered the world, but maintains his integrity. He is beaten and set in motion, but that is the problem. We never know if he is really in danger. They say he is in a place, but he still seems to have carte blanche to move and do what he has to do. Sometimes he is so arrogant that he does not do much to protect himself. Your allies are in the police department, but almost everything else is pretty corrupt. He perseveres (almost too good to be true), of course, and we do it for him. The problem for me is the lack of sustained suspense. It would have been much better if he had had to clear his name. He never falls into the depths, even when his wife rejects him. It's still fun with the bad guys imploding. See him just to see Cagney make his tough guy posture.
