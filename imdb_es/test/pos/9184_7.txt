Having not seen the film in its commercial debut, we have just captured it through DVD. Expecting the worst, "Hitch" proved to be a pleasurable experience because of the three principles it contains. Thanks to the direction of Andy Tenant, the film has an easy rhythm and, although it is predictable, the comedy has some winning moments. <br /> <br /> Hitch is a kind of "dating coordinator" for losers like Albert, who is not exactly what one would consider a piece. However, Albert is a genuine guy who, without some professional help, would go unnoticed by the same women he would like to take out. Enter Hitch, to prepare him to overcome the obstacles he can not overcome, and although Albert is overweight and never manages to dominate social graces, he conquers us because he is real, in stark contrast to all the fans who make the rounds. in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> The basic mistake that most production designers make when preparing venues for Hollywood movies is that they are out of touch with reality. The apartments in which these characters are located are so rare to find that only by the magic of the cinema these people can live in places like these. Obviously, the majority of cinema people are dealing with fantasy, since most city dwellers kill for such fabulous spaces as those shown in the movies, and much less these same people represented in the film could not pay. <br /> <br /> Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a lovely way to love without doing much. However, the surprise of the film is Kevin James, who, like Albert's overweight, not only wins, but shows that he can defend himself in his scenes with Mr. Smith. Eva MÃ©ndez is fine as Hitch's main interest. In minor roles, we see Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport and Phillip Bosco, among others. <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is a fun movie to watch thanks to the inspired direction of Andy Tenant.
