While the work of the camera was certainly "funky", perhaps a Dutch short of "drugged", the premise of the film was fantastic. He really took a scathingly satirical look (in Hal Hartley's true tradition) to God, Jesus and the Devil. The interaction of Jesus and Satan provides some funny scenes ... Even the monologues of Jesus were great, this was the best Jesus I've ever seen. So relaxed, like Zen, the son of God, but still a good guy. On one level, this is a very general look at the paradoxes of Christianity, but there is still a personal level, in which you can relate to Jesus Christ without having a God Complex (thanks to Martin Donovan and Hal Hartley).
