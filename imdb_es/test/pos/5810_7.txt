Hammer House of Horror: Witching Time takes place in a rural area of ​​England at Woodstock Farm, where the stressed musician David Winter (Jon Finch) lives with his actress Mary (Prunella Gee) and is currently composing music for a horror movie. One night, while looking for his dog, Billy David finds a mysterious woman in his stable, who calls herself Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn) and claims to be a witch who has been transported for 300 years now. Obviously, quite skeptical, David finds it hard to believe her, so he locks her in a room on his farm and calls his doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to examine her, however, once he arrives and they enter the room, Lucinda has disappeared. Charles attributes it to David drinking too much, but on the next day strange and disturbing things start to happen to David & Mary ... <br /> <br /> Witching Time was episode 1 of the short life of the British anthology of horror series. produced by Hammer studios for TV and originally broadcast here in the United Kingdom during September 1980, the first of two episodes of Hammer House of Horror that will be directed by Don Leaver (episode 13, The Mark of Satan is the other), I really liked it. As a series, Hammer House of Horror dealt with several different subjects and all were disconnected from each other, except in name and as expected. The Observation Time is a sinister and effective story about a witch. The script of Anthony Read benefits from its duration of 50 odd minutes. and it moves at a good pace. The characters are pretty good as is the dialogue, here are some nice scenes and I liked the way it never reveals if David and Mary are going crazy or not. I think it's a well-structured, entertaining and quite spooky horror-themed television show that I enjoyed more than I thought. <br /> <br /> Being made for British television meant that the Hammer boys had a lower budget than normal, if that were possible, and as such, there are no gorgeous period settings here like in their films. Frankenstein and Dracula are better known, although the contemporary configuration in English gives it a certain atmosphere with which it can relate a little more. Another restriction based on television is that the levels of exploitation are lower than you might expect, there is some nudity and gore but not much, although I did not care too much because the story here is quite good. It's well done for what it is and Hammer's experience in his films probably helped them look pretty good, the acting is good and the genre's favorite, Ian McCulloch, makes a partial appearance. <br /> <br /> Witching Time It's a good start for the Hammer House of Horror series, since a 50-minute program on British television is pretty good, why do not they do a show like that here?
