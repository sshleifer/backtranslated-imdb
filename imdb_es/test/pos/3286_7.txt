Wesley Eure is the young inventor Brian Foster, who invented a new security device against crime in the form of a robot dog, the headline "C.H.O.M.P.S." (It is synonymous with HOMe canine protection system). C.H.O.M.P.S., who has been modeled after Brian's real dog, Rascal, can do almost anything; Has improved speed, strength, X-ray vision and the like. It's just what it takes to save the security company of his boss Ralph Norton (Conrad Bain). Naturally, a slimy competitor, Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants the advantage, so he tries to get his hands on the secret. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing that is too hard to resist. It has a lot of slapstick (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons play with a big pair of dumb idiots), an optimistic attitude, an attractive cast and enough good laughs to keep one entertained. The energetic disco-style music becomes repetitive but is undeniably catchy; The story is simple, and the dogs are absolutely adorable. In a completely strange but sideways touch, there is another dog in the movie (called "Monster") whose thoughts we really hear; Both his dialogue and the performer who makes the voice are priceless. In fact, he even uses a bit of blasphemy and his last words end the film with a very positive final note. <br /> <br /> Eure and the pretty Valerie Bertinelli are very kind youngsters, and their veterans support casting. The material with all the taste they can muster. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis and Regis Toomey are also co-stars. <br /> <br /> A rare live action theatrical adventure for Hanna and Barbera's team of cartoon creators ('The Flintstones', 'Scooby-Doo', 'The Smurfs', and so on), "CHOMPS" It's a pleasantly silly thing. I know he left me with a smile on my face. <br /> <br /> 7/10
