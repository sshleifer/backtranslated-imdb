This is a small gem of low budget, well acted. Alice, a teenager from a small town in Massachusetts, fed up with her existence, goes out to escape her mother, turns over her burgers and her own job as an exit assistant in a supermarket. She goes to Florida and stays with her richest friend in high school who is a freshman in Miami. After her car breaks suspiciously on the highway and loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in a recreational vehicle that also travels to Florida. and, it turns out, a prostitute and her pimp. Little by little, Alice is lured into prostitution at the truck stops as the RV winds its way down the highway toward Florida. Through intermittent flashbacks, we learn a little more about Alice and her desire to leave little Milford. We also see the couple under a new perspective and their life, and the choices made by the couple and Alice seem quite credible. An excellent movie well done in which you'll think when it's over.
