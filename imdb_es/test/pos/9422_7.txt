From 1942, the character of Sherlock Holmes, as portrayed by Basil Rathbone, was established in the then "modern" Britain. Many purists of Holmes have praised the first two entries of the series (produced by FOX), but discarded the 12 characteristics that followed. For my part, I was never an avid reader, and that's why I appreciate these films as they are without any initial bias. In fact, the WWII stage for this entry places it as a period piece with British propaganda evident throughout the film. The execution of the modern Holmes is handled much more carefully than the previous entry (Sherlock Holmes and The Voice of Terror) and the rates are much better for two reasons. First, Roy William Neil is on hand to direct (and would be for the rest of the series), and second, although Holmes confronts the Nazis, the inclusion of Professor Moriarty makes this feel more like a battle of the intellect between two rivals. . The performance of Lionel Atwill has been criticized by many for being very inferior to the one of George Zucco and Henry Daniel, but I feel that it is more the script than the interpretation of the personage. Especially after seeing that Atwill was very capable of being much more diverse and enthusiastic in other roles of horror. Basil Rathbone on the other hand is exceptional in this entry. It seems that he is having fun in the role of Holmes, but that is why I blame the writing. For example: the introduction of Holmes in the Voice of Terror tries to immediately establish how smart Holmes is as soon as it appears on the screen, while this film shows the brilliant deductions of Holmes, but also his shortcomings. Even at the climax, Holmes initially has the advantage, only for his blood to slowly drain from his body. Now, there are some flaws in this movie that I thought I could point to. First the opening; Do not the Germans deceive too easily? Maybe it's just me, but the book seller simply enters the bar, says he's going to make Tobel not only answer his door after weeks of hiding, but allow him to enter and then go for a walk with him. What!? Second, Tobel certainly puts everyone around him in danger. Leaving the secret parts of the bomb with scientific geniuses. Leaving the note with his fianc√©. What was I thinking? I was putting everyone in danger. I thought it was this magnificent scientist trying to save England? And it's not the whole concept of 'using it on them before they use it with us' a bit harsh. The obvious propaganda. Third, how was Holmes supposed to fit in the bottom of that chest? It is very small! In fact, the entire execution of Holmes finding Moriarty disguised as an ex-convict is not really explained as well. I've seen this movie more than fifty times and there are still parts like this that I find are executed in a very confusing way. Fourth, it's okay, so Holmes discovers that the first three scientists are dead and immediately assumes that Moriarty could not know the fourth man's name because he was not dead yet. Well, if Holmes did not know the name, how could he assume that? The guy could very well have been face down in a lake. Lucky guess. Fifth, again with confusion. When Holmes is supposedly dying on Moriarty's operating table, how can he recover so quickly? Surely he was acting as if he had lost a few pints of blood, but not enough to keep him from saving the day. Now, despite these flaws, this is a very entertaining movie. The costumes are well made, the mystery of the men dancing is well done (especially the back-to-back scenes of Holmes and Moriarty, who realized they were over analyzing them) and Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade is always an advantage. And as a final note, the interrogation scene still worries me a bit, I always thought it was one of the best-made sequences of the entire movie. In general, this movie has a special place with me, since it was the one that solidified my Rathbone as Holmes' obsession. A classic. 7/10.
