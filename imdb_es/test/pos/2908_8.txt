This Fox show was a great success when it was released in 1954. Produced in a sumptuous manner, with excellent music and scenarios, an intriguing cast, moves slowly but interestingly. Edmund Purdom is surprisingly handsome as an Egyptian who becomes a renowned doctor, juggling three amazing women: a maiden Jean Simmons who adores him passively, the tempting Bella Darvi who eludes him and the sister of a pharaoh, Gene Tieney, who wants him as his pharaoh. The popularity of the film has not diminished, since it was shown again in AMC (preferably in widescreen). Purdom is particularly large, his character apparently hits with women and ends up never married and is a "thinker". Darvi is amazing and tempting in her role as a fatal woman. Victor Mature, Michael Wilding, Peter Ustinov co-star. Check it out.
