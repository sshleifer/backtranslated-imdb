This lasted several years despite the late hour he was in. <br /> <br /> Like many crime dramas of the '80s, it seemed cold. Both physically and figuratively. Although this is not a bad thing. And the (obviously) low budget really worked in his favor. Gritty during a time when he was "slippery". <br /> <br /> The segments of Allan Royal when the news editor gave him a slight advantage. <br /> <br /> The only actors I remembered were Scott Nylands Earthquake) and Tony Rosato (SCTV). The cast of hardly known people was a good thing because you could see the group as a whole and not as a group of people who supported a 'star'. And yes, it's a young Clark Johnson (Homicide) in a recurring place. <br /> <br /> I hope there is a DVD release in the future. Does someone out there want to put on that?
