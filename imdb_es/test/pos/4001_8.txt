Chi-hwa-seong (Painted Fire) chronicles the life of the Korean painter Jang Seong-ub in the midst of the changing political landscape of the late nineteenth century in Korea. <br /> <br /> However, the themes of this film focus on the process of artistic creation through the fire of the artist's desire and the expectations and demands of his audience and society. <br /> <br /> Jang seong-ub is masterfully interpreted as a complex character that changes from the innocent emotion of youth to a hardened alcoholic tortured soul. This characterization reflects the young enthusiastic artist who finds it increasingly difficult to invoke the spirit of artistic creation within himself without letting the creative shoot himself through drink, erections and desire. <br /> <br /> Although this development of the character continues In general, gradually through the film, Jang's emotional complexity still reproduces in a constantly oscillating way, until the end of the film. Curiously, the montage of the film is parallel to the emotion or the fire of the artist in constant change and apparently wild, since the scenes pass without problems from one time and place to another without any conventional "signal" to the audience that such Scene change will happen. For example, many scenes would apparently change in the middle of the conversation at another point and location. <br /> <br /> The visual scenario of the film is presented beautifully and also ranges from a black and white (and perhaps desolate) black and white stage. to more colorful and vivid environments that, again, are parallel to Jang's paintings, either in simple black ink on white paper or with added color. The rainbow of color is introduced into the film at moments when the artist observes nature and especially the women who are then reflected in his paintings. <br /> <br /> The theme of an artist's individual desire to create against the expectations and demands of society emerges in the film through several points, including class distinction, government domination over the artist , the accepted norms of the artistic elite and the basic desires of the common masses. Instead of creating his own completely original works, Jang finds himself recreating masterpieces by other artists throughout East Asia. Therefore, the question arises as to whether recreation in itself merits artistic merit. <br /> <br /> I would like to be more familiar with the political events of the period to understand how they were linked to history, but beyond any comparison with the current role of the Korean government in artistic expression and / or censorship. I can not comment <br /> <br /> In general, an extremely well-acted film and cinematography is often impressive. A great movie to watch and then reflect on.
