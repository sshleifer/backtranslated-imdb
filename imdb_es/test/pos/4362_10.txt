Little Dieter Needs to Fly was my first film during the 1999 edition of the Gothenburg Film Festival. Since I was very tired that night, I hesitated to see it, but the overall score of 9 here at IMDB made me go there. <br /> <br /> It was 80 minutes of pure life force! Experiencing the life of Dieter Denglers through his own story was enchanting. <br /> <br /> SEE IT! And if it's possible ... Watch it in a movie theater!
