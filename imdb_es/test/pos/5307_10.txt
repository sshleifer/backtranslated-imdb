This is an excellent movie and it was immediately placed in my top ten (trust me, I know the movies!). It's one of the movies that really makes you think, not necessarily about the story but about yourself! The film is about a fifteen-year-old boy (Leland Fitzgerald) who kills an autistic child. They send him to the juvenile room where he meets Pearl Madison, his teacher. His relationship with Pearl grows slowly and, finally, Pearl decides to write a story about Leland and his companions, but as he gets closer to discovering Lelands's motive, he learns that he must first deal with his own problems. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and a must see with good music from the elves and a fantastic score. Look at it!
