Much more than ANY other movie of that period, Night of the Demons represents the incredibly funny and brainless pastiche of horror. It's a lot of fun with a lot of nasty make-up effects, beautiful teenagers (and horny ones) and adorable clich√© elements. A group of party animals, led by the alternative Angela, will celebrate Halloween in an abandoned funeral home that leads to a mysterious urban legend. Everything begins typical and "innocent" with dancing, drinking and occasional flirting among young people who can not keep their hormones under control, but very soon a bloodthirsty demon possesses the hostess. In the most ingenious way you've ever seen, the rest of the cast brutally kills only to return like horrible creatures that haunt blood. What makes this movie better than most of the horror films of the 80s is that there is a good balance between the stunned field and the atmospheric horror. Some sequences are really spooky and the setting of the funeral home gives Night of the Demons an excellent tone. Director Tenney makes great use of the pieces (coffins, a crematory, infinite and dark corridors) and his young and enthusiastic cast obviously loves what they are involved with. Of course, the obvious aspects for love and horror are absolutely delightful for fans who love the large number of limbs cut off, eyes peeled and skulls crushed! The highlight, however, is Linnea Quigley's trick with the disappearing lipstick! This nympho bimbo pushes a whole tube of lipstick on his nipple and continues his sexual assassination spree! Great! Night of the Demons received two sequels during the 90s and, although it's still worth checking out, they focus more on comedy than chills.
