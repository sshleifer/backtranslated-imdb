King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm) of Romania is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with humanity. But his son, Radu (Anders Hove), is a cruel creature to his heart (which is quite obvious as soon as you see him). Three female students have come to study local folklore, but they are trapped in vampire legends at the wrong time: Vladislav has been killed. <br /> <br /> Who can say something bad about a movie with an Angus cameo? Scrimm? I can not I mean, I had some low expectations after seeing other photos of the Full Moon ("Puppet Master" in particular, and "Demonic Toys"). But despite the really bad animation effects of the demons, this movie was really very well made and very fun to watch. A lot of blood, a good plot and a background story (Bloodstone's story was surprisingly refreshing) and even some new angles on vampire myths, which one would think would already be dead. (Maybe I'm wrong, but this is probably the first movie in which they throw rosaries with a gun.) Apart from vampires and blood, you get a part of the nudity (free, but welcome) and I had to notice the excellent score of composers (I'm not sure who deserves credit, but those involved include Stuart Brotman, Richard Kosinski, William Levine, Michael Portis and John Zeretzka). This is horror 101 all the way. Hell, you even have two sequels, which is the sign of a real horror movie. (Of course, some bad films also have sequels, did I mention "Puppet Master"?) The Romanian theme was well done, and the movie seems to have been made by Romanians if I am guessing its origins correctly. And the score, the music, really stood out for being a good change of pace, very atmospheric. I like Richard Band, but I'm glad that another composer has been given an opportunity because he stuck the atmosphere in his head. If you like vampire movies and want a small variation (one of the varieties of Eastern Europe), it's worth seeing.
