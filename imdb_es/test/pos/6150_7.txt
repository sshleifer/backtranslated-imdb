Instead of seeing the recycled history of "Pearl Harbor" with nothing new to reveal, except for a couple of real events involving a few individuals, so the creators of the film could say that they contributed to the dissemination of the story, together with nothing more than CGI. Explosions filling for a sappy romantic triangle. One should go to see the dark blue world. <br /> <br /> This film takes place during the historical epoch of the Second World War, in which the Czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the RAF instead of laying down their arms and surrendering to the Nazis . It was a part of history that should at least be told once to the outside world. A love triangle takes place between the main characters, but one of them does not die conveniently as in Pearl Harbor, but through the sacrifice for true friendship. The film is tragedy after tragedy, without even a bittersweet ending, with our hero without enjoying the glory of regaining his country, the return of love for his current lover, the return of love for his reunified lover or even the return of the unconditional. Love for your pet long life. He is absolutely disconsolate and does not feel worse in the Russian labor camp. This type of ending is something that Hollywood would probably change if it were his script. <br /> <br /> The movie plays a little on the sentimental at times, but it also shows the humanity of the people. In general, a movie that is worth it.
