"Four Daughters" introduced John Garfield to the public, and that is what is most remembered from this movie today. Unlike some actors who appear in several films before their screen images, Garfield established hers immediately, with a cigarette hanging from his mouth and talking about the fates that oppose him. <br /> <br /> It's actually the story of four girls, their father widowed musician (Claude Rains) and their various suitors, one of whom, Felix, is played by the handsome Jeffrey Lynn. He is the one everyone is in love with, but he is in love with Buff (Priscilla Lane). Then he meets Mickey Borden, who also falls in love with her. When Buff realizes that one of her sisters is in love with Felix, she leaves him at the altar and marries Mickey. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty fictitious story given life (and sequels) by acting. Garfield was already mentioned, but Priscilla Lane was by far the strongest daughter, the most interesting and the best actress. Jeffrey Lynn was a new and attractive protagonist, and this movie put him on his feet with Warners. However, true stardom should not be. Like many others of the time, he entered the service, and when he left, he had a Bronze Star, but not a great career. Later he went to television and the real estate sector. Claude Rains is warm and wonderful like the patriarch. <br /> <br /> So popular was "Four Daughters" that it inspired "Four Wives" and "Four Mothers", as well as reuniting a large part of the cast again in "Daughters Brave" where the actors played different characters. <br /> <br /> Very nice, a nice memory of simpler and probably happier times, and the chance to see John Garfield in his first movie.
