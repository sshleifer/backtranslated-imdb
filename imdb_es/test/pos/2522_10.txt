This film has an outstanding performance, by Marilia Pêra, and an impressive performance by Argentinian Héctor Babenco. This is, in my opinion, the best Brazilian film ever made. The film was filmed with a child from the 'favelas', the Brazilian ghettos. The children were not actors and were broadcast by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children who are arrested in the correctional prison, which looks much worse than Alcatraz. The children are constantly raped and beaten by the police. Unfortunately this is not purely fiction, in Brazil it happens until today. A must for those who like violent movies. But take your mother out of the room, because it's a difficult movie.
