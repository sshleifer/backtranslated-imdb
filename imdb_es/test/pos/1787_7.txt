After "My Name Is Barbra" in 1965, and filmed in bright colors, "Color Me Barbra" has Streisand alternating nostalgia, clown comedy, female romantic anguish and the seductive seriousness of an hour of crazy gossip dazzle. She is a cut and a fatal woman, a sprite and an enigma. With her Egyptian eye makeup and her ever changing hairstyles, she is also a chameleon. His voice is rich and moving, even if some of his songs are not ("One Kiss", "Yesterdays"). The circus sequence is not as intriguing as the trip to the museum (with the idea that Barbra has become the images of the paintings, an idea that works better than you think). The circus-medley (built around songs with the word "face"!) Is a very pretty girl without really being charming. Still, this is an animated and eye-catching special, not so emotionally tempting as "My name is Barbra," but it's certainly a sophomore effort.
