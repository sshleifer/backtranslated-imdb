My skating career ended in 1974 when my two-four skateboard with steel skate wheels hit a rock and I fell, for days it seemed, down the sidewalk outside of my parents' house in Boston. When the cast left my arm, the summer was gone. <br /> <br /> But I have always admired the types of X-games and especially the surfers. I think I spent the first month after moving to Southern California on the beaches and jetties watching the surfers, lamenting the fact that I had lost my call. It's the kind of thing you should learn young, before the horrible senses of self-preservation and self-consciousness are introduced. Or, if not, in the best case, you'll be so worried about not hurting yourself or not laughing, you'll end up watching. Like a trained bear. <br /> <br /> I always admired that a good surfer seems to care nothing more than that moment, that wave, that experience. At one with the forces of nature. A good surfer makes it look like there's nothing but that wave right there, and the way you interact with it. I have a lot of Zen. <br /> <br /> This documentary describes how some young people took surf concepts and extended them to skateboarding. Ramps, degradations, low sweep curves when interacting with cement waves under your feet. In its day and time, all this was new. radical. Before the Zephyr Skate team, the idea was apparently to go as fast as you could in a straight line on a skateboard, hence my long "Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace", like falling on the sidewalk. <br /> <br /> This film is a retrospective look through time, to an America before ALL was labeled, labeled, marketed and forced by our throats as "Extreme". (Seriously, what's "extreme" an "extreme value meal" in Taco Bell? Apart from the fact that it is an extreme danger to your colon ...) <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and see the Birth of 'extreme sports'. Before the X games, before Boom-boom Huck-Jam, before Crusty Demons, before ASA ... there were these young street urchins that created "extreme sports" without really trying. They only did it for purity, pure pleasure, to skate in the sun with friends. <br /> <br /> I hope they get some of the 'extreme' money there is. God knows they do not get the credit they deserve. Maybe this movie can correct that. <br /> <br /> Excellent film with a great soundtrack, a portrait of a Southern California, in fact an America, that no longer exists. <br /> <br /> I do not. He worries about Sean Penn but he does a decent job in the narrative.
