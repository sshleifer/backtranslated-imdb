I was very curious to see this exit from Wajda-Depardieu, besides the period of time is definitely fascinating. Being a fan of Wajda, I was disappointed, and that may be an understatement. The film never really took flight cinematographic: there is no foundation for the animosity between Danton and Robespierre, etc. <br /> <br /> Basically, the script was weak (adapted from "The Danton Affair"). And yet, the direction was masterful ... it's Wajda, after all! In addition, there were some incredible actors BUT they never attract the attention of the public as they should. Depardieu appears as a carefree and almost dumb Danton ... it is not exactly the image we have in mind. Wojjech Pzsoniak is amazing, as usual, but once again, the script limits even the most talented actors who can not break. Andrzej Seweryn and Bogoslaw Linda appear as Bourdon and Saint-Just ... and if you are familiar with Wajda, then you would know them. <br /> <br /> In general, I was disappointed. very praised movie. Great cast, great director, but without foundation of quality. Bad writing, not dynamic. We need to enter the mentality of Danton (Walesa) and Robespierre (General J) ... what are your motivations? Eh ... who knows? Do you like women, the other you dust? The light Ok, so if you are looking for a great film of the French Revolution, I HIGHLY recommend "La Revolution Francaise" ... it is divided into two parts and it is very good! Excellent performances, in-depth scripts, juicy tid bits ... Definitely a satisfying experience! Klaus-Maria Brandauer is much better Danton than Depardieu ... the wonderful Andrzej Seweryn apparently took some notes from "Danton" and is BRILLIANT like Robespierre. LOOK AT IT! NOW! As for Wajda fans, you're better off with "Man of Iron / Marble," "Promised Land," and the like. Cheers!!
