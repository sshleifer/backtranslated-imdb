At first I did not think I would like this movie, but as it went on it got better and better. I love music and I was impressed by how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also likes the movie a lot because of his music and the story and the way the story developed, slowly showing how Corelli won the hearts of the girls. The acting and the story were well done and well directed. At first, Corelli's bravado was annoying, but it soon grew on you. The twists in the plot were intriguing, especially the relations with the Germans. I would like to see this again to follow all the lateral plots. I also want to buy the soundtrack to listen to the music again.
