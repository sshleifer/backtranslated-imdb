<br /> <br /> The kind of movie that demands too much from the public, but that disappoints most of them. I think of the Mexican people who (either in an attempt to support Mexican films or wanting to watch a movie of the best Mexican stars) saw it, half of the people left the theater when I went to see it, it's definitely not the kind of movie that one could wait. I also think of people from other countries who dared to spend 2 hours watching it until the end, "what a piece of shit". To understand Chronicle of a breakfast, one has to be Mexican, and one has to be familiar with the lower middle classes (or, better yet, be part of them). There is nothing accidental in this film, the family is and has what many families, at least in Mexico, share. You have to see it with an open mind to accept it completely, it's not the kind of movie you completely understand after watching it. The older brother would not let anyone sit on his RED couch, the sister stays no matter how he wants to leave, the younger brother goes hiking and all he cares about is the yellow radio, the mother has to prepare breakfast for the family, no matter how tense and unbearable the situation. The father returned later, who knows how long, which allows the mother to live a night of passion that somehow is momentary, and ends up repeating all the attitudes of her children ... The stories in the house are surreal (and that's the movie), a travestito looking for his penis, a worker in a factory and his suicide attempt, subtilized by the kisses of his girlfriend, a fat man who rides his bicycle after an interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister. wife? Mother? ... Music does not pretend too much, but it achieves a lot, no more than a box, a saucer, some strings. Thank you, it was made and launched a movie like this. <br /> <br /> One of the best Mexican films in history! And one of the least understood, even by the Mexicans themselves, no matter how identified they have felt with it. . <br /> <br />
