Since this caricature was done in the old days, Felix speaks with cartoon bubbles and the animation style is very crude compared to today. However, compared to his contemporaries, it is a pretty good caricature and still holds up well. That's because despite his age, the caricature is very creative and fun. <br /> <br /> Felix runs into a man whose shoe business is folding because he can not sell shoes. Well, Felix needs money to go to Hollywood, so he tells the guy at the store that he will sell all the shoes. Felix distributes gum throughout the city and soon people get stuck and leave their shoes, rushing to buy new ones in the shoe store. In gratitude, the boy gives Felix $ 500! However, the owner of Felix wants to take the money and go alone, so Felix finds a way to sneak away. <br /> <br /> Once there, Felix bursts into a studio and gets a little annoyed himself. Along the way, he encounters comic book versions of Ben Turpin and Charlie Chaplin. In the end, however, through luck, Felix is ​​discovered and offered a movie contract. Hurrah!
