Based on the book by Mika Waltari, this second CinemaScope film that has been made is full of rich color, beautiful music and a panoramic show. The argument is sometimes confused with a contrite wording, but in general it has a strong social content: man is governed by his emotions, and each action has an equal consequence. But to really enjoy this movie, first watch the movie, then read the book. Although it is different, it sheds light on many things that were not seen on the screen and breathes some more of the depth of Sinuhe.
