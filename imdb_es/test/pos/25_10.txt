This is a film that deserves another look, if you have not seen it for a while, or a first look, if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on a play of the same name, it is the story of an older actor who runs a Shakespeare repertoire company in England during World War II. It's about the stress of trying to play a Shakespeare every night while facing problems like the bombed-out theaters and a company made up of older or physically disabled actors: young people with bodies are capable of being taken into military service. It also deals with your relationship with several members of your company, especially with your dresser. So far everything seems pretty boring, but nothing could be further from the truth. Although in general it is tragic, the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high. The two male leaders received Oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama, theater, especially Shakespeare, or who has worked behind the scenes anywhere. The behind-the-scenes events are another facet of the film that will be fascinating to most viewers.
