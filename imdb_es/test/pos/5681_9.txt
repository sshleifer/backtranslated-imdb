I put this film on not expecting much, apart from a B Bore Fest movie. Fortunately, they presented me with a very well made film, which raised the suspense and managed to maintain it during all its execution time. This was an impressive achievement. The performance was solid, creating characters that interested you and with whom you related; and although some may find the movie slow, it forced you to think about what you would have done in the same situation. In addition to this, there was a good camera work and the directors did everything in an admirable way. An excellent effort then, which is well worth your time if you prefer the development and the suspense instead of the gore.
