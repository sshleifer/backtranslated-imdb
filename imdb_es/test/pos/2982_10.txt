Michelle, Anic√©e Alvina, was very kind, and I really fell in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Actually the best movie of my youth. The "repeating stations" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever ... Please, if you know where I can find a VHS for the movie, send me an email! My husband of 26 years and I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still is. I think we both cry our eyes. I think we were possibly attracted to the movie by the music of Elton John, but then we were swept away by the adolescent anguish of all this. Paul and Michelle were almost the same age when we saw the movie, very easy to identify! It's wonderful to know that Sean is doing well, I'm also in the "helping professions" (RN). I thought that his performance was good and very credible. "Michelle" was very sweet, fragile and vulnerable. I think the main issue is that if they did not have to deal with the "real world", then they could be happy and still in love. How many times have we all wanted to have a "Calgon moment"? If we all had no external concerns and could deal with our "basic needs", it could be something easier. I have a 15-year-old daughter and I would not have any problem watching this movie ... Children see much worse these days that this is very docile. For those of you who are trying to locate the CD, my husband (a big Elton John fan) was able to get a 2 CD set that came out in 1992. It's called "Polygram Studios", "Elton John-rare teachers". This has all the songs of the friends, as well as many others. As far as we know, this is the only CD with the music "Friends". We also had the LP years ago and we were delighted to find the CD. Good luck. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the theme of "young love". I wish I was only on DVD now !!
