This was much better than I expected, the film oozing professionalism compared to other B-moive of this kind of budget. The script was good if a bit formulated, but the performance was surprisingly good for everyone, including Lorenzo, and good standards from Scheider and Busey are always expected. Besides the good plot and good acting, the action is good, especially the car chases and the crashes are class A. In general, this is an increase above other B movie thrillers and does not have to depend on the Constant nudity or a flow of cheesy word games to make up for the shortcomings of budget and script, is definitely worth a rent.
