In 1242, Russia was invaded by two sides: from the East by the Mongols and from the side of Europe, by the German Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. The city of Novgorod is the last free city in Russia. The population, to organize the defense of Novgorod and the lands of Russia, calls Prince Aleksandr Nevsky, who had defeated the Swede in a previous battle. His successful strategy defeats the Germans, after a great battle on a frozen lake. This film was made in 1938 due to the threat of the German to Russia, in a period before the Second World War. The idea was to make pro-Russian propaganda. However, it is a striking, wonderful and powerful masterpiece. It's amazing the battle scene on the frozen lake. The current generation is very used to special effects, as in the trilogy of 'The Lord of the Rings', and may not understand how fantastic is this fight in black and white. If the spectator can forget the ideology and see it as an art, he will surely be surprised at the end with a similar masterpiece. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Alexander Nevsky
