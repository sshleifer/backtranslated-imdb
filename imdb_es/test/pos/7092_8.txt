Kate Gulden, played by one of the most nominated actresses of the last decade of this century, and also one of the most talented actresses, Meryl Streep (Out of Africa). She is wonderful is every part that plays. The Yale graduate is the pride and joy of American cinema. <br /> <br /> Kate's health is deteriorating and her husband, George, well-developed role by brilliant actor and also Oscar-winner, William Hurt (Smoke, Kiss of the Spider Woman) has difficulty with the deterioration of the health of his only true thing, and seek the help of his daughter. The poor daughter, Ellen Gulden, Ren√©e Zellweger (Jerry Maguire) has waited too much for her. There are no breaks! The story has a very realistic view of a father's illness. In this film, the only daughter has to put her life on hold to meet the needs of others. There is always one in each family that faces that kind of responsibility. Ellen is angry at the beginning of the film, but as time goes on she ends up understanding her mother's dedication to life. She even asks her mother: How do you do yours, every day, inside and outside, and nobody notices? That's what women do, a lot of what I call invisible work. In addition, we clean, we arrange, we mennd, we stretch, we celebrate, we are the best friends, we are confidants, the lover, the promoters, the disciplinary, the sensitive. Some of us, like both women in this film, have the perfect education, we are the psychological pillar for the whole family and we also do all that invisible work. That's Kate Ellen, and many women in our society. Many of us have already gone through that stage of life when our parents grow old and die. I have been there. They were just too young. I have thanked my parents, but I never understood them as well as when I had to play their roles, and I had to walk in their shoes. This film reflects the reality of life. Maybe it's sad, but that's life, sometimes. George, a Harvard professor, is a complicated person, who seems to think his work is more important than everyone else, and has a "teacher / servant" mentality towards women in his life. He is not strong enough to cope. If you want to see a good performance and the reality of life do not miss this movie. Favorite scenes: The restaurant that comes to Kate, violins and everything. The making of a broken porcelain table. May I be so symbolic! We are all broken glasses! Favorite phrases: George: "It's only when you go uphill, when you realize you're really going downhill." George: "You have an education at Harvard, but where is your heart?" <br /> <br />
