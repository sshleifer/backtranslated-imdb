The Thing is a milestone in the creation of films and remains one of my favorite movies of all time. Despite the movie's roots in science fiction, it's ultimately a horror movie that brilliantly balances splash with psychological trauma. Today, more than twenty-five years after its launch, special effects stand out as an example of brilliance and effects that the man Rob Bottin suffered a complete physical failure for his art. It would be impossible to make the same movie today, since the studio would surely insist on choosing a female character or a type of Paul-Walker. <br /> <br /> An American science team consisting exclusively of men in Antarctica is mired in confusion. when an alien life form capable of absorbing and perfectly imitating other forms of life infiltrates its camp. Their mutual trust crumbles steadily as they become increasingly insecure about who is real and who is an imitation, and this scenario of "body snatchers" sees their numbers dwindle as they fall victim to The Thing. When cornered, it manifests as a different nightmare creature, the metamorphosis is always horrifying and convincing. <br /> <br /> The impotence, isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men who have no way of getting out of their situation or form of help to reach them is supported by experts. The long hours of darkness and the growing snowfall provide a gloomy backdrop to the terror that unfolds. Director John Carpenter carefully selected a team of brilliant character-characters and each member of the team fits perfectly into the role they play, be it the young and wise street chef, the elderly and wise doctor or the bitter and cynical helicopter . pilot. The point is that nobody here comes close to being an American badass superhero with blond locks and a pack of six, and the true strength of the film is due in large part to this realism. People who suffer on screen are recognizable in our daily lives. <br /> <br /> The Thing remains always pleasant and emotional even after repeated visits. Now I have seen the film on more than twenty different occasions and my astonishment at the quality of direction, acting and special effects is unwavering. My girlfriend prefers the split in the high school of the film, "The Faculty", which is a good and solid entertainment, but much more cheerful and cheerful. However, she still loves and recognizes the brilliance of The Thing, and thank God for that ... because I could not be in the company of someone who did not love this movie. <br /> <br /> A classic and then some.
