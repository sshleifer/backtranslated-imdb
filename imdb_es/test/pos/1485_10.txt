The decade of 1990 was a great decade for the British comedy with many popular creations as ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS THE FINE BLUE LINE, THE BRITTAS EMPIRE and MEN BEHAVING MADLY reaching the television screens for the first time. <br /> <br /> However, MR. BEAN is, without a doubt, the best comedy of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> MR. BEAN represents the first major attempt at a throwback to the era of great silent artists such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for several decades. It brings to the audience a single character, Mr. Bean, played to perfection by Rowan Atkinson. <br /> <br /> Many people who have commented on this page, as well as in the forums of this and other websites, have been compromised. in discussions about whether or not Mr. Bean has a mental disability or if he has significant learning difficulties resulting from such a disability. However, I think this debate is unnecessary because I very much doubt that the creators of this program would expect anyone in the audience, for a single moment, to even consider Mr. Bean in that context. <br /> <br /> Mr. It is shown that Bean is a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems on his own without the guidance of others. Some of their methods to tackle everyday tasks, such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist, are addressed in a strange way for anyone who sees the show. This is where humor drifts. Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he may be an eccentric person used to treating things his way. And, of course, some of his methods for completing a task often result in a disaster, which we then see Mr. Bean try to solve. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, we see Mr. Bean show a bad patch, often trying to compete with those around him or play jokes on those who least expect it. However, at the end of the day no harm is done to anyone and the results are always reassuring. <br /> <br /> Unlike most examples of British comedy in the last 30 years, MR. BEAN is a simple, harmless and harmless entertainment with U rating, that everyone can enjoy in the family. It is for this reason that the television series became a great success in dozens of countries around the world. It is also the reason why it will still be remembered in several decades from now, when many other television programs will have arrived, gone and forgotten. <br /> <br /> Some critics claim that the program only attracts kids, but I just laugh. both in Mr. Bean's antics as I did when I first saw the episodes as a child in the 1990s. Rowan Atkinson has used his natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem as fun in the replays of videos as the first time. <br /> <br /> The TV series has generated two spin-off movies, BEAN and LORD. BEAN VACATION. As expected, a familiarity with the kind of humor shown in the television series does not translate into success on the big screen. The two films do little justice to the television series and fail to really capture the magic of the episodes. The biggest flaw in both films may lie in the change of scenery. In both films, the producers remove Mr. Bean from his usual British environment to America (the first film) and France (the second film). As a result, the characters in the movie around Mr. Bean respond differently to their behavior than their counterparts in the television series. Both films reuse gags from the television series, and the evidence shows that the gags were correctly made the first time. In the second film, it is shown that Mr. Bean is behaving out of character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem more foolish than fun. On several occasions, I found myself thinking that the character I was looking at was not Mr. Bean, but a pale caricature. It is clear that Rowan Atkinson was not having as much fun as in the television series. His heart was simply not in the performance. After the second movie came out, he publicly declared that he would not play Mr. Bean again. I realize how he felt. <br /> <br /> Upon returning to the television series, each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and execution in each scene. Even the weakest episode is still very nice and is far ahead of the two films. <br /> <br /> My favorite episodes are the first three, which establish the high level that I should continue. I think the final episode is the weakest, but still hilarious. <br /> <br /> To summarize, MR. BEAN is a really excellent comedy for the whole family. Rowan Atkinson is a true comic book genius and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this television series. My recommendation - see and enjoy. But you only see the movies if you consider yourself a big fan after watching the television series.
