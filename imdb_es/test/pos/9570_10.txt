This is the best of the films (so far) that Christopher Guest has created using his talented cast. Previously, they had done the excellent WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and, following BEST IN SHOW, they did the very nice A MIGHTY WIND. As for the latter, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, the less said, the better. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular. Follow these few dogs chosen from the preparations before the show until the big night in which one of them is the best chosen for the show in the fictional "Mayflower Kennel Club". However, none of these people is enthusiastic about dog shows, but talent improvisation actors who parody many of the common types of people in the world of dog shows. Surprisingly, even though the characters are quite extravagant, there is a lot of truth in the personalities that are parodying. Like decades ago, I had some experience with dog shows and this is a group of people VERY aggressive! My dog ​​owners' favorites were the incredibly tall and tense yuppie couple that only exuded anger and volatility. I also loved the openly gay couple, as they were terribly funny and intelligent. However, the best performance probably was not from any of the pairs but from Fred Willard, who played the most stupid and least talented announcer in the world in the history of mankind. His comments were uniformly unhealthy and, often, he was betrayed as an incredibly stupid person: I do not know how he became the announcer of such a prestigious show. The other contestants who participated were also quite funny: the high-priced professional poodle handler and his rich owner, the country boy and his dog, as well as Winkie's "parents", who could barely get together enough to get to the show . <Br /> <br /> Despite the improvised style of film making, all the pieces fit beautifully and tell a very funny and compelling story, one that is NOT just for dog owners. Exceptional performance made this one of the best comedies of the last decade. By the way, try to find this on a DVD, since the extras are really worth seeing. Although a bit painful to watch, I loved seeing Harlan Pepper and his collection of beach balls in particular.
