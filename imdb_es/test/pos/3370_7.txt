The trailer does not go anywhere and only rubs the surface of the film, and rightly so, not because it has the obligation to keep its real narrative secret, but because what actually happens, will cause completely different questions, some of which They are frustratingly not answered in the movie, leaving you to your own device to interpret the series of events. Which, of course, means a lot of material for a post-show discussion. <br /> <br /> Metaphorically, the picture refers to how humans tend to subconsciously conceal ourselves in situations or things in everyday life, and how they tend our closed thoughts. to see things from a certain perspective, rarely outside the box. There is a speech delivered near the end by one of the characters that will leave you reflecting on this fact, which governs the basis of the entire film, and even focuses on existentialism, where our bodies are mere containers for the soul, and from the cradle to the end. The tomb we put ourselves in more boxes of a way of life. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about the film, is how it tried to sound smart through the frequent abandonment of secret government agencies like the CIA and NSA, as if there was something overtly clandestine about these agencies from which we should be aware They have no other purpose than to put every action and every person under scrutiny, which no one can trust, wreaking havoc in a sense for both the characters and the audience as we try to keep up with the trust issues to help in the interpretation. of the narrative. Having established it in 1976, in a NASA context on manned space missions, and in Langley, Virginia, also provided that sense of distrust that will undermine your energies when you sit down patiently. <br /> <br /> Based on The Tale Button, Button written by Richard Matheson and turned into an episode of Twilight Zone, follows the Lewis family, where Arthur (James Marsden) works at NASA and develops a prosthetic foot for his teacher, wife Norma (Cameron Diaz.), and one would think that he is a happy family with his son Walter (Sam Oz Stone), until one day a mysterious man named Arlington Steward (Frank Langella in a facial effect inspired by two faces) who we prefer in the opening. , comes knocking and giving them a Deal or No Deal button in a box. Press the button and you will get a million dollars (we are talking in terms of 70's dollars here) although a stranger will die. If they do not, well, the agreement has an expiration date. <br /> <br /> History would dictate that an agreement be made, which, of course, triggers a mysterious sequence of events that unfold, with even more somber characters (who appear with nosebleeds), some of whom they are inexplicably like zombies, apparently all under the influence, or employment, or Arlington Steward. Whether Steward is Death or not, a clandestine government employee, a messenger from God or a representative of Aliens after an anal test, remains unanswered, so you look at it, it's as if you're delivering something expected, just begging humanity to do it. Shake off your innate greed so that your work can be interrupted and return to wherever it comes. <br /> <br /> If you need a small distraction from the disparate scenes that make up the narrative, the production is set and the art direction is great to recreate the style of the 70s, while you try to discover the mystery of the consequences that they are derived from a result of not fully understanding the fine print. It is a complete circle of this examination of human nature, of our greed for immediate gratification, which manifests its result in long-term pain, confusion, and other choices we will make based on real sacrifices. Also great special effects come into play, although it only leaves more room for the genre of the film. <br /> <br /> So, is it horror, science fiction or a mystery thriller? Actually, everything is rolled into one, along with a hint of the philosophical. Do not expect a direct narrative film with clean and easy answers at the end? This is like an episode of X-Files on steroids.
