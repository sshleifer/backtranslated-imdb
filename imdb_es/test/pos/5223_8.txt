044: The Big Trail (1930) - published on 10/24/1930; seen on 5/4/06. <br /> <br /> BIRTHS: Richard Harris, Harold Pinter, Robert Atkins. <br /> <br /> DOUG: In Hollywood, Raoul Walsh unveiled his latest film, The Big Trail, a western on the westward trek across the border, starring promising actor John Wayne, 23 year old. In 1930, we are seeing many "first" but few "better". In addition to John Wayne's first film, we have here the first wide-screen movie (although we only saw the full-frame version). Interestingly, the decision to shoot on widescreen was essentially the same reason why widescreen became popular later: to compete with television, which had not yet appeared commercially but was still an emerging curiosity. Anyway, this movie was extremely good, it gave us an anguished look on the trip to Oklahoma. The initial letters of the title allow us to know that this is a western of the most traditional type, about America, about the earth, about who should live, etc., and it is an excellent demonstration of it. Walsh gives us some amazing images of the wagon company in the desert (when they reach a cliff, they must tie each wagon one by one), and we also get a secondary plot of revenge in which Wayne chases the man who killed one of them. his friends. (I seem to remember something similar in Stagecoach). Wayne's tough cowboy routine is at least in part, and will surely evolve further in later films. As this film represents all of Wayne's work in the early 30s for Odyssey, we will not see his face again until Stagecoach, but once we do, we'll continue to see him through to the end of Odyssey and beyond. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Ah, our first Western sound, and John Wayne's first lead role. It is the great trace of Raoul Walsh. This review will be brief, as it has been weeks since I saw it. I enjoyed this movie, but it was far from being a masterpiece. The adventure, mostly predictable, had some surprises, as when the brains of the bad guys, Red Flack (Tyrone Power Sr. in his last role) dies halfway; I thought he would be the boss at the end, but that ended up being Bill Thorpe (Ian Keith). I remember that I did not like the way Breck (Wayne) kills Thorpe and takes revenge at the end. I understood that that was what I should do in the story, but I really did not like her reasoning when she tells Ruth why she has to do it. I think he had a much greater responsibility with the hundreds of settlers he led in the harsh west. <br /> <br /> Last movie seen: Animal Crackers (1930). Last film chronologically: Soup to Nuts (1930). Next film: L'Age D'or (1930).
