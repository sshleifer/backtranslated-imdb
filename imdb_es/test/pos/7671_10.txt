I found that this movie is one of the best for this time and era. The cast was very exceptional and very entertaining for all who saw it. I would like my younger generation to have seen this movie, but I have not been able to find or see the movie in the past. The first time I saw her was in Since the early sixties, I've been looking since then. The film showed me the potential of how far we have come to become a gift in a trade in which we could only have meaningless roles to act as buffoons and servants. <br /> <br /> Porky and Bess showed some of the urban life of my neighborhood as I saw it at the time I needed good solid male models. The singing and acting made me jump for days, playing the role of different characters in this excellent movie.
