While this movie might not be the next Evil Dead (Demons, who knows, maybe it will, it's only been out for a year) It's worth seeing. Do not expect a $ 10 million movie. Because you will be disappointed. Expect to be entertained, laugh and enjoy the experience. Everything in this movie is MUCH better than many, if not all, low-budget horror films that exist. I've seen movies that spent more than 10 or 20 times more than what it cost to make this movie and they were 10000000000 times worse. The effort put into this movie weighs heavily on the setbacks it faces when having a limited budget. The movies are meant to entertain, and this movie does it. In fact, this movie could even open new doors for you to watch movies. It's available on Netflix if it's not your local video rental store. So look at it, then decide.
