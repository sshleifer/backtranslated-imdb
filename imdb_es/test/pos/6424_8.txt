"Traces (on the Moon") is almost certainly the strangest, most complicated and atypical Giallo ever made. It may be a restriction for some of the subgenre fanatics, but this movie does not feature many of Giallo's usual trademarks, such as murders with bloody knives (preferably committed by a masked assassin wearing black gloves), dazzling dressed beauties and unpredictable red herrings. However, to compensate for all this? and much more ?? The "footprints" benefit from the most indescribably mysterious and incessant atmosphere I have experienced in this type of movies. The level of mystery in this movie is so high and unbearable that it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and scared. Like the female protagonist Alice Cespi, you have absolutely no idea what is happening or why, and this feeling of utter helplessness is undoubtedly the main strength of the film. As a spectator, you crave to help this poor woman to understand the things that surpassed her, but you simply can not. Alice has a successful career as an interpreter, but her quiet and peaceful life is brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly begins to realize that she has no recollection of the previous three days. Find a torn picture of a hotel located on the holiday island Gama and decide to go there to investigate what happened. On the island, several people, including a lonely girl, seem to recognize Alice, only that she used Nicole's fake name, wore a red hair wig and acted as if she had come to the island to hide from an unknown danger. Meanwhile, even the nights of the poor girls are restless, as she has recurring dreams of astronauts jumping on the surface of the moon and an amazing scientist named Dr. Blackman. The plot of "Footprints" is really strange and shows slowly, and in particular the sub cosmic plot is really difficult to link with the rest. Alice assumes that they are just images from a science fiction movie that she saw a long time ago, which seems a reasonable explanation, but you feel there is a deeper meaning and a real connection with all the other events. Fans of Italian cinema driven by tension and style can not afford to miss this movie, really. This is the psychological tour-de-force of director Luigi Bazzoni, with stunningly beautiful photographs and music that alters the mind. Despite the lack of violence (or maybe just for that), the film is really disturbing and the mental agony that Alice goes through honestly affects the viewer emotionally. As unfortunately it is very frequent in Gialli-cine, the climax suddenly becomes abrupt and almost does not give a waterproof explanation of all the uncomfortable events that you have just witnessed during the last hour and a half. Still, the content of "Footprints" will keep you watching long after the movie is over and its powerful impact will only increase. Florinda Bolkan is sublime as the tormented protagonist and receives an excellent response from the limited support group, including the young Nicoletta Elmi. The eminent Euro-cult star Klaus Kinski also receives the highest turnover, but his role is nothing more than an extended cameo. This film is much better than Giallo's "The Fifth Cord", more acclaimed (and much easier to achieve) by director Bazzoni, so we hope that "Footprints" will soon also receive an elegant DVD.
