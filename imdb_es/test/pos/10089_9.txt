Disgusted as an Asian Horror, "A Tale of Two Sisters" is actually a complex psychological drama directed by a character, which involves the viewer in the problems of a seemingly normal family. I was very surprised by the depth of this movie. Director Ji-woon Kim's decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap fears has been successful. Creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies. <br /> <br /> "A tale of two sisters" tells the story, as the name of two sisters Su-mi and the younger Su-yeon suggest, that after spending time In a mental institution he returns home with his father and his apparently abusive stepmother. Since then, we are witnessing how the sisters treat the growing aggression and erratic behavior of their stepmother. To say what would happen next would ruin the whole experience. So I'll leave it like that. <br /> <br /> The plot is very well written. With the characters well done. Ji-woon Kim's focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view of them and their relationships to each other. In addition, each of the four main actors has a very different role and character type. From the protector Su-mi, the weaker Su-yeon, the father visibly disinterested to the frantic and then mortal behavior of the stepmother. There is a great sense of mystery, since much of the plot is not revealed until the end, and even after that, the film still leaves a large space for interpretation. Even after seeing it once, the viewer will be forced to see it at least once more so that he can understand it better. <br /> <br /> The actors fit perfectly into their roles. It is especially difficult to create strong and emotional scenes in psychological movies, but it is a great joy when you create them and this is an excellent example of such a feat. The direction of Ji-woon Kim is slow and exciting, building tension for the horrible scenes of the film. While there are few moments that are strong and frankly terrifying. The cinematography and the score are first class and help to establish an atmosphere appropriate to that of a psychological film. <br /> <br /> "A Tale of Two Sisters" is a demonstration that the horror genre is actually much more than a trip of simple emotion. With its strong focus on character and mystery, this is a complex film that could easily seduce you by watching it over and over again so you can understand it better.
