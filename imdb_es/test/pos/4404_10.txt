Thank God for the Coen brothers. Their success has brought them bigger budgets, but it has not freed them from their creativity. I had planned to watch another movie, but I was exhausted, so I went to this instead. By the time it started, I had forgotten what movie I was there to watch. It surprised me in more ways than one. This movie is hilarious, but they do not make any cheap joke just to get the laughs. The writing is brilliant, and presented with great skill by George Clooney (after this, no one can say it's just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. It can be seen on many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can not remember the last time I saw such an intelligent movie. I have seen others that I would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, all of which also describe "Oh Brother", but this movie reminded me of older episodes of Seinfeld in which all the secondary arguments came together. You can feel that your trip is becoming something, but you can not say what. And the Coen brothers do not fail us, the ending is certainly not disappointing. It's amazing and ties all the loose ends in an orderly fashion, without wearing down the story.
