I am very happy not to live in a small American city. Because every time they show me a small city in the United States, it is populated by all kinds of monsters, among which meat-hungry zombies, evil aliens and sinister ghosts are the most innocuous. In this movie, a former doctor, who has just completed a time to kill his wife in a car accident, is heading towards the nearest small town: he should never have seen a film about small cities in his life, which happens Be the floors of purgatory. And, of course, as soon as he gets there, all hell breaks loose. Meet a blonde girl who, of all creatures, looks more like a cow, both in facial expressions and in the functioning of the brain and at the same time falls in love with her. But there is a small disadvantage, she is already married to a drug dealer of very little time who in a minute is shot unfortunately and does not die. To know what has come out of all this, you should see the movie for yourself. I'll just tell you that you remember Oliver Stone's U Turn a bit, but it's a way to reduce all the artistic properties.
