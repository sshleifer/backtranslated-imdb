My first revision in IMDB, after some years of using this site constantly ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw this in the tube the other night, I loved it. It is in the mindset of a dangerous mind or a substitute, but much better. For a moment, I was sure that Rex was Speedy Levitch, in Waking Life, but after checking it out, it does not look like it. <br /> <br /> I can see why many have problems with this plot and their poetry, but also think that these people are closed-minded. It is true that the end was not exactly what I expected, but in general it was so unique and well acted that I can not complain. I would not call it corny, as a critic did, it brought out the scene better than most of the 80s movies. And they refrained from playing any music from the 80's really datable. <br /> <br /> I can not remember everything that made me smile when I saw this, but basically it showed very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity and if I share the Rex's beliefs or not, I love the original attempts to describe the meaning of the lifetime. And his mutant theory is, as far as I know, original. He also had a lot of fun, but they showed how confused he was sometimes and why he might have some psychological problems. And then, in his moments of clarity, he was an extraordinary philosopher, a person who noticed the small details of life and tried to express them. <br /> <br /> I was also very impressed with John Savage as a teacher. Usually the actors fail in that role. He achieved it brilliantly. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed Waking Life, I tell you to watch this movie if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> pk
