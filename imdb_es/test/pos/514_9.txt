Blade is a fantastic action thriller that keeps you captured for the duration and Wesley Snipes offers what I would say is his best performance so far. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything you could ask for in an action. / thriller, it has a lot of blood, guts and blood, a bad twisted and disturbed purchase, moments of humor, but the most important thing is a very good story with many twists. <br /> <br /> His action is constant throughout the film with impressive acrobatics and effects, the wrestling movement of Wesley Snipes is fantastic. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is a must see. Wesley Snipes has a fresh and solid appearance. This movie means I can not wait for the continuation. 'BLADE 2' will be launched next year. <br /> <br /> My IMDB rating: 9 out of 10
