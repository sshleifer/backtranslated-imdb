Rififi is a great movie that is overlooked. It's a criminal drama where a man gets out of jail and plans another job. It is a story about used but this is different from the others. They gather the usual suspects for the job. This film analyzes how the family is torn as time passes. The real robbery scene is one of the best I've seen in my life. Instead of a suspense soundtrack, the director decided to leave quietly, about thirty minutes of silence. This fits perfectly with the mood and is often copied these days. Of course, things get out of control and people die, and it ends in a great ending that accumulates in suspense. <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking for a big black cinema that does not have a lot of people. This is a great collection
