(WARNING: CONTAINS MILD SPOILER) A movie almost designed to pause and review your memory: it is confined to an almost empty motel where the huge courtyard resembles a circus ring and the rooms look like temporary retreat points instead of shelters ; as the characters become more and more concerned about the past, the present gets farther and farther away, until the countess's last incendiary appearance in the black Mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy. It is impossible to determine if their stories are true or not, and if Stanton is really the father or just a crazy old man who intervenes in their stories. The subject seems to be how the love of an extreme and unthinking nature is confused with stability to the point where reality itself breaks down; Where exotic fantasy and misplaced becomes dangerously tangible. The image of the burning motel, a symbol of dislocation beset by destruction, is a very strange ending to this strange but effective, surprisingly imaginative film.
