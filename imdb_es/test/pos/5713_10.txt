John Leguizamo's one-man show is more fun and more involving than most of the movies you'll see. A number of devices, such as slide projectors, are used to improve the story, but this is essentially a good old-fashioned artistic performance. In particular, check out his hilarious version of "I Will Survive." * Highly recommended
