Colonel Chabert is one of the best novel screen adaptations I've seen in movies. It combines the realism of French cinema with an excellent characterization, from the late Chabert de Depardieu to the proud lawyer of Fabrice Luchini and the complex widow of Fanny Ardant. The film has a wonderful dimension, as might be expected from a cinematographer like Yves Angelo. The characters keep this movie going and, although a little slow at the beginning, it increases the pace and it is a good movie by the time it reaches the end.
