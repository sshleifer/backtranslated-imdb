It will soon be 10 years since this movie was released ... it still makes me laugh ... If you enjoy this movie, try the new Hera Pheri ... this is very funny. And my favorite part of the movie must be when Salman realizes that he has no bullets left in the gun, while he has the advantage and he has everyone at gunpoint ... and he actually says it in aloud !!! You just want to hit him ... but you know you can only do that if you stop laughing! Fantastic movie .... 10/10
