For a moment, let's leave aside the cultural aspects of this film, although it is a very important aspect, and let's see the simple fact that this is a very nice love story. Two individuals are in a difficult situation, caused by two selfish spouses. They have to live their sad days without any ray of hope. If each of these two women had been alone, imagine what kind of life each would have had to accept. They met and fell in love. That this love is against all the social, religious and cultural laws of its environment is almost irrelevant. They loved each other, they found relief in each other, that was enough. The reaction of the individuals around them is nothing more than a small fact that they have to accept, to suffer even, and then they can continue with their lives, their lives. Very nice.
