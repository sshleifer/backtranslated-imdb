This is a funny movie and I like it a lot. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood on the shirt. This is, of course, the usual good against evil with Robin against the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Most of the humor is on your face, but it still works well. A comedy for a night in which you do not have to think much, it's worth a rent!
