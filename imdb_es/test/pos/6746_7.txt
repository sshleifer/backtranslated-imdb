This is a very dark movie. Noir in fact. The main character is smallpox, brought to the city of New York without knowing it by Evelyn Keyes. <br /> <br /> She is on a mission when she arrives and a rougher one after she speaks to her sister who is no longer innocent. But she herself is not intentionally a murderer. This does not mean that she does not kill. It does not mean that its presence somewhere among another eight million people does not ruin the city. <br /> <br /> Keyes is excellent. The supporting cast is very good too. There are several little-known people involved in this, including the director. Do not be discouraged. It is a movie to consider! (And it's good to see a picture of Columbia, Columbia and Republic produced wonderful comedies and noirs, however, we almost never see them).
