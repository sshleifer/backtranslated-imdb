I have loved this movie for a long time. I had not seen it in a long time, so I checked it again and actually found it even more enjoyable now. I loved the caricature of The Chipmunks when I was young, so I naturally loved "The Adventure of the Chipmunks". <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not think of a better argument for this movie. It is not tremendously creative, but I have always wanted to travel around the world, so I have a lot of fun watching it while my desire to travel grows even more. The part with Elenore singing to the little penguin always makes me cry ... <br /> <br /> 'The adventure of the squirrels' will remain one of my favorites forever, I'm sure. I guess it's because I saw it when I was very young. I do not think it has a big impact if someone older sees it for the first time. (Unless, of course, they have a young heart)
