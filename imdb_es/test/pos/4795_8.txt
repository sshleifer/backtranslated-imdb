The career of Spanish director Luis Buñuel spanned almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. Arguably his best films were those he made during his exile in Mexico, from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. There he had to deal with very cheap budgets, and work in an industry mainly interested in mixing commercial films for unsophisticated audiences, but somehow managed to make interesting films that invite reflection and have withstood the test of time. This film is based on a novel by the Spanish author Benito Pérez Galdós, and the adaptation is quite faithful, even if the setting is the Mexico of the early twentieth century instead of the Spain of the early twentieth century. The protagonist, Nazarín, is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as it can be to that prescribed by Christ. The question many would ask themselves is whether such an effort would be possible, without incurring the hostility, incomprehension and mockery of other human beings. As it happens, he suffers many indignities, but he remains obstinate (until the controversial final shot) at this goal. I think Buñuel wanted to show Nazarin as a somewhat ridiculous figure, but perhaps inadvertently, his obstinacy (at least for this viewer) becomes admirable. In any case, a great movie.
