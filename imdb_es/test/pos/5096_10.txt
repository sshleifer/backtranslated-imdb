"Chips" is an excellent combination of music, light comedy and drama with a perfect image of Peter O 'Toole and an effortless romantic performance by Petula Clark. O 'Toole can show the shy and uncommunicative teacher who so much wants to be loved by his students and can only express his love when he married Katherine (Clark). She brings to the world "How many flowers!" And he changes forever. He becomes the beloved director of Brookfield through the tragedy, but he knows that he could only have achieved his goal through Katherine's love. The songs (with the exception of the Music Hall number) are all "thought songs" that come from the emotions and thoughts of the characters and, the more you listen to them, the more beautiful they become: "Walk the world with me" and "You and me". The best moment of O'Toole is the final speech given to the students (it was the reason for the Oscar nomination). As teachers, we question what the "book" learns, but, as Chips says, we teach them how to behave among them and that is what really counts. Beautifully filmed, perfectly orchestrated by John Williams and one of the most moving movies about love and how it can change you. "Did I fill the world with love?" The boys sing their school song. In the end, Chips realizes that he was able to do it, but only because Catherine was there.
