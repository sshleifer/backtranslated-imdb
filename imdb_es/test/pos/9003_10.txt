First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although I found the aspect of rugby in this movie interesting, it could have been any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it anyway. The fact that it was about rugby did not make it better or worse for me. <br /> <br /> What made this film great is the story itself, based on real events that have occurred over the past 30 years. The rugby club Highland. Coach Gelwix is ​​the kind of coach that most parents would like their children to have, someone who cares more about the person than about the sport (even though they won 17 national championships and only lost 9 games in more 30 years!). The more I've learned about the coach and the team, the more I like this movie and its message. <br /> <br /> I've seen other sports movies that looked great at first, but then I investigated the details to find that most of those movies had 10% reality and 90% fiction, and 10% the facts were very exaggerated. Not so with Forever Strong. It may seem too good to be true, but that is the surprising thing about this. If it were fiction, it would be a nice story and nothing more. Instead, the film is inspiring and makes you want to be a better person. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie due to some negative reviews from professional critics. I have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given horrible criticism to the film. These are usually the same critics who talk about movies that most people hate. In fact, I would worry if some of these critics had given good reviews to the film because I almost always disagree with their opinions. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and post your review (positive or negative)! Currently, most reviews of the audience are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I'm interested to see if this trend continues. Thank you!
