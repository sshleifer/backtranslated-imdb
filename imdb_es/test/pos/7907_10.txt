My cousins ​​and I have seen this movie since we were little. I do not know exactly what it is about this movie, but we cling to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories. <br /> <br /> I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good healthy family movies because that is exactly what this is. The things that the four children get into are absolutely fun to watch. It's an old movie but do not let that fool you. This is one of the best movies that are so strong among themselves.
