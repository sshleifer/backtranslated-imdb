University professor Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) is a blocked writer since his ex-wife Margareth (Kate Mulgrew) ruined him, stealing his novel that became a bestseller. He does not hide his hatred for Margareth, which annoys his girlfriend Beth Ryan (Kim Greist), who is an anthropology professor at the same university. While teaching Creative Writing, he is harassed by student Owen (Danny DeVito) who wants to know his opinion about his crime story. Larry says he did not like it, and explains that in each mystery story, the killer should eliminate the motive and establish an alibi, otherwise, they would catch him. In addition, Larry suggests that Owen see Hitchcock's films to understand the structure of a suspense story. Owen, who wants to kill his obnoxious mother (Anne Ramsey), looks at "Strangers in a train" and misinterprets Larry's advice, believing that his teacher wants to exchange murders to eliminate the motive. Owen travels to Hawaii and, while on a boat, Margaret falls overboard and disappears into the sea and is considered dead. However, Larry does not have an alibi and becomes the main suspect, while the crazy Owen pressures him to kill his mother as part of his alleged deal. <br /> <br /> "Launch the train mom" is one of the funniest comedies of the 80s and a great tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. The direct reference is "Strangers in a train", but there are jokes with "Vertigo" (with the revolving camera), "Familiar diagram" (with the car without interruptions) and other movies. The lines are excellent and there is an interesting point when Larry says that every great romance or mystery has a train. Anne Ramsey is amazing in the role of an unpleasant and abusive dominant mother and the viewer will certainly feel sorry and understand Owen's madness. Kim Greist is very beautiful and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect bitch. Billy Crystal plays a character obsessed with many silly and unreasonable attitudes but necessary for the plot. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jogue a Mam√£e do Trem" ("Throw the mother of the train")
