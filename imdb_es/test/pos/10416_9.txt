I loved Niami's debut. I hope we'll see more of your work soon. I had the good fortune to see the movie during his brief career in New York and he seemed a worthy successor to 80s films like Desperately Seeking Susan and After Hours, but with a gentle European whim that made it fresh and fun. A strong cast that played mainly against the guy was a pleasure. And I thought that the complex threads between threads were correct. Sandra Bernhard presents her best performance since King of Comedy, while Peter Stormare is very funny and Ling Bai plays. Look at it.
