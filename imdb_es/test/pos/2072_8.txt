Part of the BBC's filming of all of Shakespeare's classic works, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most overrated works and Hamlet himself is not a particularly moving and tragic character . I do not feel sympathy for him, and I did not after seeing this. <br /> <br /> Even when you have great actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of Dane, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde. like Rosencrantz, he can not disguise the lack of passion in history. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects passion, it makes all the paper incomprehensible. I just could not relate his physicalization of the character to what he was saying, and this killed him for me. That said, he does understand the discourse "Being or not being" well, since his actions with a dagger make clear the suicidal intentions of the character at that moment of the work. <br /> <br /> The secondary roles, For me, better written and, consequently, better interpreted, are pleasant, in particular the lazy interpretation of Claudio de Lalla Ward, Ofelia and Stewart. <br /> <br /> At four and a half hours, it is very long and you can observe better bite sized pieces. Check it if you are interested, but be prepared for a long watch.
