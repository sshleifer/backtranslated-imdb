The best of the American pastry "pastry". I discovered that humor and plot are a much more attractive audience than any of the American Pie films to date. . Also regarding the adequacy of the content, I found that this is acceptable to a much wider audience than any of the previous American Pie films. I really enjoyed this cinematic experience. When the first movie came out, I read several negative reviews and ended up not seeing her when I was still in the theater ... Now I regret that decision. The film far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialogue / scripting and overall quality. I give it two thumbs up!
