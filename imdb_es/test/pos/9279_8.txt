Despite the previous critic's rule, this is an interesting documentary and with many classic 1950s sci-fi movie clips that influenced Spielberg, Lucas and others in their most recent efforts. I agree that Spielberg's films are not even in the same league as the films analyzed here, such as the brilliant INVADERS FROM MARS by William Cameron Menzies, to name just one of the many titles examined, but this is still a Pretty good description of the 1950s. Paranoid science fiction. Yes, it becomes a commercial of the warm new version of WAR OF THE WORLDS during the last fifteen minutes; You can turn that off. The rest is surprisingly good, and it's nice to see contemporary filmmakers remember the films that inspired them, even if they can not begin to match the originals.
