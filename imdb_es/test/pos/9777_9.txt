I have heard some comments, particularly from prisoners of war, that CHANGI is not historically accurate and that it is disappointing. Maybe it's for those who really had to live through these things, and much worse. But for the rest of us, who really have no idea how the Japanese treated the prisoners during World War II, CHANGI is a remarkable introduction. But CHANGI is not a war documentary: if it had been, then the historical precision aspect would have been paramount. It is a miniseries drama, with fictional characters and fictitious situations (although it is based loosely on real events that I have heard and read), and at the center of the story is the ideal of the couple relationship. This group of young Australian soldiers, taken prisoner by the Japanese and kept in appalling conditions for years, became partners due to adversity and the strength of their friendships continued throughout their lives after the war. It is also a cultural study of the differences between the Japanese of the time and the Western world, with their music, games and entertainment: in part 5, when it is clear that Japan will lose the war after Germany surrenders in Europe, the Japanese prison camp colonel insists that his country must study the culture of its prisoners, to defeat a people, one must defeat their culture, and to do this, one must understand it. In general, Australia continues with its rich tradition of producing exceptional television miniseries, and is an incomparable world leader in this regard: winning the AFI Prize with CHANGI is MY BROTHER JACK, the adaptation of George Johnston's novel, and also a worthy winner Miniseries in recent years include DAY OF THE ROSES (the history of the Glanville train crash investigation), KINGS IN GRASS CASTLES (the adaptation of Mary Durack's historical account of her pioneer ancestors), KANGAROO PALACE (about a group of friends from a rural city in Australia that travels to London and changes and moves away, and the adaptation (somewhat disappointing) of the powerful novel by Bryce Courtenay, THE POTATO FACTORY, less recently: the saga of the life of Nancy Cato in Murray - ALL THE RIVERS RUN; Cusack & James' brilliant novel about postwar life in Sydney - COME IN SPINNER; Colleen McCullough's outstanding pioneering saga - THE THORN BIRDS; THE KING OF THE RIVER; Ruth Park's LA novel ARPA IN THE SOUTH, BODY LINE, EUREKA STOCKADE, ANZACS, etc ..., etc ... (Of course, there have been some not so good productions, for example, MOBY DICK, DO OR DIE, ON THE BEACH, THORN BIRDS: THE YEARS DISAPPEARED, etc ...) In general, however, if you are presented with an Australian miniseries, be sure to watch it, and this is duplicated for CHANGI, a masterfully directed masterpiece. Score: 9/10.
