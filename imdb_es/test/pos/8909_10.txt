In fact, the nature of the whole series is irrepressibly fun! But it's not always fun ... there are moments of extreme shock as the deepest aspects of human emotion are touched. <br /> <br /> Again and again, the commentaries of the series on the frailties of human nature and life, or in this eternal case, struggle to overcome them. Monkey is smart and stupid at the same time, his arrogance and confidence in his own martial skills lead him to problems in almost every episode. Pigsy is just gross. Sandy has a philosophical mindset. He has many of the most ingenious lines. <br /> <br /> The English translation is a delight. "Ignorance can always be improved," Sandy says in her relaxed way, "but you can not do anything to help stupidity!" "Who are you?" The group of travelers is asked. "We are the three kings of the East," says Mono. <br /> <br /> This is not just for children, it's a magical game for anyone who can suspend reality.
