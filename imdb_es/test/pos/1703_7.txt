The title suggests that this film is a sequel to "An American Werewolf in London." None of the characters from the previous film comes back and is not even mentioned in this movie by name. Then, as a sequel, AAwiP fails, one would say. <br /> <br /> I dare say the opposite. <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a charming and effective horror movie. It's one of the best werewolf movies I've seen in a long time, too. And I've seen my part enough, like an American werewolf in London, The Howling, Wolfen, The Wolfman and the trilogy of the underworld. <br /> <br /> The story tells that three Americans visited Paris on vacation. At the top of the Eifel Tower, one of them saves a woman who tries to commit suicide. What begins as a romantic relationship slowly becomes a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed ... <br /> <br /> I really liked the acting in this movie. Especially the two stars of the film: the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her. They have good chemistry together. But the other two Americans also play their roles very well. I really did not find anything annoying about the performance, so clap for that! <br /> <br /> The effects on werewolves are nice. It does not seem too cheap or false. Of course, opinions are divided on this topic. But let's say he did not disappoint me. <br /> <br /> There is also a good amount of humor in this movie. There are some really fun scenes that you will probably remember for a long time. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize, an American werewolf in Paris may not be a direct sequel to his predecessor, but it's still a pleasant experience. movie. Perfect for those who love werewolves! 7 out of 10 stars!
