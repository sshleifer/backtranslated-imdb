I see many movies, but now my number one genre is Asian horror. I just bought this DVD and initially I found "Janghwa, Hongryeon" an intriguing but confusing movie, as I had not understood many parts of the story. But I saw on the IMDb Board a message entitled "Explanation of a masterpiece (all your questions answered) faster load", written by opiemar, and I was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations that this user provided to the viewers as I did not achieve story points. I would like to congratulate Opiemar for his excellent work and suggest that he write a correct summary of this film in IMDb to help and guide other viewers. <br /> <br /> In the end, I agree that "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is a great Korean movie, but I do not give ten in my vote because very few people can see the same movie more than once, as it demands this movie, and without the great support of Opiemar, I could not understand it. The history as a whole. I intend to watch this movie again in the near future. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo" ("Fear")
