I really enjoyed watching Hell to Pay. I've been a westerns fan since I can remember, and it reminded me of many of the westerns of the 1960s (although I was too young to have seen them in their first race). The only thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music. Sometimes it distracted me. One thing I noticed, and I wonder how many Gunsmoke fans noticed, was the name of Buck Taylor's character. It was a play by the name of Doc Adams of Gunsmoke. In place of Gaylan Adams, Buck Taylor used Adam Galen. I wonder if that was his choice or Chris McIntyre's. Anyway, I would recommend this movie to westerns fans. Do not expect anything too "deep". Simply the old entertainment.
