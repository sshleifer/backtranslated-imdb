I wonder how anyone could dissuade in this movie. It is based on a real story. It is not necessarily the "Rugby" itself, but the one we publish here that needs to make a "real" rugby movie, the point was lost. This is not another typical sports movie in which a team sucks, they hire Emilio Estevez, they turn the team around, they win the championship and they give everyone the confidence and warmth. It focuses on a HISTORY. It shows how someone can change their life for the better. The movies of today are about sex, drugs, parties, etc. That is Hollywood. I'm a big fan of movies, but I must say it was an inspiring movie with a great message. If you consider yourself a "tough guy", do not watch the movie, it will not live up to your standards. If you want to see a good inspirational movie, this is a good movie.
