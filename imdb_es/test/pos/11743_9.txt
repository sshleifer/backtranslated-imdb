This movie always hits me hard emotionally in the end. Although the themes of the film, interracial romance and adultery were controversial at the time, this film goes far beyond the narrow parameters of the innovative novelty and the uniqueness of the avant-garde. Here we have a true love story, written by the woman involved in this love story, told in a brilliant aggressive style that extols the virtues and glory of passionate and crazy love. "I love" this support of the only emotion that makes life really worthwhile. Jennifer Jones is full of grace and William Holden is simply magnificent in his role as a reporter. A wonderful movie that only people who have been in this kind of love can really appreciate and understand. And for those who have not yet fallen in love, even the hope that one day lightning will strike you makes life worthwhile, because it is worth having love even for a short time, even if you lose, because love en The "things" - the essence - of life. This movie works for me. A warm experience!
