Batman Returns must be considered quality when talking about superhero movies. His predecessor, Batman, in my opinion, is by far the best and best thought of the comic book genre. To say one that Batman Returns was disappointing, he or she has not seen the film completely and has considered the performance of Danny Devito as the Penguin. Devito and Walken offer some memorable moments. The Batman tale is supposed to be dark and Tim Burton has fulfilled how the comedian portrays Batman. Batman Returns provides comic relief, action, suspense and fantasy; and it should not be seen as 'junk', although we are all entitled to our own opinions.
