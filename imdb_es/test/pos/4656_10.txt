What can I say about this movie that has not been said hundreds of times before? It is an American classic. It has generated dozens of imitators. Or none. Midnight Madness is unique in its class. From the ridiculous editing / opening music to Bonaventure HOtel, I was hooked. Leon made us all feel so young and carefree. One question, however, how did he have those two hot whores with him all the time? And how did you have the time / money to organize an event of this kind? The cast is top notch. David Naughton is at his best here. His tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing. His little brother Michael J Fox (in his first leading role), is a real brat. There is also the love interest of Naughton and an imbecile and the obligatory black in a fisherman hat on the yellow team. Michael J Fox does bad things like trying to steal beer mugs at the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery and flee to Flounder's van. The Flounder team gives us the greatest comedy. What exactly is the deal with the blonde on that team? Are you dating Flounder? Or melio? O Blade? Yes, the name of the Mexican knight is razor. The other guy from the Flounder team has the best lines of the film, I will not show them here. The Meat Machine team is a group of drunks. My personal favorite is the armpit. But the silent black is also great. The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians (two of which are 450-lb twins). <br /> <br /> You already know the ending from the beginning. But that does not matter. This is the genre of the 80s at its best. Do not rent this, buy it. and buy it now.
