This is an underestimated and chilling gem with chilling performances and a fantastic ending. All the characters are great, and the story was amazing, also, I thought the ending was really great! The plot was great, and it never bored me, besides, while the children's actors were bad, they gave me the chills! It happened that this was in the space channel a while ago, so I decided to check it and record it, I read some good reviews from other horror fans, I must say that I agree with them, it is very creepy and full of suspense, in addition to Strother. Martin, he was fantastic in his role, as the worshiper of Satan. It has tons of spooky atmosphere, and it keeps you guessing, plus all the characters are very nice, and you really start to encourage Ben and his family! It has many disturbing moments, and the movie really surprised me sometimes, and it's extremely well done with a low budget! This is an underestimated and spooky gem, with chilling performances and a fantastic ending! I recommend it a lot! The address is very good! Bernard McEveety does a very good job here, with a great camera work, creating a lot of spooky atmosphere and keeping the film at a very fast pace. There is a little blood and blood. We have a severed leg, many bloody corpses, throat cut with blood, cuts and dice, decapitation and impalement. The acting is excellent! Strother Martin is fantastic here! as the worshiper of Satan, it is extremely creepy, very convincing, it was quite chilling, it was extremely intense, it seemed to be having fun, and overall it did a fantastic job! Charles Bateman is great like dad, he was very affectionate, very nice and gave a good show, I liked it a lot. L.Q. Jones is amazing like the Sheriff, it was fun, besides everything, he looked very young, he had a great character and, in general, he did an incredible job. Ahna Capri is good as a girlfriend and did what she had to do quite well. Charles Robinson acted to the extreme as the Priest and it did not convince me a bit, and that laughter was especially bad. Geri Reischl is actually decent as a daughter, it was a nice thing, and it only bothered me a couple of times, I liked it more. Alvy Moore was ridiculous, but very nice in his Tobey role, I dug it! The rest of the cast does good. In general I highly recommend it! *** 1/2 out of 5
