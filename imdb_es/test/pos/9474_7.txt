Five years after he joined James Cagney in "The Public Enemy," Mae Clarke makes another appearance, this time as his girlfriend with the character of Cagney on the other side of the law. It seems that she was also calling more shots in their relationship, trying to make Johnny Cave a little more practical with his money and his career. You had to think they would be together again after she gave him the boot to challenge his crooked boss; Those things have a way of working on images. <br /> <br /> I really liked seeing Cagney in this one. I usually do it, and here it looked like I could have auditioned that characteristic shrug movement that used to have a good effect on "Angels With Dirty Faces" which portrays Rocky Sullivan. It was right after he threw Cavanaugh (Robert Gleckler) out of his office during the first attempt to bribe the new head of Weights and Measures. He turns to the camera and gets hooked as if he was completely satisfied with his response to the thief - very good. <br /> <br /> I understand that this was not one of Cagney's Warner movies, but I could have done it. state. Warner's often took the cause of the common man, and the exposure of the crooked merchants and the politicians who protected them would have been the best. It also has those fantastic street scenes of New York City that represent the cars and shops of the time, with homemade signs that cost flour at eighteen cents a pound. Hey, how about the furniture store that sells the living room for one hundred and eighty-nine dollars? You may get a single stick chair for that price today. <br /> <br /> The best part of the image could be that meat counter. Scene when Cagney, James Burke (Aloysius) and the butchers play with a low weight chicken. One of the lightest moments in the movie, but they give you an idea of ​​how people get tense when they catch them cheating. The same goes for the truck driver who has been pressured by Johnny to sign a precise delivery; I just was not used to doing that. <br /> <br /> In general, a good detour from the presence of more typical Cagney gang members, even if it is not up to the level of their films. It is fairly easy to obtain as one of the few public domain images of Cagney that exist, and which are often found in comparatively cheap compilations.
