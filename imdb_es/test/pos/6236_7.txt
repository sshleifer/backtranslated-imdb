This is a strange rarity, directed by the guy who edited "The Texas Massacre." Chuck Conners offers a hilariously exaggerated performance as the owner of a "wax" museum on the side of the road that our convicted teenagers break up nearby. The wax figures seem "so real," says one of the teenagers. Heh, heh, heh ... It's not so much a slasher movie as a strange mix of psychological horror and the old "House of Wax" style. I can think of many, many horror movies that are worse than this one.
