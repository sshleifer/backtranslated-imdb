Usually, I do not like movies with / about aliens, but K-PAX is different. The actors are great in the movie, especially Kevin Spacey played his character in an awesome way! The film never falls to a lower level: the suspense is always in the film and you want to know how it ends, what about Prot ... You have to think long after the movie about the film because there are some open questions. ... Robert Porter Prot or Prot is only using the body of Robert Porters as a means of transport? How can you see ultraviolet light and how can you know that about astrology? But each one can make his own end and decide what he wants to believe. Very good movie with an excellent Kevin Spacey!
