This program started during a brief period when I was a child, I remember seeing it while eating fish and chips. <br /> <br /> Riding on the back of Tron's bass drum, this series was very Streethawk-like. manimal and similar, except more computation. There was a geeky guy that the computer somehow created this guy: automan. I would go to solve crimes and everything. <br /> <br /> All I really remember is your elegant car and the small and striking cursor thing that used to draw the car and help in general. <br /> <br /> When I mention it to someone, they can remember very little too. Was it real or maybe a dream?
