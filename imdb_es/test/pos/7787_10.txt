Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time. Both Aamir and Salman Khan have acted brilliantly, while Aamir's performance was much better than Salman. Amir Khan is known as' MR. PERFECTIONIST in Bollywood and it shows in each of his films. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around two young people, Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan), both from poor families and are a great dreamer. They want to become rich without enduring any pain. So when they hear about Raveena Bajaj's daughter (Raveena Tandon) from Mr.Bajaj (Paresh Rawal) who comes to India to find her boyfriend, they both cheat on their parents to marry Raveena Bajaj and the trip begins . There is also a twist in the movie that makes the movie even more fun. Paresh Rawal has a double role (Teja and Mr. Bajaj) and has acted brilliantly as he always does. Shakti kapoor (Gogo crime master) also adds A great comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie is a comedy of ribs from the first minute to the last and is one of the Bollywood classic comedy movies.
