I've seen this movie probably more than 20 times. The jokes are now between 10 and 15 years old, but every time I see it, it makes me fall out of my chair. Two of the best actors Salman Khan and Aamir Khan play the leading roles here. Even if Aamir Khan is a much better actor and got the best role (smart guy) in the Salman Khan movie games and, on occasion, he performs even better as the dumb boy. All the characters are memorable. This movie is full of fun phrases and funny situations (probably a little silly). Do not try to look for logic in this movie. Let your brain relax for a while. I promise it will be an experience to remember.
