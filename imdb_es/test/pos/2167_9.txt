I'm a jerk for a decent superhero movie. (I'm not counting the budget of the super mistakes, no Batman story either) <br /> <br /> A couple of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist. The Black Scorpion can be added to that collection. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the demolitionist, get this movie. It's basically a copy of that heroine. (She even stars the same guy in both movies) <br /> <br /> If you have not done it, then let me explain ... a policeman's father is murdered and she seeks revenge. She ties the black outfit (an attractive and attractive outfit that looks absolutely great in Joan Severance) and goes out to kick some booty. <br /> <br /> It's a fun and action-packed movie, of course, you may not want children to see it ... without examining it first to see if you approve of the rather graphic sex scene Severance has in it. What, in my opinion, was an advantage (okay, give it an extra star <grin>)
