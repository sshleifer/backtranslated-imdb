I was given the solo "Summertime" in 5th grade for our spring choral concert. From that moment on, a great appreciation for the music of Gershwin arose in me. I love the melodies of this Gershwin opera. When I was in fifth grade (around 10 years old), I got the LP to practice and I also love the soundtrack. I recommend watching this movie and, if you can get the soundtrack, get it (sometimes you can find it on eBay), an old used LP. I've been searching and searching to find the soundtrack on a CD. The songs in this have wonderful musical arrangements and I really want them to be placed on a CD for purchase and I also want them to restore the movie and put it on DVD. This is really a great job that I believe that present and future generations could enjoy and take advantage of. Some may think that the movie is slow and boring, but it seems to me the opposite. Although Poitier and Dandridge have doubled musical voices, I think the voices fit well with faces and personalities. The voice of a person speaking and the singing voice can be very different. Porgy and Bess, and the songs of this opera, will always have a special meaning for me.
