A forerunner of "Citizen Kane" in his analysis of the life of a recently deceased tycoon, here revised by his faithful secretary in a series of interwoven flashbacks. In the fifteenth film by Spencer Tracy, he is already middle-aged even in the scenes where he is destined to be young! <br /> <br /> A bit of silent screen type emotion is understandable given the harvest, but this is one of the most enjoyable, well-written drama.
