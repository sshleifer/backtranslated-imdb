When this film does it well, it really does it well. And when it goes wrong ... I would say that a full 3 / 4s of the movie is great. I can even isolate the bad. It's everything that has to do with romance. Everything you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes, but it lasts for about 30. I would recommend skipping that section if you can. He does nothing but explain his exile. It should have been a minor point of the plot quickly thrown aside. Fortunately, the period of approximately 0-30 and 1: 00-2: 19 (The End) is excellent. <br /> <br /> There are a number of excellent performances in this movie, and an equal number of terrible ones. Like everything else in this movie, the acting is perfect or terrible. Peter Ustinov as the squalid slave of one eye Kaptah is perfect. It is one of his best performances, up there with his role in Spartacus. Victor Mature as the ambitious Horemheb is also perfect. Again, one of your best roles. Jean Simmons is wasted as Merit, the perfect girl in love with our hero John Carradine gives him a good supporting role as a philosophical grave robber; and Michael Wilding is excellent as Akhnaton, the idealistic pharaoh who tries to bring peace and monotheism to Egypt only to see how it collapses due to his unwillingness to fight. Now the bad. Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is sadly miscast. This is doubly unfortunate since he is the main character. The whole movie revolves around him. Actually he does quite well as the disillusioned exile and the wise old man. This is due to its very limited range. He does not seem able to put any passion in his words. This is especially evident during love scenes that are uncomfortable. He spends the last half of the film as an old man, a performance in which he is decent enough. He has the perfect voice for the character. The less said about Bella Darvi as Nefer, the treacherous Babylonian woman, the better. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets are magnificent. This is the only movie I know that tries to represent life in Egypt that is not overshadowed by Jews or Romans. The film takes place in the 14th century BC. which is even before exodus. The only monotheists are Pharaoh Akhenaten and his followers. There is the same strong element of religious zeal that can be found in most epics, but it is done in a different way and only shown at the end. An interesting note: having Akhenaton followed by Horemheb as a pharaoh, the film completely skips the most famous pharaoh of all: Tutankhamun. It seems like a strange thing to do when using that name could increase the knowledge of the movie. <br /> <br /> Be careful: this is an epic film from the fifties. If you do not like that kind of thing, then do not expect it to be different. It's different, but it's still an epic. I appreciate this movie, and I appreciate what he did and what he tried to do. This is a movie that should be better remembered than it is.
