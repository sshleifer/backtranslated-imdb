Hilarious and low budget comedy at its best. This set of unique individual sketches with an extensive self-referential humor reminds of a really daring Kids in the Hall. Get ready for some of the most random and worthy recitation lines, full of ethnic insults and horrible language. Includes sex toys! <br /> <br /> There should be more comedy like this today. This collection of sketches on a DVD will guarantee many visualizations and revisions to appreciate some of the parts. If you enjoyed The State and / or Wet Hot American Summer, get ready for a little more glory. If you are even considering this for younger audiences, I would say that every child on earth should see this.
