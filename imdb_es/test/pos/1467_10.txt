This movie is a very beautiful and slow movie. There's nothing Hollywood about it. It is very Danish and the characters are very real. It is the first Danish film that deals with this transsexual theme. It really is about love that has no gender. I would not say it's about lesbian love even though the two main characters (the transsexual Veronika and Charlotte) are attracted to each other. It's a story about love and life. <br /> <br /> The story takes place practically in both apartments. There is almost no background music, which makes it seem more real and intense. The two actors who play the main characters are great. They really make them look real. They are not archetypes, but real people that you could meet on the street. I think it's the first time I see a transsexual portrayed so well. Very well done.
