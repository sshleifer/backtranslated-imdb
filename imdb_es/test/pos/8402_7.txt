I'm a big fan of Gone With the Wind, and I read "Scarlett" before it was a miniseries and I loved it. This is a sequel of all kinds. As if you would not have expected it with that ending "Frankly dear, I do not give a damn." Timothy Dalton was great as Rhett, although nobody will replace Clark Gable. Joann Whaley-Kilmer, on the other hand, could give Vivien Leigh a run for her money (although I feel almost guilty saying that). His attitude and presence in the film makes the character adapt to a shirt, making you love her and hate her. At the same time, that is what most feel about the portrait of Mrs. Leigh as well. The film moves slowly, mainly because it follows the book very closely and was not released as a feature film. Excellent choice by the producer. I think this film deserves some recognition for the great story, the rebirth of the characters that have been gone for almost 50 years, and for being something that even Margaret Mitchell herself could have been proud of.
