The first time I saw this movie was in the early 80's and we used to have it in betamax. As we all know, betamax followed the path of the 8-trak tape, sigh, it also had a good image quality. Anyway, I'm glad I found this movie again, I've been looking for it for more than 10 years! This film falls into the category of films like Airplane: continuous jokes, lines, funny actions (body language). Mark Blankfield is absolutely hilarious. His transformation from the shy Dr. Daniel Jekyll to the animal party crazed by Mr. Hyde is unforgettable, complete with gold tooth, chest and gold chains. The part that I liked the most was when he stole the car from this poor man and then went to Madam Woo Woo's house. Totally psychedelic experience without drugs! If you need laughter therapy this is the movie to do it. When I saw it for the first time, I had tears in my eyes and my belly ached from laughing constantly. This is a movie that I could watch over and over again. I highly recommend it.
