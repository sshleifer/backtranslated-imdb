"Hoppity Goes to Town" was the second and last full-length animated film made by Max and Dave Fleischer, who created a universe parallel to Disney. While Disney films are well remembered today, both films Fleischer "Gulliver's Travels" and this is forgotten. <br /> <br /> "Hoppity" is a fascinating originality, not an adaptation like the first image. That is a great advantage, one might think. No, critics, rarely on the Fleischers' side to begin with, attacked them for this. Yes, the story is not as tense as "Gulliver", but how can you hate a movie that flaunts itself with such joy? <br /> <br /> It is full of great musical numbers and a very interesting story, which would be a crime to reveal. The characters are adorable and charming and there is a heart in this movie. <br /> <br /> The Fleischers really got over here and never did it again. Most of his time would be spent on re-leashers after they accumulated at the box office. It is a pity that they did not continue making features. Who knows? Your next attempt may have become the masterpiece you were looking for. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
