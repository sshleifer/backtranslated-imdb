Martin Ritt's first film offers an exceptional existentialist response (three years later) to the more conservative "On The Waterfront" by Elia Kazan. While "Waterfront" benefited greatly from an electrifying Marlon Brando, who inadvertently disguised Kazan's offensive theme in trying to justify naming names (as Kazan enthusiastically did before the House Non-American Activities Committee), "Edge of the City "has a young John Cassavetes and an upstart Sidney Poitier who dares to face the problems that" Waterfront "could not recognize, namely the rights of workers and race relations. <br /> <br /> "Edge of the City" dives boldly into this (then) unknown territory, and although the rather attractive black protagonist (Poitier) may seem a bit simplistic of Hollywood, the brave fight against bigotry and Violence with little veil has hardly aged. One wonders how surprised the initial moviegoers of 1957 were at such a bold presentation of black-white relations (if some of the fans did not leave the theater prematurely, they should be stunned, if not offended). <br /> <br /> The last roll of the film will still surprise audiences, as it refuses to sink into the expected clich√©s, including those that contaminated "Waterfront." Only the most jaded spectators will not realize what ends up being a radical and entertaining film, "Edge of the City". <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing about this lost classic: how unfortunately it is not available in any format, for example. Reasons that are quite cloudy. This movie should be seen in high school or college history classes throughout the country, but one can only find it on dark television at night, if it ever does.
