This DVD set is the complete series of 15 episodes of "Surface", a television program made by Universal in 2006. The full execution time is 10 hours and 34 minutes, plus some additional functions (scenes deleted, interviews with the cast, special effects functions). ). This was a relatively high budget show and much of the budget comes to the screen in the form of quality design and special effects. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, more than 10 hours is a long time and, as often happens with this kind of thing, the general quality begins to diminish in later episodes. I found the first 7 episodes (albums 1 and 2) extremely attractive and the rest a disappointment. "Surface" was produced, written and directed by Josh and Jonas Pate; and it seems that they were surprised by the success of the series and could not gather enough subsequent material while rushing to complete the request for additional episodes. It even seems that additional writers were incorporated for later episodes because the characters (who were already the weakest part of the series) lack coherence with the way they were played in the first episodes. The series was canceled and, although the last episode offers a conclusion of all kinds, there are still many things pending. <br /> <br /> It's basically a science fiction story about genetically engineered dragons; a kind of television mix of "Jurassic Park" and "ET". The story begins like a jigsaw puzzle, while an unarmed Navy submarine finds itself adrift in the sea, boaters in a Texas lake are sucked into a whirlpool, a lighthouse in Africa destroyed by a huge monster, etc. This vague there is a good amount of tension and suspense. A human element is introduced in the form of three American families, one on each coast and another in the Gulf of Mexico. Laura Daughterty (Lake Bell) is a marine biologist from California who discovers a strange creature that rises from a submarine thermal vent on the ocean floor. Rich Connelly (Jay R. Ferguson) is diving with his younger brother in the gulf when a similar creature drags his brother (he will never see him again). <br /> <br /> Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins) is a teenager from Wilmington who finds some strange eggs floating in the ocean. He is taken to a house where he becomes an "ET" type dragon. He will spend the rest of the series trying to hide his strange pet from his family and local authorities. These dragons may look like lizards but they are more like indestructible electric eels, firing electromagnetic pulses, causing lightning, emptying the sea of ​​fish, and reproducing like a group of randy rabbits when they find an underwater thermal outlet of boiling water. As long as it is not known if they are intelligent, extraterrestrial or harmless, the premise is interesting. Once you start suspecting its origin, everything becomes very tired and predictable. <br /> <br /> Jay R. Ferguson (an amazingly bad actor in the David Hasselhoff tradition) essentially plays the Richard Dreyfuss character of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", so you know that with a better actor and A Better Director could have been an interesting character. You will grow to hate this character more with each episode. Unfortunately, what starts when three parallel story lines soon condense in two, since Ferguson and Bell (a low-budget version of Sandra Bullock) are soon paired and engaged in a series of stupid adventures almost as unlikely as " Jason Bourne. " It gets in You expect the holes in the plot and the need to suspend disbelief in this kind of show (which may even be part of the fun), but their adventures are not only totally unlikely, they are completely and completely boring. There are three consecutive episodes that present Ferguson and Bell together in a submersible that will make you want the excitement of an all-day actuarial conference. <br /> <br /> Jenkins (Miles) is the strongest member of the cast and the segments with his dragon pet (Nimrod) are often interspersed with Ferguson-Bell's boring stuff to keep you staring. And these segments benefit from the presence of the beautiful Leighton Meester (of the recent fame of "Gossip Girl") as her sister Savannah. Apparently, the producers realized the importance of this for their target audience of "teenagers" and the only positive thing they did with the later episodes of the series was to present Linsey Godrey (Caitlin) as a "first love" interest. for Miles. Therefore, as Savannah's screen time decreases, Catlin gradually becomes incorporated. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, they needed a third story to keep viewers sufficiently engaged and it would have been better to limit the adult melodrama in favor of a second group of young actors <br /> <br /> Then again What do I know? I'm just a boy
