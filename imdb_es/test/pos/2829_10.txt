And that's saying a lot. Rent this if you want to be surprised by the strange, surprised by one of the strangest scripts, the direction and the cast in the history of the movies. I'm staggered. I can not believe I've seen it. I'm a big fan of Bernadette Peters, normally, but this proved my resolution. Do not read more comments here, it's better if you do not know anything about the plot. Just rent it. You will not believe what you are seeing .......
