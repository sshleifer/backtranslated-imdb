I must admit that I did not expect this to be as good as it was. I also did not expect Samuel L. Jackson to play the slide and sing in blue. <br /> <br /> Cinemark of Beaver County, PA, does this frequently. They advertise movies in the lobby, they thrill everyone to see it and then they disappoint it by not showing it ... <br /> <br /> I expected that with such a great cast of Jackson and Ricci and even an old N'Syncer (Timberlake ), that this film would at least have been screened for a week. But no, at that moment, if I remember correctly, the MI3 was shown on 3 screens (that or some other kind of supposed box office successes). <br /> <br /> Like Blues Brothers and Crossroads, this film incorporates the mystic and the legend of what passion music blues is about, and difficult times. Religion and sex The dogs of hell from the past. Redemption. I mean, many elements enter the blues to make it work. <br /> <br /> This was just a good story. Of course, not many people will see it because it has no pirates or spiders that swing. But you have Samuel L. Jackson ... <br /> <br /> Think of what happens to the Jacksons character of Pulp Fiction after he walks the earth and establishes himself and that essentially describes him as a "T" " <Br /> <br /> Great and underestimated, but are not all good ones like that?
