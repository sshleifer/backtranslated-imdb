Incredibly well elaborated miniseries. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing most of them twice when it was shown on American Playhouse on PBS. He was strongly promoted at that time. I think it might have been one of the oldest miniseries to appear on PBS outside of the Masterpiece Theater series. <br /> <br /> The complete production was shown, I think, only once during its first broadcast. It was 6-8 hours in total. This duration was edited a little up to 6 hours. Cut out some interesting scenes, but slow ones. <br /> <br /> I hope that people who have their current rights go ahead and restore a full version, not edited, on DVD. It is not worth creating a VHS version at this time. <br /> <br /> It would fit very well in the miniseries or in the genre of dramatic history.
