Keep in mind that this movie has nothing to do with Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist: the Music Hall ... I know what is and what is not associated with the place in New York. Theodore of the movie is just the "Music Hall". There are no Rockettes in the movie. Only wonderful ice skaters, in addition to excellent actors and fun. I just thought you'd like to know. Truly a wonderful movie. You will never guess who the "killer" is while watching this movie ... until the end. What a magnificent and beautiful ice skating parcel. You never see that kind of action again. The Roxy Theater and the Downtown Theaters, in New York City, had ice skating performances on stage!
