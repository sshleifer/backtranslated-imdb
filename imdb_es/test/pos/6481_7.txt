I saw the movie about 13 years ago while living in Airlie Beach Qld Australia. I found it on the shelves of a small store in the back that most do not bother to flip through. <br /> <br /> For my pleasure, I found it and saw it with the intention of one day owning it in my collection. I still do not have it, but someday I will. <br /> <br /> I like the concept with poetry and fantasy. Semi-desert street scenes with a busy team city in the far background were added to the visual effect. <br /> <br /> I have mentioned this movie several times to people who enjoy this genre, with nothing but praise. It has stayed in my mind and it will be for a long time. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie completely, but only for those who are in this type. <br /> <br /> This comment and that of Los Angeles, CA can help you choose to watch this movie. The comments may be negative, but they seemed positive to me if you look beyond the derogatory connotation.
