The second film about the adventures of the couple of Gaulois, Asterix and Obelix, is 10 times better than the first. The humor is great (and irreverent) and the script is well executed, taken from the original 1965 comic Goscinny and Uderzo. I fell asleep with the first movie (although I'm a big fan of Asterix) and I was reluctant to see this sequel, but I'm glad that this movie proved that I was wrong. Excellent comedy for everyone. Highly recommended!
