This movie is one of my best memories of childhood. Seeing the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading to Hollywood, singing and dancing, with Miss Piggy taking care of her beloved Kermit, Fozzie Bear went out of her way to manage everyone, and a generous cast of "extras" They offered a movie that turned out to be "Okey Dokey". <br /> <br /> Kermit's melancholy ukulele number "Rainbow Connection" was nominated for an Oscar that year, but was surpassed by "It Goes Like It Goes" by Norma Rae. I'll choose the Kermit song any day! Get the children and enjoy this timeless fantasy ... someday you will find it, the rainbow connections, the lovers, the dreamers and me.
