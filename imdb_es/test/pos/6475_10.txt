The real life story of perhaps the best soccer coach the game has ever known. Knute Rockne led the "stone age" soccer game with innovations such as the advanced pass and the offensive training changes. But he's probably best known for his costume motivational speeches. Along the way, he brought fame and glory to a small, small and unknown Catholic school in Indiana. Pat O'Brien is incomparable in his role as Rockne. Fabulous cast that includes Ronald Reagan, who delivers a great performance as the first superstar of Notre Dame, George Gipp. <br /> <br /> For football fans, this is the best football film ever made. Do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version. (Some versions have deleted scenes for some reason) If you got the good version, look for a short cameo of the immortal Jim Thorpe as he sticks his head in the locker room and tells Rockne and the team that there are only a few minutes left before the 2nd begins half.
