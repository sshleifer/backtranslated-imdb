This movie was amazing, it was extremely fun and moving. Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Caine have organized a great movie that will appeal to all ages. James McAvoy and Steven Robertson made this film brilliant. His performance was excellent, there was a real real feeling between them, which made you really believe that they were the characters they represented. Romola Garai is incredibly beautiful and brilliant in her role. The story of these two people with physical disabilities and their caregiver is well placed, and you really start to know and feel the characters better as the movie progresses, it was especially annoying at the end. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a movie that is truly felt in the heart, warning the most sensitive viewer to make sure they have paper tissues that will be needed. <br /> <br /> Again, an incredible movie!
