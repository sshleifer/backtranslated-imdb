I saw this movie late at night on a free channel, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Being a fan of horror movies, I often see this kind of midnight movies during school holidays. Most of the time, the horror movies shown during this time are usually large. 'Campfire Tales' certainly does not fit into that category. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is basically an anthology of stories based on familiar urban legends. They combine with an environment in which teens tell these stories around a campfire. This campfire scenario has a mysterious plot in itself. However, this particular story is weak and confusing, obviously used predominantly to create other spooky tales. <br /> <br /> There are three stories in this movie (four if we count 'The Hook' at the beginning), All of which are really creepy and well done. I especially enjoyed the third story ('The Locket') that involves a guy whose motorcycle breaks up in front of a mysterious house. This particular story works well to really scare you with sudden flashbacks to the history of the house. In addition to this, the end of the story will surprise you completely! The first story ('The Honeymoon') was also very scary, although the second story ('People can also lick') lacked something. <br /> <br /> Being a horror movie veteran, I do not usually understand scared. This movie certainly did that job well! What I particularly liked about this movie is the fact that it is divided into three short films. This means that the film will not spend more or less an hour of character development and establishment of the configuration before the real bloodshed begins. That makes 'Campfire Tales' perfect for pajama outings, parties, etc. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is a creepy and crunchy horror movie that will make your heart stop more than once. It's certainly better than the trash you'll often find in theaters these days (Blair Witch 2, Urban Legends: Final Cut ... bleah!). Find a copy and look at it ... if you dare! <br /> <br />
