Realistic masterpiece. Thirty years later, the images may seem a little old, but in reality only the 'fist on the face' effect of the film is needed. I've never seen a movie like this in my whole life. The first time I saw it, I did not know if it was a fiction ... And it did not seem ... That movie is a masterpiece that all the people in the world have to see. It is the best critical film of society. The last movie that shows that the system is down. And the system has not changed much, in thirty years. I think this movie should be seen as an educational piece.
