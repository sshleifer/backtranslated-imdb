This is a truly wonderful love story. I liked the songs, however, even if you do not, you must love the story. Peter O'Toole is at his best and Petula Clark is fine too. I saw it for the first time when I was about 13 years old and I loved it then. Now in my forties, I still enjoy it, probably even more. It still makes me cry and laugh and feel good. It is a movie to see only with a new age boy or alone, since it is a movie for girls. But what's wrong with that? You need a bit of romance and maybe a little crying, try this movie. <br /> <br />
