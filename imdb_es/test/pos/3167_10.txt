At first I did not know if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after a taste experience or maybe a revelation. The film is a human search to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. Lead is clueless and cold. It is like all of us who wants to get rich, laugh, travel, eat and entertain. It moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or reason just to pass the time and entertain. In the end it is too late. Since my first visit to the US UU., It grew in me like a dream made to measure where life on earth is nothing but a strange experience. I am an artist and a Buddhist and this film communicated to my senses. He was an ideal embodiment of impermanence. This may sound strange, but somehow this movie was able to touch me in a way as deep as any other. I recommend it.
