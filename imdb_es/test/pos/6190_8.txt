To be completely honest, I was completely intrigued by the original concept of 'Sleeper Cell'. Having seen the best part of the series on the FX channel (United Kingdom), my Sky broke up, which means that I missed the crucial final. But what I did see, I assumed it was a great story, good acting and since I do not see '24', I thought it was great, and it was confirmed for a second season ... <br /> <br /> One of the best TV shows that I've seen. Much more realistic and credible than "24". Excellent development of characters and plot. It does not hit Islam, but it gives a thoughtful and considerate approach, which shows the difference between radical terrorist Islam and true Islam. Everyone should see this show! <br /> <br /> Stringy xx
