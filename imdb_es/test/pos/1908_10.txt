Yes ... I read David Lee Roth's autobiography, "Crazy From the Heat" (which by the way is an amazing read), and DLR says that this was his favorite blacksploitation movie as a child. In fact, he says he always imagined himself as a black man in Southern California. Mr. Roth is mentioned: <br /> <br /> "We saw all the photos of Blacksploitation, and those films were a big influence for me: Trouble Man, Superfly, Foxy Brown, Shaft, Cleopatra Jones, Blacula, Rudy Ray Moore doing his Dolemite style, I saw all those ... "<br /> <br /> Keep saying: <br /> <br />" Dolemite, Rudy Ray Moore, was one of the originals, it was a blue comic, with blue humor, as Redd Foxx did on the first records of the party, he was the most perfect to play a new secret agent, his answer was not "Bonds." James Bond. "His answer was" Dolemite, motherf *** **! "We would expect that line in all of his films." Get Whitey "would appear in all the movies at least once, and we would expect that too. They had the cars. They had the shoes. They had weapons. The haircuts. The slang And the scams. And we all knew that all those beatific resolutions at the end of the film were white bull *** *. He is trying to feed hungry children but he is really a pimp ... bull ****. That was designed to be pleasant for our moms and dads to let us see the image. "<br /> <br /> Spoken like a real genius, so when reading about Dolemite in Mr. Roth's book, I bought immediately on a DVD and I really like it Yes, it's very low budget, and yes ... I hate rap ... but as a fan of Tarantino's movies, I can see many similarities, especially some of the fusion music / funk ala-jaco pastorius from the 70s throughout the film, I also love the scene in which the two policemen "turn it on" for coca and then one of them snorts a lot as if he had done it a thousand times before, and says something like: "Aww, yes ... that's the real mccoy! "... and then he continues to talk and he still has a bit of coca on his lip CLASSIC! Part of the violence is a little exaggerated, but shocking, which I consider a positive quality, not as predictable as I assumed it would be. I'm going to pick up "The Human Tornado" very soon, 10 of the 10.
