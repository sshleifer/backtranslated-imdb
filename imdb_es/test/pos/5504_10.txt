I think this movie is the most misunderstood movie in Jerry Lewis' career. It's a bit slow to start, but after it gets going it's a lot of fun and Jerry's use of irony as never before in his previous films ..., that is, Who's Minding the Store, The Nutty Professor, etc., the idea is clear, it's a simulacrum of the Dirty Dozen, instead of getting soldiers on the death row to do a suicide mission like in that movie, you have 4, 4-f's and 2 labels along. Including the former center fielder of the A. L. Dodgers, Willie Davis as Linc! FUNNY! I love that movie!
