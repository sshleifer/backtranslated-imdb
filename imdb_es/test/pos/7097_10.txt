This movie was a very good Universal Monster movie. Once again stars Lon Chaney as The Wolfman and Glenn Strange as the Frankenstein Monster. Ah, yes, that jerk John Carradine has returned as Dracula. I like all the actors in this movie. I especially liked Onslow Stevens as Dr. Edelmann. (It is written with 2 n) I thought it was a good idea to have the good-hearted doctor condemned as Talbot. One scene that I think is very good is the scene in which Dr. Edelmann is thinking deeply as he changes. Everything that worries you blinks before your eyes. The good doctor says no, while his bad side says yes. That's the only reason why I did not want Dracula's character to be completely removed from this movie. I thought that Dracula did not have business in the House of Frankenstein. If your character was eliminated you would not miss him. In this film, the doctor's blood is contaminated with Dracula's blood, which gives him his curse of Jekyll and Hyde. I hate John Carradine and I think he should never have played with Dracula. I did not care if other actors played the Frankenstein Monster after the great Karloff because they all did good jobs. But when they get another actor to play Dracula, he stops there. John Carradine thought he was so tall and powerful. He was offered the role of the Frankenstein Monster once and he rejected it because he thought he was too trained. I could imagine Carradine if he played The Monster arguing with the director on the set: "I do not have to take this off, I've done Shakespeare." John Carradine was not Dracula and he never will be. I'm sorry John, Bela Lugosi is the only Dracula. Thank God, they got Bela back as Dracula so that Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie. You will not be disappointed and you will enjoy it as you did with the other. This is a very good addition to the monster movies. If you are a collector, make sure you do not leave it out. <br /> <br />
