Warning: this movie has amazingly graphic images and children should never see it. <br /> <br /> The artist that this story is about was, in fact, an excellent Korean painter who rose from the deepest depths to become his artist. The best painter Unfortunately, in many ways, this guy was also a fool in many ways. Part of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was its demanding nature when it comes to art. But, other times, he was just a drunken jerk, especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist. By the end of the movie, his annoying, abrasive and unnecessarily cruel self seemed to have diminished. While all this did not make him a particularly nice man, it is important to capture it in a film, so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist. <br /> <br /> I really found the film fascinating and I loved how real artists were shown throughout the film (as in LUST FOR LIFE). I really wish I could show this to my students (I teach in an arts school), but I can not because there is too much material for adults. Yes, there is nudity, but even more problematic for any audience (especially the younger ones) is when he ... hmmm, ... I do not think IMDb allows me to describe what happened, but it was very graphic and it's about body fluids . Not just an unpleasant and unpleasant scene that did not need to be seen, but a reason to prevent young people from watching this film, which otherwise is wonderful. It is a real pity.
