Of course, how could he. Obviously, he opted for several aspects of that excellent film, which was also based on the sensational French case of the "World Health Organization doctor", who called himself and murdered his family and himself when he finally unmasked him as a fraud. Emilio refers to his son as a "monster", he sings to the radio in his car, hangs on the banks of the park and specializes in investment plans to swindle his family and friends, all this and more directly taken from " Time Out ", which came out the year before to" Nobody's Life ". It's very bad because this movie is pretty good by itself, with good acting and writing. While Vincent of "Time Out" is a much more subtle character who seems to have a sense of ethics, although sometimes it becomes a knot, the protagonist seems to lack any character, except for his winning looks and charm. Seriously, the part where he used X-rays that show that his mother-in-law's cancer steals more money from his father, then uses a subtle twist in the same scam to avoid eviction from his elegant home for not paying the contract. lease time - it's almost too much The guy has no shame whatsoever. In fact, he looks more like the leader in "Stepfather" than a poor imbecile who is fired and is so humiliated that he can not face the disappointment of his family and friends and feels compelled to invent a new life for himself, as did Vincent in "Time Out". Therefore, one might feel that the tension increases in "Nobody's life" and that the violent conclusion arrives. One thing that "Nobody's Life" has that "Time Out" definitely lacked was a love interest apart from the protagonist's confident wife. It is not difficult to understand how the sexy babysitter was able to fascinate and trap Emile to the extent that he ignored the danger of his natural curiosity and allowed him to reveal his unguarded scam. Given the reservations mentioned, this is a pretty good movie that we found entertaining. If you long for something that touches similar elements to go deeper and be more intellectually and spiritually satisfying, I strongly suggest "Time out."
