Broadcast news {dir. James L. Brooks, 1987} <br /> <br /> **** / **** <br /> <br /> Although it lacks the emotional impact of Brooks' debut feature, (Terms of Endearment) Broadcast News is a superlative film, with exceptional performances by each of the three conductors and a script that feels as genuine and well researched as a blunt news report. Let it be known, this is a film of characters in the first place and a second satire. In my opinion, it succeeds on both levels on its own terms. The characters in the film have a surprising depth and dimension, while the satire is still cunning and never bitter. Comparisons with the Net are unnecessary because movies have two completely separate objectives and attitudes. While it is also a great movie, Network is a cynical and tired job; In other words, it is crazy and you are fed up with the state of television. The satire style of the network feels more extreme and guerrilla. In contrast, the characters that populate the Broadcast News newsrooms love and live for their jobs (sometimes to the detriment of their love lives). They get pleasure from the stress and satisfactions of the news, just as the public gets pleasure from seeing this. Sweet and romantically realistic masterpiece.
