Dylan and Bobby are childhood friends and are in love as children sometimes do. But Dylan has met a girl and is beginning to put aside those childhood things. Bobby knows he is not interested in girls and he misses what he had with Dylan. <br /> <br /> Received as part of a pop video of the 80s, part of a home movie, part of the memory of the video, this film tells a confused and sad story, but very often true, that He will come home with many people who see her. <br /> <br /> This movie brings back many memories and played a true chord with me, but I wish the filmmaker had gone a little further and left him with a happier note. Yes, we all love and lose, even when we are young, but there is always a tomorrow, especially when we are young.
