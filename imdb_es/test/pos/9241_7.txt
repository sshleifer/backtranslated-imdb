Anyone who has asked how to make a movie without a budget should watch this documentary. The determination of all those portrayed in this project was very moving for me, and should connect us with those of us who have ever ventured into any part of the entertainment world, be it film, music or writing. I think the filmmakers could have done a better job of presaging the events that led to this film becoming a documentary, perhaps because of the use of a narrator; Apart from that, the film appears as a real example of how the entertainment business is not about "the program", but about "the business". <br /> <br /> I hope that the real planned project, "Repo Hombre II", gets to see the light of day. I think the filmmakers did a good job with the little they had to work and everything they had to overcome to complete it.
