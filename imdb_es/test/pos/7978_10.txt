This is a cute little movie that offers almost everything it promises: good entertainment. After all, when a movie proclaims that it has the best SASS shooters, you must think that it is not a likely candidate for the Oscar for the "Best Picture." Those guys are shooters, not actors. His next clue is that the film is not starring Nicholas Cage or Jennifer Aniston, that is, should not expect to see the most current names. It was meant to be just an old-fashioned entertainment and, in that sense, it's as good as many of the "brandy" I've seen over the years. <br /> <br /> So, what do you get with "Hell to pay? You have 100 minutes of good old entertainment. You have the opportunity to see some stars from the past few years, which look a lot like what they did in their better time but a little older, you have the opportunity to see some good SASS shooters in leading roles and some SASS hams in the background, it was very funny for me to see the people I've filmed with, I've visited them in their homes and They are good friends who can do something that many people have only dreamed about: they are in a real and honest life, gosh movie, they are doing something, many aspiring actors and would-be shooters will never have the opportunity to do it and I think that that just makes it worth seeing. <br /> <br /> It's true that not everyone is a SASS member and that's why I saw a lot of fun and humor that others can get lost, but it's still good old-fashioned entertainment, and frankly, h and MANY movies in the theater at this time that I would not give a penny, so save the money to go see "Brokeback Mountain" get "Hell to Pay" and see some cowboys really have fun.
