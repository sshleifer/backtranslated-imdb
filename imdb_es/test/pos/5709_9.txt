Four adorable young nurses in their final year in nursing school experience all kinds of excitement and excitement in their lives: the sweet Susan (brunette brunette Elaine Giftos) tries to comfort Greg (a moving performance by Darrell Larson), anxious but the neurotic Phred (the lovely blonde Karen Carlson) romances, the handsome gynecologist Jim Caspar (the affable Lawrence Casey), the free-spirited hippie Priscilla (the incredibly beautiful Barbara Leigh) is impregnated by the relaxed drug trafficker Les (the solid Richard Rust) and compassionate Lynn (very well played by Brioni Farrell) helps the angry Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie (the excellent Reni Santoni). Despite the fact that this film was made for Roger Corman's legendary exploiting team, New World Pictures, it's anything but your normal piece with no sense of soft-core darning. Instead, it is a very pleasant, charming and even often reflective capsule of the social and political upheavals of the early 70s (the secondary plot involving Lynn and the revolutionaries is especially potent and provocative). Special congratulations to the director Stephanie Rothman, who offers a welcome and a refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material. In addition, the four attractive and attractive women lead a solid and praiseworthy work. Scottie MacGregor also impresses how the wise supervisor, Ms. Boswell and the ubiquitous 70's announcer, Ronald Gans, provide the off-screen voice of a psychiatrist. The polished cinematography of Stevan Larner, the fantastic rock soundtrack and the tasty folksy'n'funky song by Clancy B. Grass III are up to date. A true sleeper.
