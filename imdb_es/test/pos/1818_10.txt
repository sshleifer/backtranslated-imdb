20 years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around. Never a movie has surpassed the incredible soundtrack of Valley Girl. The film completely encapsulated the 80s to such a perfect degree that only this could be done many years later. Nicolas Cage at his best. A film that has so much character, that makes you realize how sad Hollywood has become (in terms of quality). The special DVD edition is loaded with tons of extras and is worth buying, as it will have a lot of material to analyze. For sure.
