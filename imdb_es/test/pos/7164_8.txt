Originally I saw this movie as a Blockbuster VHS rental. That was a long time ago, but I still remembered it. Blockbuster does not have it anymore. Netflix did not have it and there were not many copies on the web, just a few spent copies of VHS. Recently, I finally found it available on DVD at a reasonable price (in PAL format, but our DVD player will play PAL discs on our NTSC TV). <br /> <br /> We both enjoy it. The style of the film is a bit strong, and many, if not most of the parts, are too over-interpreted as if the fans did (especially children), but it's not annoying. The contrasts of societies are accentuated in exaggeration. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of political preaching in terms of saying that young people in Russia should not try to escape from their not-so-big life, but should at least try to improve things first. But that is not dominant. It's pretty funny most of the time. <br /> <br /> Some of the negative interpretations of the West commented by others is not that IMO at all, I take it as a comment on the expectations of the Russian characters. At least when it is taken from my western point of view. Maybe it's a reduced version of the west from a Russian point of view (which is literally by the characters that say it). <br /> <br /> I can not say how literally faithful to the film are the English subtitles, but I can. Say that the subtitles were done very well, full of idiomatic expressions in English as if you were a native English speaker, complete with a "colorful" language.
