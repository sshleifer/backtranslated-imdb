This was a pretty good movie that in general was pretty good. The idea about Mercy (it will not go bad) was also original. I think Angelina did a good job as one of her first movies. The only things I disapproved were some of the cheesy fight scenes (they will not spoil either). I liked the first movie and I liked it too. 7/10
