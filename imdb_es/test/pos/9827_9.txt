I really enjoyed "Random Hearts". It was shocking to see such a low rating on IMDB, but I did not have a child and all that. I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I have to admit that he was wrong in this movie, and the reason why I gave him 9 instead of 10. Kristin Scott Thomas, however, was just wonderful. She was believable and beautiful, despite having been fixed for half the movie as if she had been crying for days. Could there be "random hearts" better? Sure, but it's really worth seeing it as it is.
