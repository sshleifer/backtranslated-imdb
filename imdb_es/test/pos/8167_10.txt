This was a truly moving movie in every sense of the word. I myself was a Mormon missionary and I know firsthand the desire to complete my mission, but at the same time I hid the fact that I was gay. Like the character Aaron, I was sent home for having been discovered and excommunicated, but being the only Mormon in a family of Catholics was not as great a pity as for the main character. This film really took me back to those days and helped me realize, years later, how lucky I was to have a family that accepted me and understood what was happening. I found myself applauding the end of a movie when Aaron and Christian meet again by chance at the Lila's restaurant. It really moved me to tears. I strongly recommend this film to all who read this review and also declare it essential.
