This little short film fascinates me absolutely. <br /> <br /> The only thing I've seen so far is part of the work of Sam Brakhage, the creator of Dog Star Man. However, when Brakhage tries to disconcert "making us learn to see again" and gives us an affront of headache that induces bright colors and sparkles (which I still dig and totally embrace as art ...), this film that would characterize as very relaxing and hypnotizing. The widespread use of rotating objects / camera by Man Ray does not create a feeling of dizziness, but a warm flow of senses, which intermingles and accompanies the gravity of the world in motion that surrounds us. <br /> <br /> An interesting concept of this very brief work is that as it progresses, the objects become more and more recognizable until we end up in a naked torso (of which I think they are the less rounded breasts and less feminine than I've seen). The circles and spirals of shadow and light on the torso make it an object of surreal beauty, something you can hang on your wall and deepen forever. It is because of this and other images in this film that I had to see it again and again (up to a total of seven times) simply because it completely fascinates me. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
