Do you know the concept of "guilty pleasures"? Yes, you have them, like admitting that you saw (and enjoyed) goonies, battlestar galactica AFTER they came to Earth, and the series, Charlie's angels, Starsky and Hutch, the version of Superman in 1950, or Godzilla movies. <br /> <Here is the ultimate in guilty pleasures. combined with all the exchanges in an hour full of sam raimi action, this space of half an hour is fast, easy to follow and is loaded with funny babies seen with exploration clothing. <br /> <br /> the man who brought us the death of evil, xena, hercules and the adventures of brisco county jr do it again with this 2000 update of Charlie's angels. we got charlie (voice) an unknown being who has the knowledge and the time to find people who need help, bosley (man), the man of gadgets, and three beautiful girls who kick ** to make a living. <br /> <br /> and oh that life!
