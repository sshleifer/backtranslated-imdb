Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookstore in the quiet seaside town of Loblolly by the Sea. Divorced, Helen has a daughter who goes camping during the summer, giving the mother a bit more freedom. Working in Helen's shop are the manager, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a gossipy townwife who has eyes for the handsome fireman, George (Tom Selleck), and two young college students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny (Tom Everett Scott). One day, Helen stumbles upon a romantic and tender love letter and suspects that Johnny has written it for her. Throwing caution to the wind, Helen and Johnny start a small "thing". But then the letter falls into the hands of others, including Janet, who believes that George sent it to him and Johnny, who imagines that Helen wrote it for him. And, again and again the letter goes. But, in truth, George possibly has eyes for Helen and Jennifer has fallen in love with Johnny. The curator of the city museum can also have a secret love. Will entangled matters like these get tangled up? This is a beautiful movie with a beautiful scenery and capable stars. Each of the main actors provides a pleasant performance, including the addition of Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart to those mentioned above. Then, too, the coastal landscape is more charming, the costumes quite well chosen, and the photography very pleasant. There are some surprises, including a subtle development of the gay plot, which may not please all the spectators. But, for those who love romantic comedies, this should be included in any list of good choices for the genre.
