This is a disturbing job. It's only ten minutes long, but I'd rather pay ten dollars at the cinema to watch this than to watch a long-running movie doing the rounds. It is a simple piece of a man's reflection. He came to a young man in this place and was fascinated by a room and the music that came from it ... and now here he sits, dying in old age in this place to which he so kindly connects. to his youth. The music is brilliant, the guitars have that sound of the jazz room like the music of Neil Young in the dead man. If you have the opportunity, watch this movie. Worth it. If Rutger had blown more movies like this, I think he would get more respect than he gets. The moment you hear it, put yourself under phrases like "everyone's favorite psychopath". I'm sure that's not what Rutger would like to remember as an actor. He also directed this film, so this shows that he is a very artistic actor / director. A change of the b-grade films that he has been doing since the early days. The 90s. I hope to see more of this ruther hauer since he is one of my favorite actors.
