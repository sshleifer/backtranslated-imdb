"My Dinner with Andre" of 1980, with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory, is essentially a dialogue about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit. 'You Are Alone' of 2005 demonstrates how common mundane events can shatter the soul. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around three main characters. There's Daphne, a teenage student who cares about almost every decision in her life. Then there's the prostitute, or paid escort, Britney, as sure of herself as Daphne is self-conscious. What makes them interesting is that they share the same body, if not the same person. Part of the magic of this film occurs in one of the first scenes in which Daphne approaches the door of an aged hotel room. She stops and obviously is torn by the decision of whether or not to knock on the door. but it is Britney who slides effortlessly into the room when the door opens. <br /> <br /> On the other side of that door is Buddy, a middle-aged person with few or no personal qualities that anyone could find attractive. He goes as far as to face the profession chosen by Britney as soon as she enters the room. However, we soon learn that Buddy is the neighbor next to Daphne and that she has observed over the years how she grew up from girl to girl. This complicates things for the audience. Buddy is just a worried neighbor or does he want something else? <br /> <br /> If it's the sex that Buddy wants, here it is. Britney loves sex. Their definitions may be clintonesque, but that does not show their enthusiasm. He prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic bracelets that invites his clients to choose. Each color band denotes a specific act that she will perform? but exactly what act is not revealed until after the band breaks off of his wrist and the election becomes irrevocably. <br /> <br /> Britney is, or thinks she has control of every encounter. Even with his eyes blindfolded and tied, as he is by one of his regular customers, he imagines that his arms and body are caressed by several men, but his legs and pubic area are being caressed by a woman with colored underwear. blood red. The images of the movie keep coming. <br /> <br /> Buddy's pathetic life is acceptance. He has lost his wife, his dog, even his fantasies of the beautiful teenager next door. It is no accident that he has attracted Daphne or Britney to this particular hotel room. There is a painting on the wall of a food plate with only one fish head on the left. This is a perfect metaphor for Buddy's life; All good parts are finished. So it is here, where he brought his wife when they were still university students, where he defends? to recover some control of his own life, to make his statement. <br /> <br /> The director of 'You Are Alone', Gorman Bechard, knows his trade. The main action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film, assisted by a large number of interspersed scenes that add dimension to the characters, their circumstances and conflicts. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, Britney asks Buddy if he should undress. He says yes, but she gets naked only to her underwear. A real prostitute would probably remove all her clothes (one of the five that receives the profession). But it is not Buddy that is making fun, we are. As the film concludes, we find that there are much deeper human emotions and motivations at play. A tease does not work unless it actually delivers. Britney does it, so does 'You're alone'.
