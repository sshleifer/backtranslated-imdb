"Hari om" is an Indian greeting and the convincing title character from the movie of the same name (played by the wedding organizer of Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of South India. There are no backdrops or stereotypes of "Bend it like Beckham", and only slight greetings to Bollywood music and dance (however, the soundtrack is worth it), but the feeling that you are seeing the real India permeates the movie. the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to increase the performance of the five professional actors. Fortunately for us, Hari Om's partner is a beautiful young French woman looking for a trip. With a presentation of a trip "And Your Mama Tambien" towards self-discovery (without sex and fatal illness), this beautiful film calms and brings the philosophical mind. Against the initial juxtaposition of the protagonists, all are identified with the traits of both and the cultural division disappears as humanity advances. Put more succinctly, the central theme of the film, "Everyone has a love story, do not miss yours" teaches us a lot about love on several levels. Do not miss this movie!
