I can not say that this show is perfect. Maybe all the previous commentators remember the old slot at 10:30 on Tuesday, occupied by Butch Elvira Curt's childhood humor ("There's a space shuttle that rides a 747!"). Oh, the glory of battling to press any button on the remote control to make it change. Face it, comedy can not get a Showcase and create the comedic genius of the truly Canadian Trailer Park Boys. But hey, they try. <br /> <br /> This program is by far one of the best original programs. However, none of the following will find themselves laughing at the apparent "players" who show their stupidity by picking up the girls: <br /> <br /> a) "Dumb" Girls - Obviously, they can not realize that are. Like the girls in the program. Unaware of. Jump on man's flesh, you can call yourself a whore tomorrow and get his name. It looks good, it should be popular and nice. HAHAHAHA !!! Oh, but you would never do that! Nobody would ... if they knew what was happening. <br /> <br /> b) Unsociable men who think that women like nice guys. Obviously, seeing these guys succeed in failing or even not getting to the experience is going to boil their primary rages. Look more closely, they are shot down most of the time. They say stupid things. <br /> <br /> c) Girls respect each other: Obviously, seeing their separate female species get trapped in real world situations is wrong. Nobody plays. Women are not objects, they can not be played, because they are all very faithful angels who go to the clubs to talk politely without fear of the boys trying to pick them up. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait ... hmmmmmmmm <br /> <br /> As much as EVERYONE will say that this show is not fun, and that it does not teach you anything, I have to take the opposite side. The program is very good at detailing the way relationships work for both men and women. The way they think, and the way they think about each other, and the social hierarchy. It's fun to watch and listen to the guys make absolutely idiotic comments to what the women say ("My grandfather died recently" "Oh ... well, are we having fun tonight?"). <br /> <br /> Also, it's a club. The place where people go to have fun, and lie down. No matter who you are, you go to a club to call or pay attention to someone. The boys go there to try their game and pick up girls. The girls go there to flirt with the boys and find the one who better drags her off their feet. Just relax! <br /> <br /> If you are a man, learn one or two things about the different approaches and the different effects they have. If you are a girl, learn what these whores of men "stallions" really think and learn to differentiate them from genuine boys. The next time you break up with one of those assholes, you realize it's not because of him, it's because you're a fool and you thought he was the best kid of all time when he was clearly a jerk to you all the time.
