I saw this movie many years ago and it has never left my list of the best movies of all time. When I saw it for the first time, I was beginning what has become a lifelong passion for justice. He gave an interesting perspective on the death penalty and also gave me some things to think about. <br /> <br /> When you have a cast like this, you're right in assuming it will be nothing less than fabulous. This is by far the best role I've seen Sean Penn playing (along with I am Sam). He nails the paper, he does not glamorize his actions while he does it. He manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the film that I think was very important. Until the end, he does not try to be seen as something other than what he is. He is a sick man who regrets his past, but still has excuses for it. He ends up being able to redeem his sense of self-esteem as much as a convicted (and guilty) murderer can, through the help of Susan Sarandon's character, Sister Helen Prejean. His character taught me about goodwill towards others, without making me forget how horrible the actions of a person can be and without giving excuses. <br /> <br /> The support cast was also top-notch. I was surprised to see a little cameo by Jack Black in this film given the funny man he has become today! I loved this movie for personal reasons and just because it was a cinematographic work of art. And, in my opinion, this is one of the rare exceptions when the movie passed the book.
