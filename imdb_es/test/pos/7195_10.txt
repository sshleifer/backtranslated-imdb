It's the first time I remember that an adaptation did exactly the same as the book ... In fact, only jokes were added to the story instead of mixed or deleted content! <br /> <br /> Like the Egyptian slave Cellularis Who had difficulty transmitting, um, communication, LOL! Or when Tidivinnus was played as a quasi-Sith Lord and was upset when the Roman Empire withstood a blow, the general ordered the Empire ... Ah, look at the people in the movie! <br /> <br /> I can easily believe that this image was one of the most expensive in the history of French cinema and, for my part, it was worth it, Depardieux was excellent as the Roman attack and the boar chewing obelix. Clavier playing the small indomitable Gaul was perfect and far from his days as the clumsy Jean Reno in "Just Visiting". <br /> <br /> The scene of the fight between Artifis and Edifis was very funny and enjoyable. The Matrix theme was not borrowed to strip an otherwise perfect battle! <br /> <br /> Redbeard the pirate and his crew almost stole the photo, from dragging their own ship to being the engine of Otis (Assistant of Edifis) invention used at the end. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are Asterix and the Olympic Games with many of the same team back, by Toutatis, I think I see that too!
