It is an interesting fact that the metaphysics of Plato and Aristotle, formal logic and abstract ontology are formed on those sciences in which most people are not interested. But then, about a thousand years after Aristotle, the computer began to usurp human thought and the human beings who refused to reflect the questions of not being biological, physical or chemical, suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not cope with the consequences that these computers would bring "during the night". R.W. "Welt Am Draht" by Fassbinder, along with "Solaris" by Tarkovsky and "Alphaville" by Godard, is probably the first film that took the philosophical questions of emerging computing as the basis of a story to be told in a movie. The confusing questions about identities and realities are intelligently incorporated into different intertwined criminal histories that the audience really tries to follow because they are interested in solving the cases. Fassbinder was a master at selling highly abstract content to his audience by incorporating theoretical knowledge into practical and appetizing forms. The basic problem that must be understood is that an identity defines a reality, but on the other side, a reality also requires an identity to be perceived. The idea of ​​a person with multiple identities is known only from the point of view of psychiatry. However, logically speaking, the only reason we only have an identity is the fact that our logic has only two values ​​(correct and false). Now take a logic with just one more value, that is, with three: Then, as you can easily see, you already have three identities. What happens now, when, say, Dr. Stiller is killed? Then, it is very possible that only one of the three identities is abolished and the other two remain and can rescue the individual from death. Another question is, if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at the same time. However, the idea of ​​showing such sets of identities in an ascending or descending manner, as shown in the scene with the elevator in the hotel, is misleading, since identities and realities are not structured in a hierarchical way, but rather in a heterarchical. Strictly speaking, there is no "artificial identity" either, since each identity is defined on two objects that share all their characteristics with each other. Therefore, the idea of ​​assuming that each individual has a single identity is only a consequence of the old logic of two values ​​(a second identity would imply that a person, at the same time, exists and does not exist). But now look around and see that each subject perceives in its own way the same object (which is, by definition, identical to itself). Therefore, if each subject sees an object differently, why should it not be possible for the individual individual to open the limits of his corset of individuality of two values, with the effect that different people can exchange their different Individualities? Fassbinder five years later would resume this theme in his masterpiece "Despair, A Journey to the Light".
