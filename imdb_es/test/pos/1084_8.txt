Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictional story surrounding a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agashe is a tough, hard-working policeman who heads a plainclothes crime squad that becomes famous by killing dangerous criminals at organized police rallies instead of locking them in jail. His loyal officers obey him without question, but a crack forms when one of his officers, Imtiaz, is frustrated by Sadhu's high rank and is secretly competing with him for his murders and his status. A new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and Imtiaz gets angry when Sadhu allows him to take the initiative in his first case. An additional change occurs in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhu's tactics and who are all trapped in internal politics. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such a well-directed action thriller coming from India. The work of the camera is excellent, the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds. The performance, the rhythm and the political subterfuge convince the spectator that they are a fly on the wall that witnesses blood, sweat and tears from a personal and close point of view, and that the events are based on the reality, which undoubtedly explains why they tell us It is not at the beginning of the film, although it is likely that the director, Shimit Amin, has taken liberties with factual accounts. However, Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished cinematographic piece.
