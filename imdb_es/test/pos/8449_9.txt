Great movie of the late seventies. It says a lot about corporate corruption at the expense of the common person, so that the powerful can make huge profits and ignore the environment and the safety of others. <br /> <br /> Almost 30 years later, this film is convincing about the power of certain corporate entities that since the release of films have multiplied their control capacity tenfold; It shows the need for public regulation against powerful commercial interests whose main objective is profit. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon is brilliant, while Jane Fonda and Micheal Douglas are equally convincing in their roles. The frivolous 70's were condemned by a lot, this movie redeems the decade. <br /> <br /> A movie that becomes better after each observation.
