James Stewart plays Dr. Ben McKenna, who, with his wife and son, are tourists in an Arab city. They get caught in the middle of a murder scene. The victim whispers something in Dr. McKenna's ear and he is told to do something. <br /> <br /> Later, your son is kidnapped. The kidnappers turn out to be a man and a woman he knew, but the woman is a little softer than the man. <br /> <br /> The song, "Que, Sera, Sera" (What we are, we will be "be be" is one of the best songs that have been sung in any movie. <br /> <br /> The wife of Stewart of Doris Day, who sings the song mentioned above, her performance is Oscar-worthy, I'm surprised she was not even nominated. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10.
