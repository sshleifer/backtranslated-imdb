The Love Letter is one of my favorite books of all time, so naturally I was skeptical when I heard it was to become a movie. But I liked it. I found myself smiling through the whole movie. I admit it's not a great movie, but it's definitely an enjoyable hour and a half. I thought that Capshaw and Scott were perfect like Helen and Johnny. Just as I imagined them. And the city and the landscape were also good. I recommend this movie, but do not expect too much, just enjoy it.
