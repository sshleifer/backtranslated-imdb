I enjoyed, I appreciated, I will see this movie again because I am sure there are some subtleties that I missed. Beautifully cast, without exaggerated action or Clich√© or plot. It uses a tragic event to reflect multiple relationships, how the people involved in each relationship are connected (or disconnected) and the perceptions of life, what position each person occupies in the relationship, in life and how they face confusion, joy, the pain and the disappointment. to discover that things are not what they perceived they were. At first I thought there were "Observers" and "the observed", but that is not the case, we are all connected in some way and our perceived separation is only in small degrees. I recommend the film to everyone, especially those who work in teaching, social work, religious counseling and any other person who breathes.
