Josie is a newspaper reporter who has the task of going back to high school, since she will be 17 years old again. <br /> <br /> While she is there, remember some really horrible things that happened to her the first time she was in Highschool as we see in flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> In the flashback Show that (the little spoiler) Josie was kind of a nerd in high school and was chosen in large numbers and one day the cool guy tells her he's taking her to the prom , only on graduation night when he leaves his home that he receives. For the hole in the ass and his bitch. What a horrible thing to do (some of you will find it hard to see as it is very unpleasant and will make you feel more affectionate with Josie). <br /> <br /> I did not find this movie so funny, but there really was something Funny things in the office scenes a lot more fun than anything that happened at school. <br /> <br /> This movie had the perfect happy ending, as it brought tears to my eyes from mom and sister. The performance in this movie was not outstanding, it was good in most of the movie, there are some bad performances in some parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie 7 out of 10.
