The biggest tragedy surrounding this charming film is its lack of distribution in the United States. I was fortunate to see this film at the Boston International Women's Film Festival, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has the opportunity to see it. The fabulous performances, thoughtful script and excellent direction of the talented and funny Rose Troche combine to make this film a winner!
