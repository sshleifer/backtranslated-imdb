probably the best horror movie in 5 years ... there have been boring remakes, attempts to scare you (when all they do is leave the theater) and movies that simply should not have been made. But this one is worth it. the only reason I did not give him a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but his death scene makes up for it, believe me) .. <br /> <br /> .. so here they are ... the SPOILERS of all the scenes of death in the movie .. <br /> <br /> 1. My favorite death scene: the Paris Hilton! After finding her boyfriend Blake lying on the floor with a knife protruding from her neck, Paige starts to run. Well, the fast walk is more respectable. She finds this like a garage with all these cars in it. then (one of) the assassins cut her ankle from below (all this time she's holding a HUGE metal spike) so she drops it and runs and hides behind this car. the murderer picks it up and, while looking out the window, throws it out the window and shoots through his forehead. I HAVE NEVER BEEN EXCUTED OR RIVER SO HARD IN MY LIFE. <br /> <br /> 2. Paige's boyfriend, Blake, receives a knife that stabs him in the neck and then the murderer approaches him (while he is on the ground) and steps on him pushing him further into his throat ... then dies. <br /> <br /> 3. Elisha Cuthbert (Carly) (one of the hottest girls in history) does not die PHEW but she does hit her lips, hit her face and cut off part of her index finger (yes, I felt like I was bulging). ) 4. Carly's twin brother, Nick, also survives, but not without being kicked in the ass and a stab in the leg. <br /> <br /> 5. nicks, the best friend Dalton is thrown down a flight of stairs and then decapitated. his body is dragged and we see his eyes blink .. then he covers himself with wax. <br /> <br /> 6. Wade (Carly's boyfriend) cuts the Achilles tendon with huge scissors, and then is attacked by the same scissors. It does not die, but it is covered in wax, and on 2 occasions its skin is accidentally removed, revealing its unpleasant bloody flesh. YUMMY <br /> <br /> .. so there it is. Definitely worth your money.
