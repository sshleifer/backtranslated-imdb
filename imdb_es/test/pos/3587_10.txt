The Blue Planet series is, without a doubt, one of the best documentaries ever made in the ocean. For five years, the filmmakers worked tirelessly on the series, obtaining images that nobody had ever seen (that is, in the title, The Deep). <br /> <br /> I recommend you see this series. Seeing the fisherman fish outside the small images that are shown in the textbooks is really a pleasure, but only a needle in the vast sea hay that covers the Blue Planet. From the open ocean to the tide pools, from the coral seas to the darkest part of the ocean, the BBC takes the viewer on an almost magical journey across the ocean. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that one of my first dreams in life was to be a marine biologist, and after watching this series, the dream was revived. I have studied the oceans of this world for years and have seen countless documentaries about coral reefs and dolphins, whales and crustaceans. But in general, nobody has managed to capture life under the waves as well as this group of people. <br /> <br /> Look at the 'Blue Planet' series in its entirety, I promise you will not regret it. that.
