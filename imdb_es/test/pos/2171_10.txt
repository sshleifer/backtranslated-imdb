Most of the other reactions of the subscribers to this service were very adequate, although some found it slow or ambiguous. Instead of ambiguous, it was complex and multi-layered in its meanings. One can see it as against the war, because of the opening and closing scenes, and the madness of feigned greatness, because of how wonderful the men of cavalry were as they prepared for the great charge in Eylau, in contrast to their conclusion so horrible and disturbing when we see the bloody uniforms, the dead children, etc., but mainly, I see the film as a moral man in an immoral society. In the end, Chabert chooses to withdraw from the corrupt post-Napoleonic French world and opts for the simple pleasures provided by Derville (who in turn is saved by recognizing Chabert's basic decency and the morality of his choice to quit): white bread, cheese , a little wine and tobacco, about the riches that he leaves to his wife and her and the dishonor of society. In her case, we can see the film as feminist, in the position of women at that time, in which the only weapons that Mrs. Chabert has are her charm, beauty, tricks and, ultimately, money.
