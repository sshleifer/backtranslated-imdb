Filmed entirely in Bulgaria, The Man With The Screaming Brain is a very funny love story between two ugly American guys and a murderous gypsy from the hotel. <br /> <br /> William Cole and his wife Jackie arrive in Bulgaria on a business trip and take a taxi driven by the Yegor swindler. Things start to go wrong when Tatoya, the maid, murders Yegor and William, and a mad scientist implants a piece of Yegor's brain on William's head. The robots eventually get involved, just like gypsies with broken fingers, head injuries, Bruce Campbell riding a pink Vespa with small streamers and the All-Of-Me style physical comedy of a character at war with a voice in your brain that controls half. from his body. <br /> <br /> The man with the brain that screams is an incredibly funny movie. It has the most hilarious tracking shot I've seen (when the character of Bruce Campbell, recently arrived from the lab and with a giant forehead scar and blue hospital pajamas, runs into a square and scares a crowd of people) and a fall on the ground. -the step murder scene that had the entire test test audience screaming laughing. All this is a damn riot from start to finish and I would recommend it to any physical comedy fan, Bruce Campbell or B-movies in general.
