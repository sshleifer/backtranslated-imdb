The impressive mega-epic of Raoul Walsh, filmed in an early widescreen process by the great Arthur Edeson, can be slow and static in the early way of speaking, but this classic wagon train trip across America to the Northwest is exciting as a pure physical production when seen on the big screen. On television, the lack of close-ups and remote sound reproduction can be daunting. The young John Wayne is easily scored in his first leading role with a natural delivery that the rest of the cast can not direct. Surprisingly, the film failed and Wayne spent most of the following decade in Western Grade B fodder.
