I think this is one of the best performances of Elizabeth Montgomery in a movie, and I've seen most of her films. I saw this for the first time on television when I was about fourteen years old, and I was so scared. I watch this movie every once in a while, and I still enjoy it a lot. I know that these days it's likely that this movie does not scare people too much. This shows that the public cinema and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years. Years more or less. I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you. The cast in this movie was first class. Jess Walton, who played the sister in the story, was very good, although her part was quite small. He also played in an excellent suspense film for television almost at the same time called Never See Me Again with David Hartman. I got the most out of Eileen Heckart's performance as a housekeeper. Eileen was as good as a lady with a very bad disposition. George Maharis, who played the husband, was quite effective. This story obviously had many errors in the plot, but I love the movie anyway. I recommend this movie to people who love a good thriller without graphic violence. I gave this movie a vote of seven.
