The first time I heard about Haruhi Suzumiya's Melancholy was from a critic on Youtube. Literally, he slapped the show with a big pervert, condemning it as garbage and confusing. Curious, I decided to watch the program (once I got the correct order of the episodes, thanks to those who made the lists), I found it absolutely brilliant and pleasant to watch. Great memorable characters who are full of life and are absolutely kind and hilarious; a unique and not exaggerated plot that makes sense now that I've seen the show; and two of the best anime moments in history, in my opinion. In addition, the opening and ending themes are excellent. <br /> <br /> The anime, based on a collection of successful manga novels, follows a simple plot, once you understand it. While the focus of the show is on the main character, Haruhi Suzumiya, the point of view is of her friend Kyon. Kyon is a regular high school student who does not really believe in supernatural things (for example, Santa Claus, aliens, time travelers, ghosts, espers) but soon ends up talking to Haruhi, who is the strangest girl in school. I prefer to go out with an extraterrestrial, considering all men worthless. He even joined all the clubs in the school to find something interesting, but resigned as fast as he joined. After the "advice" of Kyon, Haruhi decides to form his own club with the club of Kyon. In the literary club room, Haruhi forms the SOS Brigade, her mission is to investigate supernatural cases (think of Scooby-Doo minus the dog, the masked man and the Mystery Machine). <br /> <br /> Haruhi "recruits" Three additional members. The first is Yuki Nagato, a kind of bookworm who talks very little and spends most of his time reading and sitting. The second one is Mikuru Asahina, a shy girl who is forced to go to the club by Haruhi, who thinks she needs a nice pet to do some things. She is often forced to dress by Haruhi to promote her tenderness. The third is Itsuki Koizumi, a friendly and sociable transfer student who is always smiling. While Haruhi thinks that her group is full of normal people, she could not be more wrong. While Kyon is the most normal thing you can get, the other three, on the other hand, are quite unique: Yuki is an extraterrestrial, Mikuru is a time traveler of the future and Itsuki is a esper (a person who has ESP). The three have come to watch over Haruhi, who may have the powers of a god, and if she gets bored, she can discover her powers and create a whole new world, and Kyon is involved in some way. <br /> <br /> The show is worth seeing with great characters, music and some fun and wonderful moments. However, for parents, there are some sexual references that include Mikuru's neckline when exposed or touched several times, and several words of joy are also used. Apart from that, the show is one of the great ones.
