Frank Sinatra did so many excellent things in the entertainment world that it's hard to choose one of the best. However, if he had to name the best he ever did, it would be his performance as Frankie Machine, the heroin-addicted poker player and musician who is saved, just for the love of a good woman (played by an exceptional babelicious Kim Novak). The scenes of "cold turkey" between Sinatra and Novak are terrifying and heartbreaking. The film is almost perfect, in fact, from the graphics of the title of Saul Bass to the innovative jazz score of Elmer Bernstein. It may not be the kind of thing that someone thinks about in relation to the 1950s, but it is a must visit nonetheless.
