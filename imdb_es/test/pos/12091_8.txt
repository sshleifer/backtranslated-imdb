'Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul' is one of the best musical documentaries I've seen lately and it's more than a movie about music. It is also a declaration of musical love about a fabulous city, one of the biggest cities in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities for the history of Europe and for Islam, the city that can build a bridge in the future Europe and the Middle East o It can mean once more, as happened in history, the precipice between two worlds. <br /> <br /> Then there is the music. The interesting approach that the film takes with respect to music is that it starts from modern music, and we listen a lot (good) rock and rap in the first third of the film. And then, like a step back in time, the soundtrack takes us to the roots, to traditional Turkish music, to commercial romances, and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the Turkish music landscape. In a country as complex and conflictive as Turkey, the film does not avoid some of the political aspects, such as the censorship introduced by the military government in the 80s or the relevance of the songs of minorities, especially the Kurdish. One of the best musical moments is provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a hamam shaped like a cathedral (Turkish bath). <br /> <br /> One gets to love the city and its music by the end of The visualization and audience of this film. I've never been to Istanbul, but after watching this movie, I'm sure I want to visit this place soon.
