As a native of the city where the story unfolds, in Buffalo, New York, it's fun to see the local sites, but the story is very local and fun too! <br /> <br /> The small-scale promotion of this film requires a strong word of mouth to achieve the broad vision it deserves. Please make this movie the success that was the great Greek wedding.
