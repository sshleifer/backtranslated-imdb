I'm also afraid that 'inside' will throw it into the annual VHS purge. <br /> <My brother and I (the last 30 'we still laugh at the continuation in this fantastic show. Healys Lucky Cup Hat and telling the apprentice THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING OF THAT (Shooting, passes, etc.) and turns out to be Peter Beardsley As a Leeds fan, I have to laugh at Bostock's empty record before the cup final (or did he say S ** t?) <br /> <br /> The reason why I went into line today was that my brother wants it for Christmas, so ITV, please, bring it on DVD Let's go to The UnderFelt Men !!
