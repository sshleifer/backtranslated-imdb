It does not matter if draw or leelee are total babies, but there are many girls that are very nice and hot but they seem to be so nerdy. This movie is not the kind of Oscar movie, but it has at least a good point of view of what life is like for young people or for "real" people. He made us laugh and learn to accept others for who they really are. This movie represents the real world and that is what really matters.
