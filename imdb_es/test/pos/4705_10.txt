I had the opportunity to speak with the co-creator, Rebecca Cammisa at the 2002 High Falls Film Festival in Rochester, New York. She said that her style should be completely open and uninhibited in the making of films, but she was very happy to be so severely constrained in the narrow places of the group home. The narrow corridors and small rooms were filmed by experts with a realism that would have been lost with a more controlled and deliberate camera work. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen herself is a remarkable character, who comes from the tragedy of her own life to be an unusual combination of care, hardness and street style. The way the film presents its past is excellent, since only a few carefully selected minutes have been scattered. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not begin to properly accumulate the compliments for this movie. It really is a treasure of cinema and the subject a treasure of humanity.
