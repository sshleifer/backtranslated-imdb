The first time I saw this movie on video in a department store ... it intrigued me. Considering the fact that I thought I was in love and that I was the same age as the youngsters in this movie at that time (although I realize that they are now old enough to be my parents), in addition to the written soundtrack by Elton John and Bernie Taupin just before they "got big" here in North America ... I realized that I had nothing to lose by buying it. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> So far, I've shown it to many men I've dated since then, and to my current boyfriend ... obviously, I did not find them as charming as me. .. I prefer to call it a "girl" movie ... but I'm still laughing and crying. This movie was very overlooked. It's good to see that it's available to rent from one of the local video stores around here so that other people can share the magic. <br /> <br /> So maybe it's a bit of an exaggeration ... but it gives you a sense of joyful innocence ... and a renewed faith in love.
