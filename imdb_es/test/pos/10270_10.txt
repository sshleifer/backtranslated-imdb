This is a great comedy, which highlights what it was like to live next to a racist fanatic. But it also shows that the two main characters are really as bad as the other. Based on ITV's hit comedy, this is politically incorrect. And everything is better for it, comedy, after all, is entertaining. The only real drawback of the movies is that there is not much plot. However, the cast is as big as usual. Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker are a great team, they face each other in a very personal way. It's been many years since I saw this movie and last week I was finally able to buy it on DVD. The fact that the film still contains moments of genuine laughter means that I can recommend this movie, as I would in the 70s.
