Forget about all those romantic and sappy movies that involve notebooks and couples with closed lips that somehow manage to go to the great beyond together after a life of unrealistic and too simplified romance screen. Forget about all those "dogs who give their lives to save their relatives" (although I have to admit that I have a weakness for them). Forget that Ricky Schroeder already showed his propensity to exaggerate at a tender age (now that was MISSING!). <br /> <br /> This television movie, which unfortunately never seems to be broadcast anymore, is the all-time champion of tears, hands down. And a well written and acted story to boot. Ann-Margret had a great opportunity to take on this role. There's nothing extravagant or sexy here, and that's a monumental achievement in itself. Based on a true story, she plays Lucile Fray, a terminally ill mother who chooses to work hard to find the best breath to find a good home for her ten children, instead of leaving them to unpredictable government agencies. Frederic Forrest does a great job as her husband, the supporter of the good-hearted but unreliable family whose disabling arthritis and personal demons make him unable to care for children. <br /> <br /> The film takes us through Lucile's heartbreaking process of interviewing prospective parents and then seeing their children leave the house. It also gives us the perspective of the children themselves and of the father, afflicted by the tragedy that is happening now and the one that will surely follow, and frustrated by his inability to do more. The scene in which the youngest of the children (Steven) is taken to his new home is the most heartbreaking I have seen. Now, I grew up as a "hopeless romantic", and I have spent many years since then making myself a harder and more cynical shell. In general, I find more to mock than to empathize with the triple sentimental kinematics imposed on us these days. But this gem of the early 1980s still kills me. <br /> <br /> I really want someone with a little marketing sense to release a DVD version of this drama. Among the special features you need to include the television broadcast of the Emmy Awards the following year. A-M was nominated for this role, but the prize for best dramatic actress went to Barbara Stanwyck for "Thorn Birds". In what has to be one of the best moments of what is now a really monotonous prize show, Stanwyck burst into tears during his acceptance speech and let out a cry: "Ann-Margret, I love you!", Which made that Ann-M cried. . <br /> <br /> A final note. The IMDb rating for "Who will love my children" is 6.4 as of this writing. However, more than 75% of the grades are in the range of 8 to 10 (mostly 10). Whatever type of disadvantage system this site uses to modify the general ratings of the films listed by IMDb, it completely loses its mark on it. This is the "crybaby" of all time, and an excellent television movie to boot.
