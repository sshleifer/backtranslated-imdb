Cecil B. DeMille directed a series of domestic comedies and dramas in late adolescence and early twenties. He found his perfect protagonist for these provocative pieces in Gloria Swanson. In Do not Change Your Husband, Swanson plays a bored housewife whose husband, rich and entrepreneur (Elliott Dexter), pays more attention to work than to her. She is chased by a beautiful rouge (Lew Cody) until she gives in and divorces the bored husband for the new lover. <br /> <br /> Things soon become familiar and Swanson discovers that the new husband is as negligent as the first. To make matters worse, she discovers that Cody has a woman next door (Julia Faye). After several confrontations and convenient meetings, things were resolved. <br /> <br /> This was a great success in 1919 and helped Gloria Swanson to be a great star. Even though she was only 20 years old when she filmed this, she is very good as maybe the dumb wife. It looks great and wears awesome dresses. <br /> <br /> There is a memorable scene that is 100% DeMille in which Cody is attracting Swanson with promises of wealth, pleasure and love. While he lulls her, she imagines the scenes. Pleasure is a fantastic Swanson scene in a hammock that swings over a pool while people dance. Wealth is a scene in which Swanson is dressed like a Babylonian queen while the servants bring their jewelry chests, which she pulls aside. Love is a scene in which she is a wood nymph who makes love in a forest clearing with a character similar to Pan (Ted Shawn). Hokum pure but very entertaining, and Swanson looks great. <br /> <br /> Dexter is very good like the insipid husband who shaves his mustache and starts training to get his wife back. Cody is also good as the fake charmer who is a liar and cheat. Faye is funny like the other malicious woman, called Toodles no less, who gets his. Sylvia Ashton plays Mrs. Huckney. Ted Shawn married Ruth St. Denis and together they were modern and influential dancers (from the Denishawn School). <br /> <br /> Swanson impresses me more every time I see her. She seems to have been such a natural actress and yet, there is a way in which the camera captures her expressive face that is simply fascinating. It is a joy to see her. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining movie with many color tones in different scenes to keep things animated. And many of the furniture is back in style 86 years later.
