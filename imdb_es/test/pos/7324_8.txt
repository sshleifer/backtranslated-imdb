This belongs to its superior level, although there were others, such as Micro-Phonies and Punch Drunks, that deserved more Oscar nominations than this one. But if nothing else, the recurring announcement of a speaker, "Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard," followed by "Woo woo woo woo" by Curly, makes this a classic on two levels. In the first place, it symbolizes everything that the Stooges represent; My daughter loves to repeat the ad when she is doing something silly. Second, the absurdity of these three as doctors in a hospital; I imagine the terror I would feel if I were a real patient in a real hospital and heard this announcement over the loudspeaker. Throughout this short, you hear that announcement and you know that something horrible is about to happen, and the speaker's voice remains with you for months afterwards.
