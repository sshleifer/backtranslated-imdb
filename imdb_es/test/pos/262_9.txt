It's just one of those movies, or you love it or hate it, my girlfriend and I loved it, we told my brother to rent it and he hated it, he said it was too flashy and colloquial, then, again, it's just go see great action movies, so there probably will not be enough explosions to disappoint him. There were some great new talents (I had never heard of potential clients). Des Brady (the brother of the directors?) It was especially good. Playing a right cock at the beginning, I thought he would never redeem himself, but he managed to get out of the dark hole he had created and, for the end, he was really on his way. A very surprising movie with a lot of heart, if you can live without a count of bodies and explosions, then this is very original. Yashimo Brixton in the United Kingdom.
