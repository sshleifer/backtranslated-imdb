To consider the film as nothing more than a documentary about skateboarding would not recognize several important aspects of Dogtown. Peralta himself (a well-known character in skateboarding) has created a film that not only deals with the birth of what we know today as skateboarding, but also examines the socio-cultural and economic circumstances in which this sport emerged and gained great appeal. In addition, his film is quite personal: Peralta's first-hand association with this cultural phenomenon serves as an informed film researcher and as a participant-subject involved. In this role, he is an "observer-participant" par excellence, while bringing together a wide range of personalities who were an integral part of this movement and those who were deeply affected by the advent of skating as a competitive sport and subculture. The film employs a unique stylistic form of film and sound editing, and the narrative (by Sean Penn) and the interviews take a fairly genuine and untested form that is similar to the anarchic and nihilistic spirit of surfing on the sidewalk. The film shows the kinetic appeal of a prolonged music video, tempered with the sensitivity of an archaeologist to the importance of time, place and circumstances.
