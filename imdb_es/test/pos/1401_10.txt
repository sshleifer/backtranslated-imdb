Of course, most people will designate "Fishermen's Island" as silly and of poor quality, but can you honestly name another film that presents THIS many exciting themes? This Italian gem represents pure entertainment and presents elements such as voodoo, volcanic eruptions, creatures of mutant fish, the mysterious continent of Atlantis, the search for treasure, a remote island full of deadly traps and completely mad scientists! All this and much more in a simple movie? Yes please! Closed-minded opponents of Italian horror films can easily label this film as a cheap exploitation version of "The Island of Dr. Moreau," but the truth is that this is much more! "Island of the Fishmen" offers emotions and adventures from beginning to end with surprisingly convincing special effects and surprisingly elegant camera work. The story begins in a promising way with a small group of prisoners, survivors of a shipwreck, arriving on a tropical island. They meet the sadistic Edmond Rackham who governs a native tribe and a legion of genetically engineered amphibian monsters that live in the island's marshes. There are so many additional twists and subplots in the story that it is almost impossible to write a summary but, believe me, it is worth taking a look at this gem. Sergio Martino proves once again that he is an ingenious filmmaker who has the talent to be creative and creative at the same time. He makes great use of the beautiful location of the island and also the interior sets look very impressive. The amazing underwater images and imaginative landscapes really raise this film above the normal standards of exploitation in the late 70's. I do not understand why Roger Corman modified the original so much and launched it in the US market with a different title ( "Screamers"), because there are very few elements to improve. The members of the cast are all regulars of Sergio Martino (with the exception of the great Joseph Cotton is a support rule) and give great performances. In case you can get the German version recently restored, you will receive fifteen minutes without additional action cuts. Look at it!
