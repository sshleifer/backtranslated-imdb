It's great to see a new batch of puppets creating havoc in this series. I found this chapter very funny. In fact, it would probably be my second favorite in the series. This movie has very little violence and is only rated PG-13. This is noticeably different from the other R-rated puppet movies that were charged with bloody and violent chaos. However, the lack of violence does not diminish the fun. This film also has special effects noticeably better than the last film in this series. Good.
