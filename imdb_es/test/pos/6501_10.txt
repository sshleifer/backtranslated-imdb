I just watched this movie on resfest and it was torn down. I've never been a big fan of scratching myself, but this movie hooked me from the getgo. It is cataloged as a documentary, but it never felt as such. (I do not remember the last time I had so much fun watching a documentary). He has a style and an energy that is refreshing, insightful and never too predicative. The production values ​​were there, too. (shot in a movie with great cuts and an incredible soundtrack). In general, an intelligent piece, entertaining and enlightening.
