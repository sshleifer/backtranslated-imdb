Alfred Hitchcock's surest narrative of a film he made twenty-one years ago is infinitely superior to the original. Hitchcock told himself that his first version was the work of an amateur, and although it is certainly not a bad movie, he seems to be right. That said, this remake, although definitely better, is still not among the best works of Hitchcock. That does not mean it's not good, it's more than a little too lenient, and that drags it down. Hitchcock seems very interested in dragging certain elements, and these are parts of the film that are not entirely relevant to the plot, which can become annoying. Some of these trailing sequences, such as the one that sees James Stewart and Doris Day eating in a Moroccan restaurant, are good because they help to establish the different culture in which our American protagonists are, but for each restaurant scene, there is an opera . the sequence and the latter is what makes the movie worse. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a middle-aged doctor and his wife who travel to Morocco to spend a vacation with their young son. While they are there, they meet a French man on the bus and another middle-aged couple in a restaurant. However, things go wrong when the French man dies because of a knife in the back, shortly after whispering something to the doctor. The holiday becomes a nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, which causes them to shorten and go to London to try to find it. The film has a high degree of paranoia about it, and manages to maintain this at all times. In fact, I would even dare to say that this is the most paranoid film that Hitchcock has ever made. Like most of Hitchcock's films, it is very exciting and keeps him on the edge of his seat for almost the entire duration, with only the opera sequence mentioned above standing out as a moment in which the tension is diffused. There is also something more than a little humor in the film, which provides a joyful relief to morbid events, and actually works quite well. <br /> <br /> The original version of this story received excellent support from the fantastic Peter. Lorre. This film does not benefit from their presence, unfortunately, but that is compensated by the performances of the incredible James Stewart and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man who will always be a candidate for the crown of the "best actor of all time." His collaborations with Hitchcock have all the fascinating performances of him, and this one is no different. (Although his best performance is still that of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). Stewart transmits all the courage, conviction and anguish of a man who has lost his son and would do anything to recover it brilliantly. In fact, that's one of the best things about this movie; You can really feel for the loss of the couple at all times and that serves to make it even more exciting. Doris Day, on the other hand, is a rather strange casting choice for this movie. She is definitely a good actress, but she is more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is quite strange (even if she manages to flex her vocal cords a bit). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned; This is not the best Hitchcock movie, but there is a lot to enjoy and although I would recommend many Hitchcock films before recommending this, I will definitely give you two thumbs up as well.
