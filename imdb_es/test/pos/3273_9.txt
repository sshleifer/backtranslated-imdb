spoiler-- <br /> <br /> In 1993, African-American director / actor Mario Van Peebles followed the tremendously popular urban action movie New Jack City with "Posse." The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also plays the main character, Jessie Lee. <br /> <br /> Argument: the film begins in the late twentieth century, when the United States was involved. In the Spanish-American War. Apparently, at a time when the United States justice system could send convicts to military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an enforced enlisted man, serving with a completely black cavalry troop in Cuba. Some of his compatriots are Little J (Stephen Baldwin), Weezie (Charles Lane) and the imposing but simple Obobo (Tiny Lister). They find a hidden gold chest in a reconnaissance race and decide to keep it. However, the ambitious and intolerant Colonel Graham (Zane) finds out about the gold and apparently is willing to kill Jessie Lee and company for it. A shooting between the forces of Graham and Jessie Lee leaves the blind colonel in one eye, and his forces retreat. The team of Jessie Lee manages to smuggle (and gold) to New Orleans, but it turns out that Graham is not far behind. Jessie Lee and her allies are forced to flee, heading west towards a city called Freemanville. Apparently, Freemanville was founded by blacks in the years after the Civil War. Jessie Lee's father, "King David," was the charismatic preacher who co-founded the city. However, as revealed in intermittent flashbacks, King David was soon brutally murdered by a white mafia, in parallel to the Ku Klux Klan's terror campaigns that began almost at the same time. Jessie Lee and the company eventually find their way to Freemanville, only to find that the townspeople are not exactly happy to see him, especially when Sheriff Bates (Richard Jordan) from a nearby white town makes it clear that he loves Jessie Lee and his Companions dead or alive. Carver (Blair Underwood) is the deputy sheriff and mayor of Freemanville, and his own agenda may not coincide with the presence of Jessie Lee. <br /> <br /> Analysis All the action sequences are very credible, and Mario Van Peebles becomes a good performer as the melancholic hero. After the success of New Jack City, Van Peebles was almost expected to direct a sequel, or at least a similar follow-up to urban action. Instead, Van Peebles looked at 100 years in the past, creating a largely black Western (effectively 'updating' the black-themed Westerns of the 1970s) and continuing the legacy of black-themed cowboy movies largely forgotten about principles. of the twentieth century. Unlike New Jack City, the film was independently funded and originally released through Gramercy / Polygram Entertainment. Apparently, the executives of the main studios resisted when Van Peebles sent them 'Posse'. Some of the most "curious" releases at the time involved rappers Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc as Father Time and Angel, respectively. In certain interviews, Mario Van Peebles has said that he often likes to throw against the guy; In later years, the tendency to choose rap singers in non-musical films would become almost common. Enthusiastic viewers will notice several appearances by various entertainment personalities: veterans of the black action film Isaac Hayes ("Truck Turner"), Pam Grier ("Foxy Brown") and Larry Cook ("The ghost that sat next to the ") appear, like the legendary legend Nipsey Russell, not to mention the television producer Stephen J. Cannell (who hired the young Van Peebles to star in years ago in" Sonny Spoon "). The film is composed by Woody Strode ("Spartacus") in a key role.
