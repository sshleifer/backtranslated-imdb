Oh my God. Obviously, when you rent or buy this, you do not expect to see a documentary about the mating habits of small rodents in their natural habitats. You expect a visual feast of blood and blood, and maybe even a fright or two. Well, for those who are as sick and twisted as I am, they will not find many chills, but they will be very close to urinating with laughter. The key phrases of this film will remain with you and your friends forever. The first time I showed this to my friends and colleagues was more than 3 years ago, but we still laugh and use the key phrases. It is as addictive and fun as The Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn by Sam Raimi and Dead Alive / Braindead by Peter Jackson. From the absolutely ridiculous dialogue of the opening scene, to the best works of the Department of Splatter and Gore, to the wonderful skills of Ed, the movie cutter, you will laugh and laugh again. As for the visual feast of blood and blood, oh yes, they do. And they are very good at that ... "The bone of the neck is connected to the bone of the head ..." This movie may also have made the best nightmare / hallucination / nut scene I have ever seen. and that is not to be fun, but man is well done (and it's creepy). In general, for anyone who is not against a lot of blood and a good time, IF YOU SEE THIS MOVIE, GET YOURSELF !!!! It's on Netflix, I know for sure.
