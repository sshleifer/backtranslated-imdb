Much said without words. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie. It was done in color, not in color like in today's movies, but in a special use of a single color (with shading) that portrays meaning, mood, meaning and time. It must be seen in color, since it becomes a completely different movie. The story, presented by Selma Lagerl√∂f, winner of the Nobel Prize, is presented in an effective way. One never has a clear sense of the real, the memory or the ghost. The changes that are occurring in Swedish society at that time are subtly layered. The most recommended. Try to rent it or find it online. I saw it in a Swedish film class and I want to add it to my movie library.
