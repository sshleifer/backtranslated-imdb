Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I have to disagree on a couple of things. First of all, this movie does not look anything like THE CARS THAT ATE Paris. Not in my humble opinion Nothing like this. <br /> <br /> I think the film had elements of surrealism, but I think the filmmaker's basic approach is not "surrealistic" per se. therefore, it is not like CARS Paris, it seems more like a strange European work, with some scenes with the stamp of "wierd" not surrealist. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think that Heuzenroeder's music is brilliant. They used whistles, the old sound of Country and Western records, and it's better than most of the Australian movies that usually combine the filmmaker with an indy soundtrack that the company wants to promote. <br /> <br /> As for the name of the movie, I do not know why it's called Modern Love, I expected David Bowie to appear dressed in a lipstick and a lipstick ... I started showing my age.
