Stunts sequences (as well as special effects) are brilliant, in this movie. Michael Scherer must be one of the best cheat coordinators in Canada of all time. The explosion in the Caf√© is a wonderful combination of acrobatics, special effects and visual effects. The Director had an idea, which the Team managed to create in the film. <br /> <br /> Besides that; Donald Sutherland does one of his best performances in this movie .......
