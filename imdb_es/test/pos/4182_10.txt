When I saw this movie for the first time, I also expected that "our guys" would be cute, and more like an extended version of the television show. I did not "get it" back then. But, years later, at a party, YEARS later, in a PAR-TAY from the 70s, where they smoked, they inhaled certain substances and with a lot of tequila, "HEAD" was on until late at night. We saw it and finally realized what it was "HEAD". He simulated his own program, as shown in a song that called itself "a fabricated image". As Davy Jones wrote in his autobio, "They made a monkey out of me," he openly admits that everyone in the movie had been up all night smoking marijuana. They made fun of themselves, of society, of everything! Great movie! However, as a 52-year-old grandmother, I no longer "get in", I STILL watch this movie when I want a good LOL !!!
