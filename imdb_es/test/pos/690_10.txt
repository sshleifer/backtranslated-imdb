I watched this, hoping to see the usual stereotypes of the rigid British lips and I was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humor. It was more like Eastenders going to the sea than what we serve. The scenes during the approach and the attack are remarkably realistic in their portrayal of a combat ship and things in the ship's company (at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some of the disposable lines are very clever ("I'm not going to join the Band of Hope just to please a greasy fish fryer!). My only complaint is that they did not show what happened to the Irish helmsman and his girlfriend, or the tattoo tattoo and her tattoo "I Love Arabella"!
