Walter Matthau can always improve a mediocre movie, and this movie proves it. He has a very realistic performance as a coach of small horses and a single father, he has no role in the sugar coating. <br /> <br /> It can be, by turns, of soft and affectionate heart, and then of iron hand. to his boys, and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training (we see he does not want his young racehorse to work too much and get hurt in small races, but he seems willing to risk the horse ). life when he enters the great moment). <br /> <br /> This is just one of the wonderful performances of Matthau, and one that I highly recommend.
