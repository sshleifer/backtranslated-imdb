Cult director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his bloody zombie movies of the 1980s that earned him his legitimate reputation as the "Godfather of Gore." Fulci's best absolute film, however, dates back to 1972 and, although it is definitely stark and violent, it is not as bloody as many of his other films. "Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino" aka. "Do not Torture A Duckling" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's best film, but this Giallo, absolutely brilliant and seductive, is one of the most outstanding aspects of the genre. The impressive atmosphere and tormenting suspense, the great Sizilian stage, the intriguing story, the brilliant performances or the intense moments of pure commotion, I do not know what to praise more about this ingenious Giallo! "Do not Torture A Duckling" offers cinematic perfection in all aspects, which makes it an absolute masterpiece of Italian horror cinema. <br /> <br /> Unlike other Gialli, it is not the queens of seductive beauty that die. for one, but small children who fall victim to a loose assassin. The bodies of young children are found in rural Sicily. While the police are desperately looking for the killer, the small town is basically full of strange people, and the people of the city scream for a guilty ... <br /> <br /> The film is surprisingly suspenseful and intransigent from the start , with a sandy, dark and constantly tense atmosphere that still has to find an equal. The acting performances are among the best in Italian horror cinema. Tomas Milian (one of my personal favorite actors of all time) is excellent at the head, like the journalist Andrea Martinelli who is investigating the crimes. The sexy Barbara Bouchet offers both goodies and a brilliant performance. Equally outstanding performances come from Irene Papas and Florinda Bolkan, who is absolutely brilliant in her role. The great score of Riz Ortolani brilliantly intensifies the suspense and atmosphere, and the film is ingeniously shot in fascinating Sicilian landscapes. Although it is not as bloody as many other Fulci movies, this film is definitely harsh and intransigent in its violence, with some surprisingly brutal scenes. <br /> <br /> "Do not Torture A Duckling" has everything that the brilliant Horror requires. This is not as easy to achieve as most of Fulci's other films, but I make sure that the search will be worth it. Any Horror fan MUST see this personal favorite of mine, and I recommend to any true movie lover in general not to miss this. A masterpiece!
