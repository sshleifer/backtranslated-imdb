If Archie Bunker was armed, it could very well have been "Joe." However, "Everyone in the family" would have had a short term because the censors would never have allowed him to run in the line of THIS movie. Joe is a working-class guy who is racist and intolerant, and has a big mouth, especially when he's drunk. One night, he meets a man in a bar, Bill, who is taking a drink to calm his nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's drug-addicted boyfriend and letting Joe escape. What happens is that Bill's daughter was living with the drug addict, and she was taken to the hospital after an overdose, and he goes to the apartment to pick up his things but does not expect to really meet the boyfriend, who comes in fresh of a big drug business. In the fight that follows, the boyfriend is killed accidentally and Bill does not want anyone to really know, of course. But let it pass to Joe, and when the newspapers and television reports come out, Joe sees them, puts 2 and 2 together, and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes. He hooks up with him later and Bill, of course, worries that Joe is going to blackmail him, but not for money, he wants to date him. Which is, in a way, almost worse. Now, Bill's daughter escapes from the clinic where she is and returns home, and accidentally overhears what happened and then flees, and most of the rest of the movie is that Joe and Bill infiltrate "the underground" to try to find his. This accumulates until a quite shocking end, which for me was totally unexpected and ends with the right note or the wrong note, according to the point of view. A kind of decent but tenuous vision of life in the early 70s, mainly from the point of view of a working-class fanatic, which is not for everyone, but it's not a bad movie and it's a decent watch. 8 out of 10.
