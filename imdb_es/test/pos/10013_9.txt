I watched this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival in 2002. This seems to be one of the less popular films of the festival, however, as it turned out, even more interesting. <br /> <br /> The story, of An actor who tries to confront himself and his environment after retiring from a drug addiction, is based on real events. In addition, the characters involved in the film are the real people who live this experience again, this time for the film, which is partly configured as a play. Not only are all good actors, Jia Hongsheng's parents are also actors in real life, the methods used to highlight their relationship with Jia are very effective. <br /> <br /> Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some The Chinese action films of the late eighties begin in the nineties. Later it can be seen in big movies like Frozen and Suzhou River. Between these two professional careers, Jia becomes addicted to drugs and loses all the impulse to act or even do something productive, except for making somewhat useless attempts to become a guitar virtuoso. <br /> <br /> I like the way the scenario writer chooses to emphasize his behavior after the withdrawal rather than the horror of drugs. We really feel the pain and the struggle that Jia is in. At the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him. <br /> <br /> The film draws the viewer in an exhausting pattern in which Jia seems to be trapped, dragging with him his parents and sister trying to take care of him. Because there are personal 'interviews' with the characters, we feel that we are getting to know Jia not only through him but also from others. <br /> <br /> The movie has a heavy feeling, but Jia's scenes go by bicycle. Bejing and the party with his friends lighten the tone. The same goes for the bitter humor in many events throughout the film. The music is beautiful and he stayed with me a while later. This is a film that does not easily attract many people, but for those interested in the most serious and modern Chinese film, this is a strong recommendation.
