I saw this movie and I loved it totally, the characters are great. It's definitely my kind of movie that you do not get bored in this movie. I love independent films, they are much more rewarding. My husband and I really enjoyed Jay's style. If you are an open-minded person who loves movies that provoke thoughts and love conversation after you finish, you will love this movie. It is definitely provocative. The movie will definitely tread on some toes, but who cares these people probably will not go see this movie. It's amazing to see the characters evolve. Jay Floyd has really captured both sides of the table. Applause, applause, Jay, I hope you're working on another movie.
