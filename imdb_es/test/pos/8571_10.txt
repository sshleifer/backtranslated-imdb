Touch of topless football !! A contest of wet shirts !! A raid of jockstrap! This "animal house" has it all. Except a plot and good actors. The film consists of several cat jokes and fights between H.O.T.S. Girls and bitch house PI. The dialogue is a shout and the soundtrack is sublimely brilliant. In recent months it has been appearing all over the wire, so do yourself a favor and be careful. H.O.T.S. It's so bad that it's good!
