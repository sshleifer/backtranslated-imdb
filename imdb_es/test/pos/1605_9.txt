From the first to the last scene of the film, the director Visconti stands out in his art, insofar as it is guaranteed that the film will remain as a cultural treasure just for God knows for how long. It's perfection, like a movie, that is, but the story has some minor shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Thomas Mann's novel is also a perfect work of art, so, of course, it is impossible to include it in other media. Visconti follows the story a lot, and only when it is allowed to deviate a bit, the transition fails. And no matter how wonderful the scenery is, the tension in the air between the characters, the hundreds of subtle cues and allegories, the almost unbearably enhanced service of Mahler's music, even so, the tiny anomalies in the plot make me uneasy. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just a victim of man's desire to fail the impeccable. However, I will offer an example, which I consider crucial. <br /> <br /> WARNING: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In Mann's story, Aschenbach eats strawberries that probably contain the disease that will kill him. , after leaving his frustrated persecution of the child Tadzio in Venice. Unable to catch a delight, he conforms to another, which poisons him. It is very subtle in the book, but it is there. The forbidden fruit, more or less, but rather a sign that it surrenders itself. <br /> <br /> In the Visconti movie, he also eats strawberries, but in a rather insignificant scene on the beach. The persecution in Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. It works, too, but it lacks some subtlety, and also the symbolism of several layers, which makes us reflect. <br /> <br /> But all that is forgiven, when the film allows us to delight ourselves with beautiful, expensive landscapes. and constellations, and certainly as many other symbols as we can digest: the last gesture of Tadzio, standing in the water, is the end equally sublime and mysterious.
