If you're looking for a modern movie version of Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weismuller that overcomes the machinations of the unscrupulous white safari guides or the cunning men of the black tribes, while you save the animal kingdom, this is NOT the movie for you. This is a recount of the "legend" of Tarzan from its inception in intelligent terms and for adults. It is beautifully filmed and is true to the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Tarzan is not an action hero, but a man divided between two worlds: the natural and the civilized. In an impressive performance, Christopher Lambert portrays this anguish with absolute realism. If it slips once, the cat will come out of the bag: the audience (especially the adult audience to which the film is directed) will laugh, and the movie will lose control. It will fall in the depths of cheese. But Lambert never lets that happen. (Forget what I can think of him in other movies, when I saw this movie in the theater at its original release, I thought it deserved a prize from the academy.) <br /> <br /> The cast cast is uniformly excellent, as other commentators have noticed. I do not agree with most of them that I did not find anything wrong with Andie McDowell's performance. I would not have nominated her for an academy prize (the paper is undemanding), but she is fully prepared, just as she is. I also do not know why his voice was superimposed. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of the African segment of the story is absolutely beautiful. It captures both the beauty of the African desert and the exotic expectation it possesses in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. The landscape is exuberant and exotic, and the colors are vivid. <br /> <br /> But this is also a "period" film, and cinematography also magnificently represents Victorian England: the countryside, the city and the interiors. The costumes are exceptional. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or annoying. <br /> <br /> There are some disturbing scenes, especially for animal lovers, but no more disturbing than some scenes in Dance with Wolves. This is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature, personified in the young Lord Greystoke, convincingly portrayed by Christopher Lambert.
