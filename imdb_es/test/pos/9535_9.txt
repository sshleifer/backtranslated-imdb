This brings so many memories of childhood. (I'm not old, I'm 19) It's great. The trains, the old house, the fallen corridor, the really terrifying collapse (well, it's when you're 6 years old), the drama of whether children can stop the train, or will it crash? This is a movie for children without a doubt, but it offers a great harmless function, without blood / guts / weapons, etc. for children. And he has Bernard Cribbins, who is great. 8/10
