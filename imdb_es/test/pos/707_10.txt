I read on the web that this movie is becoming a theatrical feature. Finally!!!!! It is time for Hollywood to act together. The big studios always frown at the nervous material, with Oscar written everywhere. Go figure! <br /> <br /> JERICHO MILE was made ahead of time. It is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Michael Mann, a true visionary, found a way to attract an audience without excess. The performance of the Peter Strauss Emmy Award is probably the best character role I've seen in my movie life. Any actor who plays this role will never be the same (unless there is already an Academy Award in his mantle). <br /> <br /> The multi-ethnic and harsh set, a backdrop for THE JERICHO MILE, makes one understand the sensitivity of the social. Dynamics of our world. It is about redemption without public validation, and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers. Imagine an imprisoned convict since he was a life-long teenager with no possibility of parole, who does not know that he is possibly the fastest runner in the world. ... What would you do? <br /> <br /> This movie makes you walk away feeling that you have not been cheated on any level. Totally exciting, attractive, emotional and a soundtrack of "Rolling Stones" that kicks in the ass! <br /> <br /> I always thought that this would be done for the big screen ... I can not wait ...! !! In the meantime, I'll have to keep checking my worn-out VHS copy that I've had for many years.
