I must admit that I could not see this movie in the theater. As it premiered at the beginning of a summer hit season, this cute little movie could not help but get lost in the shadow of multi-million dollar special effects movies, right? <br /> <br /> "Return to Me" has a charming and simple story in its essence, and is very well directed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been in several important films as an actress herself ... along with This!) The charming story is beautifully interwoven with an intelligent comedy brought to life with excellent performances from both veterans and younger actors. <br /> <br /> For those who say that David Duchovny has not really had a good chance to escape. his mold "Fox Mulder", I agree. I have seen his other film work, and it is, by far, the best he could have done for himself. Minnie Driver is simply beautiful, charming, funny and animated in her role as Grace. <br /> <br /> Outside these two contacts, however, you are surrounded by Grace's close family and friends. Jim Belushi is an absolute point, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real life force. However, I can not fail to mention the talents of Robert Loggia and the late Carroll O'Connor. Ironically, I went back to see this movie on DVD only the day before he passed away. This was his last film, and he gave an interpretation that an actor of his caliber could certainly be proud to end a great career. <br /> <br /> In general, "Return To Me" became what it would have been. It has still been just a fun love story, and it became a movie that has become one of my favorites! Take the time to rent this ... it's worth the effort!
