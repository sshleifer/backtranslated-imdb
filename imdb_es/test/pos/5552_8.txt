The Pickle was the most underestimated movie of the decade. Despite my best efforts at home, it still looks like a bad movie. I say to hell with everyone about this. Everyone does not understand that it is partly a comedy with a dramatic turn at the end. Danny Aiello plays a director burned with perfection and transmits a depressed and sad man. The scene where you are trying to record a last message is quite good. The interludes of the Stones movie are absolutely funny. "This is Harry Stone and today I become a man!" In short, a thin film and sadly misunderstood. More a great cameo from Little Richard. Fun! I hope more people see this movie because 202 people are not enough for a consensus. <br /> <br /> -Silence Dogood
