I thought that this movie was perfect for little girls. It was a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do whatever they wanted to do as much as they wanted. Most girls would like this story, even though death is thought of in it. Although nobody dies, the king almost does it, but little girls would not understand it, so it becomes a perfect story. All the events add up, creating a great plot that can have a meaning if you dig deep enough. This story is perfect for little girls, and since it's a Barbie movie, kids can have more fun with it, especially if they have their own Barbies. However, anyone can have fun with that, because it is very nice and understandable. In general, I think this movie is a good movie for everyone, especially for little girls, and it will give everyone a smile at least once during it.
