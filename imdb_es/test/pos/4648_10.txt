I hope so, and how can I participate? <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic and full of laughs, adventures and a cast of stars, from the 80's. <br /> <br /> What happens when to bring together a group of athletes and a women's fraternity, a group of debate nerds, a gang of misfits and a couple of cousins? <br /> <br /> A lot of laughs that will make you beg for more! <br /> <br /> David Naughton plays Adam, the leader of the "yellow team", a kind and modern university counselor who helps students with everything from getting the classes they want to the first dates. <br /> <br /> His nemesis is Harold, the leader of the "blue team", hilariously played by Stephen Furst of the fame of "Babylon 5", the non-fanatic son of a wealthy ex-college student with enough trophies to make that any Hall of Famer is jealous. <br /> <Br /> Put these two together and launch a "red team", a "white team" and a "green team", an "incredible view" in an observatory, the consequences of cheating in the miniature golf, a super tour on the Pabst B Lue Ribbon, a brewery and an odious old landlady, among other adventures, and you'll have all the details of a night to remember! <br /> <br /> Look for the appearances of Michael J. Fox, Eddie Deezen and director Andy Tennant in one of the last movies in which he acted before becoming a director and you have a cast of stars and hilarious. <br /> <br /> The only negative aspect of this movie was the performance of Debra Clinger as Laura. She exceeded herself terribly, but the rest of the movie is so good that it can simply be ignored. <br /> <br /> I own this movie and I can never see it enough! <br /> <br />
