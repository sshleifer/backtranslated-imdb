There is no other word for that ... Fox left it, without any marketing. No one in the country, apart from those who have been waiting for this movie, knows nothing about it. All the red flags have flown. It has to be a disaster, it can not be as good as Office Space, right? Incorrect. Although Office Space is not, this film definitely has satirical wit and wit. It is a mistake on certain levels, but who is at fault is a mystery. <br /> <br /> According to what is currently shown in theaters, I can say that IDIOCRACY is a good movie. It's funny, sometimes laughing out loud funny. It is effective, sometimes ingenious. What is not what I can say, is finished. We will see something of this movie again, either a prolonged cut or a re-engagement. It can only be hilarious. Sometimes it is absurd. <br /> <br /> Leaving the theater, looking around the mall, I was surrounded by advertisements and billboards, commercialism and stupidity. It is not a so damning dystopia as that of 1984, but this film paints an unpleasant future for our culture. And there seems to be not much anyone can do about it. Anyway, go see this if you can and try to find out what happened that was buried so specifically.
