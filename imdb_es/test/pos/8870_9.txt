I do not clearly understand this average rating of the movies! <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it, I even stayed up until dawn to finish watching it on the nightly television. <br /> <br /> There are three excellent characters here, excellent characters. Danny DeVito played a gem, quite a feat considering that he was also directing. His down-trodden character was sometimes written brilliantly and was surreal in an absolutely credible way. There are people like that, Owen was on the line without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal's comedic style and timing sensation was PERFECT for his role. His frustration / comedy was interesting and captivating, and what's more ... you can understand his feelings. To really feel that you know that a character is difficult to achieve from the point of view of writers, finding the right actor to achieve it is an art in itself and both were achieved here three times. <br /> <br /> Third, who else could have played Mom? There is no one who can interpret this part so well. There is a style that is unlike any other, something you love to see, I found myself waiting for it to appear on the screen ... and not because the rest was bad, oh no, but because the character of mom was, again, So line without crossing it that was excellent to see. <br /> <br /> And what is more? A happy ending with new friendships found, no one getting hurt and everyone getting what they wanted in life ... WITHOUT a big piece of cheese tied at the end. <br /> <br /> Brilliant script, brilliant idea, perfect cast, great movie.
