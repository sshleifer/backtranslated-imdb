The first time I saw The Couch Trip (1988) on nightly television was years ago and I instantly fell in love with it. The funny thing is that I usually get all the comedies done, but I've never heard of this until I saw it. Dan Ackroyd is a simple and simple period. He has made a couple of great movies with Belushi and do not forget Saturday Night Live. But I think the sofa trip is probably your best and most fun. With a good cast of support from Charles Grodin, David Clennon and Walter Matthau, this piece of film shines with comic gold. Ackroyd's wife, Donna Dixxon, even does a good job here. My favorite moments of the film are the character of Ackroyd and David Clennon, Lawrence Baird. Those two played well with each other. So, if you have not seen a good comedy on awile, go back to 1988 and rent or buy The Couch Trip. I just did it, Amazon 78 cents. What a bargain, how badly they hit me with a shipping fee of 2.50. Oh well, it's still worth it. Any guy will love this movie, take a look.
