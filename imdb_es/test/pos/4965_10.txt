This is a video version of a production on stage, with additional footage for video editing. The result wins both the drama of the stage with the impact of a well produced film. The set of George Tsypin, with sculptures and masks of Julie Taymor, is excellent. <br /> <br /> Jessye Norman is great, and one listens (and sees) the young Bryn Terfel. This production is shocking, emotional and majestic. If you do not see it, you've lost it.
