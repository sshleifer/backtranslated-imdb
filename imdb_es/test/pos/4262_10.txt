Without doubt one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, intelligent, intoxicating ... it is difficult to articulate something so good. There is not a character that you do not like to see instantly: Myronex "Putney, there are problems in the black room!" "My name is Rufus." The lines, thrown to the left and to the right, are classic in themselves, remembering Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialogue is not of the formulable variety of punchline. "Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!" "My organization is pro-integration ..." "Where is Lopez? 'It's in my head.'" They do not sound bright until you hear them in the context of the scene. ... This movie will eat your brain, it's too good. I have read reviews that call this racist film, which could not be further from the truth. All the scenes are of gold, from the Cereal Etherial commercial to the meeting of the Brothers in the Black Room to the disturbing trumpet of the final scene. A word - genius.
