Okay, maybe this is not the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see. Actually, there is not a little "sophistication" * in him. He is childish, adolescent, inoffensive, idiotic ... And absolutely hilarious. Basically, Richie and Eddie run the worst hotel in Britain. Involve some ridiculous pranks with the guests while they stick to each other, try to get the rent money from the only resident who is foolish enough to stay, have a drunken all night with the guys at the power station next door .. And fall into lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press. Try it if you're a fan of Rik and Ade and their work. If you're not ... Do not put on the movie. As simple as that. <br /> <br /> * I'm not being thick, this is a word from another of Rik's fabulous excursions to the world of cinema ^ _ ^
