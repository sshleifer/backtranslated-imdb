This movie was much better than I expected. After a couple of Will Smith films that were not as good as me, Robot, he has become nice and funny again in this one. Smith plays, Hitch, a dating doctor. Most of the films are centered around him teaching Albert how to be himself and having an appointment with Allegra Cole, a famous and rich celebrity with whom he works. Albert is a fool and a fool and always stumbles on his feet or what does not. All Hitch does is teach him how to act more calmly and not be so nervous with Allegra. <br /> <br /> During all this, Hitch meets Sara, a gossip columnist who has sworn men. Hitch love it, so of course, they come out. But, Hitch can teach other guys how to make the girl fall in love with them, he does not believe in love himself. He has never had a girl since he was left in college. But, he likes Sara, so he's still chasing her. Sara's friend is hurt by a guy she thinks went to the doctor's appointment. So Sara follows the doctor, just to learn his Engagement. So, of course, she thinks he is a pig. Then, it depends on getting hooked to explain to Sara and Allegra what he does, so that both end up forgiving. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Well, he laughs and is entertained. I recommend it.
