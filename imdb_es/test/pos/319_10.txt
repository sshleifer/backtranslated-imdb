My favorite movie of all time. This was a faulty Coppola job and watching the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was the king of Hollywood after making "The Godfather" and "The Godfather II" and had developed the necessary ego to dare to even try to make a film like "Apocalypse now". Out of sheer arrogance, he went to the Philippines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he arrived at Colonel Kurtz's compound. And like Willard, he did not know what he was going to do once he got there. This is a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, due to this open ending, it infuriates some viewers who like to make their films much more obvious. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges categorization. Some call it a war movie that is not, it's actually more a personal study of man. The best picture about Vietnam is "Platoon", in my opinion, and if a viewer is looking for a recount of the Vietnam War, you must first get answers. <br /> <br /> Coppola should be congratulated for his vision of the war bureaucracy that he transmits quite effectively with the meeting with Generals Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. Kilgore's audacity makes him an unforgettable character and the attack of the dawn will always be a Hollywood classic. <br /> <br /> It's an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending that makes it a movie that is not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but also rewarding. I could offer my explanations about each scene, but that would be totally useless. This film is intended for interpretation and contemplation instead of immediate gratification. <br /> <br /> A small footnote, definitely if you are the first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, see the original version first, the 'Redux' version is I think it's more intended for hardcore fans and it's more of a curiosity than a "new and improved" version of the movie.
