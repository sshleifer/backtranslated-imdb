The first time I saw this movie on cable in the 80s, it shook me to the core. He appeared again on television about six months ago. <br /> <br /> Shot on location, the black and white cinematography graphically shows the New York of 1950 as the gritty "urban jungle" at a time when there was much more industry and port activity in the city, particularly in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes always brought a special intensity to his performance, and he is magnificent in the role of the army dodger. His short 1959 television series "Johnny Staccato" is also a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier and (later in the film) Ruby Dee bring freshness and vitality to their roles. But it is the excellent performance of Jack Warden as the vicious and brutal shift boss that caught my attention. To get an idea of ​​Warden's versatility, watch this movie, then take a look at an episode of the 1962 "Nude City" television series "Spectrum of the Rose Street Gang (available on video)". If you are a black film fan, this is a must. Enjoy!
