I had never seen an Oliver Stone movie before, nor any film starring Eric Bogosian, I did not know what to expect from this movie. Having played with the idea of ​​buying it for a while, I finally got it for free as a supplement with a Sunday newspaper and it impressed me greatly. <br /> <br /> Tell the story of Barry Champlain, a radio show. Host that can be incredibly rude to your interlocutors, often placing them in their place before they realize what is happening. Although this is what has made him a popular radio show host, he has also won him numerous enemies. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie was hugely impressive, without a single actor. Eric Bogosian is brilliant as Barry Champlain, the talk radio presenter with Alec Baldwin who has become a great performer as Barry's boss, Dan. He also has the voice and appearance of Michael Wincott (my reason for wanting to see this). <br /> <br /> The story was very well written because, despite his arrogance, you feel for Barry more. His problematic life is revealed and it is seen how vulnerable he really is. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone, as it is captivating and, what is more important, real on numerous levels, two of which are inspired by the life of a real radio announcer and in the fact that you actually get radio presenters and callers, like the ones that appear in the movie in reality. <br /> <br /> High recommendation and 10/10. <br /> <br /> To you, Cat Squire
