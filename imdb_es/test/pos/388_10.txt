Alfred Hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers, and many of them have been considered as some of the best films of all time. A film that tends to get lost a bit under dizziness and psychosis is this movie; Strangers in a train, the most convincing movie Hitchcock ever made. The story follows Guy Haines, a tennis player and a man who will soon marry the senator's daughter, if he can divorce his current wife. One day, on the way to see his wife, he encounters the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and soon finds himself involved in a murder plot that he can not stop or stop; and one that could, finally, cost him his life. <br /> <br /> The conversation on board the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the most interesting and fascinating of all time in cinema. What would happen if two people "exchanged" murders, thus solving all the suspicions of the crime and making their motive irrelevant? Could it really be the perfect murder? What makes this movie even more terrifying is that the events Guy conducts can happen to any normal person every day. Everyone has someone they'd like to get rid of, so what happens if you run into a madman on a train that kills you and then forces you to do it? The chances of this happening are unlikely, but the idea that anyone could be a murderer is fundamental to the message of Strangers in a train; And in this situation, anyone could. <br /> <br /> Is there an actor on earth who could have played the character of Bruno Anthony better than Robert Walker? Man was just born for the role. He manages to capture the right mood for his character and controls absolutely every scene in which he finds himself. Bruno's character is crazy, but he's not a lunatic; He is a calculating and deceptive human being, and Robert Walker makes the character credible. His performance is extremely malevolent and, nevertheless, discreet enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality. Unfortunately, Robert Walker died barely a year after the release of Strangers on a Train, and I think it's a big loss for the movies. No one in the cast shines as much as Walker, but it's worth mentioning his co-star Farley Granger. Granger never impresses much, but his performance is good enough and he defends himself against Walker. Also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person; And that is how it should be. Ruth Roman is Guy's wife to be. She is not really in the movie enough to make a lasting impression, but she does the best she has. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, assumes the final role of the four central roles as Barbara, the sister of Guy's fianc√©. She is appropriately charming in this role, and tends to steal many of the scenes in which she finds herself. <br /> <br /> The direction of Alfred Hitchcock is always sublime, and it is very much in this film. There is a particular shot, which sees the murder of the film committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant photo, and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene. The direction of Hitchcock is changing and meets the style of black cinema. The highlight of the film is spectacular and exciting, and I do not think anyone, except Hitchcock, could have achieved it with the great effect that was shown in this film. It's really exaggerated, and it's out of the way of the rest of the movie; but it works. There is a reason why Hitchcock is often cited as the best director of all time, and the reason is that he not only uses the script to tell the story of the film, but also uses the camera to do so. Strangers in a train is one of the best thrillers ever made. His story is both intriguing and stimulating, and will surely delight any movie fanatic. A masterpiece.
