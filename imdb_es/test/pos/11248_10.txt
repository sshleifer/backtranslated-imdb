Keys to the VIP is one of the most entertaining, informative and fun shows on TV right now. The idea is original and well executed, since it manages to preserve the appearance of reality, but it is still entertaining. All judges have a razor wit. They are not the most pleasant at all times, but if you are looking for comfort, go see a movie for girls. Say what you want about the validity of the program, but it is absolutely real. I know people who have competed in the program and have confirmed it. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh, watch this show. It is one of the best comedy shows ever made.
