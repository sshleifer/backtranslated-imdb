This film was made shortly after Karen's death so that, perhaps, Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen felt a little guilty about how they could have contributed to their health problems. As the years passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have become easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death, constantly remixing and compiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I've read, it looks like he might be planning a next generation of carpenters with his children. It seems he has regretted having made this movie, and that may be why he is not available in any way. I thought it was a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and the incredible talent that Karen Carpenter was.
