Everyone who worked on this film did an INCREDIBLE job. Honestly, this is one of the best lesbian movies I've seen in a long time. The acting, the writing, the cinematography, the music, the visuals, everything was first class. As an avid fan of the genre (both the lesbian movies and gymnastics), this movie pleased me in an incredible way. It really gave me much more than I expected in all areas. Listening to the questions and answers with the cast and crew was fantastic, the main actress has a lot of positive energy and is so humble and kind, it is a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what is really important. And the writer did a great job, in addition to directing and the editing was incredible. Thank you very much for making a great movie! Thanks also for the line about "if you're going to stick a label, it would be bisexual". I'm so tired of the movies where the characters that have a relationship with both sexes pass themselves off as homosexuals or heterosexuals, it's wonderful to see the bisexuals recognizing their existence and being part of the gay community, and it was nice that the labels were not even necessary at all in this movie. What an ending! Just when I thought he could not give me more, he did. Beautiful work and my applause to all. I'm going to spread the word, this is definitely a movie that should not be missed!
