If you like Madonna or not, this movie is very funny! I'm a fan of Madonna and I saw him in the theater at the time of his release. However, over time he has not lost his foolishness and pure fun. Of course there are some bad lines and a cheesy performance, but the whole movie is just a crazy comedy with Madonna that takes the whole movie with great bombing. She's cute, funny and the only comedic role of her film career. Madonna usually only plays "herself" in roles, but seeing her as Nikki Finn in this movie, she really seems to be someone else for once. Of course, the film is directed by James Foley (who filmed the dramatic and disturbing 'At Close Range' with Sean Penn and Christopher Walken) and co-stars Griffin Dunn ('After Hours'), which is also brilliantly performed and have fun with the material. The story is not great and do not expect a climate ending, but if you ever want to see a fun game, clean, the 80 or if you're a fan of Madonna, then you MUST SEE. The soundtrack is also very remarkable and contains 4 Madonna songs: the hit # 1 "Who's That Girl", the hit # 2 "Causing A Commotion" and the beautiful and one of his best ballads "The Look of Love" (Top 10 Hit in the UK) and "I can not stop" an emerging theme from the "True Blue" sessions of the previous year. It is only on VHS but will soon be available on DVD.
