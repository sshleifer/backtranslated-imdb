This movie appears again and again on ABC in Australia around 3 am in the morning. <br /> <br /> Start with the scene of a bus accident in London. <br /> <br /> The films have retrospective scenes of each character as the film progresses, in addition to the expired photograph of Big Ben returning the rhythm, to symbolize the events that occurred thirteen hours ago, until the bus crash. <br /> <br /> It took me a while to figure it out, but it was nice anyway. <br /> <br /> If Sean Cunningham and Quentin Tarrantino got together and made a movie, this may be the result, because of the flashbacks and the little stories that are linked and the deaths. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure of the main characters, since it's been a while since I've seen it, but it's a rare gem.
