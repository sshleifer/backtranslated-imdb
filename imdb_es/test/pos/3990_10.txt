First of all, I loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I expected more comic situations than I actually had. However, it was nice to see him on a paper with more depth and emotion. His representation of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly and exceptionally he. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was excellent in his first role in the cinema. When Sammy travels to Romania to visit his client at the site, his world is upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the only person who could change his life. The journey of Sammy and Max is unique and moving, and even humorous at times. In addition, the location in the Czech Republic where parts of the film were shot was absolutely beautiful. I have to say that this dramatic comedy made me feel a variety of emotions. I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to everyone.
