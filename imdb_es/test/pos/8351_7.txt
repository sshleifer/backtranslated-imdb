* Minor spoilers * <br /> <br /> You know, it's getting to the point where the Walt Disney Television Animation could also be called Walt Disney's Sequel Animation. These sequels range from the excellent ("Beauty and the Beast: Haunted Christmas" and the fantastic "King of the Lion II: The Pride of Simba") to the horrible ("The Return of Jafar"). (This is, of course, my personal opinion). Now Disney brings us its latest sequel. "The adventure of Scamp", and although it is defective, it is still entertaining. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is not on par with the Disney Character Animation; Even so, the animators do a good job to bring the characters to life. Lady and Tramp have not aged a single day since 1955. Trusty still talks about her sense of smell and "Ol 'Reliable," and Jock still feels sorry for that. There is a good fight between Tramp and a huge dog in the kennel, and once again we are invited to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic protagonists (although it is very doubtful that this will become a classic scene like his predecessor). <Br /> <br /> I'm not really interested in most of the songs (although Roger Bart and Susan Egan, the singing voices of Scamp and Angel, sing their parts very well). Both Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done a much better job in the past. Danny Troob's score is fine, but nothing memorable. And some of the junk gangs look like excess baggage; that is, they do not really do much. <br /> <br /> Voice work, on the other hand, is pretty good. While I do not like Jeff Bennett as the dog hunter, he is very good as a Tramp. Chazz Palminteri does a good job as Buster, leader of the junk gang, and Alyssa Milano gives what could be her best performance as Angel. Then there is Scamp (which is the image of his father). He is expressed to PERFECTION by Scott Wolf. Wolf does an excellent job of showing Scamp's wild streak and its soft side. <br /> <br /> In general, while "The Scamp Adventure" is flawed, it's still a pretty entertaining visualization. However, I am hopeful that Walt Disney Television Animation will turn its attention to more original material for future releases. <br /> <br />
