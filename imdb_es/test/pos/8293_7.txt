This is undoubtedly a good film, beautifully photographed and acted evocatively. However, one should certainly criticize him, and Mizoguchi, because he is not exempt from flaws and weaknesses. Mizoguchi really cared about women and wanted to make statements about the man's lack of sympathy and total cruelty, but sometimes he goes ahead while trying to make this statement by adopting the wrong means. This is certainly a case in 'The Crucified Lovers', 'The Princess Yang Kwei Fei' and 'Zankiku monogatari'. It sets the stage in feudal Japan, which leaves the viewer at the end with the partially correct exclamation: "boy, feudalism stinks, I'm glad it's over ...". And true, some of the scenarios that the weakest films of Mizoguchi present would be impossible to read today. In addition, their female characters sometimes become unrealistic self-sacrifice archetypes, which also simplifies the less attractive scenario. That said, "Crucified Lovers" is a good movie, with so few relative weaknesses, although the sometimes cold and cynical prose of Ueda, the screenwriter helps this film. I still prefer and highly recommend Mizoguchi's 'realistic' contemporary films of 1936: 'Osaka Elegy' and 'Sisters of the Gion', as well as his latest masterpieces, in which he showed more moderation and subtlety: 'Ugetsu' Sansho Dayu ', and' The life of Oharu '.
