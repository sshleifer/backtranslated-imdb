I saw this movie on the big screen when I was a kid and I loved it: joy and everything. Recently, I found a copy in the video and reviewed it again. Badly done, sure ... fun, definitely. He still has an entertaining punch. It is much more fun than the boring version of Disney ("Alive"). The only thing that "Alive" did better were the special effects. If you are a lover of the B movies, I recommend "Survive", not to mention all the other René Cardona Jnr movies ... and the Mexican wrestling movies made by his father (René Cardona Snr). "Survive" is very late in the treatment of special DVD edition. Are you listening, all your kind people, in Anchor Bay ...?
