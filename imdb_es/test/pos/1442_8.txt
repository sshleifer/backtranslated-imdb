A great little innovative film (in 1955) on an important theme. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much from Sinatra's performance and I was pleasantly surprised. I loved Kim Novak! It was beautiful! <br /> <br /> I loved Elmer Bernstein's jazz score! As good as that by Lazlo Schifrin for "Bullitt"! I am very surprised that it is not available on CD (if anyone knows about the availability of the soundtrack in any other format, they should post it here somewhere!). <br /> <br /> Preminger's address was, as usual, the limit. impeccable. <br /> <br /> I did not read Nelson Algren's novel and I have no idea how faithful the script was. Frankie's secondary argument as a "hot" card salesman was also a bit of a surprise, as were some other things. But see for yourself. It's really worth seeing ...
