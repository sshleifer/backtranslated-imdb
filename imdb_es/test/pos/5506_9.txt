Many people have said that this movie was not a good movie, from a horror perspective, I agree, it was not very scary, it did have some horrifying forms of torture, yes (there are hooks that go where they should not) but not from fear. but it was a good movie from a comical point of view, I thought it was hilarious, such a bad performance by Dee Snider with his stupid theological questioning and every second word he said came out as "what is____, define______", then the angry crowd in his home with one of them with a sign that says "we are not going to take it" (which is a song of his sister twisted, but I think the part that made me laugh was the wife of the only man who was dead and dee snider held her and I made her dance, when I saw that I burst into tears ... so I would not recommend it to lovers of avid horror, but to lovers of horror for their comedy I recommend this movie 100%
