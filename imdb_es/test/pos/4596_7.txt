Many of the things in this futuristic satire are more fun theoretically than really funny (although they have some moments of laughter out loud), but many of them are because it seems that the studio cut them out to better appeal to the idiots is mocking. Many situations are not allowed to develop, there is an obvious overpopulation of exhibition material, and the worst of all is that a narrator explains EVERYTHING (most of which does not need an explanation), probably because some previous audience did not understand what was happening . In other words, a movie about stun has been ... you guessed it. <br /> <br /> One hopes that a longer and better version of this comedy will finally appear on DVD and become the favorite of the cult. it deserves to be, but even in this mutilated form and somewhat comical and diminished by the spirit, it is one of the most memorable films of the year: a cry of disgust against our culture and all the ways in which it has become garbage, stupid and uglificado in the world. Name of appeal to Yahoos. I saw it right after Land of the Dead, the last milking by George Romero of the unique idea that consumers = zombies, which is basically the same point that the judge points out; However, where Romero's counterculture (now zombies = subclass that needs rebelling against the rich) seems irremediably outdated, the judge's opinion is fresh, relentless and much more disturbing. Just listen to the Yahoos in the audience of their movie screaming for the State of the Union of President Camacho as well as their counterparts on the screen, and he will know that we are all condemned.
