This is really the only chance to see the magic of James Joyce's writings come to life. His novels are all impossible to filter (in any real sense) and this is the only long story he wrote. It was John Huston's last film and he did not get to the screen until after his death, and it's easy to see his touch of grandeur. The Dead is poetic in its approach to the screen, and tells us more about Ireland than any modern movie in the IRA and that "the problems" could be expected to tell us. We hope more people will see this movie and experience the best of both John Huston and James Joyce, and perhaps visit this story at their local bookstore (and discover that it is probably the best short story ever written on paper).
