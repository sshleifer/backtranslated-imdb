I'm not going to go deep, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There were no funny scenes of slaps on the knee (which I can remember), but they had their moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as always and Eddie Murphy makes a pretty funny performance. Ren√© Russo was fine in the movie, no complaints. There were two characters in the story that I liked and they did not explain much. The first was the friend of Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy) in the gym that played Ken Campbell. I assumed he was just a friend of Trey, but I wanted to know more about him. The other character that I liked was the partner / partner of Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) played by Nestor Serrano. I guess he was just another cop working with Mitch Preston, but he wanted to know if he was his partner or not. I think maybe I'm thinking too much about a movie, I mean, after all, it's a comedy ... who cares about the characters? Although I think so. I was very pleased to see that this was directed by Tom Dey, who also directed Shanghai Noon. Since I saw that movie, I looked forward to his next job. I think he did a good job with this movie, and again I look forward to his next job. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a good movie, but I would not recommend paying the full price for a ticket unless you're a Robert De Niro / Eddie Murphy / Rene Russo fan. It was worth seeing in the theater, but not at a full price, I would recommend seeing it at a reasonable price. <br /> <br /> Also, here are some trivia of the movie for you. The boy who played the cameraman, played by Judah Friedlander, is the boy in the music video "Everyday" by Dave Matthews' band. He was also the employee of "Meet The Parents", also starring Robert De Niro. ... And on top of that, he also played Derek Zoolander's brother in "Zoolander" (both Zoolander and Meet the Parents star Ben Stiller). Just some useless questions for you. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the movie. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
