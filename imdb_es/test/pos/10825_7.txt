An interesting combination of stories, this small film manages to gather characters and story lines apparently different in the context of World War II and manages to unite them without losing the audience. I was impressed by the depth represented by the different characters and also how much I really felt that I understood them and their motivations, even though the time devoted to the development of each character was very limited. The outstanding acting skills of the people involved with this image are easily noticeable. A fun and stylized movie with a lot of funny moments and a lot of events that shake the head. <br /> <br /> 7/10
