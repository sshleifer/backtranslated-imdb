Many believe that this movie is a baseball movie. These people are disappointed because it is a baseball player, but the film is not about baseball. <br /> <br /> Some think that this movie is a romantic comedy and they are disappointed because the relationship is not really developed. This movie is not a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie is about culture. An arrogant American commander Leaguer and a stern Japanese traditional baseball manager can not succeed because they can not, in fact, not understand each other. It is after they manage to break the cultural barrier that they succeed. The ball player becomes more Japanese in his team mentality and the more American manager by allowing individual achievement, and they are in the middle. <br /> <br /> Baseball and romance are subordinated to this critique of the two cultures. Many of those who do not understand the Japanese mentality miss this and think that it is a movie about baseball or romance and they see culture as a comedy relief. It's not --- the culture shock is the movie's assessment. Based on my own experience and understanding of Japanese culture, I think that this film did quite well, since it did not romanticize Japanese culture too much or exaggerate its interpretation. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this is a nice and relaxing movie if one understands what it really is about.
