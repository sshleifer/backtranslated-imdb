This is a great movie! It's fun for everyone, even adults. We have Jason Voorhees / Leatherface as a killer in this, along with other extravagant characters. Very funny movie, for children of all ages. You must rent this every time we went to the video store! Buster and Babs make a good pair, and they must love the duck. It's probably my favorite character! I was never great on the television show, but this movie only brings back many good memories. You have to see it for families, fans of the show, or anyone! Pleasant, no matter how small or old you are! RENT NOW AT YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE! <br /> <br /> P.S. YOU NEED A DVD PUBLICATION!
