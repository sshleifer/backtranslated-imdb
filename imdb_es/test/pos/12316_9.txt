For his latest film, John Huston directed his daughter, Anjelica, in this adaptation of the story of "Dubliners" by James Joyce, and gave us one of his best achievements to remember him. <br /> <br /> Joyce is almost impossible to shoot as anyone, but "The Dead" presents at least one traditional narrative to work with. Much of the important information (in fact, almost all) of the story is in the spaces between lines, in the thoughts and expressions of the characters: there are great moments, but they are cerebral, they are not elements of which movies are made But somehow, Huston understands it well, and he achieves an almost perfect adaptation. <br /> <br /> Anjelica is magnificent, and the film is disturbing and powerful. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
