Okay, I do not usually exhaust and rent foreign films ... especially foreign dark comedies. I think I can count on a hand the amount of movies that I found really funny from beginning to end. This movie will be added to the short list. Even the dark comedies that come out of Hollywood sometimes turn me off because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor. But this one had my eyes full of tears. My sides hurt. I have not laughed so much in a long time. This film was recommended by my mother and I do not think I would have dreamed of seeing it if she had not told. Do not be afraid of having to read during your movie, you will miss a hilariously well-acted movie.
