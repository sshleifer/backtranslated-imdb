I saw Dark Harbor at the Seattle Film Festival of '98. Shot with an autumnal Maine background, this film has an excellent cast and plot that keeps you guessing. Sometimes mysterious, sometimes funny, I have to say that he stayed with me for days after seeing him. Rickman and Walker are wonderful as ice-mariners and Reedus is someone you'll hear more of, I'm sure. The opening shot of a sinuous and deserted road in a downpour at dusk (and the score that accompanied it) set the tone so well, just excellent. Pleasant, good job of a new director / screenwriter and his talented team.
