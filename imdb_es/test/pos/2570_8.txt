Actually I thought that Black Snake Moan was a great movie that takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazaro, whose wife leaves him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten on the side of the road. Lazaro discovers that Rae is a sex addict and was mistreated as a child, so she decides to take the matter with her own hands by tying him with a chain to cure her of his evil. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have a great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and the search for redemption, Lazaro and Rae become best friends. I was also surprised by Sam's ability to play an electric guitar and be able to sing. S Epatha Merrkensen is excellent as Lazaro's lover, Angela, Justin Timberlake plays Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie, who is underutilized in the film but does his best to offer an excellent performance.
