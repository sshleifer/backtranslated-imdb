I would not be so sure about accepting the DNA tests as irrefutable evidence against Anna Anderson. First, read Peter Kurth's book on which this film is based. Anna Anderson knew things that only the real Grand Duchess Anastasia could have known (forensic evidence in favor of Anna aside). Second, compare the photos of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Anyone can see that they are one and the same person. Third, visit the website of Peter Kurth (url below) where you can read detailed information about DNA tests, as well as why Franziska Schanzkowska and Anna Anderson are not the same person (scroll down to the link "ANNA-ANASTASIA NOTES ON FRANZISKA SCHANZKOWSKA "") Even the relatives of Schanzkowska believed that their sister and Anna Anderson were not the same person. <br /> <br /> I, for one, will always believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and Anna Anderson they were really the same person; they will never let me take away on the contrary. <br /> <br /> www.peterkurth.com
