The ruthless evil warlord Samanosuke (magnificently played up to the odious hilt of Yutaro Gomi) cruelly mistreats the peaceful residents of a small town. The giant stone statue Majin finally comes alive to destroy Samanosuke and his evil minions. Director Kimiyoshi Yasudo and screenwriter Tetsuro Yoshida give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an ancient legendary historical tale: there is a very strong sense of an ancient time and a far-off place (it is specifically established in feudal Japan) ), the good ones are noble and attractive, while the villains are really unpleasant and detestable, the occasional sword fights are organized with considerable skill and enthusiasm, the special effects are good and impressive, the serious tone and the steady rhythm never waver by One minute, and the last reel of Majin The wild destruction is extremely animated, exciting and more than a little frightening. In addition, the fantastic elements of the narrative are given great credibility by being firmly rooted in a dark, gritty and gritty world that is totally credible. This movie earns bonus points for representing Majin as a brutal and terrifying force of angry revenge instead of a pure spirit of absolute good. Veteran composer Akira Ifukube provides a typically rich, robust and moving score. The sharp and capricious cinematography of Fujio Morita also hits the mark. All the members of the cast are able to offer admirable and sincere performances, with a work especially worthy of praise of Jun Fujimaki as the brave and protective Kogenta and Tatsuo Endo as the evildoer Gunjuro. Highly recommended
