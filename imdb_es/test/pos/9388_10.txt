I see many movies. A lot of movies. Obtaining a postgraduate degree in film requires one to watch 2 to 3 films per day for years. Everything becomes very exhausting. Especially because I feel I've seen it all. So strange is when something surprises me, mainly I hope to see something as good as I hope it will be. <br /> <br /> The Deathbed is so different from anything I've experienced that I actually had to stop the DVD to rant about its genius. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the piece is psychotic. It is structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay out of the frame. It's not like something like Halloween with all its fast editions and your POV footage; The death bed actually appears as a kind of dream. The most pretentious way I can say is: this is Samuel Beckett making a movie of a haunted house. I mean it's a manic depressive bed that eats people! And fried chicken! Out in the middle of nowhere! And there are bone hands! I can barely articulate my feelings about this movie. And yes, facing this pleasure will open you up to ridicule. But things get the same after a while. It is difficult to be a cinephile and stay committed constantly. I can honestly say that this is a totally unique movie, from top to bottom. From what it is to how it is put together. We need movies like that, movies that take us out of our complacency. Consider it as an existential camp. It's fun and it's stupid, but also brilliant in its strange way. The worst villain of terror of all time? Maybe, but at least it's not a man with a mask.
