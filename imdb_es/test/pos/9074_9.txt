His flashbacks are like children's nightmares. Revived students are disturbed by remembering the acts of repentance they committed or committed against them.

Therefore, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland were in the early stages of their careers as an adult actor. Besides that the plot is extremely intriguing, the suspense becomes a dramatic climax and the script is tight and compelling, all the young actors make "Flatliners", which is now a semi-science fiction suspense of stars. Who knew 17 years ago that the film careers of this young group of actors would shoot up? I suspect that director Joel Schumacher did it.
