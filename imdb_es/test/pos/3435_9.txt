'Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies, not only of Peter Dalle but of the Swedish film industry itself. It is a film made in black and white to get something from the atmosphere of the days before Christmas in December 1945, which makes it very well. Almost the whole plot takes place in a train, without stops to Berlin. On the train there is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the literature critic "Gunnar" played by the famous actor Gustav Hammarsten in Sweden. The main role 'Gunnar' is the kind of person who, although his intentions are the best, seems to drag everyone who is close to him, in an extremely funny way, to disaster and hell, especially for a person of the war of Finland. I return home, wounded soldier played by the extremely funny comedian Robert Gustafsson. On the train there is also a doctor, who cheats on his wife, with his mistress. Together they have planned to assassinate the doctor's wife who also travels with the same train without any knowledge about the intentions of their husbands. Will the doctor's wife avoid the plans to assassinate her and all the others will survive the unfortunate comrade 'Gunnar'?
