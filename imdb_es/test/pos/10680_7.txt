When I saw that this movie was broadcast on the television of the night, I initially decided to avoid it. I'm glad to have started looking. Yes, the special effects are the same as Gerry Andersen's puppet shows. Some of the actors / actresses are from his other productions, obviously he used the same composer later on, since the corny soundtrack could have come from one of his productions, and the plot is as slow as a wet weekend. Beat all that and you have a movie that shows intriguing possibilities. Is there a planet on the other side of the sun? Is it a duplicated land? Has everything been reversed and, if so, do they speak English in reverse? I love this dated SF, if only for Gerry's wonderful models of cars, planes, buildings and spaceships. Some of them are not as far away as they seemed at the time. And did you see the logo of the European Space Center? Very reminiscent of today's euro logo. Suspend the belief and spend a couple of hours watching this, you'll be glad you did.
