Considering that it's basically a low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good movie about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey plays Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for almost all his music. Backed by her crickets, Holly had a series of successes and became a real star before her death in a plane crash, along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film continues its ascent to the stardom, the marriage with its fianc2ee and the final death. I like this movie and I think you will too. Charles Martin Smith also does a great job in this movie.
