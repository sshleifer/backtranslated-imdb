Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons featuring Bugs Bunny / Daffy Duck / Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wit about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy provoke "pronoun problems" with Daffy, always the victim of Elmer's shotgun, which results in his always dismembered beak. Then there is the transvestism of the rabbit that always puts Elmer in his beaten love mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always my favorites in the team category of writers and directors because of these fun hunting trilogy cartoons that I've laughed at since I was a kid. And at least two of them end with the exclamation of Daffy to Bugs: "You're despicable!" You can not improve that!
