Forget the overrated "Start Batman, THIS is the best Batman movie you do not want to miss, this movie has it all, and totally surpasses the first mega hit of 1989. It may not have done as well as the first one in the box office But it's definitely a much better movie, the images are incredible, Burton does his magic as he always does in his films once more, Gotham City, Batman's hunting ground, is an amazing sight. It's pretty good and the 2 villains in this story are VERY interesting, much more interesting than the comics Tim Burton and the screenwriter Daniel Walters go a step further to give you a truly emotional connection with these characters.The penguin, played to perfection by Danny Devito, is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge in the world that denied it.Sometimes it is very unpleasant to see, but has some The most classic lines that a villain could pronounce in a single movie. the other villain is Catwoman, played in an absolutely brilliant way by Michelle Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and who offers a WOW performance, and steals the show completely in what refers to the past and present of Batman, the live action villain. She also has a tragic background. her name is Selina Kyle, and she is a very spoiled secretary of a shrewd businessman named Max Shreck, who later murders her by pushing her out the window. somehow, she survives and is "awakened" by the cats, and decides at that moment to become the legendary Catwoman, not before, of course, in the amazing sequence in which she unleashes herself completely and destroys her entire apartment in one of the best Oscar. A performance worthy of anger and anger that I have seen in an actress. <br /> <br /> Once again, Michael Keaton puts on his cape and hood as Batman and also as Bruce Wayne and this time it is much darker. There's not much more to say here, except that Keaton is simply the best actor to play Batman. it just oozes cold, and has a kind of Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman, and it's very dark. He does not talk much, and when he does, it sounds very good and does not make his voice sound silly and false. The bullet "batman" voice from IE starts in batman. he walks through Gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons. He is worried psychologically, and you know it. In this outing, he faces 2 of the most famous bad guys in the batman comics world. <br /> <br /> I have to say that, despite the awesomeness of the action scenes, like the scenes with the best Batmobile. NEVER, running down the street knocking down thugs and batman slipping through Gotham, it's the romantic angle between Pfieffer and Keaton that really makes this classic movie one of the best options for anyone who wants to see REAL Batman in action, I consider it a 10, I would give more if I could.
