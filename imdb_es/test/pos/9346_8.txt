'Thriller' is still the best of pop music promotions with an argument, excellent images and an excellent song to wrap the film. Michael Jackson was at the top of the tree at the time (and he was not so upset in his plastic surgery regimen for that to matter). Here is in good shape, the song is great, lead the zombies in dance like no other. <br /> <br /> Ola Ray plays the girl who watches in disbelief as her sweet boyfriend (Jackson, natch) becomes a werewolf! Then, at the pulsating rhythms of the opening line 'It's close to midnight', step on the cemetery next to the other zombies and creatures of the night. <br /> <br /> The supreme glory of all this is the fruity voice of The great horror star Vincent Price speaking in the middle of the record. Great.
