The most attractive factor found in this masterpiece of a movie are not the beautiful main actors. Nor is his outstanding chemistry acting and hot. <br /> <br /> For me, it's the bad scene of the whole movie. The configuration, lighting, accessories ... contribute to the atmosphere of love among the main characters. A puff of smoke from Chow's cigarette tells us his mood, Lizhen's tight cheongsams, always changing, reflect the limitations of decision making, the ruins of Angkor Wat are related to the deteriorating relationship of the two tracks. <Br /> <br /> The excellent use of mis-en-scene gives the film the just amount of sensation needed to develop the complicated nature of the characters' relationship. The film leaves the audience unsuccessfully craving more.
