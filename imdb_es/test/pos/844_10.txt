I loved this show. I think the first time I tried Rocky Road ice cream was because of this show. Was not the store right on the beach or something? Actually I wrote from one side to another with Marci for several years. I lost touch and I wish I could reconnect now as adults. Does anyone know where she is now? I would like them to put it on DVD. I seriously doubt it, since I think there are maybe five or six people who even remember the show on the air in the first place. They just do not do programs like this anymore, right? I wonder if he would still be in this day and age. Do you know anyone who can record DVDs of the program they recorded on VHS? I would be willing to pay (within reason).
