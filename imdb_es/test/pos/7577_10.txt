I do not remember reading Sarah, Plain and Tall at school, but when my son told me about it and said that they had seen the movie in class, I also wanted to see it. I borrowed the video from the library and saw it as a family. It was a wonderful story. However, I did not know until a few months ago that there were sequels. I finished seeing them this week. I discovered a small oops: in the second movie, Skylark, Jacob remembers when he was a child and tells Sarah "my brothers and sisters and I would dream ...". In Winter's End, those "brothers and sisters" do not exist in the conversations between Jacob and his father. But it's a very small Oops, and I just caught it watching the trilogy, the second time. Great movie, a must for a good view of the healthy family.
