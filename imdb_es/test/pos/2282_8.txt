An egotistical baseball player in the big leagues is forced to continue his career in Japan, faces a culture that is alien to him, a seemingly humorless manager, an attractive Japanese woman and his own professional and social insecurities. There is a certain subtle charm that flows through the performances of Tom Selleck. There is humor, sometimes subtly underestimated, as in this movie, sometimes slapstick as in "Folks!", But there always seems to be some higher purpose involved. Add an individual full of personal doubts who struggle to solve their personal difficulties while clinging to "doing the right thing" and ending with a fun and thought-provoking movie. The cast fits like a championship team, and even if neither the cast nor the film wins awards for their efforts, they will leave viewers feeling good (and may be the best results after all). You will want to see this movie more than once and, each time, Mr. Baseball hits a home run.
