This Columbo is unique since we do not know the exact result until the end. Our favorite detective of dark horses suspects that a pair of identical twin brothers killed their rich uncle; each one points his finger at his brother. In a mystery series in which the crime is shown at the beginning of the drama, this turn could be used reasonably only once or twice, and this was Columbo's moment. Apart from that wrinkle, this episode fits well with others in the series. It has a lighter tone than some, with a very funny performance of Jeanette Nolan as the annoying and loyal housekeeper who takes an instant dislike to Columbo.
