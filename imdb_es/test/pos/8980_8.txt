When told in flashback, the film begins in 1989 and Charlie receives an award for his role in the defeat of communism. I must admit that my heart sank at the idea of ​​having to endure another story of serious life, something boring and prolonged. How wrong I was, because that brief scene is as close as the boring movie can be. <br /> <br /> The film is full of entertaining and entertaining fun and crack dialogues in some of the most unexpected places. The next scene after the awards ceremony is Charlie in a jacuzzi with some naked women and a guy who tries to invest in a television show. Another pretty funny scene is about 3 rooms in the film, composed by Charlie, a group of his rather attractive secretaries, Phillip Seymour Hoffmans CIA Man and a bottle of whiskey. As for dialogue, what about this for a line? "Says the senator, can teach us to write, but can not teach us to grow boobs." Well, I know, but I know that the movie is full of big lines. <br /> <br /> As for the performances, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as usual, steals all the scenes in which he finds himself. Hanks is fine, but surprisingly for me it was Julia Roberts. Who is very good in the role of a pretty eccentric millionaire of Texas oil. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is one of the best non-musical biographies in a long time, besides being a rare thing in a movie that entertains, entertains and informs everyone in equal measure.
