Eighteen, as written and directed by Richard Bell, may have too many stories to tell simultaneously for a 102-minute movie to be a complete success, but there is a great sense of commitment from the entire cast and crew that the viewer ends want the movie to work, and so it does. Yes, the aspects could have been refined if the producers had more money to spend in the final cut, but as a small Canadian independent film, this is a tender, gently humorous, very moving story about vulnerability, communication and commitment. . It works on many levels. <br /> <br /> In a very well choreographed opening, we are pioneers of a family dinner in which, obviously, something has gone wrong and results in a father and two children leaving in a car and having an accident. in which one of the children is killed. With an introduction like that, it sets the mood for the surviving 18-year-old Pip (Paul Anthony, who seems too old to have credibility as a teenager), leave his family and live in the streets. Meet Clark (Clarence Sponagle), a prostitute who gives food and shelter to Pip, Jenny (the very beautiful Carly Pope) who saves him from an attack by his associate Derek (Ryan McDonell) and gets romantically entangled with Pip, and Father Chris (Alan Cumming) in a sympathetic role finely wrought as a priest. It's Pip's 18th birthday and his father (Serge Houde) traces Pip down to give him a gift from his deceased grandfather with instructions that the gift should open on the day he turns 18. <br /> <br /> Pip, although he drinks too much and full of anger, pawns the tape machine but keeps the tape and starts listening to the words of his grandfather Jason (voiced by Ian McKellen) who tells his 18th birthday in World War II in France, where he (now the very sensitive actor Brendan Fletcher has an experience with a wounded doctor named Macauley (Mark Hildreth, also excellent) and reflects on his one-night marriage with a cabaret singer Hannah (Thea Gill from the fame of 'Queer as Folk' and a thin singer and actress here), just for something to live with during the war: Jason offers help to Macauley when he dies, with a beautiful scene of redemption for the two men at the end. The parallels of Pip and Grandpa Jason interact every time Pip listens to the tape and leads Pip to alter his view of life and love.Secondary arguments include Clark's isolated existence as a con man being altered by Jeff (David B eazely, in a surprising debut in the cinema) that simply wants to be loved; for an unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip; for the confidence that Father Chris instills in Pip and Clark with good manners: and for a flashback of the car accident in which Pip could have saved his brother Daniel (Paul Dzenkiw) from an abusive act at the hands of his father, just before the accident, but he did not do so, opening his deep guilt and resulting out-of-place anger, reflected by his grandfather's recorded experiences. Each of these subplots meets at the end, creating a sense of closure for each of the people involved. <br /> <br /> There are aspects of this film that make it seem like a big budget production: Bramwell Tovey's musical score is played by the members of the Vancouver Symphony, Kevin Van Niekerk's photography is aptly atmospheric, and the overall quality of the performance of this Canadian cast is very good. Although Paul Anthony manages his role well, choosing a very young teenager in the pivotal lead role would have made the story work much better, and Richard Bell, with just another "Two Brothers" movie on his resume, promises a young talent to watch. Despite the shortcomings, EIGHTEEN is a worthwhile film that deserves attention. Harp grady
