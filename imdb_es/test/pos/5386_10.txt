I saw "Heaven-Ship" ("Himmelskibet") at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile, Italy. What a great movie! This Danish steampunk saga is the moving story of the first trip to Mars, at a time when wireless telegraphy has not been perfected. The spacecraft does not have a radio, and the heroes are brought from the landing field through horsecart. Even the intertitles are charming ... some of them written in rhymed pairings in the original Danish. <br /> <br /> The actors' performances are laughable, largely histrionic face-to-face. But the sets are amazing, easily beating everything done by Georges Melies a decade before (or in "Die Frau im Mond" a decade later). Of course, the plot is simplistic. The crew of the spacecraft consists of seven thin guys and one fat guy. Guess which one breaks. Interestingly, everyone in this movie (except the dubious Professor Dubius) believes fervently in God. Even the Martians. <br /> <br /> Impressively, the writers have the sense to recognize that a trip to Mars is not easy: the title cards state that scientists need two years to build their spacecraft (which has an airlift)) and six months to get to Mars. During the construction sequence, there is an extremely impressive configuration that must have been choreographed: dozens of workers rush through the job site in different directions, without hesitation or collisions. Danish scientists baptize their ship "Excelsior" ("packaging materials"?) And set the course towards Mars, although the Moon and Venus are closer. When the ship (which flies horizontally, not vertically) lands on Mars, it is received by "Marsboerne", the Martians, who happen to be Nordic blondes, all highly developed pacifists and vegetarians. (As a very developed carnivore, that part bothered me). <br /> <br /> Conveniently, Mars turns out to have an atmosphere like Earth's, as well as gravity itself. On an outer plane of the Martian landscape, the apparent magnitude of the Sun when viewed from Mars is the same as when viewed from Earth. I also could not help noticing that all the older wise Martians are men. In fact, the old women are thin on the ground here: both the hero born on Earth and the Martian maiden have no mother. The Martians speak a universal language, use the straps on their clothes and greet the visitors of the Earth with a globe ... which, of course, they hold with their North Pole upwards. <br /> <br /> That Martian maiden is Marya, played by an ethereally beautiful Danish actress. (Waiter, I'll have some of that Danish!) We see a martial chastity dance that could have been twee or ridiculous but it's actually quite touching and beautiful. In addition, the Martian funerary scene presents a shot that reminded me of a sequence in "The Seventh Seal." I wonder if Ingmar Bergman saw this movie. <br /> <br /> "Himmelskibet" has some flaws, but its production design and other merits far outweigh its drawbacks. The Ole Olsen that appears in the credits (and that appears in a brief prologue) does not have relation with the vaudeville partner of Chic Johnson of "Hellzapoppin". I would give "Himmelskibet" a 12, but the scale reaches a maximum of 10 ... so, a total of 10 out of 10 for this delicious trip to Mars, the blond planet!
