They succeed in their plan, but D. Juan César makes things go wrong when he gives a valuable ring to his lover. <br /> <br /> "Du Rififi Chez les Hommes" is a magnificent black cinema, certainly among the best I've seen. The script has credibility, backed by an impressive direction by Jules Dassin, impressive performances by the cast and a great cinematography. Jean Servais has an outstanding performance in the role of a criminal with principles guided by the rules of the underworld. The famous long and silent sequence of the robbery is amazing and extremely tense and, without a doubt, among the best in the history of cinema. I'm listing this great movie on my favorite movie list. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rififi"
