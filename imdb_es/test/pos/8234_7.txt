Consider the general release date of August 8, 1945, about a week before Japan surrendered in World War II, so there will probably be a message for us in "More than 21". Irene Dunne (It happened one night, the Love Affair version of 1939) is Paula Wharton, who is going to live in an army base while the editor of her newspaper, the husband, is in the training school. Alexander Knox (the longest day) is her husband Max. Look for Charles Coburn (Monkey Business, gentlemen prefer blondes) as the suffocating and commanding newspaper chief. Also look for Cora Witherspoon as Mrs. Gates, of The Women, Bank Dick, Libeled Lady. History of war written for the point of view of the wives, that was not very common in those days. funny comment about the bad condition of the "married house"; Irene's wardrobe in this film was certainly not bad ... since they never had to leave their house, it seems that the entire budget of the film was spent on their always exquisite dresses and hats.
