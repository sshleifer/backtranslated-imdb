This movie starts with all the bad-tempered promise of a great contemporary western noir, anyway after the ill-conceived opening flashback sequence. The landscape is beautifully desolate, the characters are painfully isolated. While part of the performance is less than credible, the plot ultimately offers enough tension and twists to make this movie worthwhile.
