Great movie. Good acting, a wonderful script. It is exciting to discover what people think and how they react to the situation in which they find themselves. A pity for the end; A 'page' of text about how Nynke's life went, instead of moving images, was a bad choice. I hope this movie attracts a lot of people; worth it!
