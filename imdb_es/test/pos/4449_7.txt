First of all, I must say that I am a big fan of Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento. Although I have not seen absolutely all of his films, I really enjoyed almost all the ones I saw. I really like giallos and I thought that Argento was the master of this genre, after watching films like "Tenebre" and "Phenomena". But after seeing "New York Ripper" by Fulci, I discovered that he could do pretty good giallos besides his graphic zombie movies and even surpass Argento, at a certain level. <br /> <br /> I love Fulci's style, and yes, I love Gore, but I think that this film, although it has a more developed plot and characters than its other films, is not the best. What I do not like is that it can be confusing at times, especially at the end. And the fact that we go from one suspect to another, and then another until we suspect for a moment of the delayed child, I think it goes too far. I know the giallos are supposed to keep you guessing until the end, and the killer should be very hard to find, but this movie plays too much with our minds. However, I liked the scene in which they kill the witch, I think it is very well made and gave me chills. The performance is also quite good and the photography is excellent. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a bad movie, I think Lucio Fulci has made better movies than this, and I think his best film is "The Beyond". , a very different movie but with a more atmospheric and visual experience. <br /> <br /> I give "Do not torture a duckling" 7 out of 10. <br /> <br />
