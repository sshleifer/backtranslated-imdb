The unforgettable "Oz" by Tom Fontana is undoubtedly one of the best television series ever created. Written, acted and directed brilliantly, it is the closest thing to perfection in any form of art (film, television, literature, music) that is obtained. Chasing his extreme brutality, he creates a prison world full of diverse characters ranging from compassionate to terrifying. It's a show that no matter how brutal it is, you can not look away from it. The combination of theatrical actors trained professionally with film and television actors allows a variety of diverse and original representations. <br /> <br /> And while the show is universally praised and has a loyal following base, one can not feel that it was underestimated during its television run due to other HBO dramas such as "The Sopranos", "Sex and The City "and" Six Feet Under ". And while all those programs are fine and borderline masterpieces on their right, many people forget that "Oz" was HBO's first entry into a one-hour television drama series. It was a courageous and risky first entry and with it HBO hit a grand slam with her. This is as good as it gets.
