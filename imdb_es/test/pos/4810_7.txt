This film is a refreshing change from the stupid rhythms of the Hong Kong triad that I've grown so tired of. There are no spectacular gun battles. There are no car chases. And practically minimum action to talk about. The audience remains largely in abeyance, although certain aspects of Andy Lau's so-called "tactic" are quite obvious. <br /> <br /> The film has been hailed as a deviation from the violent triad genre. Movies, and as an "intelligent" crime movie. To a certain extent, it is. But, to some extent, the "credibility" test still fails. You can hardly imagine that a member of the triad is foolish enough not to see through the feminine disguise of Andy Lau in a second. He also seemed to have fallen in love with "if someone was seriously ill, he said that someone will be coughing up large amounts of blood regularly" which Chinese movies seem to have all the time. <br /> <br /> The subtle relationship between the two main characters is a refreshing change. <br /> <br /> In general, a nice movie, although the concept is not new and there are few surprises. >
