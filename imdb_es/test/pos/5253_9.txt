I had my son over the weekend and my parents called me and told me that they wanted us both to meet at the cinema. When I got there, my mother said that she really wanted to see "The Women" and she asked me if my son and I cared because they labeled it as a movie for girls. I reluctantly agreed that it was going to be another "First Wives Club" movie. I have to say that I was very surprised to find myself really enjoying the movie from the initial scene to the credits. It was a great production and the cast was perfect in its roles. My son and I found ourselves laughing through the whole movie and we are glad we saw it. It was a great Saturday afternoon and I recommend it to everyone, men or women.
