The clever and scathing drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon appeared on the cover of every newspaper in the United States (when life imitated the movie). An employee of a nuclear power plant in Southern California is threatened by his superiors when he decides to make public the real story behind an accident at the plant. Apparently a stuck valve problem, a movie from a television news crew shows that it was an accident in disastrous proportions, and worse, that the security conditions are being cleaned to save millions of dollars, a cover-up that endangers the life of all. The film occasionally becomes too technical (especially in the second half) and could use more human interaction, however, the performances of Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda (as a news woman in the right place at the right time), and Michael Douglas (as an independent cameraman) is excellent. The disposable fragments involving the nuclear protesters are totally accurate and bitterly satirical, and the business newscasts (with their corporate structure and their yes-men vapids) are captured vividly. *** 1/2 of ****
