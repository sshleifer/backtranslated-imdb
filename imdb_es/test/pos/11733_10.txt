The soundtrack of jazz makes it look like a Clint Eastwood movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, everything seems to Burt doing to Clint. The story is good and the movie is full of a line that I carry with me to this day. (Reynolds to bad boy: I'm going to put the chain to your friend, because you're in my city, and you want to know the worst part? You're from out of state!) <br /> <br /> Highlights: The reel to reel Technics 1500B is a good dressing for audiophiles! <br /> <br /> Charles Durning remains motionless while listening to tapes of telephone taps of prostitutes who have (more or less) telephone sex. (You should see it, believe me, it's hilarious). <br /> <br /> Brian Keith plays against the guy like a tough guy. (And he does it well!) <br /> <br /> Bernie Casie's concern with Zen. <br /> <br /> Rachel Ward. WOOHOO! (Where did he go?) <br /> <br /> Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show band play as usual. (Joe William's guests in the voice.) Manhattan Transfer recorded again the "Route 66".) The soundtrack pays close attention to the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Do I need to say more? It could be Reynold's best movie. <br /> <br /> (Yes, he plays, as usual, but it works!) <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
