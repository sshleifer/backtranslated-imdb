The other day I saw this short film on HBO and I loved it. Eight different characters, eight different perspectives. At first I was confused by the way the story progressed, but then I realized that only one scene was shown again and again, just to show us the different perspectives of the characters. <br /> <br /> At first, you think that employees are yelling at the teenager for stealing. They speak in their own language, which I (and Chris the teenager, played convincingly by Eleonore Hendricks) can not understand. The perspective of the employees dispels that view. I did not realize how wonderful the short film is until the last two scenes. <br /> <br /> Excellent short film. With luck, director James Cox can turn the short film into a feature film with the same cast, or win us with a completely new movie. <br /> <br />
