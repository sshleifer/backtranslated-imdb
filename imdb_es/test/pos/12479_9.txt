Great artists, they always suffered while they were young. I could mention Mozart and Beethoven, but that's not the point. <br /> <br /> This movie was made by HG Clouzot, whose family wanted him to succeed in the law professions. <br /> <br /> Its main star is Louis Jouvet, who studied and practiced as a pharmacist before becoming "The best actor" and also the theater director of France before and after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> They both had health problems. Clouzot had TB when he was young, Jouvet had heart problems and died in a theater .. <br /> <br /> Such events shape the character of men (and women, of course). You could even say that today's artists are very poor, because they had never suffered and fought for their lives. <br /> <br /> For me, this is Clouzot's best movie. "Salaries of fear" is higher in "suspense", "Diabolique" also has more "suspense" and a better plot and is more about "evil woman". <br /> <br /> Quai des Orf√®vres is more human. Clouzot was falsely accused by de Gaulle's entourage (mostly Communists and Jews) of collaboration with the Nazis and was banned from making films until De Gaulle left the government of France in early 1946. De Gaulle returned in 1958, as President. <br /> <The main characters are all good souls: Jenny L'Amour can act as "putain" on stage, but she is not a "bitch" (dictations make synonyms for those words, but they are not the same), loves her husband, and refuses the slight advances of her friend (presumably lesbian) Dora, the photographer. <br /> <br /> Maurice, the husband, is jealous and shy, but escapes from the crime scene coward because he fell in love with a woman and changed a career for more elegant love. <br /> <br /> Antoine, the detective (played by the great Louis Jouvet, basically a theater actor, acts in this French "Gray" Not Noir, as well as EG Robinson in "Double Indemnity") shows talent for pseudo criminals, tenderness for a black son (?), and compassion for the true perpetrator of the crime, because he remembers that his father cleaned the latrines in the castle of some nobleman. <br /> <br /> Clouzot was able to slap the face of an actor to put him in the state He was in the right mood, but deep down he was very human. <br /> <br /> I have your horoscope in front of me. He had Venus in Sagittarius, which means frankness, devotion, charity and altruism. For those who do not believe in astrology, my most sincere apologies ...
