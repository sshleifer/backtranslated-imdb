If you are really reading this review, I give you a lot of credit. You care enough to search for this movie, which most people forgot and then read beyond the first review! So for your reading pleasure ... <br /> <br /> I guess you already know the plot, so I will not waste my time writing that. I will mention that Sandra Bullock did an amazing job with this movie. She really brought a lot of sympathy to the role of a computer programmer, often difficult to do. I can say this because I am a computer programmer. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought the basic plot was very good. You can easily create subplots on your mainframe and make it a very nice movie. The premise is also very realistic, since all this can really happen if the proper precautions are not taken. <br /> <br /> To make a long review ... Oops! Too late! If you enjoy Sandra Bullock giving life to a role and you want to see a very well made movie for that time, take a look at this little gem. You will not be disappointed. :-)
