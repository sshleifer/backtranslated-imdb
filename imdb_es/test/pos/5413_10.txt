This movie is a powerful commentary on family life in North America today. The story is so well constructed that it almost seems like it's happening across the street, right now! If you are connected with your family and your community in some way, this movie will catch you and transport you to Travis' house and will not allow you to leave until the credits end. <br /> <br /> Our imaginary heroes, through a lot of innocent circumstances, often unknowingly lead us down a path of sadness, confusion and isolation. The Travis family, after a terrible tragedy, invites each one of us; Father, mother, brother and sister, in their respective lives to share their experience in a dynamic set of circumstances that simply do not give up. We see all the above and, finally, the joy, in the powerful interpretations of the main actors and the rest of the cast, making this film an absolute treasure for the spectators. <br /> <br /> In a film as well made as It is usually difficult to find something special, but the representation of Sandy Travis by Sigourney Weaver was outstanding. I would be surprised if others did not recognize him as such. <br /> <br /> Clearly a 10. Well done!
