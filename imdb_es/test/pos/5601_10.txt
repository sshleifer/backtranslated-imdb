The promise that Martin Donovan would play Jesus was honestly enough for me to see the movie. Definitely worth it; Intelligent and fun without exaggeration. Low-quality filming was probably an appropriate effect but it ended up being a bit too jarring, and the ending sounded more like a PBS program than Hartley. Still, too many memorable lines and great moments for him to judge it harshly.
