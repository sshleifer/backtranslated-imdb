DRIVING LESSONS is a small movie that surprises you. What at first seems to be a bit of fluffy and meaningless comedy, British style is based on a very good story about the coming of age and the need for a meaningful friendship of both young and old. The writer Jeremy Brock ('Mrs. Brown', 'Charlotte Gray', 'The Last King of Scotland') directs his own script and the result is a cohesive one, which includes a story full of fascinating and diverse characters, each one interpreted by actors of the first. . <br /> <br /> Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint, who stands firm as a developing actor in the 'Harry Potter' series) is a small poetic seventeen-year-old who lives with his bird observing Father Vicario ( Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive compulsive, rigid, evangelical and good mother (Laura Linney) in a home where "people in need," like the murderous transvestite Mr. Fincham (Jim Norton), have priority over family matters: By the way, the mother has an affair with the priest Peter (Oliver Milburn), and uses Ben as her cover! The sad Ben is among other things trying to learn to drive a car. His mother is a poor teacher and decides that he needs professional lessons and needs to get a job to help pay for poor Fincham's needs. Ben follows an ad and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters), an elderly actress who is as crazy as any created character. She hires Ben and the fireworks start. Through a series of incidents, including a camping trip that Evie demands they take, the two learn the lessons of life that are lost to each other: Ben learns to respect himself and himself, and Evie finds a true friend that will allow you to leave your dazzling facade and be the beloved human being who has been hiding. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, who always offers the best acting skills in every character she creates, finds a role like no other here: she's incredibly wild and adorable. Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for the challenged coming of age, Ben. The chemistry between the two is as delicate as that of the classic film "Harold and Maude." Laura Linney is, as always, an excellent actress who plays a very different role from her usual repertoire. And the cast is a panorama of fine characterizations. This film is a pleasant surprise and one of which will ensure warmth the heart and entertain those who love good writing, direction, acting and the message. Harp grady
