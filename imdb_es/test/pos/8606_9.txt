Black Rain, by Shohei Imamaura, was launched in 1989 just at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, a fact that gives the film about the slow deterioration of the victims of Hiroshima radiation an additional sensation. The black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash, radioactive fallout and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion. There have been other books and movies about the launch of the atomic bomb, but none so unique and powerful as this one. Based on a Masuji Ibuse novel that collected information from interviews and diaries of real-life bomb victims, the film shows how a whole family is psychologically and physically affected by the bomb years after the original explosion. It is a horrible sight, but one that resonates with deep compassion for humanity. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 when soldiers and civilians perform their normal daily activities. Suddenly, a blinding light comes on and you hear a thunderous explosion. Almost all buildings are destroyed or damaged without the possibility of repair. The first atomic bomb dropped on a city is now part of history. The survivors must restart their lives in some way, without realizing the devastating effects of the bomb. Shot in high contrast in black and white, the story centers on Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka), a young woman who is caught in the radioactive rain when her ship returns to the city to look for friends and family. In Hiroshima, Imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us: a boy with skin hanging from his body begs his brother to recognize him, an older man is crying because of his inability to free his son from piles of rubble, a mother is tormented as she rocks the blackened body of her son. <br /> <br /> When the family returns to their rural home, Yasuko's life changes forever. She sees her friends dying around her and awaits the inevitable attacks of radiation sickness that have already affected her uncle Shigematsu Shimuza (Kazuo Kitamura) and Aunt Shigeko Shimuza (Etsuko Ichihara). Pretending there are only business as usual, the family denies that the bomb has affected Yasuko. "He forgot how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed, they all forgot, they forget the hell of the fires and attend rallies as an annual festival, I'm sick of it," says Katayama, a friend (Akiji Kobayashi). Yasuko internalizes the tragedy, feeling ashamed for being different from others and guilty for being contaminated. <br /> <br /> When her aunt and uncle try to find her a husband, the eligible men refuse to marry her because of suspicions about her. Health, even though Shigematsu has copied his diary to prove that he was not directly exposed to the bomb. The only suitor with whom he feels comfortable is another injured man, Yuichi (Keisuke Ishida), who suffers a panic attack every time he hears the roar of an engine. In the end, the beauty of life is so fleeting when Yasuko goes to the pond and sees a show that he has been longing for all his life, the real carp jumping in the water, playfully enough to say that beyond despair exists. still joy Unfortunately we heard in the radio statements of politicians about the use of the bomb once again in the Korean War. "Human beings do not learn anything," says Shigematsu. "They strangle themselves, unjust peace is better than a war of justice, why can not they see?" We hope that Black Rain from Immamura has allowed us all to see more clearly.
