The first time I saw this movie when I was a teenager (now I'm over 40), I have considered it my favorite movie for a long time. The story is enormously moving, without being sentimental. The performance, especially by March and Loy, is dead. And the fact that Dana Andrews is too old for her role does not take away the credibility of her romance with Theresa Wright (who I think is the only important character in the movie who still lives). This might have turned out to be another post-war melodrama, but the script and the cast are simply too good for that to happen.
