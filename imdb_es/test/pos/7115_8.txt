This temperamental and spooky horror film begins in a castle on top of a cliff overlooking the sea, an ideal setting, in which a vampire bat enters and crawls towards a sleeping doctor (Onslow Stevens). The bat becomes a man known as Baron Latos, actually Count Dracula (John Carradine). Seek the help of Dr. Edelmann to cure him of his vampirism. Finally, the good doctor also wants to help his hunchback nurse assistant (Jane Adams), Wolf Man (Lon Chaney) and the monster Frankenstein (Glenn Strange). But Dracula's tricks contaminate the doctor's blood, and he himself becomes a Jekyll / Hyde vampire. This is somewhat better than the "Frankenstein House" of the previous year, as it is less episodic and more visually exciting. There is a disturbing scene in which Dracula tries to attract the second nurse (Martha O'Driscoll) to his world, where he is initially playing "Moonlight Sonata" on the piano, which soon gives way to a terrifying music. Principal Erle Kenton uses expressionist shadows and mysterious music to frame many sequences, including a wonderful montage sequence that the studio often used in its horror features. Two interpreters stand out: Stevens, with his wonderful voice, is at first sympathetic and then convincingly threatening. Adams, his beautiful face in alarming contrast with his twisted body, shows great pathos and sympathy. Everything ends in a slam-bang climax, typical of the universal horror of 1940, a bit abrupt, with images taken from "The Ghost of Frankenstein" (1942). I hope Universal releases it soon on DVD (it was left out of its double-feature releases).
