Someone went through this movie as a "waste of time" because he expected the "beautiful landscape of Brazil and Portugal", but then everything seemed "washed" or somber, or something similar. I think this person missed the whole part of the movie. This is the reality. The objective of this film is to show that life is not, in fact, ideal, and to show what people spend in their lives for family, love and survival. A young man leaves his neighborhood in Sao Paulo, Brazil, to go to Portugal to visit his mother's country of origin after his death. Discover that not everything is free, and that the natives of Portugal disdain the Brazilians. Eventually he finds a life, a love, but the story does not end as expected and this is not a story of "fairy tale". The part that attracted me most was the final song, "Zeca Bailero (Honey Baby)" by Gal Costa. It fits very well with the movie; Especially the end.
