I found this film nice and immersive to watch, and I'm surprised it has such a low rating. Actually I can see why it is; I imagine that it is the fans of Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano who have given most of the 1s and 2s, because if you put the tape in the machine hoping to enjoy seeing something of these two or both, then you could be quite disappointed. Eric appears for about half an hour towards the end of the movie, and Alyssa for about 5 scenes in the second half, and in those he says little and uses less (although never naked if that's what you're looking for, stay with the hug). of the vampire). Although it's always a pleasure, it's a shame that she, or Eric, does not have a lot of screen time, but I still give her an 8. <br /> <br />
