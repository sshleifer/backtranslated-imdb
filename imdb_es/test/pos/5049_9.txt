To qualify my use of "realistic" in the summary, not many older people I know pretend to be famous teachers, blind people, etc., and I've never been an older person. Leaving aside these minor problems, the relationships between the characters in this film and the emotions expressed in it were completely realistic and genuine. In fact, although we are not yet 30 years old, I could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife. For those who do not die young (there is a great line in the film about this, when the two best friends talk about dying young, and one of them says: and paraphrasing, we lost our chance). We'll have to put up with it), we'll all be where these characters are someday. I know that many viewers would prefer to be dragged * away * from reality instead of being "confronted" with it, but even they can enjoy the sweet reminder of our mortality, and the importance of living life to the fullest. what this movie is.
