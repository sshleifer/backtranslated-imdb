Another horror of the hand means another dividing film that the fans have yet to seek and decide. <br /> <br /> Imagine a cross between The Blair Witch Project and The Grudge and you are close to the general. Content of this movie. It is another horror recorded on video, but this time most of it is edited together for the preparation of a doc video that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared. <br /> <br /> I certainly had a sense of dread while watching this movie (does anyone do it better than our Asian friends?), but the spooky moments, the really scary moments, were sadly a little less and further away from what I expected. I also felt that I was two or three steps ahead of the researcher when apparent "revelations" appeared at all times, so I certainly can not recommend this as much as [Rec]. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it would be remiss of me not to recommend any film that extends over ectoplasmic worms, contains at least two moments of subtly spooky ghosts and made sure I had to turn on the lights again for a time when the sun went down. br /> <br /> Check it out if you've been enjoying some of the latest genre releases lately. And the end is a scrawny one. <br /> <br /> Check this out if you like: The Last Broadcast, Pulse, Angel Heart.
