I watched this movie last night on HBO and I did not expect to be hooked. I usually fall asleep when I see HBO. But it happened and you will too. It is a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner) about the murder of an elderly tourist in Jacksonville, Florida, and the investigation, arrest and trial of a 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie today and get A feeling of how we have progressed as a society. This film was the most deserving of an esteemed Oscar: they will move you to tears.
