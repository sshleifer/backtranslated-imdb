I saw this at the BendFilm Festival on Friday in the midst of a multitude of unresolved people, without the help of a bad decision from the event planners, who chose a totally inappropriate short film to precede the film. And it really threw the audience when Modern Love emerged after a light and capricious short (name I forget). <br /> <br /> People !!! It was really silly to mix this short with Modern Love, which is a serious dramatic film. A movie of cinema. <br /> <br /> Then the audience gets the teaser which is a comedy and then ... Modern Love. Hmmmm Modern Love, despite my reservations (strange ending, a little too tangential) needed a short film according to its strangeness, so my advice to programmers for next year is to be more careful when planning the program. <br /> <br /> The people who watch Modern Love really just did not know what hit them, they were guided along the way and this is not their fault. <br /> <br /> Modern Love has some excellent performances that play well against the tangential meanders of the film: a film that its creator seems to have "surprised out loud" instead of running in the normal way it is recorded and record a movie. <br /> <br /> Too bad the public was misinformed. Incorrect session location, incorrect short film, incorrect approach by well-intentioned programmers, who, despite good efforts, need to watch many more films and travel to other festivals.
