The Coen brothers have done it again. Three convicts from the depression era (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) escape a Mississippi gang and head for a buried treasure that will finance their new lives. On the way, they sing on the radio and become highly sought after stars, as well as fugitives. Great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson / introduction to bluegrass music. <br /> <br /> Clooney is outstanding as Ulysses Everett McGill, who speaks fast and has a fast pace. Holly Hunter plays her ex-wife. Turturro and Nelson are perfect discs. They are also in the cast John Goodman and Charles Durning. <br /> <br /> Dan Tyminksi offers the singing voice of George Clooney in "I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow", the song Soggy Bottom Boys that serves as a template for the bluegrass loaded soundtrack that also features Alison Krauss , Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch. Kicking the toe, fun of slaps on the knee for the whole family. You will be surprised how relaxed and fun this movie is.
