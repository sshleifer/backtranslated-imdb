"Do not Torture a Duckling" is one of the best Italian horror movies I've seen, and I've seen my part. Calling it giallo is a bit misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more like a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Complete with one of the most brutal and bloody scenes in such an ancient film, Fulci's twisted, revolving film oozes a spooky atmosphere and an old-school Italian vibe. The setting is perfect: an old Italian town. The music is ridiculously perfect. The ending is genuine and original. <br /> <br /> After watching "Do not torture a duckling", you really have to wonder how Fulci's later things got so bad. I like all his things, but he deviated. Maybe he thought he had already done it ... Because with this movie, he hits the bullseye. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who thinks that Dario Argento is the owner of the genre Giallo. Fulci defeats him with this one. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10, children.
