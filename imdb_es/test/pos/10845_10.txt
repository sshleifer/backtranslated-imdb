Over the weekend I watched the movie Tipping the Velvet and, if I had to rate this 100 movie, I would have to give it 100 without asking any questions. I am a true believer in true love and this movie moved me in many different ways and the actors fit in the parts without any problem. But I have to say that the end was not so good because I did not see that spark in Nancys' eyes when she looked into Flo's eyes, since every time she looked at Kitty, Kitty just had to be in the room or in the thought Nancy and Nancy would simply shine with that spark. Kitty told Nancy that he could not find her and that he looked for her, but he could not find her. Kitty was ready to give up everything to get Nancy back. In Kitty's eyes you could see Kitty's pain. I think Nancy should have let Kitty see that her love is true and strong and that she would not let her go that easy. You must be part two and have the two do it together, but you must not allow anyone else to play the roles that the real Kitty & Nancy has to be or it will never work. My mother once told me that true love is not real. I'm not stupid. I know we all have a true love somewhere waiting for each one of us and I believe with my life that Nancy's true love is really only Kitty's true love and Kitty's is just Nancy. Come on, let's play the game the right way, the only way. Let Nancy's eyes shine again ... Kitty lost everything, losing Nancy. And Kitty is not the only one to blame. I am gay and being gay is not easy !! AWAKE!!! in 1889 he would not want to be gay, Kitty got deeply lost inside herself and in 1889 maybe the right thing to do was marry a man. Even if you love a woman. Kitty needed Nancy to cope, she needed Nancy to fight for her. I remember how much I loved this girl and let her escape because I thought I was doing something wrong and I went back with my ex boyfriend. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I know I was wrong to leave it and I'll pay for the rest of my days, because like Kitty I could not find it anywhere. I heard that she is married to a man in the United States somewhere. I even heard that he hits her. I guess in the end we both lose. Give the two girls one more chance, life can be very lonely if you are not sincere with yourself and your loved one. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Kristen Ann
