My colleagues were surprised to discover that this movie was a documentary. It was so funny that it seemed to be written, but it offers a moving picture of real life in the life of independent cinema. We felt moved to buy Coven and we wanted to meet Mark and Mike. As college students, this film gave us a much-needed view of real life.
