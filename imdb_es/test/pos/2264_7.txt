In the United States, Jewish Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) collects personal belongings of his family to remember. A few moments before he dies, his grandmother gives him an old photograph of his grandfather with a woman named Agustín in the Ukraine. Jonathan gets in touch with Odessa Heritage Tours, a family agency in Ukraine, to guide him to the place where the photograph was taken to find Agustín, and together with the interpreter Alex (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather and a strange dog, they travel in an old car that looks for the lost past of the family of Jonathan. <br /> <br /> "Everything Is Illuminated" is a strange movie about a young stranger with the compulsive behavior of collecting memories of his family so as not to forget them looking for his grandfather's past to understand how his life could be if his Grandpa had not moved to the United States. This strange vegetarian character meets a dysfunctional Ukrainian family that owns an amateur travel agency specializing in helping Jews find missing relatives, and together they make an almost surreal road trip through the country of Ukraine. The film begins as a comedy, with a sarcastic black humor, and ends in a moving and tragic drama recommended for specific audiences. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Uma Enlightened Life" ("An Illuminated Life")
