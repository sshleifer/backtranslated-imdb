This is a romantic comedy, so it's really a fairytale, but unconventional. Cinderella, instead of living in the ashes, lives in an over-decorated castle in the suburbs with a handsome husband who is not a prince. She finds her prince, but he is not so handsome. Instead of a castle, at least initially, he gets a little walk in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> Pfeifer, Stockwell and Ruehl lead a cast of completely accomplished characters, albeit a bit exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Demme achieves the highest level of movie making in my mind. He creates a world I want to move to: a Manhattan neighborhood and a life on the street full of life and community. <br /> <br /> I wish that the IMDb is linked to the other comments of the critics. I would like to know what other movies the people who criticized this hate. I'm always looking for lots of laughs and nice places to "live" for at least an hour.
