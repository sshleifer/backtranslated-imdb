'In The Line Of Fire' tells the story of the game between a former presidential bodyguard and a former government assassin turned into a psychopath. The secret service agent / bodyguard (Eastwood) is on defense and the assassin (Malkovich) is in attack. The bets? The president is alive. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie ... I've seen it several times on TV and I've recently bought it on DVD. However, it is not an excellent movie. The plot is too thin and attempts to swell it are downright ridiculous. The whole love story is not very plausible and the way they incorporated an additional character into the story, just to be able to kill it is an insult to the more or less intelligent viewer. Although I feel that these mistakes can not be forgiven, I can easily look at the excellent performance of Mr. Malkovich. I have always considered him a great actor, but in this film he is really on fire. There is a reason why he won an Academy Award nomination. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were fine, but I do not think his performance is memorable. They are never in the best of their abilities. <br /> <br /> If you do not wait too long, you will surely like this movie. It is not a masterpiece, but John Malkovich is really extraordinary and I do not think anyone can enjoy his performance. It really is worth the watch ...
