It is possible that Ghoulies IV is not the best of the series, but it is not so bad. If you do not take it seriously, you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Peter Liapis come back as Johnathan Graves, who stopped using magic and became a Detective, but still thinks about what happened in Ghoulies. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a woman named Alexandra who is Johnathan's ex-girlfriend who breaks into a museum and takes a red gem, using the gem she wakes up her boyfriend named Faust, which is the dark side of Johnathan, but he needs the gem so he can enter the real world and John is sent to hell. <br /> <br /> Something goes wrong and Alex loses the gem so he needs to find a new one, since he leaves the entrance door still open and two little Ghoulies called Lite and Drak appear. They are not the real Ghoulies since they look like men in a Troll costume and wear a mask, but that does not matter, since they are comical in some places. <br /> <br /> Lite and Dark need to find Johnathan since he can return them home to cause chaos while they try to find Johnathan. Another difference is that the two Ghoulies are the good ones, unlike those of the previous films. <br /> <br /> I found that Ghoulies IV are good, but this movie may not be for everyone, check it out if you like Budget movies like Troll 2.
