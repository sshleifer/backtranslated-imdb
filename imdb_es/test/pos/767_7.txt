Ben Marshall, a teenager of religious origin, realizes the financial situation of his home by his dominant mother Laura. She suggests that you find a temporary job to contribute to the home. In fact, the family has taken a widower, to deal with them. Robert Marshall, the father, is a pastor in the local church; I would rather be in the country observing birds than attending to the souls entrusted to their church. <br /> <br /> Ben's job is with a major actress, Evie Walton, who wants him to do things for her. around the house. "Give me" Evie, as she calls herself, is a woman of a certain age whose career has died maybe because she was not so good. In fact, the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera that was popular, but he preferred to forget about it. Evie, who is a compulsive liar, tells Ben that she is dying, only to conveniently forget it, later when she clarifies the child. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Ben is amazed at the bigger personality than his employer's life. He has been taking driving classes. Evie asks him to take a camping trip, what he does against his better judgment. He knows that this will provoke his mother's fury. Not content with that, Evie decides to go to Edinburgh, where she has been invited to read at an art festival. It is this journey that solidifies your bond. Ben gets to know and savor the pleasures of meat with a friendly Bryony. <br /> <br /> When Ben returns, everything collapses at home. His mother, who has been having an affair with a parishioner, decides to leave the family in favor of the young man with whom he has been having an affair. Ben and Evie's relationship survives the test of time. He also begins to see his own father in a different light. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Brock, the writer of "Driving Lessons" and other memorable English films, takes his first job as a director with this sexy comedy. The mixture of show and religion, loyalty and friendship, is explored in its screen treatment, which makes it a fun moment in the cinema. We have seen the similar situation before as in "Billy Elliott," where Julie Walters plays a breeding role with a younger man. We had read that the film was based on Mr. Brock's own experience while working with Dame Peggy Ashcroft when he was young. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, who plays Evie Walton, is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie. She always delivers. Ms. Walters is a welcome presence in any movie that appears and works wonders with her fake "lady". Laura Linney, a luminous player, does not understand our sympathy for her icy mother. Rupert Grint, famous for his Harry Potter films, plays Ben, the young man who sees in Evie a kind soul. Nicholas Farrell is the betrayed father. Michelle Duncan has a small role in which she shines.
