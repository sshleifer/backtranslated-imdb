The almost marvelous mix of comedy, romance and medical chaos has a 50-year-old doctor, tired of going to rock concerts with nubile airheads, dating a patient of his age whom he met in his rounds. The script by Julius Epstein shows a great deal of sophistication, although he does not have enough material to complete the last third of the image, and you can almost feel the film slip. The secondary argument about the hospital's investigation for its poorly done business was not satisfactorily resolved, and in any case it feels highly elaborated. However, Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are an excellent team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney are very funny in their support. The director Howard Zieff makes everything explode, and even when Epstein's phrases feel that Neil Simon rejects him, Zieff advances happily. The results are dryly attractive and, at times, quite sweet. Followed by a failed television series. *** since ****
