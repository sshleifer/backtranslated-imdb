Although this film is among the sophisticated upper English classes, it is a simple story of a couple divided in two. It has a somewhat antiquated air, being an adaptation of "A Way Through the Wood", a 1950 novel by Nigel Balchin (which was hugely popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes, who despite a prize from the academy for the script of "Gosford Park", has a somewhat anachronistic person, wrote the script and directed it (the latter for the first time). With the DVD version that I saw, there is a more enlightening audio commentary by Julian. His main focus was getting his characters to be well, and in general he has achieved it. This was helped by two outstanding performances by Tom Wilkinson as James, the city attorney, and Emily Watson as his attractive wife Anne. He also kept it short; The execution time is only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> James and Anne have a house in Chelsea and a former comfortable vicarage in Buckinghamshire. Anne is some years younger but they do not have children. Apparently, they seem happy, but James, one of nature's moralists (something unusual for a city lawyer), is a control freak. Just along the way is the aristocratic the Hon. William Buel, who is not of the moral of the middle class, and is more than happy to take advantage. But there is a complication, a road accident, in which a Range Rover hit by a rural road is run over by a Range Rover like the Hon. From Bill Soon James, Anne, Bill and the widow of the victim (who are the cleaners of James and Anne) are attracted by a conspiracy to hide what really happened. The main focus is on the corrosive effect of all this in the relationship of James and Anne. <br /> <br /> The third person in this menagerie, Bill, is played by Rupert Everett. From the point of view of the cast, its languid and superior way is suitable for the part, but somehow it does not manage to get there. In part, this is because he is supposed to be sick for some time and looks good when he is supposed to be sick, and vice versa. The part seems underdeveloped. It is interesting that John Neville, like Bill's father, who only has one significant scene, manages to establish his character beautifully in the time he has. <br /> <br /> The world of five-star hotels and superior restaurants is very well evoked. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary, these people can convince themselves that the Edwardian era still exists. In the background, however, the film is about what unites a couple and what tears them apart. Nigel Balchin was going through a marriage breakup when he wrote the book, and Fellowes has made a good fist to convey the atmosphere. As he says, his is a pretty free adaptation, but the central theme is the same.
