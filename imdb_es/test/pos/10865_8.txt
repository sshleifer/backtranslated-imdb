I started to see this waiting for the worst, I was glad to discover that the movie turned out to be nice, a bit confusing in some places, like when all the justs started singing. It gave me the opportunity to see Daniel Wu in action for the first time, he's a better actor than I thought, at times he seemed a little out of place. I thought the Purple Storm deserves its release from Hong Kong legends, since it's different from most other Hong Kong movies, it's about a man's emotional problems when faced with memory loss, it may sound cheesy, but when he finally discovers what and who he really is, he really makes the movie much more interesting. Once you get into the movie, you will find that it keeps you attached to it, as if you lacked a bit, then a lot of the movie will make sense, for example, I lost a bit at the beginning and recommend to anyone who sees this. Do not miss it. So I can say that it was worth watching this movie and a pleasant surprise for me, that I enjoyed it.
