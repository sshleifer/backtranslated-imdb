Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939, but by then, almost all of Europe had fallen under the advance of the Nazi war machine. When entering the war, Great Britain began virtually from scratch, with few supplies and with an air force that was outnumbered ten in one in Germany. But the will of the British was firm, emboldened by his new prime minister, Winston Churchill, who declared: "We will never sink". <br /> <br /> On August 8, 1940, the Battle for Great Britain began. However, for the first time since the declared position of Hitler to conquer the world, it hit a wall. Although massively outnumbered, the British Royal Air Force went on the offensive, and in the span of twenty-eight days in September and October 1940, the German Luftwaffe casualties went up to 2,330 lost aircraft and crew. Hitler's anger was boiling, but he had to wait a moment. Responding later in the year, Hitler launched a huge fire bombardment in London on Christmas Day of 1940. When I say that there has never been a disaster film to rival the live live images of London in flames during this assault, it would be an underestimation Perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter in the series "Why we fight" would be to see British citizens emerge from their underground shelters after the bombings to resume what was left of their life on the surface. Even as you look, there is no way to understand the living horror that these people had to go through, since the city of London was practically in ruins. <br /> <br /> However, the Nazis were also stunned and blocked. Everything that Hitler wanted to believe about freedom and democracy was now turning on his head. Instead of being weak and complacent like the French, the British would not surrender without a fight. And they fought, they took the air battle to Germany and they responded with the attacks on the German homeland. It was a turning point, forcing Hitler to reconsider his strategy.
