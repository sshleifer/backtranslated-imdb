From a simple description of the main elements of THE TOLL GATE, one might think that it is a Western revisionist of the 60s or 70s. <br /> <br /> * Our hero is a thief, a murderer and an arsonist; <br /> <br /> * the love interest is a single mother whose husband without a shift left her and her son; <br /> <br /> * Twice our criminal hero is "unofficially" released by the authorities in exchange for a good deed, and this is presented as a laudable act; <br /> <br /> * the only acts that are presented as truly evil are the betrayal of the family and the betrayal of a criminal associate; <br /> <br /> * the hero tries to go straight, but returns to a life of crime after he can not get a job; <br /> <br /> * the hero is running away from the sheriff's gang and a criminal gang; <br /> <br /> * the final redemption of the hero is done by strangling a man with his own hands and throwing his body on a cliff; <br /> <br /> * and the "good bad man" ends the movie by sending the young mother and her son to civilization and riding alone into the Mexican desert, never (probably) to pay for their life of crime. <br /> <br /> It's just going to show you that there is nothing new under the sun. <br /> <br /> Of course, THE TOLL GATE does not show up at all. Cynicism or moral nihilism of his successors. : The redemption of the hero is established when he surrenders to the gang after reading a passage from the Bible. I can not imagine Clint Eastwood doing that. <br /> <br /> THE TOLL GATE is an excellent movie by any standard, and Hart was a very good actor, not given to the broad histrionics that is often used to convey emotions in the days. Before the sound. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
