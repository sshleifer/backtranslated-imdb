This, ladies and gentlemen, is truly a modern B-movie. The dialogue is forced and delivered with wooden rigidity, the premise is predictable (there are some decent turns) and the characters are still 2D in most cases. And yet there is a certain ... charm. The WWE wrestler Kane gives life to the sick and twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos (although it looks like his character who has been playing for about ten years), so I find it quite funny when people say that "It's not much of a reach for him," but Glen Jacobs is, apparently, quite nice, so it really is. In any case, he is perfectly chosen as the great beast and the deaths are adequately above (Jason would be proud), but I heard at least four jumps of applause for four scenes of different murders. Enter frankly in this movie thinking you'll have a little fun and a gorefest, oh, it's quite the gorefest. The R rating is well deserved and I actually had a bit of nausea during some of the more graphic moments. In any case, a very, very funny movie, but quite bad.
