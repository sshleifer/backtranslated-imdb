Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One) gives us an exciting film in which the awards go to the supporting actor, John Malkovich. His criminal attempt to assassinate the president was first class and credible. <br /> <br /> That does not diminish the efforts of Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo, or even Fred Dalton Thompson, who plays a real imbecile of a target. Chief of Cabinet of the house. Eastwood was great, and I love any movie that Russo is in. <br /> <br /> The film features original five-time Oscar-winning music (Mal√®na, Bugsy, The Untouchables, The Mission, Days of Heaven) Ennio Morricone. That alone makes it worth your time.
