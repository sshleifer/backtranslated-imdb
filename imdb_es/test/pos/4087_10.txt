Like some people here, I love / love the Stingers! In Norway it was issued much later. That also means we're in episode 176. (yes, that's right) I have to say that I really love the Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. The stingers could be the series (with the exception of Gray's Anatomy) that I really see! The actors are incredible! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personally I think that she is one of the best accesses we have! I know it's not like SUPER-known, but she's really a great actress! The stings make me want to be a policeman! I love! <br /> <br /> P.S: Do you know if you can buy the episodes?
