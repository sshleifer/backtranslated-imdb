I'm a big fan of this movie and I found the mini-television series "Children of The Dust," the version that fans should look for. At least 20 minutes or more are cut in the DVD version of this movie. <br /> <br /> I would also suggest to viewers who enjoyed this movie that they see the book. There is a more complete story with Corby / Whitewolf and Rachel. , more about Black History and Buffalo Solders. There were two many stories for the series or this movie. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier only shows that it improves with age, the talent keeps growing in the chemistry between her character Gypsy Smith and Regina Taylor who were wonderful. I also enjoyed the story of Billy Wirth / Joanna Going, who seem to play well with each other. <br /> <br /> Billy Wirth is, of course, the "Indian Vision Model". The look, the attitude, the dream of every woman who wanted to be taken in one of those romantic novels by a native hero. I also worked for myself. <br /> <br /> Much more could have been done with this story, but it gave the viewer a brief glimpse of racial problems in the 1880s, the takeover of whites by whites, lack of black pioneers to set up cities in the west. Michael Moriarty (Maxwell), as always, a great actor is presented as a very affectionate and confused teacher, not sure if the "whites" should interfere with the native culture. <br /> <br /> For anyone who enjoys the characters and sees them Change this movie is for you. I thought that the chemistry between the character of Poitier and that of the orphan Whitewolf was very moving and he thought that Wirth and Poitier worked very well together. Billy Wirth did some of his best scenes when he works with Poitier. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you make me nervous when you just want to stop and shake her or give her a "wake up and grow up" call. But overall, it was a great night of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Look for the two-tape version of this mini series. If you are a fan, you will really see the difference.
