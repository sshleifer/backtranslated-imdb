Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is nothing but shots and fights, but it has a very good plot of vampires! For people who say they do not shoot and fight fights as they usually do. Well, this is really hard! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really great in the movie. Nicholas Guest was also very good and possibly steals the show! He really plays like a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think this very pretty actress is very underestimated. Michael Cavanaugh was good. It was great to see Vince Murdocco in this movie! As for the action, it's really impressive with all the gun fights and the super cool fight scenes. The fight in this photo is really one of the best I've seen! There is so much happening in the 86 minute run time. For fans of the action, they will be impressed by all the firepower and the excellent fight that this film has to offer! Night Hunter is a movie that is not easy to locate and if you are in a video store and you see it for sale, buy it because this movie is a great guardian and, besides, the box is great! There is a lot of action that you have to see to believe! Look and see if you can find good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com Z-Shops and Market Place Sellers! In my opinion, Night Hunter is one of the best fighting movies I've seen and the characters are so neat. If you like Don 'The Dragon' Wilson and you want to see Nicholas Guest in a great performance, then I strongly recommend to any action movie fan who loves movies, vampire fights and vampire fights, and who has been disappointed by other movies that have Â¡Watch a real action movie without stopping, but do not deliver it to get and buy Night Hunter today!
