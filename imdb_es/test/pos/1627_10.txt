I was excited at the opening to hear part of "Chevaliers De Sangreal" but I wanted more, so I bought that piece from Hans Zimmer. Possibly the 4 most inspiring and beautiful music minutes ever written! This film is an exciting masterpiece of suspense, even without religious considerations. You have the opportunity to tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. The opening in the CERN where the "Particle of God" is created or the greater amount of Antimatter with AWESOME images is an immediate track that predicts the excellence of this film. Who does not love Hanks? The story and the twists in this movie are excellent and are well drawn to the incredibly twisted climax. This film suggests a satisfactory compromise between science and religion, although many closed heads will persist on both sides. "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind". A.Einstein
