I'm not sure I've seen a black Denamark comedy before, but this is pretty good actually. The humor is adequately discreet and inexpressive to accompany some of the frightful activities. Svend and Bjarne are tired of working for their boss, because he is always repressing them (in fact, he mentions that they were not smart enough to decompress them before urinating at any given moment). They do what they have to do to open their own butcher shop and when a worker accidentally locks himself in the fridge at night while turning on a light, they find something that makes their butcher shop much more popular than that of their old boss. In fact, he was the one who sold his first "steaks", and it's partly his fault, since he served them at a Rotary dinner at his house and the guests talked about it and they showed up at Svend and Bjarnes the next day . Bjarne is somewhat horrified by what Svend has done, but it does not stop there. Svend has risen above his small and sad existence to be someone of certain popularity that is new to him and does not want to leave that aside, so the freezer continues to fill with all kinds of acquaintances (and, at a given moment , "A little Swedish park"). However, suspicions arise because former chief Holger believes that something is wrong. Bjarne is also obsessed with his twin brother Eigil, who lived in a sanatorium for years in a coma and to whom Bjarne wanted the plug removed so he could get the inheritance money to help open the store. When Eigil was removed from the respirator, it was revived, much to Bjarne's horror. And Bjarne also has a great interest in Astrid, who works in the cemetery. Neither Svend nor Bjarne are well-adjusted individuals, so things start to get out of control. The deadpan humor really does this, and although this is not exactly material to laugh out loud, it's certainly fun. However, it is somewhat creepy if you consider the cuts of meat and parts of the body that meet by chance, especially because these two take everything so clear. If you are a fan of black comedies, this is recommended, I liked it quite well. 8 out of 10.
