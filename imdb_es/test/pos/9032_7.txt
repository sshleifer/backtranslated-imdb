A very powerful drama from the small southern town of Faulkner that deals with the murder of an innocent black man by a local resident. A striking cinematography and a good narrative (through a flashback) take us through the difficult relationship between the suspect and the son of his lawyer. A still powerful story that precedes Sidney Poitier's films about racial prejudice. Porter Hall has a great role as the father of the murdered man. Trivia: This was actually filmed in the hometown of Faulkner, Oxford, Mississippi, and many of the residents were used as extras.
