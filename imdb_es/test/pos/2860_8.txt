Nurse Betty is really an interesting movie. I suppose we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in a telenovela are real, that they can not be explained by any means that they are only actors and not real people. <br /> <br /> 'Nurse Betty is not a nurse at all. In real life, she is an ordinary housewife who works in a restaurant. To escape from her terrible husband and the problems in her miserable life, she has become a dedicated fan of a telenovela. After she witnessed the murder of her husband, she suffers a kind of shock and loses all control over reality. She believes that she is in love with one of the telenovela's characters, a doctor, and decides that she will visit him and form a family with him. However, the hit men think that she knows too much and they are chasing her to kill her. <br /> <br /> As I said, the subject is quite recognizable (if you leave the professional assassins and the murder is left out). ) and the movie was funny. The story was well directed and the actors did a good job. He had everything he always wanted to see when he saw a comedy. I give it a 7.5 / 10.
