This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite horror films! I really can not believe it did not gain much more popularity when it was released, especially when the main contenders at that time were the sequels and the horrors of Wes Craven's usual magnet, Mute Witness has all the style, suspense and twists of the fire plot Fast of a Hitchcock / DePalma Movie, along with a very sharp black comedy and a great plot. It never promises to be more than a good movie of popcorn and hot-dog, but it's hard not only to enjoy the movie for what it is. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on Billie Hughes, a silent girl working on the set of a horror film that is being made in a Russian factory. Due to a series of events, she is accidentally caught and stumbles upon the filming of a snuff film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the movie is the lack of screaming that seems to invade all horror. movie never made. Since the main character is silent, he can not make noise, something that is a blessing in some stages of the film and a curse in others. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have studied his Hitchcock very well, Even the opening scene is a gesture of contempt both to Hitchcock's "Psycho" and to the rather generic slasher movie scenes. <br /> <br /> While acting can sometimes be absurd, the whole movie sustains it. together, not only throwing a couple of excellent scenes that place him right on the edge of his seat, but also some small questions about how the film will end. <br /> <br /> In short, a Psycho-thriller greatly overlooked, with rhythm and full of action, I would recommend to any jaded spectator to look for something a little different from the usual regurgitation of Freddy / Jason / Scream / Michael Myers / Damien in Hallowe'en.
