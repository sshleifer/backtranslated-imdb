It may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> This is just a good movie. A lot of silly good things to laugh about. However, do not watch the TV version, they cut too much. Dom Deluise is quite impressive as the mobster Don, who is hired to kill Robin. All I can say about his ten minutes: it's a long drive from Jersey. You should also love them when reviewing the script to make sure Robin has another chance. Also: 12th Century Fox. <br /> <br /> Anything bad? The rappers at the beginning and at the end seem quite outdated. The songs were pretty lame. Once, while watching this movie, I could think a few more times when they could have thrown another joke or two. <br /> <br /> In general, however, a pleasant movie experience. A must for fans of comedy.
