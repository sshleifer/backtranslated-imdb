Although Bullet In The Brain is, without a doubt, superior among short films, it largely seems more like a short writing than a movie. And it is a bit difficult to feel sorry for the teacher when his intelligent comments make him shoot. But after the bullet enters his brain, we begin to understand a little about why he had got so tired of life in the first place. There is a tremendous amount of detail in this reasonably short movie and this is what makes me feel that it should have expanded a bit; There seems to be almost too much to assimilate at once, as the details come flying towards you. Quick. A slightly more relaxed pace and a less angry narrator in the final section would have benefited this film a bit. Despite these complaints, it can not be denied that Bullet In The Brain is a pretty great job compared to many short films, and even long-term. Creators should be applauded for trying to make a film so basically emotional and literate in the current climate of quick jokes and Hollywood action.
