The trio is a pleasant and nostalgic journey towards that first hint of desire, when it was still a simple exploration of the unknown, before we "grew" and added those complexities of HIV status, emotional baggage and that we had to run . -pager-just-go-off-off in the emotional mix. <br /> <br /> The anguish represented is pure adolescent anguish, but it sounds true in all three stories. Your sweetness and positivity make you feel good that you are gay. And those kinds of movies are very few. <br /> <br /> Good news! Both Boys Life and Boys Life 2 are now available on DVD as of September 1999.
