A photographer from the small town of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness, but downplays his family and friends. We never discovered the nature of the disease, but the main focus of Hur Jin-ho's moving first film, Christmas in August, is not his illness. It is the grace with which he leads his life, his ability to accept what life has reserved without remorse. Unfortunately, it was the last film filmed by cinematographer Yoo Young-kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. <br /> <br /> The photographer, Jung-won, is played by Han Suk-kyu, At one point, the most popular star in Korea. A handsome man in his late twenties with a contagious laugh, is so warm and full of vitality that it is hard to imagine it as the end of life. Jung-won owns a small photography store and lives at home with his hearing impaired father (Goo Shin) and his sister (Oh Ji-hye), teaching his father to play films in the VCR and writing instructions for let him take care of him Your store if you were to die. While Jung-won deals with the day-to-day business of putting his affairs in order, Dar-im (Shim Eun-ha), a meter reader, enters his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements. <Br /> <br /> Abrupt and impatient, he treats her with disdain, but then he apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without the open expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is your base to be, the place where you come from. To protect Dar-im from suffering, Jung-won does not tell him that he has little time to live, but this does not make the situation easier for her. Inevitably, her growing absence from the store makes her feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a stone through the store window. Although Jung-won's decision to retain his Dar-im disease is questionable, he feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to "live life to the fullest. " Playing. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving sequences of the film is when an old woman returns to her studio to take a commemorative photo of herself. Jung-won makes sure that the image is an accurate image, knowing that soon he will take his own image of the memory. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It's about enjoying the ordinary moments: riding a bicycle, sharing a joke, eating ice cream, being considerate and considerate, and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say that you feel it. Although there have been many films about the process of dying, Christmas in August drives the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously, this film about death is an experience of the greatest joy.
