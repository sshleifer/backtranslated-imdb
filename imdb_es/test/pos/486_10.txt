Today I saw him for the second time and I must say with all my heart that it is time to make a film about us as people not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human life as this story was maybe something good will come out of it. And Eric is hotter than ever. Often, in the cinema, the people of the First Nations are seen as different people from ordinary people. We are always portrayed as chiefs or healers. Hello, we are like everyone else. And this movie showed just that. It hurts us when an injustice is done and we can win in the search for justice. It's really bad that the big movie companies can not see that. I can not wait until this goes on DVD. Thank you to those who chose to show this story as it really was.
