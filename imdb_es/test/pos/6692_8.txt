K-PAX is exactly what a movie should be to warm the heart. The story is about a mysterious mental patient, Prot, played by Kevin Spacey, and his incredulous psychiatrist, Dr. Powel, played by Jeff Bridges. The two have a very friendly bond, and as their relationship grows, Dr. Powel can not help but wonder if there is something else in his mysterious patient, who insists that he is from another planet called K-PAX. This movie is very funny, and Kevin Spacey pulls a well-placed line as if it were his second nature. K-PAX is a smart movie, and I did not expect it to go where it did. In the end, I found myself thinking about the little things in life and about the wonder and magic of everyday life that we often take for granted. I left the theater with a warm and confusing feeling, and for families and couples on a date, K-PAX is a splendid movie, which will not disappoint. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in something other than monotonous gore fests, bright and action-packed.
