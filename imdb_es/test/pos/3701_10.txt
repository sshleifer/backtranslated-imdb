It's 3:30 a.m. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie about six minutes ago and it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> A teenager has a passionate night with her mother's lover and it ruins the lives of everyone. The really interesting thing about this movie is that you can not really blame a single person. <br /> <br /> Everyone performed perfectly, and the story was inspiring. <br /> <br /> You should definitely see this movie if you can put it in your hands. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10.
