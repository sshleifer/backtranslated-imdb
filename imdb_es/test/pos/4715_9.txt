Based on a true story, John Boorman shows the struggle of an American doctor, whose husband and son were murdered and she was continually plagued by his loss. A vacation to Burma with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all, but when her passport was stolen in Rangoon, she could not leave the country with her sister and was forced to stay until she could get the I.D. Documents of the American Embassy. To complete a day before she could fly, she made a trip to the countryside with a tour guide. "I tried to find something in those stone statues, but nothing stirred in me, I was also stone." <br /> <br /> Suddenly all hell broke loose and was caught in a political revolt. Just when it looked like he had escaped and got on a train safely, he saw that his guide was beaten and shot. In a split second he decided to jump out of the moving train and try to rescue him, without thinking of himself. Continuously his life was in danger. <br /> <br /> Here is a woman who demonstrated a spontaneous and selfless charity, risking her life to save another. Patricia Arquette is beautiful, and not just to look; she has a beautiful heart. This is an unforgettable story. <br /> <br /> "We are taught that suffering is the only promise that life always holds."
