I just watched this movie at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, Alabama, which was really a fun festival, and it surprised me. It was the best movie I saw all day long shot. A school-age prostitute meets a middle-aged man and tries to end the deep depression together. It is an internal look at the darkest parts of human sexuality. The story comes from real life events, torn directly from the headlines. The direct, direct dialogue and a murderous turn at the end. The film contains sexual dialogues and graphic nudes. Definitely not suitable for children. Too depressing for the tastes of some people. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion.
