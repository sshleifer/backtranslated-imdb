The spectators of Motorama should already be interested in other unconventional films based on the desert like Baghdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less take place in the desert). He also models part of the strange humor (and especially the trail of eccentric characters) from the writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours'. In a kind of desert travel fantasy, a metaphor for temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10-year-old boy, charges money in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang and runs away from his extremely neglected parents. . It begins as a journey through salvation (which is evident in the scenes with John Diehl), but once it gets hooked into a scratching game called Motorama, it is easily affected by temptation and loses its childish innocence. Travel from one crazy fictional state to another to invent ways to obtain the Motorama cards from the participating gas stations, just enough so that you can spell the winning word MOTORAMA and be eligible for the $ 500 million cash prize. <br /> <br /> On the way, he faces dozens of strange characters like Flea, who plays a high-roped waiter, Meatloaf who plays a crazy motorcyclist, and Mary Woronov and Sandy Baron (a regular from Seinfeld ) as two violent kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The publication of the DVD can be very misleading, as have previous attempts to sell this film to the non-cult market for the first time with the links that compare it to Home Alone and Thelma & Louise. The newest one calls it a love story with the slogan that implies that the film is about Jordan Michael Christopher in an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams ... that, despite the size of his image on the cover of the DVD , it's really just a 1 second cameo by Drew Barrymore as the fantasy girl Gus dreams about. Why did not they market it for what it was? Thought that it may seem totally strange in the first visualization, it is actually a well-designed narrative. <br /> <br /> Motorama is an excellent material for fans of strange b-grade comedies. This was a pretty interesting story, and particularly due to the strength of its main actor, Jordan Michael Christopher (who unfortunately has few other notable credits on the screen), and the clever metaphor inherent in the plot. Hopefully, its re-release on DVD will make it easier for cult fans.
