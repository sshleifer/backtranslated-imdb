I provided location services in this film every Sunday that we would film in Berkeley Square, in London. David Niven, the gentleman, really enjoyed the role, unfortunately to be the last. We had a moment of panic when a load of the boot of fake Krugerrands (cast for the film ...) overturned in a storm drain. <br /> <br /> Imagine a frantic crew opening all the drains to recover until the last. If you know and love London, you will love this comedy game, also begins Richard Jordan, who unfortunately died of a brain tumor. A good movie, great team, excellent cast. look for the current stars of the coronation street and then play scenes of crowds or extras. Ivan's car lot and retail businesses were filmed in West London, Chiswick, the entire shopping parade and the United States used car lot were dressed overnight, the car lot is still there as They are the stores. A restaurant suddenly became a funeral parlor. If you see the movie in the listings, make an effort to see it! By the way, Sally Harrison, the Bank's receptionist, was married to production designer Tony Curtis. <br /> <br /> April 2007 I thought I would add some additional comments on the locations: <br /> <br /> Pub: right next to Berkeley Square Elke Sommers Cottage: on the back street along by Twickenham Film Studios. Ivans used car parking: along Chiswick High Street and all shops near the roundabout. Workshops (conversion of armored vans) Factory in a roundabout in front of Fullers Brewery Jail (see workshops above) Telephone booth, see the country house of Elke Sommers (it was the wooden box of the studio used in many movies, look for the cable of Gound level lighting and wooden hinges in The door! Honeywells computer room near Olympia cemetery - Chiswick - Tomb just outside the boundary on common grounds Bank interiors, empty roof and strong room: Twickenham studios <br / > <br /> And just to add David Niven as the gentleman, he joked and mixed with the crew, the extras and so on ... Niven would have dinner at the Connaught hotel and joined the crew for a coffee!
