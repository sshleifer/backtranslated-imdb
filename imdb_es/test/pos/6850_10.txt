Carla Gugino, literally, melts the screen in this crime race. Its sexual attractiveness, its ample resources and its sexy southern accent make that this film can be seen again. But the film has so many "other" things that make it almost a modern classic. The performance of Simon Baker for one thing. Truly the one of a great actor. Til Schweiger has such a perfect cast that makes me wonder why he is not a big crossover star. Gil Bellows completes this motel team and literally steals this show. Another scission of Gugino easily the best performance in the movie. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are so bright ... I can not even describe it. Great chemistry <br /> <br /> The music is so powerfully eclectic that it was a character in itself. Wonderful to contemplate. <br /> <br /> People can say that it is influenced by Tarantino ... I do not agree. It is clearly unique and intelligent in its own right. Sebastian Gutierrez does a wonderful job directing this tightly woven film and minimizing many scenes that left me reeling. The ending is perfectly sinister and you never see it coming. In short, a lovely film that, for me, is the very definition of what a good movie should be.
