I wish it was released, since I would love to see the finished product! We saw the unfinished version before it came out. I loved all the characters and actors. Does anyone know if it is already in video? I would love to see him again. Definitely worth renting if you are not going to show in the theater. I had trouble finding him because they changed his name.
