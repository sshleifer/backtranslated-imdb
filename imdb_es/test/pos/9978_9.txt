If you like your sports films to have to do with dignity and the best values, this will work for you in a big way. Oversentimental in places? Of course, of course he is, and proud of it. It is the biggest and best ride in the Carnival and it should be enjoyed like this. <br /> <br /> Great production values, simple narration, with creative takes: it's not complex, it's a very beautiful and very sweet movie. It really feels like Bill Paxton's love work; and I bet your son gets that. <br /> <br /> The accumulation is slow enough to enjoy it, the conflicts are overwhelming and the British against the Americans are managed with a degree of vilevil villainy, but the dignity between the two main transatlantic protagonists are always in front . I have minor complaints: the score wants to be James Horner but it is too exaggerated, and there are too many close ups and panoramic shots for 2005, but if you want a simple, decent and good-looking sports movie, then this is <br /> <br / > So here's the thing, and I feel like I know my movie, but actually I liked it better than Seabiscuit: it's a better movie, but Greatest Story is simply Disney in its essence and enormously nice!
