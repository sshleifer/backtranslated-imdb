The timeless novel by Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness, was represented in the 1994 film. I have read Conrad's novel, and I must say that, although I prefer the novel itself, the film was a great representation. Scenography and costume designs gave life to Conrad's novel on the screen while we were following Marlow's journey. The performance also gave life to the characters through gestures, voices and personalities. If you have read the novel, I recommend that you also watch this movie. However, if you have not read the novel, the movie may be harder to follow. Conrad's Heart of Darkness is too full of action, emotion and information to turn them into a film that lasts just over an hour and a half. Therefore, if you have not read the novel, the plot of the movie may seem too messy to follow. In general I gave this movie a seven out of ten. The basic plot of the novel was presented to the screen with big sets, costumes and performances. However, nothing can replace the original work of Joseph Conrad.
