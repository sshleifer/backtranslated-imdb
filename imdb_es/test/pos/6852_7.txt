Well, Anatomie is not a reinvention of the genre Horrormovie, but nevertheless it is well done. The good actors (Powerful and FÃ¼hrmann at the beginning) and some good ideas made me happy. Maybe it would not have been so positive if this was not a German movie, but who cares. It's good to see familiar faces in a good and exciting story, with some jokes and some good jokes. All of you complaining about the dubbing: I did not see a dubbed version (of course) but I think it's not easy for you to watch dubbed movies. We (the Germans) are used to watching movies like that, so it's not a big problem. But try to see in German with subtitles. The actors are really good!
