After being out of the air for a while, Columbo returned with some new mysteries made for television that, although not as good as the original series, are better than the programs that were made in the late 90s. <Br / > "The murder can be dangerous to your health" used the real (and I think now, if you think about it) the real crime is shown as the situation of a murder. The murder is committed by a very successful and egomaniac true crime anchor, George Hamilton (in a good casting moment). His chain smoking nemesis, who lost the job for him, played by Peter Haskell, tries to blackmail Hamilton when he discovers a porn video that Hamilton made with a minor actress on his salad days. Hamilton uses Haskell's cigarettes to deliver the death blow through a poison, and an alibi is also offered. <br /> <br /> Columbo is hired to find out what happened. You know the rest. Very entertaining.
