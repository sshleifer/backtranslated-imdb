James Franco is totally great in this movie. Not only handsome and charismatic, but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere way. In Tristan's show, some people had their backs to be angry and cranky and to do everything related to James Dean, but I do not think this is true. Blind Spot is a positive proof of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries a completely different weight. It is a unique performance. Bittersweet and really touching. The lines of your diary cut you like a knife. You feel a keen intelligence of observation behind your words. The tone is everything. It takes him through action and suspense, as well as the somber fragments of the gallows humor. I also like the other two actors very much. The blonde girl is totally beautiful and the man is hysterical in his twisted hard man's clumsiness. Some of the thugs seemed a bit lazy, but this is a mini-spot really. The movie is totally solid and Franco is great everywhere.
