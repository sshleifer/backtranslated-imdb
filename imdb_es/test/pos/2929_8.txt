This was another great episode of season 11 of South Park. <br /> <br /> Cartman pretends to have Tourette's syndrome so he can say what he wants without getting into trouble. He is able to swear to the other children at school. Kyle tells the director that Cartman is faking him. But, she does not believe it. Chris Hansen plans that Cartman be on Dateline to talk about Tourette's syndrome live and uncensored. But later, Cartman begins to become so addicted to being able to say whatever he wants, that he later begins to accidentally say embarrassing things. This was a fun episode about Cartman faking Tourette's syndrome. I recommend it to any fan of South Park.
