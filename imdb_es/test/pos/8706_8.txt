One night I saw him on Sky TV, since I'm a vampire fan. I must admit I almost expected it to be a B-Movie disaster, but I was pleasantly wrong. <br /> <br /> The subspecies is about a family of vampires. When a vampire Lord dies, his two sons, the handsome and Noble Stefan, and his brother, the evil, the horrible Radu begin a war between them for their birth, the Bloodstone. The bloodstone is a kind of holy grail for the vampires and bleeds the blood of the saints, which gives the vampire who drinks it a maximum. <br /> <br /> The struggle for the bloodstone takes an unexpected turn when 3 university students appeared in the territory of the Brothers on a school trip and Stefan has to protect them from their Lusts brothers. <br /> <br /> As I said, I went into this movie without expecting much at all, but it was one of the best low budget movies I've seen. The scenarios and the locations (Romania, I think, it's been a while since I've seen it) are very nice and the music did the film justice. <br /> <br /> The majority of the performance was adequate, but it is Anders Hove. like the evil radu who steals the movie (and all the subsequent sequels). Hove's performance as the twisted Vamp is really impressive and hits the movie just okay, even pretty!
