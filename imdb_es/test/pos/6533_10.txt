Well, I have to say that this movie was probably the most fun I've seen all year. And I do not mean exactly that in a good way. This is probably the most pathetic movie I've seen in a long time, and yet that's what makes her so funny. It can be said that these people are really trying to act, unfortunately for them they are not doing a good job, so even the lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone, sound really funny. Aaron Carter is essentially a character quite similar to him in real life, and still manages to make the character look corny and unrealistic. This movie is one of those movies in which everything that is supposed to sound serious seems really fun and all the things that are supposed to be fun are so stupid and cheesy that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying. This movie is so bad, it's really good. I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood to laugh.
