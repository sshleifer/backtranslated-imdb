Well, I just discovered IMDb from my twin sister, Carol. Carol and I play the "Fat Identical Twin" in Midnight Madness. We did not have to prepare much for the fat part, who came with us, and good and the rest was natural. ;) It was our first important role in the movies and we had a great time doing it. We were 21 at that time and we lived approximately one and a half hours from The Disney Studio in Burbank and the Hollywood area, California. We grew up in front of the television and, probably, we are part of the first generation of children with a closing key. Twenty years later, we still have a lot of fun and we continue to be "heavy" or whatever is politically correct these days. We no longer act, but we know that we "go back" when the right opportunity arrives. Carol is a chiropractor in our hometown of Southern California and I am in the field of information technology in Georgia. <br /> <br /> Maybe I preached it, but I thought the movie was cute, clean and fun. We knew it was not a masterpiece or an Oscar nominee, however, it was and still is a movie that the whole family can watch and have fun together. It's good not to have to worry if your young children can watch a video without having to anticipate certain parts. And nobody was more excited when it was posted on video like Carol and me. Carol found him at Kmart for $ 6.99! This is an inexpensive way to capture memories and share them with others. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Betsy Lynn and Carol Gwynn; The twins of Thompson
