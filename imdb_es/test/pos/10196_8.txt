It seems that the writer of Robocop has been looting The Vindicator completely. This is a very solid horror / action movie about a man created in an accident to be used in a cruel experiment. Anyone who has seen Robocop knows the story. Beware of Pam Grier as a malicious and pretty murderer. This highly effective, violent and bloody horror film may not like everyone, but it is worth looking for this Canadian outlet for anyone who is a fan of the genre. 8/10
