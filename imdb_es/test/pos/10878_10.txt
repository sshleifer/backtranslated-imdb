Two years after its initial release, Goldeneye is still in the field of first-person shooter games for the Nintendo 64. Not even the Quake and Turok series have had the combination of graphic detail, sound quality, enemy intelligence , challenge and fun in general. I return to this game again and again. Each mission has specific objectives that force you to think like Bond, not only to shoot all the bad guys that appear on your screen, but also to avoid cameras, disable security systems, rescue hostages, protect the Bond girl , etc. Q gadgets abound in this game, including the famous clock. The game is loosely based on the story of the film, which includes all the main characters and the best scenes from the movie, from the bungee jump of the prey to the flight of the prop plane to the pursuit of tanks through St. Petersburg. Even the design is preserved whenever possible, so you will recognize several situations if you have seen the movie. Other levels are added to challenge the player and join the scenes a bit more. With each level of difficulty, mission objectives are more difficult, smarter enemies and more lethal bullets. I have not yet passed the 00-Agent levels. The tricks can be opened, not by entering codes or pressing buttons, but by completing certain levels within a certain period of time, and additional characters can be opened for the multiplayer. The multiplayer is still the best among first-person shooters. It's not as sharp as the Turok, but it does not slow down that much ... many options give your friends reasons to burst each other again and again, and once again just for fun. There are better games for the N64, such as Zelda and all things Star Wars, but Rare has continued his streak of outstanding games with a shooter game that has not been overcome until he reaches the top in 2000 with Perfect Dark .
