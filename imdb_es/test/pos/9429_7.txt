In the Universal series of modern stories of Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEOPON is not one of the best films, although it is entertaining. I think the problem is that much of the "mourning" of the film between Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty (here played by Lionel Atwill) seems to delay the real point of the teacher's work. <br /> <br /> Moriarty appears in Three of Holmes's films with Rathbone. In THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES he was played by George Zucco, who gave much pleasure to the love of villainy for his own good on paper. For my money, Zucco's performance as a teacher was the best of the three (there is even a brief moment of comedy in his performance, when he disguises himself as "Police Sergeant" towards the end, as if he were preparing to sing "A Police's Lot "by Gilbert & Sullivan). Then comes Mr. Atwill's performance here, more of that later. Finally, there is the intellectual Moriarty of Henry Daniell in SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE LADY IN GREEN. It's a typically brilliant and elegant performance by Mr. Daniell, but his confrontations with Holmes seem to be a tedious bore for him. They prevent you from completing the main plan. In the stories in which the professor appears, he really feels that Holmes is an enemy that will remain a danger while he is alive. However, due to the intellectual tennis match between him and Rathbone, Rathbone (in his autobiography) really felt that Daniell was the best of the movie Moriartys. <br /> <br /> If Zucco captured the love of evil in the teacher, and Daniell seemed to show the tired Oxford Don (in the stories, the teacher is a well-considered mathematician, whose volume on the binomial theorem had a " European fashion ", and who wrote an intriguing book, THE DYNAMICS OF THE ASTEROID), Atwill demonstrates the professor as a pragmatic entrepreneur. First, he has sold his services (apparently) to Nazi Germany. This has never been implemented, but it is assumed that (as this is before the Nazis really began to collapse), he believes they will win the war. Second, he is not a fool. When Dr. Tobel (William Post Jr.) has shown that he is in a state of physical collapse due to the torture of the Moriarty gang, the professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who attend Tobel, because he is a scientist as good as Tobel and would be able to put together the site of the bomb. Somehow I can not see Zucco making such a sensible decision in the place, and if Daniell had to do it, it would seem annoying that there is another delay in his plans. <br /> <br /> By the way A trick used in all Holmes series with respect to the teacher is how to get rid of him from the movie. If you read the stories of Holmes, Moriarty appears as the villain three times: in the last story of THE MEMORIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE FINAL PROBLEM"), in the history of THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE ") and the last of the four novels / novels (THE VALLEY OF FEAR). It is surprising how many miles the professor got in so few appearances (it is also mentioned in two or three other stories, in passing). But due to his fate at the Reichenbach Falls in "THE FINAL PROBLEM" and "THE EMPTY HOUSE", we always see him fall to his death. Zucco falls from the White Tower on Tower Hill. Daniell (with more imagination) tries to flee from Gregson and the police, but is shot when he jumps and the wounded do not cling to the wall of an adjacent building. Atwill (here you can not see it, but you hear it) seems to fall through a trapdoor that is placed in an escape tunnel). It is really tedious after a while to see the teacher fall into these movies. One resorts to the comedy Gene Wilder (undoubtedly a comedy) SHERLOCK HOLMES 'SMARTER BROTHER, where Leo McKern is a wonderfully crazy and evil Moriarty (complete, finally, with an Irish accent), who is not murdered at the end, but who he just left reflecting, in a rowboat, on how his careful schemes did not work. I liked that more. <br /> <br /> The use of the "Dancing Men" code here, like the use of "Devil's Foot Root" in DRESSED TO KILL, is part of a mystery of a short story. . "THE ADVENTURE OF MEN WHO DANCE" appeared in THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, and deals with a client of Holmes whose wife has been receiving strange and bloody messages in this code. Charles Higham, in his biography THE ADVENTURES OF CONAN DOYLE suggests that Sir Arthur may have taken the code of a magazine game in the 1870s, but we really do not know. The code is basically one of the substitutions of letters for the figures of men dancing. The story in the short story is dramatic, but it is about a triangle. The only innovation in the film is that Tobel makes a slight change that confuses both Holmes and Moriarty. <br /> <br /> The movie will entertain, but I still think that THE HOUSE OF FEAR, THE SCARLET CLAW and SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH are better movies.
