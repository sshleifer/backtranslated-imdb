I saw this version about a decade ago, and I've been looking for it ever since. I recently found an original version of VHS and bought it for $ 125.00. It sounds crazy, but if you, like me, consider it to be one of the best the Broadway music scene ever produced, I would not even think twice. <br /> <br /> Why? a Broadway ticket today. I really hope they re-release this in DVD format soon. It's a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by everyone!
