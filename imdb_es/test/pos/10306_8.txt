I agree with Andy, this is a good movie. The character of Kevin McKidd is credible throughout the film. We are forced to hate him and, finally, we sympathize with him. Paula Sage, who plays Roberta, also has a good performance. It is stimulating and emotional without any excess of excessive production. Thanks to the director Alison Peebles and the writer Andrea Gibb for that. A very valuable visit. The pace of the film is correct, generating enough interest in the subject to tell you, instead of bombarding with facts in a documentary style. A beautiful and small soundtrack to accompany the film, again used in moderation, so as not to distract you from the plot. Recommended.
