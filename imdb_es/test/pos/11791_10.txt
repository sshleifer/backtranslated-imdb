I really liked this movie. If other people want to give you an average of around 5.0 / 10, that is your choice. I would give it 10/10. Sutherland's performance as a private eye is totally impressive. The story is incredible, human, exciting, intelligent. The dialogue is good. The story might not be perfect, but anyway, the mood of the movie is good enough to make up for that. Also, the ending is incredibly cool and your jig-saw puzzle really gets back together. So I liked it anyway. I also thought that the main actress acted very well. I'm not a big fan of detective movies, but this was really good, also because he does not care about the conventions of the supernatural.
