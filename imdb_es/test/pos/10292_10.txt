This sad romance is inescapable because the director decides to break his narrative and offer the points of view of each character. Then, there are many flashbacks, re-shot of the same scene. But it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments to see the result! <br /> <br /> And it would be worth it, because it's for me, just one of the best French films ever made! <br /> <br /> It has everything: <br /> <br /> Deal: the first steps of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such presence and such voices, even for people with hearing problems! It is symbolic that they have fallen in love with this movie! <br /> <br /> Direction: your camera is bright, is alive, plays with sets or can be mysterious with a long foreground "Ã  la David Lynch". <br /> <br /> Cinematography: light is beautiful, between gold and oxidation, like your love! <br /> <br /> A Paris never seen before: it is a Paris out of time of more precision, a composite of many districts! Huge search here! It looks like the city of Gotham, modern and ancient at the same time! <br /> <br /> Music: It is not the great orchestra but in perfect harmony with the frames. And the song by Charles Aznavour made me discover this great singer! <br /> <br /> Oh, ?? the history! As I said, it's a love story, but quite tragic: to say that love can be for nothing, that it does not make all people happy or that a sweet ending is not guaranteed because this message is not often said ! Love is passion, which derives from the Latin "pain". You can suffer a lot when you're in love! Because of the reason ..., the endless wait, the lack of courage, the indecision. <br /> <br /> And when he can calm down, fate, destiny, god (?), the devil (?) can stab him in the back, simply because he arrives too early or too late and, above all, because Love means 2 in a world of billions! Many things can happen and so many stories can be written! So, what is love? <br /> <br /> Personally, I lived moments like this: in a car with the beloved one. Your mobile phone rings and you know it's your "special friend" who says goodbye to kisses (and not you, even if we're always together). So, you want to get out of this car to leave them together, so as not to hear the sweet but cruel words, but you can not, because an incredible rain has just started! <br /> <br /> I found that this film describes those moments of tragedy like nobody else!
