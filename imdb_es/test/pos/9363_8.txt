RKO Radio Pictures became a true classic in 1947 and even managed to get nominated for the Award for Best Picture Film. The acting, the script, the continuity, etc., are almost perfect; And the story is well worth the 82 minutes of the viewer. Although the image of the soft petals is the true story of life by making the murder victim Jewish rather than homosexual, most viewers will see the victim as a Jewish homosexual: such disguises never work, perhaps not it was intended that they do so. <br /> <br /> I could choose some details, but just for fun. There was not a movie theater that lasted all night in Washington, DC in 1947, and if there was one, I wish Robert Mitchum and his friend would not talk through the show. There were no bars where a GI could pick up a pretty blonde. ANY! If Robert Ryan wanted to read the latest scoop on the murder, he should have bought the Daily News; It's not the Times-Hearald, Evening Star and it's certainly not the Washington Post that knows nothing. But these little things do not take anything away from this classic. <br /> <br /> The film benefits a lot from the absolute lack of a musical score, except during the credits. I've only seen this done in a few movies. <br /> <br /> On the downside, since 1995 comes with an introduction of TMC in which there are some liberal comments about what the public was "ready for" in 1947 .... bla bla bla! As if this fool had some business judging his best. I would say that the ex-IG in 1947, the largest generation, were much smarter (and had better values) than some commentators, film historians or other wise men in 1995. Put a sock on it!
