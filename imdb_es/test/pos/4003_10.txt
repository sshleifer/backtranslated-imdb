I know a lot of people have said not to bother with this movie because it's not a good fight fight with the subtitles. That is a very lazy way of thinking about a movie. If you want to focus on that part of the film, you should look for something else and also learn to respect the cinema as an art form, this is a masterpiece. If you want to see this, it's not really about fighting. Sometimes there are good fight scenes that are filmed quite well with good camera work, but the story itself is what keeps the story together and is the important part. This is not the basic Kung-fu movie. The story is really the central focus and not the fights, and the combination of the two makes an excellent movie that is worth watching, and is even better in the original language with subtitles.
