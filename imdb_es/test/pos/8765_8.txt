Saboteur is a 1942 movie, partly aimed at gaining US support for the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, it's great entertainment. The main actors are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although the director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper, and Barbara Stanwyck in the roles, which would have given more importance to the film. This is a good movie anyway, with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane bringing their own style to the characters. As in other Hitchcock films, we see the director's contempt for the socially soft and wealthy. He often portrayed spies and foreign agents as pleasant, upper-class people who, at the same time, mocked democratic values ​​and concepts, as guilty, until their innocence was proven. These traitors of the upper crust are the last ones pursued by the police or even suspects. Hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police. I wanted to raise the normal boy, the thief and the guy who does not take himself too seriously. One can see him loving Gary Cooper as an icon in Frank Capra's cast. However, Bob Cummings puts his own stamp on the guy next door and works well on paper. Priscilla Lane, as the female protagonist, appears as the completely American girl who can handle herself very well when she is put to the test. Robert Cummings, as a worker at the Barry Kane defense plant, is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend. This leads to a chase scene across the country that reminds other Hitchcock heroes in the race. Hitchcock repeats some of the well-established formulas of previous films: the reluctant woman who is attracted to the action, for example. Madeleine Carroll in the 39 Steps, and risking her life to evade the authorities who are hot on her heels. We see scenes of the United States while Kane tries to find the true culprit in the bombing of which he is accused. We see rivers, bridges, cabins, truck drivers, the Hoover Dam and, finally, the city of New York. New York is a suitable backdrop for the climax, as we pass from the Rockefeller Center to the ocean liners (with a cut to the Normandy ship) and the grand finale of the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with uninterrupted action. Do not miss it
