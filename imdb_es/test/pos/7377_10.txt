I would like to say that I loved Campfire Tales! For me, it was one of the original horror movies with a twisted ending. As if the content of the movie was not scary or strange enough, you have the ending. It is a very impressive film and I am very happy that it is released on DVD on August 30. I will not hesitate to receive my copy that day. I do not think the film has received all the credit or recognition it should have had, because all these other films came out shortly after and were recognized, but if it was not because my brother told me about the film, I would not have known. Which stinks because, in my opinion, it's much better than any "Scream", "I know what you did last summer", or any other horror for that moment. So I hope you can watch the movie yourself and at least be able to see the difference. I loved it, and being a horror movie addict, Campfire Tales was like a dessert for me!
