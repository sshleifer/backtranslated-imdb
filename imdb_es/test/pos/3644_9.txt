Quite decent for his initial work and not Kokaku Kidotai without him, and he gets 2 extra points for the Easter eggs. For Shirow definitely a rung on the ladder. I am predisposed as a Shirow fan, but this was a big step for Dirty Pair, which was what I knew about him. Violent fun with a porn soundtrack! You can not help but notice that. I know people appreciate it for Ghost in the Shell ... but all the deep spiritual nuances were addressed in Appleseed. ESWAT kills terrorists, fighting for humans to stay viable as bioroids eliminate them, and Deunan remains thin despite her intake of junk food. I definitely like the characters, even the traitor ... and I do not know why.
