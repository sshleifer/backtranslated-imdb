This film was one of three that were then combined by Chapin in a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title "The Chaplin Review." <br /> <br /> This was a strange movie in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was antiwar and his films highlighted peace and fraternity. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy aimed at reinforcing the efforts of the United States in the First World War. It is really strange to see Charlie as the "super soldier" who, by himself, captures 13 Germans, casually and coldly shoots several Germans in just a few seconds as a shooter and then goes after the enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser for yourself! Truly, this was an important game for the Little Wanderer, although, at the same time, it was very entertaining and fun. The film has an exceptional rhythm, it is well made and I am sure that I did a lot to reinforce the support in the country for our troops (unfortunately, it was such a useless and expensive war).
