Buddy Manucci (Roy Scheider, solid in a random leadership role) heads a covert secret police squad, called Seven-Ups, whose tactics do not necessarily follow the exact forms of the law. They do the work their way without leaking anything to the press, and this gives them the freedom to expand their means to reach the criminals that most detectives and police officers who work simply can not stop. Buddy has a childhood friend named Vito (Tony Lo Bianco) who exchanges information with him about the types of mobsters and shysters who work on the streets of New York. What Buddy does not know is that Vito is plotting a scheme with names from Buddy's "checklist" (he has this open book with notes provided by Vito, but he does not know that his friend has copied those same names written in his Mind) to establish mafia families in a series of kidnappings of gangsters getting cash thanks to two policemen, Moon (the always evil Richard Lynch) and Bo (Bill Hickman) working with him. When this plan goes wrong, with one of the Seven Substations being killed, Vito feels afraid because he knows how Buddy can be when he chases someone ... especially when one of his own is killed. <br /> <br /> The extremely underestimated police movie has an exciting car chase through New York City while Buddy follows the kidnapping that the cop and impostor is trying to get after killing his partner. The film is not too complex after the plot is ready and we realize who is the leader of the group in the machinations of gangsters. Scheider has never been given the credit he deserves as an excellent lead actor. He has an emotional range and we see how losing his policeman and friend makes him feel very hurt. The film is animated with good action sequences and establishes an interesting plot of betrayal between friends, since greed occurs before the friendship of childhood and what seems to be a wave of crimes without problems against the mafia families It can make police officers killed.
