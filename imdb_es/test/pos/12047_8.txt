This was Bollywood's response to Fatal Attraction and this is a classic movie in its own right. Juhi Chawla was good and also Sunny Deol, but it was Shah Rukh Khan who rose to fame as the stalker. Since then he has become a favorite of the Chopra (Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge, Mohhabatein, Dil to pagal hai, Veer Zaara and Chak De India). Shah Rukh at first seems to be a villain, but then, towards the end, you begin to sympathize with him. The scripts were excellent and the songs were chartbusters. My favorites are Too simply samne and Jaadu teri nazar. <br /> <br /> After the sad failure of the underrated Lamhe Yash Chopra defended himself with Darr. The dialogues were memorable, the dialogue k..k..Kiran is repeated often. Since Darr Yash Chopra has slipped a little. Dil to pagal hai was bad, but he redeemed himself slightly with Veer Zaara, which was much better. This was the last masterpiece of Yash Chopra.
