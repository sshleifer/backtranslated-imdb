I saw what I think is the best Australian movie of the year so far, Acolytes, by Jon Hewitt. <br /> <br /> Acolytes is an elegant thriller with a murderous premise. Get this? Two teenagers harassed and molested discover a local serial killer in their suburb And then they start to blackmail him to kill the bully who bothered them. Hewitt has chosen a top-notch cast that includes the excellent newcomers Sebastian Gregory, Josua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence to play the teenagers. Add those three, yes, that's right, three great psychopaths! Directed by Joel Edgerton in an outstanding performance of serial killer du jour, Belinda McClory, his deranged wife and Michael Dorman as the teenager who raped his partner, with tattoos with swastika. Once you add these teens and these menacing adults, does all hell break loose? Hewitt has created balls for the serial thriller that is very original and successful. You can see the influence of Twin Peaks by Larry Clark and David Lynch, but Hewitt does it all for himself, in a suburban residential area of ​​Qld, always playing with the buzz of the void. The script by Shayne Armstong, Shane Krouse and Hewitt is strict. <br /> <br /> If marketed correctly, this movie could be a big hit among teenagers. The next Wolf Creek? May well be. Makes all the correct movements. The teenagers are real wing Larry Clark. They do not stink and they have a PC agenda attached, they are not communicative, they look good and they are modern. The murderers are dark with real threat. Joel Edgerton steals his scenes as the modest Ted Bundy, who sports a butterfly in his 4WD spare wing, John Fowles The Collector. Dorman's petrol rapist pours on the threat that Suburban Mayhem heads and provides a creepy thug who you can not wait to see buy the farm. <br /> <br /> The movie is fast, hard and brutal. Not only that, it shows Hewitt's confidence and leadership that will surely grant him an IF or AFI nomination, if it's not a prize. Its poetic and nuanced staging, its brilliant sound design, its excellent photography and its tight structure clearly mark it as one of the best-directed Oz functions I've seen so far this year. <br /> <br /> The movie leaves you speechless. Thinking and unsolved It's a really great edition for the return to the genre that is happening in Australian cinema today. Surely reaping the interest of Hollywood. Oh, and did I mention that you came to Toronto? What other Oz movies can say that? The world should be ready for a new author, Jon Hewitt.
