Compared to the competition, soul calibur 3 is a god among the games, a true work of art. However, compared to its 128-bit predecessors, the latest version of slash em up from namcos superior is more than ambitious: its attempts to improve perfection are not very successful. <br /> <br /> There are new modes and game settings that I praise for trying to elevate the series to new heights, but they only complicate things. Examples? Well, the character creation mode is a great idea in theory, but in reality it is full of restrictions and is not as customizable as the one found in wwe games, for example. The sword mode chronicles are fun and stimulating for a moment, but eventually they prolong and feel like a task to earn money instead of a really fun game. In addition, the soul story mode, which is basically the arcade mode with small fragments of inconsequential history and the QTR bits of shenmue style, feels really slow. <br /> <br /> "My God, you do not know what not! SaYiNg" is probably the most enthusiastic of what you are thinking, but do not try it. I do not hate this game, this game is great! It still has that classic game (although some character moves have been changed unnecessarily), absolutely stunning graphics and that epic soundtrack for which the games are known. And also on the good side of things are the new characters (especially zasalamel), who are great in their own way (except setsuka-yes, I know I'm making peace). <br /> <br /> It's just that compared to the calibur soul 1 and 2 it feels like it's trying to be much more than it really is. That does not mean it's not a classic, it just means that, compared to its high standards, it falls short despite having more characters on stage and better graphics than ever. <br /> <br /> Still, soul calibur 3 cleans the floor with 95% of the games, and that counts for something! Oh, and all those who mark this review as "unhelpful" clearly feel hurt for insulting their dear setsuka. Well, listen fanboy / girl: SHE is not REAL! And even if it were, they would not catch her dead with you.
