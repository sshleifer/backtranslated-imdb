From the apple of Adam and with his permission. I did not know until I looked for it right now. Also the errrrrrmmmmm 'Wilbur wants to commit suicide' I prefer this dead end very focused ... the drama about Adam's apple over the most important comic fervor. But With Your Permission is much more stratified and subtle, but that is another director. <br /> <br /> Once the "substantial" part of the story is developed, I felt the fear of returning to the store again and again. A little claustrophobic ... maybe that's intentional. It is based on the atmosphere. You fear rediscovery again and again until the 'kick in the shin'. <br /> <br /> This is kind of funny.
