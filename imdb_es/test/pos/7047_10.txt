The first time I saw this movie was in the mid 80's and I thought it was a fun movie. As I grew up, I see this movie for different reasons. I like to see it when I feel sad / nostalgic for my "lost youth". I was a teenager (14) at the time of the release of this film, so I can identify with many of the same problems / dilemmas that campers / CIT have in this film. I enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at this time and listening to the old urban legends like those told in the night canoe trip. The movie is also full of fun line plotters. I recommend this movie to anyone who was a teenager between the late 70's and early 80's.
