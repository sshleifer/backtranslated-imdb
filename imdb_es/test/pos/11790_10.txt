I thought that this film was excellent, peculiar and different to the usual career of the film 'disconnected from the police capturing serial killers'. Kiefer Sutherland was brilliant as usual, I really do not think I have seen anything of what he has done where he has not acted brilliantly. The dialogue was funny sometimes lightening the mood, and the plot was captivating. Thanks to other reviewers for showing the link with Alice in Wonderland, I had not detected them. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Kiefer Sutherlands (as I am) and anyone who wants to watch an entertaining movie for a couple of hours. It was a pity that it was not released in theaters for a wider audience.
