I must be a bit skeptical when I entered the cinema to watch OSS117: French comedies tend to be so satisfied today that only the stupidest have a high score at the national box office. But I was surprised that, although the humor does not always reach the level of the Monthy Pythons, the many references to the French vision of the world in the 1950s, which represents OSS117, are very funny and the director managed to recreate the cinematographic style of Ese time with amazing fidelity. To say it briefly, a bit like a good surprise, not to mention the excellent performances of several secondary actors. And at least for once, the style of Jean Dujardin (which can put on the nerves of many people) perfectly meets the character he plays.
