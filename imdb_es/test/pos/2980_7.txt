I have not seen this movie since it came out on an album in the theater, and I've been looking for it ever since. At that time I was 12 years old and the story moved me; and NOW, the end eludes me. It was young love that absorbed me the most, not to mention the voices of John and the lyrics of Taupin. The story (at that time) hit my home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental films and this still remains in my head after 35 years, it's that good. Get into adolescence and let your fantasies come true. If this movie did not arouse your curiosity, then you were too old. I hope to see you again (even at my age)! If nostalgia is in your place, I'm sure this is an interesting movie to watch. His innocence is simply amazing and his simplicity is very easy and pleasant.
