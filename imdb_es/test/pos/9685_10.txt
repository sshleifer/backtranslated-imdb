This movie was on the limit of raw humor ... I can not believe that these people can get away with it. Johnny Knoxville did not cross the line ... he was trampling everywhere! This was better than the first ... EVERYTHING! What I found in the first movie was that the scams were like they were on television. show. NOT THIS TIME!!! they did a full 180 degree turn ... the whole cast is so outstanding in what they do and it was not the crazy stunts ... but the music basically fits every situation ... GOOD JOB! When you go to see this, be sure to use the bathroom before going to the movies, keep a strong stomach and remember that you should not let the drink out through the nose ...
