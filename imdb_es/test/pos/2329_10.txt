I love military comedies (Sgt. Bilko, Stripes, In The Army Now, Major Payne) and Down Periscope is hilarious, but it also has a heart. <br /> <br /> The Stingray SS-161 (The USS Pampanito) was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful, a work of art comes alive. So it was a diesel sub engine, so what? I learned that the aircraft carrier USS Ranger (which represented The Enterprise on Star Trek IV), a huge ship, had a 'conventional engine', which could mean that Ranger was also a diesel. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Buckman, this can has been on the line from Korea! This may expire in 1966! Buckman: (Takes a full finger and proves it) What's the problem, sir? It still tastes like corn cream. <br /> <br /> Pascal: (Screaming) Except it's DEVILED JAM !! Buckman: That would be a problem. <br /> <br /> It's a story, maybe a bit tense, it seemed plausible. Winslow respected Dodge and seemed to care about him, so he wanted to give Dodge a chance. He gave him a battered Balao-class submarine but still able to navigate, and assigned him the task of using the diesel submarine to evade the nuclear armada and the "attack" of the Port of Charlston and Norfolk. Admiral Graham of 2 stars (with his eye on his third star and a grudge against Dodge) assigned him the ragtag crew, hoping they would make a mistake for Dodge to lose. Can Tom Dodge make the crew catch up and work as a team, and can he take an old sub and beat the best of the Navy?
