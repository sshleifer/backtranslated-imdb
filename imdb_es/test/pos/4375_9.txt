Mr. Carlin left our common forum in June 2008, shortly after going to the hospital for chest pains (he had a history of heart problems). The media and comics everywhere covered the loss more than I or he NEVER would have expected ... but, he was the grandfather of the observational comedy. <br /> <br /> THIS recording was his last production and contains a large section Dedicated to the subject of death and life perspectives thereafter. The filming of the project occurred shortly after turning seventy years, which pleased him to have reached (observed?). I have followed Carlin's career since the days of blurry black and white television, and I enjoyed his current album albums. <br /> <br /> It is a privilege for ANY Carlin fan to see at least (if he does not own a copy) of this particular show. He was still moving fast, and with great timing, even at 70! As he would say ..., he is NOT "smiling from heaven in you". If you are doing something, you are not taking harp lessons; maybe he is looking up !!!
