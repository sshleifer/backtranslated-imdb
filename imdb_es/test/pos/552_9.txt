Being a freshman in college, this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mother. Of course, my situation is not parallel to the situation of Natalie Portman and Surandon; but my mother and I have grown up with the typical fights of mother and daughter. There is always the mother who tells you what to do or that you are not the kind of mother you want to be. At the end of this movie, I was dancing my eyes. Surandon's reaction that his daughter went to the east coast, miles away, after all that had happened, reminded me of how I felt being from a small town on the west coast and traveling to New York. <br /> <br /> The film is aimed at women who have children who are now adults. It is very moving, I was moved by the movie. Every feeling outside the characters in this movie was completely real, you did not receive any false sentimentality. I was sitting through the credits in the screening of this film, alone, wishing that my mother was sitting next to me to be able to hold her and thank her for everything. This movie is a bit corny, of course, but everything is really momentous. It is about what a mother can learn from her son; and what a child learns from his mother. 8/10
