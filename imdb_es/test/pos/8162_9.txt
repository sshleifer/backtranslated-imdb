I was impressed by the story. He had the "typical" predator gay male and the "typical" Mormon missionary. But, everyone also had friends and family members who balanced their lives well. There are a number of characters, some pleasant and others not so pleasant, each with its own nuances of personality. And, most reminded me of the people in my own life. <br /> <br /> The story begins with several comical moments and slowly evolves into a film of comforting relationships. The story progresses without obvious twists of the plot and never talks to you. It makes you think a bit while you wait to see what happens. Even when I thought I could foresee something that was coming, I was surprised how it really happened. <br /> <br /> Not many films make me laugh knowing the true gay dialogue and then they make me cry when I feel The pain of the characters. I saw the movie on DVD and I could not stop watching it until everything was over. (Usually, I see a movie in pieces for a couple of days). It's nice to see a movie with gay characters that is edifying but does not preach. I highly recommend this movie! And not only for the gay public. Relationships transcend sexuality.
