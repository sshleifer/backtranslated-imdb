This was a truly epic production that had all the elements that one would want in a fantasy movie. The costumes, the music, the cinematography, all the artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and offered a rich experience. <br /> <br /> Ted Danson, best known for his television roles in "Cheers" and "Becker" was excellent in the role of Gulliver. Mary Steenburgen (Time After Time, Cross Creek) performed equally well in her limited role as his wife. <br /> <br /> Other performances that I really enjoyed were James Fox as Dr. Bates, Alfre Woodard as the Queen of Brobdingnag, and Peter O'Toole as the Emperor of Lilliput. <br /> <br /> This would make a nice children's movie, but it would also definitely attract adults for their deep social comments.
