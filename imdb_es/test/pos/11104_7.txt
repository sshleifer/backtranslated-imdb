Excellent drama about 2 alienated and spoiled punks that come into conflict with the federal government, each for their own reasons. One, a junkie, just wants to earn some dollars for his next dose, but the other has a much more sinister agenda fueled in part by his father's resentment. Good performances and a good script make it a winner.
