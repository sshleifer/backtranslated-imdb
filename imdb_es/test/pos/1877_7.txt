Or if you've seen the trilogy "Evil Dead" and / or "Bubba Ho-Tep", then you should know that your movies are total farces. With "Man with the Screaming Brain", go back out. In this case, he plays the American businessman, William Cole, who visits Bulgaria. When can we see that country? - When a woman kills him. Then, the strange scientist Ivan Ivanov (Stacy Keach) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent, leaving him acting as Steve Martin in "All of Me". The whole movie is practically an excuse for pure nonsense. Much of the real humor comes from Ted, the brother of the director of "Evil Dead", Sam Raimi, who is the assistant of Ivanov, who has almost no brain, Pavel. The two men have a relationship more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and the Skipper. <br /> <br /> Then I understand that this is a totally silly movie, and you will not be a little disappointed. I liked it, anyway.
