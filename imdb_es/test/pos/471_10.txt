This was a fantastic movie about two people, a young teenager and the other, a middle-aged man, who are looking for someone to help them fill a void left by loved ones. <br /> <br /> Both actors give brilliant performances with which different audiences can relate. The script, although written by Gorman Bechard, seems to have been written from a woman's point of view. And at the same time, men can relate to male characters because of how well they developed and described in the film. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves it to you. Speechless. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one. It is clear in this movie that you are not alone.
