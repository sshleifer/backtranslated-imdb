It is worth seeing the reader's summary. O Time, if it was the original source of the article that served as an alleged inspiration for Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece. Based on the true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her biological parents, Mr. Ratnam paints a classic that rivets as much as reprimands, appreciates as much as criticizes and preaches as much as practices. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The bad feeling that precedes the new struggles in the north of Sri Lanka? The chaotic home of a family headed by an engineer-author of firebrand and 3 adorably naughty children? Or that turbid region where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of unbelieving and sinister ideologies and events? From any point of view, this film is worth to be in your collection, if you like the convincing dramas of Mani Ratnam. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ratnam is a master of the past in mixing fiction stories with real-life incidents and in this film, he oozes lessons by adapting two real-life stories into one. I will not go into the story as it looks better than reading. But, I will stop at the impact it had on me and why, despite everything that happens in this world, it can not destroy that simple but inexhaustible force called hope. <br /> <br /> Innocence in its purity, it can not understand the complex desires of adult decadence and greed. Nor does he recognize the dangers when accompanied by fierce determination to seek what he wants. It is such an innocence that drives Amudha to look for her biological parents, despite warnings that they could get lost in the cauldron of civil war. Having survived a terrifying experience of conversing with a man with physical disabilities only to realize that he is a more lethal entity in disguise, Amudha adheres to his cause in a way that topples the resistance of his supporters. And finally, when the two meet, mother and daughter, the meeting is so tense with emotion that even the temperamental adoptive father is reduced to tears. With the help of a background score by A R Rahman, the scene that follows is poignant to melt even the heart of stone: a list of questions that Amudha has to ask her biological mother. In a culmination as dramatic as the sequence of incidents that lead to it, a child discovers his mother, living in body but lost in spirit. Realizing that she has no hope of staying with the one who bored her, Amudha makes her adopted mother what the title of this film means: a kiss on the cheek. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, the path is clearly marked by the brilliant PS Keerthana. Mr. Ratnam has the gift of extracting spectacular performances from little-known children's artists, but this should not take away anything from Keerthana for an award-winning performance. With a capable cast of Madhavan (Thiru), Simran (Indira) and the great Nandita Das (Shyama), he adorns the scenes in almost every frame he is in. The music may not be as memorable as other Rahman offers, but still. it did not prevent him from obtaining another National Award for the best musical direction. "Vellai Pookal" is as much an ode to the need to appreciate human life as it is to nature. The dialogues are first class (it shows the touching exchange that Amudha and Indira have on the swing, shortly after the revelation that she is not the biological daughter of Indira) and the cinematography, excellent. <br /> <br /> This film is a clear statement of how to let your arms fall as much as it is to respect life and human expressions. Do not judge it as a lesson in making movies; you will only lose the experience of one of the best of the stable Mani Ratnam-A R Rahman.
