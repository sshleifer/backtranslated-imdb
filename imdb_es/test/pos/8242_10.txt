As a child who grew up in Sydney in the 1950s, I can easily identify with the content of this good movie. Each week I visited the Wynyard Newsreel cinema on George Street to see Cinesound's shorts (and generally 3 Stooges). There has never been a better combination of B / W and color in a movie. Impeccable production values ​​complete a cinematic experience that will never be forgotten.
