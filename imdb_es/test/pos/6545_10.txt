I remember seeing this movie many years ago on VHS in a place of friends. At first I thought it would be a boring car movie. But to my surprise, it ended up being one of the best movies I remember seeing at the time. <br /> <br /> It has a good history and, best of all, it has some amazing Australian cars and street races. I really liked Fox's car more, which was a working Dodge Charger. The painting work that was done on this car was really exceptional in my opinion :)! <br /> <br /> There is also a 57 black Chev with two doors that appears in the movie later. <br /> <br /> I actually managed to get a copy of this movie on VHS last year at K-Mart here in Australia. I had plans to convert this movie to DVD, since I think it's a movie worth turning. But to my surprise this weekend, while I was browsing the DVD movie container, I found it on DVD. So, of course, I grabbed it while I could, since it was the only copy there was. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you really want to see some classic street racing with high-powered cars, including a great story without a rice burner. view. Then this movie is for you !!!! <br /> <br /> Here is additional information taken from the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Will win at any cost Fox is a young Man who lives in the fast lane. He believes he is the fastest man on the road, but street racing is illegal. If he does not accept his last challenge, he could lose his girl ... If he accepts, he could lose his life. Living dangerously, living fast and winning at any cost is your obsession. They do not turn around, they do not give up ... and they do not ask for help.
