I saw this movie last night and I thought it was decent. It has its moments that I suppose you would say. Some of the scenes with the special operations forces were great, and some of the location shots were very authentic. I will not put this movie in my DVD collection, but it's fair enough to recommend the rental. I suppose that nothing puts the film on another level compared to others of the same genre. The action is good, the acting is decent, the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion, and the story is quite interesting. 7 out of ten
