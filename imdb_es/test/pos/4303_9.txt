What cast of actors and actresses in this episode of Columbo, with Peter Falk, has Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancee, Julie Newmar, who plays the role with such delicacy. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman in the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talent and reprimands the sloppy and often typical behavior of Columbo with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Everyone who accuses the other of murdering his uncle for money. Well, you only have to see and see the result, but I can assure you that it's always worth seeing for the cast and crew.
