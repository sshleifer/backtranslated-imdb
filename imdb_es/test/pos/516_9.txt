I did not see this movie until it appeared on TV because I had doubts about comic book movies. From the series "Batman", "Spawn", "Judge Dredd" and many other pitiful bombs p.g.-13, I dodged everything at all costs. I would ask myself in my mind: "Why can not someone make a film that has an R rating and stays true to the story? How hard is that?" And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. This film appears directly on the screen with pure violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, good against evil, etc. Yes, sure many action movies contain all these things, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the film was filmed correctly, without going overboard, offering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is great, but not as great as the first one. Blade is in fact one of the best real comic movies I've seen in a long time.
