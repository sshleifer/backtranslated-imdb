When I saw this movie at age 6, I was in the CHILDREN section of Erols Video because it was animation. We saw it and it was a completely different ball game! A very violent story and graphic deaths are VERY entertaining and convincing, but not for children. Avoid to see the family, my mother almost had a heart attack and destroyed the video
