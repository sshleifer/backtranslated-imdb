I love pop culture, but I was a little worried when I first heard this. So, I've seen an episode, and I love it! I was a little annoyed when I discovered that Christopher Eccelson was no longer playing Doctor Who. It was probably the best they had. It fits the character very well. It is sad to see it go. I really do not think the new guy is going to get the doctor as much as Eccelson. <br /> <br /> I think everyone can overlook the kitschy effects in some places and creatures, like liquors. The lines of the story and the characters can more than make up for that. I am currently waiting for the second season and I will also revise it, in case, for any reason, the quality decreases. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think everyone should try to watch an episode. I did it, and I've been loving it ever since. Well written, well cast and well produced, this show is worth watching. Doctor Who receives a 10/10
