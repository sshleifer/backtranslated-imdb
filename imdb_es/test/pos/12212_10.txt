When I started watching "Surface" for the first time, I was hooked. He had everything he wanted in a show of suspense, action, mystery, great plot and a great cast of characters. My whole family loved watching the show. It seems when there is a great program on television, the network usually cancels it as it seems to do with this program. They follow Nielson's classification system, which I think is stupid because there is a lot of junk that seems to see the networks follow the air. If there was only one way for everyone to vote in a program, then maybe good programs will not be canceled. When I watch TV now I only see good shows, so now I do not watch much television. I hope the network will show the program again, but when they decide on a silly decision, they seem to keep it. I hope there are many people who feel the same way.
