This is a very long movie, by the way. But it is quite beautiful, and it is a good example to show why cinema can be considered art. You can not expect an easy story to tell in Les Amants RÃ©guliers, but every scene, every silence here says much more than a hundred dialogues. Poignant, different, perfect in its images and soundtrack, showing why the approach of the cinema as one of its main characteristics became the greatest innovation in any dramatic representation. Someone who is used to that kind of movies where everything is told and the action takes place all the time, will find this exhausting. But it is worth looking, to discover other possibilities of feeling a story.
