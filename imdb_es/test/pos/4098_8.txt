I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and I loved it. Since then, I searched for a video, but I never found it until now, 33 years later, when I asked Moviehunter. I'm sorry to say that he can not stand. This glamorous version can not rise to the production level of 1937. I love the musical score of Burt Bacharach, that is, if I listen to it alone, and even bought a CD, but for my taste it does not lend itself well to this mysterious and convincing history. It just does not fit. Michael York is lost here. Sally Kellerman offers a good performance, but Olivia Hussy is just ridiculous and it's not worth dragging her through the Himalayas. The best performance is Charles Boyer as the boss Lama.
