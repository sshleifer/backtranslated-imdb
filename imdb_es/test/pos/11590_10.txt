There is nothing here that is false or manipulative on your part. After all, he relies on facts that were well known in his country, since this case became a "famous cause" in favor of euthanasia, a topic that nobody in that country wanted to deal with in Spain. <br /> <br /> With its background of being a predominantly Roman Catholic country, Spain has become one of the most democratic societies in Europe, a distinction that is most notable due to its long years dominated by a dictator.

Suddenly they must leave everything aside to take care of him at home. His brother and sister-in-law are stoic people who deal with the situation in fact. Their lives become a last-minute idea, because Ramón's life comes first. They tend to the sick man without protest, or blame Ramon for the sacrifices they must make to keep him alive. <br /> <br /> That's why, in their minds, the Sampedros can not understand Ramon's wishes to finish it. everyone. Have not you given up on having a normal life to take care of him? This moral problem weighs heavily on these simple and uncomplicated people because in their mind, they are doing what came naturally. <br /> <br /> The second theme of the film is the legal problem of euthanasia and the well-intentioned people that suddenly, enter the life of Ramón in his desire to help him end his suffering.

There's Rosa, the worker of the fish canner who falls in love with Ramon. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem, makes a brilliant Ramon Sampedro. Its transformation is total. We do not doubt at a moment that he is nobody but the man paralyzed in that bed. Mr. Bardem can only use his face to convey all the emotions trapped within Ramon. Mr. Bardem makes this man real. This is perhaps the best role of Javier Bardem in his career. He overcomes his own award-winning performance as Reynaldo Arenas, the Cuban poet he played in "Before Night Falls". <br /> <br /> In the supporting roles, Belen Rueda, makes an impressive appearance as Julia, the woman who fights against her own physical problems. Lola Duenas is also effective as Rosa, the soulmate who deeply loves Ramón. Celso Bugallo, like Ramón's brother, shows a man at a crossroads of his own life.
