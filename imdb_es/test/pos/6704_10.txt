Lifeforce (1985) was a film financed by Cannon directed by Tobe Hooper. It is a very interesting film about a couple of space vampires that are accidentally taken to Earth during the last mission of the space shuttle. Steve Railsback stars the only survivor of the tragedy. But the truth is that the film is a mere showcase of the natural beauty of Mathilda May. She is one of those who smoke the most. The director was a big fan of Female Vampire (a.k.a. Erotikill). Miss May recreates the main role of Lina Romay. The film is beautifully photographed and directed. There are many gore effects to keep fans of genres happy. <br /> <br /> I have to give this movie a very high rating. Tobe Hooper was the man. He made three interesting films for Cannon during this time period (Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and Invaders from Mars as well). If you like sci-fi / horror movies, the films of Tobe Hooper or Mathilda May, this movie is up to you. <br /> <br /> The highest recommendation! <br /> <br /> Did I mention that Mathilda May is smoking?
