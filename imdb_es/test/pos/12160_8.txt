With all of continental Europe under his control, Hitler prepares for the last hurdle on his way before heading to North America, Great Britain. With an overwhelming advantage in airplanes, Goering's Luftwaffe seems unstoppable on paper. However, once in the air, the RAF tenaciously interrupts the paradigm by expelling the enemy from the air of the sky at a speed of seven to one. The Battle of Britain continues for more than a year, as the island nation is bloodied but not committed, providing a crucial moment for its American allies to produce more weapons for the inevitable struggle. <br /> <br /> Using more scenes on stage than the three previous documentaries of the series Why We Fight, Battle of Britain has a more propagandistic feel with the dramatized scenes (some with the unmistakable Warners music) obvious scenes for news . In an ironic twist amid the devastation caused by German air strikes, Beethoven's Seventh Symphony is used to highlight visual suffering. The story itself is of extraordinary value from a defiant nation that refused to give in to the devastating attacks inflicted by her up to that point in an invincible war machine. It is the 20th century version of the 300 Spartans. <br /> <br /> More research has been thoroughly researched and better commercial efforts have been made in this battle since this film, but the immediacy and motivation that the Battle of Britain provided will always make it a more valuable document of England during your "finest hour"
