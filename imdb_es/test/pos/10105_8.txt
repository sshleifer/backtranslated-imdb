I just saw "A Tale of Two Sisters" last night and I enjoyed it a lot. I've been a big fan of Asian horror movies recently and I think this is an important entry for South Korea. There are not many shocks that scare you like in the American horror movie, but the director keeps the bad mood and the bad feeling very good, especially in the uncomfortable interactions between the characters. Most of the fears are more conceptual and reproduce the fears of when "there is something under the bed" from when they were children, but in this case, it is the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director could capture how dysfunctional this house is through scenes like the first dinner that the characters have together. It is also good to reveal the inner life and fragility of people through simple scenes, such as the stepmother who cleans her makeup in the mirror or the one sitting in front of the flickering television. I think this movie is mainly an exploration of the guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you. <br /> <br /> THE MAIN SPOILERS TO CONTINUE) I was following the story quite well, but I started to get confused during the drag part of the bag. However, I think the flashback at the end definitely united everything. The film is very similar to "The Machinist" in the way that two of the character's joint guilt eventually lead to mental disorders and delusions. <br /> <br /> Here is my interpretation of the movie. The Su-Yeon that we see after the girls supposedly return to the house is the Su-Mi deception or the real Su-Yeon ghost that only Su-Mi can see and interact with. The initial stepmother we see is, in my opinion, an illusion of Su-Mi. However, there is a real stepmother, and appears for the first time in the movie when wearing the gray suit. I think she's the real stepmother the father is talking to on the phone during the first part of the movie and she does not show up until he picks her up and takes her home. The stepmother before that moment is imagined by Su-Mi (maybe part of her double personality?) That explains the strange sequence of the dinner when the stepmother's brother looks at her as if she were crazy and does not remember anything of what counts . I think it was Su-Mi representing his stepmother part of his divided personality. The film shows this later in the bag dragging the scene and scenes like the stepmother who cleans the makeup in the mirror, which then reveals that it is really Su-Mi, who cleans the makeup in the mirror. <br /> <br /> I believe that the ghosts of the house are not totally imagined by Su-Mi, and are of Su-Yeon or of the mother or both. In the final flashback, it is revealed that Su-Yeon wore the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress they showed earlier in the ghost sitting on the dining table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. In addition, it is the fork that Su-Yeon wore in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink. <br /> <br /> The real stepmother, in the end, is punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who comes in a scene a bit like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene unites everything in terms of how both the stepmother was primarily responsible for his death, while Su-Mi unintentionally played a supporting role. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the "mother" that Su-Yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback, is already a ghost. Maybe at this point the mother had already committed suicide in the closet. That remains ambiguous. <br /> <br /> Other things that are suggested, but are not clearly explained in the film, is that it seems that the stepmother, at some point, was a nurse, maybe taking care of the mother and somehow Han also contributed to his death. It is not clear when his relationship with the father began and if it caused the mother to commit suicide. It is also suggested that the mother also had mental problems, which require a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi, that you are beginning to persecute your mother. I do not think he referred only to the physical. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, if we accept that the initial stepmother we see is actually Su-Mi, there is also the suggestion of incest, since the father sleeps with her. . Is that why Su-Mi is scared and screams: "Do not touch me" every time the father looks for her in later scenes? Are those the "dirty things you've done" that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father? This movie is interesting because of its capacity for different interpretations. However, some of the scenes were derived, like the woman in the black tracking scene, which reminded me of Kayako's movements in the Ju-On / The Grudge movies. In addition, the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her fair desserts reminds the Ring. In addition, only the idea that some characters can be ghosts is taken from "The Sixth Sense" or "The Others". <br /> <br /> In general, I enjoyed it, however, and it will be interesting to see how The new Hollywood version (which is already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both "The Ring" and "The Grudge", so I'm not one of those boastful guys who insist that remakes can not be good too. A remake that I'm really excited about is the release of "Dark Water" this summer. I have not yet seen the original Japanese version, but both films are definitely on my list to see.
