Peter Boyle was always a great actor and he showed it by his performance as a fan of weapons, and made me hate him every time he used the word "N". I watched him and his big mouth and I wanted to turn off his lights. (Just think, Peter Boyle was once a monk) (Now a supporting actor in "Everybody Loves Raymond") Susan Sarandon who makes her first debut needs a bath immediately and enjoyed sharing it with someone else in her own dirty water. I noticed that a great Raggerty Ann Doll (the creator, John Gruelle) was the only thing Susan could really trust and love, and the doll appeared in a few scenes. If you really want to know how the 70s got away with drugs, free love and dreams, then enjoy the excellent address of John G. Avildsen ("Rocky and" The Karate Kid "). I always thought that Peter Boyle should have been Hallucinated in the end, this is definitely a cult classic that is worth seeing and sharing with others.
