It takes a while to adapt to the sound of Sons of The Pioneers, but then you enjoy it. If the soundtrack were performed by an orchestra like Max Steiner or Dmitri Tiomkin, it would lose its folk character. Music directs the film, everything seems to follow its rhythm. The whole cast is excellent. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. are the young people who guide the caravan. Ward Bond is the Mormon leader and Joanne Dru is a flirtatious actress. Ford could do what would be a common western, something totally different and original that shows us music, dances and, above all, people.
