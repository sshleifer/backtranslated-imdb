I loved this show. He used to leave the pub ten minutes before closing and running down the road to catch him. I remember Daniel Peacock's sketch of Gandhi in newsstands as a masterpiece. The stage design and lighting were out of this world, creating an atmosphere in which you felt you really lived. Unusual V for a comedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I've only met another person (apart from the other reviewer here) who once knew that this program existed. In fact, I have to thank the IMDb for its existence and show me that, in fact, I had not imagined the entire series in a drunken haze, which I was beginning to believe!
