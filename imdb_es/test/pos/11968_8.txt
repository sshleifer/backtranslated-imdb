When I went to see this documentary about the musicals of the communist bloc, I expected something totally insane, in the line of a communist "Cop Rock". Some scenes were published, including an exciting clip from a Soviet movie called "Tractor Drivers". <br /> <br /> You would think that the filmmakers have the task of making ideologically correct musicals that sing, dance and propose the Party line. Facing the insurmountable odds. And yet, one of the surprises of "East Side Story" is that some of the films presented really looked promising. One was an effort in the mid-1950s in East Germany called "My wife wants to sing", in which, as its title implies, an unhappy hausfrau seeks to start a singer career over her husband's objections to traditional mentality. <br /> <Another really interesting looking film, also from East Germany, was called "Midnight Revue". In this film within a film, the producers simulate their own creative situation with the story of a group of filmmakers under the orders of the Party to make a musical. (The same filmmakers on the screen can do a musical number on how to avoid "too hot" themes that recall the tone of the 1957 film "Silk Stockings"). <br /> <br /> The documentary is marked by a somewhat insipid narrative, but it's still very fun to watch. (Look for the final dedication to the person who made everything possible).
