A pretty nice kidnapping adventure set in New Orleans, but its main drawback in my opinion is that it contains too much political intrigue and double crossing, and not enough of young and attractive actors, scenes of vibrant colors, original cinematographic style and biting. humor. These aspects combine to offer a refreshing and daring cinema, which makes a lot of recent things unbearably boring. Let's hope that Sébastian Gutiérrez continues with that talent: he seems a talent to be careful. The mismatched set of petty criminals in the film is surpassed by the research association of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, the humor of whose scenes it is very necessary to make the film what it is. The couple performs their obligatory corrections of the south as well as the Yankees, and it is a delight to hear these two British film stars clashing with each other with a Lethal-Weapon style fluency ... just a pity that the only scenes That having the opportunity to steal are exclusively theirs. Anyway, with a little less politics and authoritarianism (!), The film would be almost perfect, so I'll give it a healthy 8/10 and I hope some people remember it a little better than the box office.
