I do not think it includes any spoilers, but if I do, I can cover my butt. "The Last American Virgin" came at a time when teenagers of the age / sexual adventures of high school were delirious. Movies like "Prepies" (1984), "Hot Times" (1974) and the popular "Porky's" (1981) earned a lot of money. However, it is the "last American virgin" that actually has a more serious argument in the midst of nudity and sexual situations. It is the story that is often told of three high school friends who want to lose their virginity. Go to the wrong places (prostitutes), the dangerous ones (older woman with jealous boyfriend) and the convenient ones (attract their female high school counterparts). The movie has many fun moments, and although the cast did not produce a great movie star, it is worth remembering a fantastic 80s soundtrack that includes: Devo, The Cars, Journey and others. For today, the standards are rude and could have obtained an NC-17 rating, but it is a well-told story of how sometimes personal fixation can only bring pain, while love may be right in front of us. It is a small piece from the 80's that is worth having in your movie collection.
