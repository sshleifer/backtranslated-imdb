Well, unlike most people ... I went into this movie hoping it was not so good and it turned out to be an amazing movie. Very good plot I love the idea, but what really made this movie were the actors. They all did an amazing job and it was great to see Fishburn and Dillon work together. It's a movie that you enter immediately and you can predict what will happen, but it does not turn out exactly as you predicted. I do not want to reveal anything about the story, so I will not ... but I suggest giving it a chance. If you saw the movie Money Train and you liked it, you would love this movie. Maybe everything Lawrence Fishburn plays is gold?
