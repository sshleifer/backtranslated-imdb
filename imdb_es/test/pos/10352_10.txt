When I saw this on TV, I was nervous ... what if it got spoiled? Millions of families like mine who live with a man with brain damage, in my case, my dad, will be disappointed. I saw him with my mother and we both ended up crying, he was so precise and he captured how the family and the person who has suffered the brain injury feels. The actors were wonderful and I had no complaints, my moms told me that I could not stop thinking about it. I hope that this program has made many people realize what it is like to live with brain damage and how it is for families. There should be more programs like this, I was surprised at how good it was and it really shook me emotionally.
