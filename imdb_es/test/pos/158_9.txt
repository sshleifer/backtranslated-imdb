Thirst <br /> <br /> I found that this movie was beautifully crafted. The cinematography was well above excellent. I thought that almost any frame could freeze, and you would have an exquisite photograph. The use of color is the one that stands out the most. In many cases, the camera slid around the scene and the work was impeccable. The direction of Park Chan Wook was fantastic. He made me believe in his implausible universe unbreakable. There were several touches of verbal and visual humor (of a dark nature) that only added another depth to the image as a whole. <br /> <br /> The performance would not call outstanding, but it adapted to the film and it worked well enough. <br /> <br /> For me, the only place where this film lacked was in history. Sometimes, I will not lie, the events between the characters just did not make sense. Sometimes the flow of history was clumsy. In general, I was disappointed by the tenuous narrative and felt that it lasted too long. <br /> <br /> But I still recommend this movie, because of its vision, its visual flourishing, its dark mood and, in general, At the end of the day, it is an interesting but imperfect film. 9/10
