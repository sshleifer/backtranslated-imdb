Many films try to take universal themes and make a comedy; but few will rise to the occasion like "Checking Out". The movie is brilliant. The dialogue is well written and true to form. The acting is absolutely premium. Peter Falk has given a great performance, as an actor; as an actor. He is able to bring the cast to greatness. Another great performance is given by Laura San Giacomo. She is such an intriguing actress. His performances take him by surprise. Whatever it is, no matter what role they ask, from wacko on Stephen King's "The Stand" to his television appearances. However, "Checking Out" allows it to shine. It is a role that you are destined to play. The film is brilliantly directed by Jeff Hare. He was able to get the best out of his cast and his direction, in all aspects, made the movie a wonderful treasure. Jeff Hare was able to make a difficult subject laughable and profound. He gives us a close and personal look at why independent films should be made. The knowledge of the directors of their cast and script extends to the finished film. The results are excellent. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, it will be available to large audiences because it is one you do not want to miss. It has the potential to be the dormant success of 2005, in the style of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding".
