He kept me on the edge of my seat. It is true that history has some holes in the plot, but the great tension of it, the way in which the director continues to challenge the premise is simply fascinating. <br /> <br /> Jos√© Coronado and Adriana Ozores are two of the best actors in Spain (see La vida stain and Hector) and here they appear as a happy middle-high class couple. Underneath everything, the truth is that Coronado's whole life is a lie. He is not an economist, he never went to university or he does not work in the Reserve of the Central Bank of Spain, as everyone else believes. We get some ideas on how he kept up appearances or managed to do it, and although it's not very plausible, it's still credible. <br /> <br /> The internal workings of the scam are shown intermittently, but it is credible because Coronado is a source of self-confidence and assertiveness. He not only believes in the scam, but also believes in the premise of the movie, and therefore carries it. <br /> <br /> Sure, it tests the belief that a wife would not know the inner workings of a marriage's finances for almost 10 years, but again, since she is supposedly a brilliant economist. <br /> <br /> It has been said, in a nationalist tone, that the film is not "clearly Spanish", as if it were a test of fire forever. movie. It's true, there are no castanets or weird cabaros in this, just a tense thriller. You will want to know how this story ends once you begin to see it.
