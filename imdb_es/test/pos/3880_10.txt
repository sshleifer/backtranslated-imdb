I thought it was brilliant! It was great to see the presenter track each one of them. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed his appearance, not even Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as disillusioned! However, I thought Mr. T looked thinner, but it was still great to see how he looked after himself all this time. I thought it was necessary to keep track of the other cast members, like the one who played Decker and the lady who played Amy. It was a pity that Mr. T could not make the actual meeting. It was also a great shame that George Peppard had died, thus leaving a gap, so to speak. Now I just wish I had recorded it to save it. Hopefully they will repeat it again.
