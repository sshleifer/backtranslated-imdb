A very positive message for our youth is shown in this film. Through the sport of rugby as a means, a rugby coach of High School directs its players in their behavior and lifestyle, on and off the field. <br /> <br /> The acting and the direction are good. The rugby shots are fine if you know something about rugby or really great if you do not know much about it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, it's worth watching, especially at a time when this sport is winning. More and more followers every day. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a true story that takes place in Utah. The coach represented in this film has been in command of the Highlanders for more than 30 years (and losing only the game every 3 years). <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
