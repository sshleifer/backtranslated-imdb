The first, and much better, of the two gay roles of Kevin Kline. (The second is the lugubrious "De-Lovely" in which he played Cole Porter.) Inspired by Tom Hanks' emotional acceptance speech for "Philadelphia" in which he exposed his high school drama teacher, the film nominated in this version was obviously more "Forrest Gump" than "Philadelphia." Here, the character of Hanks is played by Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> The reaction scenes in most of the movie are very funny and, as has been pointed out often, they are especially effective as did Kevin himself, Debbie Reynolds. Tom Selleck (a brave move since he himself was the target of such rumors, which he denied!), Bob Newhart and Joan Cusack as the eventually abandoned future wife. <br /> <br /> The real teacher of Tom Hanks criticized the graduation scene saying that people do not act that way in real life. But this is a farce and not real life. That said, it's not as effective as it could be, and the deviation from the final "wedding scene", which makes it seem that Tom and Kevin are about to get hooked, seemed pretty useless, annoying and a police outlet. <Br /> <br /> The highlight of the film for me is, of course, Kevin's scene with the audio tape of how to be a real man and it's hilarious, but it's certainly not quite realistic when the tape Reacts to Kevin's. Actions. <br /> <br /> In general, a scream!
