I have not seen so many people packed out of a theater since Star Wars Episode III. Both shows sold out, and for good reasons. The Man With the Screaming Brain was the best movie to watch with a crowd full of geeks. (Hey, I'm an idiot, too) <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell was present and had the whole crowd in points! The movie was corny in the best possible way. It may be the funniest movie Bruce has ever made. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian expressions of hip hop and facial expressions, it's a racket of laughter! Who knew Ted could rape? <br /> <br /> I changed my mind, the person who stole the program was actually a robot. There's nothing more fun than a robot ... do the robot. <br /> <br /> As for Bruce's performance: "I take the fifth one". Thanks Bruce Thanks for being cool, thanks for taking the time, thanks for all the fun.
