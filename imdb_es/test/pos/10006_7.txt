I felt that this movie had many good qualities. The cinematography was certainly different when exposing the scenic aspect of the set and the history. The original characters as actors were certainly an achievement and I felt very well interpreted quite convincingly, of course they are, but definitely unique. Cultural aspects can leave many disappointed, as familiarity with Chinese and Eastern culture will answer many questions about parent-child relationships and the stigma attached to drug use. I found the story of Jia Hongsheng interesting. On a negative note, the story is in Beijing and some of the fashion and music stink at the beginning of the 90s, although this was done in 2001, so it is sometimes quite corny (the garbage of the Beatles, etc.). . Whatever it is, it's not a top ten or twenty, but if it's on TV, take a look.
