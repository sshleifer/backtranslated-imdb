Undoubtedly the most impressive gay orientation movie I've seen. C. Jay Cox hit the nail on the head with this one. The way he handled matters related to faith, family and sexuality was very well done. The casting was perfect. Wes Ramsey did a fantastic job of removing Christian's character and Steve Sandvoss will leave him in the role of Aaron. Both brought an incredible amount of realism to the roles and impacts that these problems have on young gay men. As a gay man who grew up in a very religious (though not Mormon) environment, the identification with Aaron's character was phenomenal to me. I strongly recommend this film to anyone, faithful or not, who is interested in knowing how young gay people have to deal with family and friends in an often hostile world. By the way, the music of this movie is great! Another great work by C. Jay Cox.
