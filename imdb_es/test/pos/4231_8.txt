The first children's game was a small original and effective horror movie. As expected, the 2 horrible sequels seemed to be the end of this franchise. <br /> <br /> Well, when I heard they were doing a fourth call "Chucky's girlfriend", I just rolled my eyes and muttered "... when will they learn?" <br /> <br /> but when I found out that they had achieved a great director, Ronny Yu and a solid cast that included the inspiring Jennifer Tilly, my interest in her was encouraged. <br /> <br /> this movie is very well made. she has a great sense of humor, a highly stylized graphic violence, a great photography and the incredibly sexy Jennifer Tilly that highlights her most impressive things during the first half. (I must add that she is also a fantastic actress). <br /> <br /> keeps his tongue firmly on his cheek without turning to a country territory. The effects of the dolls are great and the verbal interaction between them is priceless. It is more of a horror / comedy than a direct horror, but humor is welcome and well integrated. <br /> <br /> I already heard that you are planning a son of Chucky. If you can match the quality of this movie, maybe this franchise will have had a legitimate return. <br /> <br /> rating: 8.5
