I understand that "Checking Out" will probably be released in the US theaters. UU In June of 2006, and on DVD in November of 2006. My recommendation is that you do not miss "Checking Out"! This comedy film will entertain everyone, who will relate to the characters, family relationships and the multiple social problems that are described. "Checking Out" will make you laugh at all times with a quick and intelligent humor integrated into almost every line, and it will also make you cry in a positive and moving way. <br /> <br /> The subject of suicide is treated in a comical way, which at the same time can help people who consider it to understand the impacts that this act can have on those who have touched in their lives and in their lives. those who love them. Hopefully, "Exit Control" can have a positive impact and help prevent people considering suicide from doing so, especially in the 16 to 25 year old group that has the highest suicide rate in the US. UU <br /> <br /> The script is beautifully written, perfectly fused and loaded with synchronicity and significant flashbacks in time, whose importance becomes more evident throughout the film and especially at the end. I think the script is worthy of an Academy Award nomination for "Best Screenplay, Play to a Movie" (The Phoenix Film Festival received the "Checking Out" award with a "Best Screenplay Award"). <br /> <br /> The cast is full of great self-made actors, and they have a long history of great performances, nominations for acting awards and victories. I feel that Peter Falk's performance in "Checking Out" is worthy of an Academy Award nomination, and is the most challenging and comprehensive of his career. The performance and chemistry of Laura San Giacomo with Peter Falk as her father is a teacher, and was recognized at the Palm Beach International Film Festival with a "Best Actress Award". <br /> <br /> Even the teen characters in the film shine and Dan Byrd (movies: a story of Cinderalla with Hilary Duff, 3 nominations for the Young Artist Award, Won 1) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (TV: Monster Island , Wolf Lake, Passions, Touched by an Angel, 2 Young Star Nominations). <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare and producer Mark Lane wonderfully develop the characters, their interrelationships and the storyline of this entertaining, fun and complex script. <br /> <br /> The editing of the film keeps the pace of the film moving quickly, only by appropriately reducing the moving scenes, so that the audience never loses interest from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie you can take. The whole family will see it and everyone will enjoy it.
