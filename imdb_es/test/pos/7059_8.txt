Camp North Star and his extraordinary counselor, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray) will surely want to end a decades-long losing streak to compete with Camp Mohawk, an ivy-league-type place that only wealthy children can attend. Meanwhile, we watch how Tripper tries to fall in love when he flirts aimlessly with fellow counselor Roxanne (Kate Lynch) while other teen counselors pair up and also fall head over heels. The film comes to the head at the Camp Olympiad when rivals face competitive athletic competitions with Tripper almost realizing that they are doomed to fail one more year. The film also shows the growing bond between Tripper and Rudy (Chris Makepeace's fame of "Vamp"), whose father is often absent all the time. Rudy does not seem to fit in with other kids his age and seems to spend most of his time running in the mornings with Tripper or taking his peanuts in Blackjack. "The film contains, mostly, hi-jinx of fellow teen camp counselors who engage in nonsense. <br /> <br /> You have sensational consultants, the total nerd Spaz (Jack Blum) with his glasses with Adhesive tape and bad acne, beak peak "Hardware" (Matt Craven), who likes to exploit things, the fat Fink (Keith Knight), who often gets stuck in the face, among others in the movie. basketball game in which poor Spaz can barely bounce the ball against his rival Camp Mohawk let alone shoot a precise shot with poor Fink throwing the fly balls between his knees that sail over the board. (with a creepy tale of Tripper about a killer with a hook) and children drooling over the beautiful ladies. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that sometimes it's desperate to try to squeeze out every laugh I can and, occasionally, enjoy lapses of sentimentality (like the scenes with a Makepeace and Murray sad), but as much as in this recent observation, I found myself laughing. I'm licked and I can not help but love this. It is a summer camp movie through which he simply wants to entertain you. I can not explain, or reinforce enough, the overwhelming joy that arises when I see that Murray's hand falls asleep by touching the alarm clock that is drilling aloud when he delivers a film from the summer camp that is about to begin. His intercom jokes are especially funny. But, the movie is, let's be honest, a series of comic cartoons with Murray non-stop ... there's nothing wrong with that. The movie, however, could not survive without him, right? It's hard to even think about this movie without Murray in the lead. It's a happier time and I think the nostalgia for that experience in the summer camp plays an important role in why adults still connect with "Meatballs" with gusto. And, poor Morty (Harvey Atkin), the camp boss who so much wants things to go smoothly, and who wins Camp Mohawk for a change, is the constant source of fun for Tripper and the gangs, since they often tease him ... especially when he's sleeping in his bed! Great enthusiastic cast that seems to have as much as we do.
