These cartoon writers are relentless with their kitschy (and fun) word games. The first shot we see here is an insular prison with the following written above its great doors: "Prison Alka-Fizz - No rope is a rope". Inside the prison, the first signal we see is "Welcome: sit down." Then they show an electric chair. <br /> <br /> However, Corny gives way to intelligence, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With the pen in his hand, he literally draws a door to his side and then escapes through it. At no time, has crossed the United States, crossed by Canada and is in the northern part of that country. This is where we see the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and, of course, our hero Droopy, known here as "Sergeant McPoodle." Its mission is to catch the criminal general of Alka-Fizz. Then, with his confident little blue horse, he goes out into the snow to track the wolf he wants. <br /> <br /> From that point, we get the normal story: Droopy is always one step ahead of the wolf, no matter what the latter does ... and both characters are involved in some wild and very funny visual gags . Droopy even comes out of an eagle's egg on top of a mountain. There is no place the wolf can go, or do (plastic surgery!) To escape the intrepid "Sergeant McPoodle". By the way, no one in the history of cartoons may have more exaggerated reactions than this wolf every time he sees his enemy. His screams, his face and body stretched in horror are becoming an important part of the vision. <br /> <br /> You would think that this caricature of a joke would become monotonous, but it is not like that. There are more good things about Tex Avery and the gang, just one of the 24 cartoons on the DVD "Complete Theatrical Collection" with restored images of wonderful appearance.
