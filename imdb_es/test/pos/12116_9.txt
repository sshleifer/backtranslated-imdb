This was a great anime. It is true that the animation is old, but still worth seeing and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem that was a bit long. <br /> <br /> Japanese film star Hiroyuki Sanada, who played Ujio of Last Samurai, played the main character. Jiro and was directed by Rintaro who made Galaxy Express 999 and Metropolis. <br /> <br /> The anime has a good animation for an old anime, interesting characters like the main villain Tenkai and Ando Shouzan and, of course, let's not forget it. The beautiful musical scores of the movie. <br /> <br /> Together, it's worth watching this movie for anime fans, animation in general, action and Samurai / Ninja movies. Despite the minimums in the film, the film is not a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie.
