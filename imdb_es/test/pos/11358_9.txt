Excellent and charming Justin Henry is beautiful as the blessed and mischievous Howard Kaylan, the lead singer of the band's ten best hits, The Turtles. The real magic is the titular sequence with an award worthy of the academy by Royale Watkins. A performance that completely captures the mystic and nevertheless the earth Jimi Hendrix. Not many films, incredibly like that, can find the essence of a special moment in a life and in a time. I would like to see this available at any home video store without any problems. Uh ... what's the deal? <br /> <br /> Thanks, Eddie. A worthy addition to the history of the psychedelic sixties. A definite shine in the eye of the mind.
