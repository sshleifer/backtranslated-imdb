Like most people who have seen James Bond movies 007. Most people NEVER knew that Thunderball was originally the FIRST 007 movie to be released, but after Ian Fleming, he wrote the story with kevin mcclory and jack whittingham. The other 2 authors took Ian Fleming to court and WON THE CASE, providing evidence that ian fleming took the ideas of SPECTER (Special Executive in Counterintelligence Extortion in Revenge of Terrorism). So instead of doing Thunderball (fleming, broccoli, saltzman) they did Dr. NO. <br /> <br /> This movie had the best of the best, since Sean Connery came back one more time, it was paid over 5,000,000 by NSNA. Irvin Kershner and Sean Connery had problems on the set, that's true. But overall, this movie was up there, I think with (Thunderball, License To Kill, Dr No) those are my favorites from the bonus series. David Dryer was hired for special photographic effects, he was working at that time in Bladerunner, no matter how much you never say. The 100-million-dollar yacht makes the nightclub look like a canoe. This movie was starring the best villian in a bonus movie just behind Dr. No. Klaus Maria Brandeau kept this neurotic business together quietly, with a little intelligence about her authority over the bond. Barbara Carrera was excellent as a fatima flush. <br /> <br /> The music was better than all the scores that did not contain John Barry making background music in most bond movies. Michel Legrand is not as great in the United States as in Europe, he has played with thousands of davis and many other EXCELLENT jazz musicians over the years. It's a bit tasteless at times, but the 007 theme that happens around 3 or 4 times in the movie NEVER SAYS NEVER AGAIN is so cool, I like it more than the original. <br /> <br /> 007 is back once again <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton explained it correctly, I thought, YOU CAN RELATE TO A SUPERMAN OR A SUPERHERO, you have to be human and have feelings. It was, by far, the BEST TRUE BE BOND VERSION. But Sean Connery shows that he can still play the role that made him and others follow him, I bet he is now 75 years old and could still achieve a villain role in a MCCLORY 007 movie if it ever comes up. <br /> <br />
