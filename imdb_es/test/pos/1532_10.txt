I really love this movie. It has a very real feeling. I think it was never popular due to the theme, however, due to the theme, it makes the film much more important. <br /> <br /> This is an "A" movie and I highly recommend it. If you liked the book or the movie "1984", I think you'll like this too. <br /> <br /> This is hard, to say the least, including acts of physical and mental torture, some pretty vile. Not for the week in the heart or the stomach. There is no gore, but his film is so good at projecting the mental anticipation that it does not need blood or guts. <br /> <br /> If you are not a realistic or pestimistic person, I do not think you enjoy it. . It leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling about humans, what they are capable of, and the very real possibility that our government (s) does not necessarily have our best personal interest at heart.
