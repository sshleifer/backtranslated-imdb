I saw this movie last night at a "pre-code" film festival, and I must tell you that when Gary Cooper turned his head on his first approach, the entire audience gasped. He was just so beautiful. <br /> <br /> Looks apart from Cooper, this film shows the art of director Rouben Mamoulian to perfection. Wonderful scene scenes, creative camera angles, symbolic allusions: Mamoulian continues to explore the medium of direction and comes with innovation. <br /> <br /> This was Sylvia Sidney's first role in Hollywood, after her success in New York. stage, and she is as beautiful as a leader of Gary Cooper should be. It's nice to see her on a piece of paper with a greater advantage than what she was given, so she often seems to be afraid that someone is hitting her. <br /> <br /> There are many familiar faces in this movie, including the wonderful Wynne Gibson. The most surprising thing is Guy Kibbee, best known for playing rich and fatuous men, as a smiling assassin killer. <br /> <br /> There are not enough pre-Code movies available on VHS or DVD, so if you can not find a pre-code festival near you, try doing a Turner Classic Movies campaign for a broadcast! As for the critic who believes that Gary Cooper was too stupid to have a more complex dialogue than "Yes" or "No", maybe he should consider Coop's performance in films like "Mr. Deeds goes to the city" or "Meet to John Doe. " Although heaven knows that anyone who looks so good, should not have to be smart too.
