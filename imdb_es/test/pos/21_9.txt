"The Dresser" is a small but absolutely wonderful movie, performed brilliantly by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. How in the world this little movie attracted enough attention to get the top five nominations for the Academy Award in 1983, it's a mystery to me, but it's good to know that the Academy may be guilty of a sample of good taste from time to time. when (of course, they awarded the prize that year to "Terms of Endearment" - after all, they do not want to be accused of showing TOO MUCH taste. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespearean actor in a production of "King Lear", Tom Courtenay is the man who works behind the scenes twice to keep this actor in front of the headlights.It is both hilarious and sad to see Courtenay's character bathing Finney with attention and affection, just to see their efforts totally despised and rejected, even to the bitter end. "Finney and Courtenay work wonderfully, and although Finney has the most colorful moments (after all he can recite Shakespeare), Courtenay is the cor az√≥n and the soul of the movie. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
