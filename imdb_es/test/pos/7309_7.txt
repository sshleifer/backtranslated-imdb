The film begins when a scruffy housewife (Norma Shearer) discovers that her husband (Rod La Rocque) had been cheating on her. Three years passed and apparently they had divorced during these years due to infidelity. Interestingly, during this time, La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two children when Shearer took them to Paris. <br /> <br /> Marie Dressler is a wealthy society lady and has invited a new and improved Norma to come to her house for the weekend, ostensibly to help Marie break a budding romance between her daughter and La Rocque! Apparently, Norma is now a super vampire and with her magical sex appeal, she can break the romance, and no one seems to realize that she and La Rocque were married. Several others are there for the weekend and immediately Norma is successful with her homosexual and carefree and sexy ways, and almost all men (including La Rocque) are captivated by her. Nobody tells anyone they were married, but it's obvious that their ex wants the new and improved Norma to come back! This film is a sophisticated comedy of manners among the upper class, similar in some respects to THE RULES OF THE GAME by Jean Renoir. Interestingly, despite the severity of the Depression, such films about pretty rich people were very popular, although many of them today will find them a bit too funny. However, fortunately, in LET US BE GAY, there are many cute and funny moments (especially towards the end when Marie Dressler shows her true colors). While it is not a great movie, it is certainly a good one and more than just another person who spends time. The only thing I really regret is that I did not love the end. You will only have to see it for yourself. Maybe you agree with the ending, maybe you will not, but I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this clever movie.
