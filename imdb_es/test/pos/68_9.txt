Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson were great in this movie / musical. The opening song by Mrs. Andrews, "Whistling Away the Dark," will always be on the side roads of my mind. The line of the plot during the First World War, is a great and suspense. If you are a romantic, you will love this movie. This is a movie that I always enjoy watching over and over again.
