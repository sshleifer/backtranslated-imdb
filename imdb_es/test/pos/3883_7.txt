James Aaron, a chubby actor who lives in Chicago, is a man who loves to eat things that are not good for him. That's clear from the start, since Dick, a friendly store clerk, advises him to stay away from junk food. Aaron, an actor who works in Second City of Chicago, is a loving man who does not have much luck in the love department. He still lives with his mother, a brave woman who encourages him to go out and have fun. James has another job in a kind of "open chamber" where people are prepared for unusual situations, such as surprising a mechanic and telling him that he is the father of a daughter he never knew. <br /> <br /> The day he meets his friend Larry, he knows the casting for the new version of "Marty", his favorite movie. Being a big man, he clearly identifies with the character in the movie. In many ways, James' own life parallels that of Paddy Chayefsky's creation in the image. He wants to try paper because he knows he can do justice to paper. <br /> <br /> One day he meets Beth in a fountain of soft drinks. James likes the woman, who one day invites him to go shopping with her to buy intimate clothes. He ends up having sex with her, thinking they have something good, but Beth comes up another surprise when he tells her that the reason they went to bed was because he had never done it with a fat man. After feeling disappointed, James stumbles upon an attractive elementary school teacher who seems to share his love of jazz. In the end, we see James fulfill his long dream of starring in a theatrical production of "Marty" in a nursing home. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin, who is a man of affable character, shows a talent for the type of comedy associated with his friend Larry David. Although both men differ in acting styles, their opinion of James Aaron is accurate. As a director, he has done it before, although this is an original concept he must follow. <br /> <br /> One of the assets of the film is the people involved in the project. Sarah Silverman impresses with her shot of Beth. Bonnie Hunt minimizes her role as a school teacher to get good results. Mina Kolb, is seen as her mother, a role she has played in "Stop your enthusiasm" with excellent results. Director Paul Mazursky is also present in a minor role. Joey Slotnick, Tim Kazurinsky, Richard Kind, David Pasquesi, Larry Neumann Jr., Gina Gershon and the rest of the cast make valuable contributions. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin is a talented man whose next endeavor will be welcomed by his fans.
