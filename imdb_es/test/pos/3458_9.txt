An impressive film that brought to light both the disability that usually makes people afraid. It showed how minds can be captured by bodies that are not and how difficult it must be to witness what happens to other people that are desired by the disabled individual. <br /> <br /> Love, friendship, fear, frustration, joy, humor and many other things were so well captured. The 2 main characters were very well played by the 2 actors with body and invited their laughter, tears, concern, joy and consternation. <br /> <br /> I approached this movie with a mixture of interest and fear, worried that it might be too much of a game for sympathy or to concentrate only on the negatives. However, it was a beautifully crafted story of 2 friends. <br /> <br /> I loved it.
