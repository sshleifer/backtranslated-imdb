Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget Sunday morning. Moving images are works of art that remain with you forever. Mishima falls into the latter category. This is the kind of thing that should win the Academy Awards, a brilliant visual movie that is depressing and stimulating. Instead of taking a direct look at the life of Yukio Mishima, director Paul Schrader intertwines three adaptations of the author's stories to see his past and his last day on Earth, the day he tried to take the Japanese military to the rebellion in the name of the emperor. By not doing so, he commits a ritual suicide in a final that hits you like a ton of bricks. The three adaptations of stories allow to see what led to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them look like theatrical scenes. Ken Ogata is magnificent as Mishima. Despite his eccentricities, he is very sympathetic, a man who is willing to die for his beliefs and does so. This makes the end much more devastating and the feeling of loss more significant. Of the three-story adaptations, Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kyoko House and Fugitive Horses, it is the last one that is the strongest and most emotional. It is also the story that best fits the mood of Mishima in his later years and illustrates what really took him to the events of November 1970. This review can not be complete without a mention of Philip Glass's surprising musical score . Not since 2001, a movie score has been a perfect complement to your images. Paul Schrader created one of the most beautiful films of the 1980s or of any other decade. Keep the handkerchiefs handy because the end will leave you in tears. Mishima: A life in four chapters reminds you that sometimes cinema can still be a form of art and as art is brilliant.
