Oooooh man I was glad I did not miss this. I wanted to publish this review, since this particular episode does what a certain recent movie did not do. Makes a real tribute to the DOOM game. Its plot is different, yes, and the characters are obviously established in a completely different universe (obviously the doctor who does), however, the feeling, rhythm, references and location are perfect. And for all the original Doom fans who hear the opening and closing of the door sound effect, it was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Please, all the doctors who are Doom fans, check it out. it is a jewel
