Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine excellent writing, a great production and an emphasis on smart ideas about the teenage pap smear. The two stars work very well together and, what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. Putting "Irkel" and Lee Majors in the movie were brilliant touches. Watch this movie with your children. If you do not laugh throughout this, you must not have been paying attention.
