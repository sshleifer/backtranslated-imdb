The 1970s saw a rise and fall of what we have come to know as "Blacksploitation" movies. The term is a reference to a species of broad general reach, rather than a true genre of film. In short, any comedy, drama, adventure, Western or urban thugs and policemen are shot, built and projected to attract the large black urban population of the mid-twentieth century. That could cover the broadest type of films, as long as they had an inclination toward the black population of the city center. <br /> <br /> It seems that the idea of ​​producing these films of special interest for American blacks had its genesis with the launching of Easter time of 100 RIFLES (Marvin Schwartz Prod./20th Century-Fox, 1969) . In it, Jim Brown, a former football player from Syracuse University and a pilot of several times All-Pro Full-Pro for the Cleveland Browns, had a Co-Starring Billing. Having appeared in several films already, as for example, RIO CONCHOS (1964), THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967), (ICE STTION ZEBRA (1968) * and others, it was beginning to make more sense for the studies of "Suits" that Jim it was an attractive property. <br /> <br /> Now, this 100 RIFLES brings a record number of black clients to the central business districts of the Big Cities on Easter Sunday to see Mr. Brown. to film more of These epic adventures and other types of films with more players and black stars? Why not? ** Therefore, we saw a succession of cops and robbers, private detective films and malicious comedies, all on their way Finally, we came to some of the broadest and most appealing films for the family, and those attending the film were invited to SOUNDER (1972), THE TAKE (1974), CONRACK (1974) and, finally, CLAUDINE (1974). <br /> <br /> At CLAUDINE, we did not find stigma or classification n easy as "Blackploitation" because the story is universal, and could have easily done as a story about people of Anywhere, and not just in the US. UU from the 1970s. <br /> <br /> It was the story of a single mother, Claudine (Dianne Carroll), who struggles to keep the family together after "..." Two marriages and two almost marriages "Far from being a Harlem style, the problems that afflict the citizens of our nation are confronted and examined under the sociological microscope of the old world. <br /> <br /> But we also consider the physical and psychological needs of Claudine as women For "The woman needs the man and the man must have her partner", *** and we grant this point (It is the SEX we are talking about, Schultz!) Claudine meets a very athletic man, wide-shouldered and athletic in Private Scavanger Garbage Man, Ruppert B. Marshall (James Earl Jones) and go on a date. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Great Welfare State intervenes with the couple while Claudine welfare caseworker , Miss Tayback (Elisa Loti), approaches to sniff to see who is this unattached Man, who is suddenly paying so much attention to Claudine's family. <br /> <br /> After a humiliating experience with the hearing of the Welfare Bureau and the "deduction" of the binge, which would be the norm for the family, the two decide to marry with or without the blessing of the Big Brother. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Claudine's oldest son has been involved in some great talks but little in the Black Activist group. But, with the help of Ruppert, he and all of them surpass A.O.K. <br /> <br /> Finish with a happy, optimistic and hopeful note. We know that it may not be exactly "... Happily forever", but we will do it all together! If there is only one criticism that we must affirm, it is that sometimes in a movie like this, a misconception spreads to a large part of Urban Blacks. And that is, the apparent implicit myth that all whites are rich, that they do not have anyone of their kind who needs help, has no work or suffers some disability. <br /> <br /> Well, folks, it's just not true. NOTE: * At one point, Jim Brown's career was a real success as a tough action player. I was even being tempted as "... the black John Wayne". NOTE: ** The idea of ​​producing films with All-Black Casts, filmed for All-Black consumption was not a new idea. In the 1920s, 30s and 40s, we saw productions of people like Noble Johnson, Spencer Williams, Jr. and Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> NOTE: *** That's "As Time Goes By," you know, Schultz, it's from CASABLANCA (Warner Brothers, 1942).
