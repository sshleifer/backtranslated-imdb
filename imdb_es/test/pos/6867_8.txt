I was very curious about Anatomy (also known as Anatomie) and if I went to see it, I would have to buy it since no video store in my area published the movie. As it was not a low-priced DVD, I took a chance and thought about taking a look at other comments on IMDb. Many of the comments did not give me enough hope to shell out many dollars for a movie I had never seen or had any clue. Basically I came up with the idea that it was a sexy youth-oriented romp compared to many thrillers for teenagers. Well, something in the back of my mind told me to ignore that kind of comments and buy it. I did, and I was pleasantly surprised! <br /> <br /> If you are going to compare it with any other movie, I would say it is a variation of Comma and Extreme measures. I could not see any comparison with films like Scream, Urban Legends, et al. Yes, the cast is young (it is because they are medical students! At least they are not the increasingly boring characters of high school), and yes, some are lustful (basically the character played by Anna Loos is, and it handles quite tastefully in the German language version), but the anatomy is well built, there is a tense mood at all times, the sets are amazing, the make-up effects are incredible, and Franka Potente is very believable in her paper. I found myself enjoying everything despite some holes in the plot! The story of a student who discovers a kind of secret society that performs autopsies in patients who are still alive is a pretty scary scenario and what happens to these patients afterwards is quite intelligent. Sure, you could ask why she just did not leave that city? Okay, but then the movie would end in half an hour. <br /> <br /> This was the first effort of the German part of Columbia Pictures, and it is actually quite impressive. There was a bit of care in the production and, in fact, offering some genuine emotions is an achievement. He is a bit mature in mind, since he does not resort to constant opportunities for sexual encounters (a breast festival) or juvenile jokes about drugs. The character of Anna Loos, though often making sexual comments and looking for some fun, was actually a nice touch: having a character who was a more intelligent woman than any of the men in the school. He discovered that sex was only a distraction for her and that men lacked. <br /> <br /> THE IMPORTANT: Seeing this film in the original German language with subtitles in English or French is the BEST way to enjoy it. I saw the theatrical trailers dubbed in English and I was disgusted by the change he made in the tone of the movie. I have never seen a movie properly folded in my life, they can never find voices that suit the actors or characters of the film. Sure enough, I tried to see some Anatomy dubbed in English and the level of intelligence was drastically reduced, so it seems more like a comedy. A good example is when a boy got scared when he was cut and yelled to be sewn again; listening to it in German it sounded frantic, but dubbed in English it sounded like a comedian. Frankly, I'm sick of hearing people say they can not handle reading subtitles or watch a movie in "mailbox." The anatomy appears silly with bent voices that seem too loud for any of the people seen in the film, and Anna Loos's sexual comments simply sound like terrible comments from Fast Times At Ridgemont High. I wonder if the negative comments about Anatomy are from people who saw it dubbed, it just does not look like the same movie at all! This is not a cheap horror movie and it deserves to be seen as it was created. It is interesting to note that some of the subtitles in English are different in the scenes of the show and the supplement "making of". <br /> <br /> In the end, I bet and won with Anatomy. It is a competent thriller with friendly characters and does not try to go for cheap emotions.
