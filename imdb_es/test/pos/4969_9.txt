It's been almost 50 years since I saw "Jennifer" for the first and only time. I did not know the name of this movie until I looked it up on this website, but I have told many people (especially my grandchildren) how movies do not have to include graphic details to scare you and leave a big impact. History skillfully introduces him to concepts that, if true, put Ida Lupino in a very dangerous situation. Every time Miss Lupino discovers a new "fact", she attracts the viewer to her confusion and fear. <br /> <br /> This movie has such an impact on me that almost 50 years later, I still list it as one of the most terrifying. Movies that I've never seen. However, this film does not contain the blood and blood that became popular shortly after this movie was made. It's amazing the impact that a good story and great actors can make.
