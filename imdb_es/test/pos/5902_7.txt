This is not the best Canadian film, IMO. I will not go out of the way and name 3 or 4 better. Only a couple of nights before I had seen "The Bicycle Thief", the highly rated Italian classic, and there are some parallels. Both filmmakers shot their film at a specific time and in a specific place, with minimal resources in terms of scenarios and cast. And the result in both cases is fascinating and it is a pleasure to observe the realistic environment and the characters alone. Persistent shots over faces and landscape almost make it worth seeing alone. That said, this is not exactly in the same category as the Italian classic. The film was filmed in a frigid, arid Quebec asbestos mining town. That frigidity contrasts with the warmth of the people and the eye of the filmmaker Claude Jutra. Basically, what you get is a series of vignettes that are probably nostalgic memories of Jutra (it has not, it has been funny) but they are touching, and probably sometimes difficult at that time, but now they have warmed up with the patina of nostalgia. The film snakes; There is little tension. Somewhere around half to two thirds of the story begins. Everyone you've met up to this point is involved, and you've gotten to know these characters quite well; So have a little patience at the beginning. The story is good; It will leave you thinking, and it includes sex, love and death, all the basic elements. If you like Bergman, Godard, Truffaut, all that kind of stuff, you will not be disappointed.
