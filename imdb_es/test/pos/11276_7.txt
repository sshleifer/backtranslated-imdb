I'm not really sure what to do with this movie. Very strange, very artistic. It's not the kind of movie you see because it has a plot or compelling characters. more like the kind of movie you can not stop watching because of the horribly fascinating things that happen on the screen. Although, the first time my wife saw this, she could not do it at all ... too annoying for her. It runs a little long, but nevertheless, a visualization that is worthwhile for those interested in very dark films.
