I loved this movie, I saw it when I was about 8 years old and almost seven years later, tonight I was able to see it again. I really thought I had an interesting idea, the only thing that bothered me was the ending that I felt was a way out of control. 'It's hard to find this movie around here and I was lucky to have seen it in BRAVO. I also expected to see Drew Barrymore more here too!
