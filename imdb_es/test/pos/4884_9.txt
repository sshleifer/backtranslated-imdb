league of gentleman has been the most disturbing British comedy of the television and how it can be that a funny film has such a bad qualification, simply they do not have flavor. This movie will make you want to see it again and again and still be fun. <br /> <br /> It's surprising that I've done it wrong, but it's British cinema that shits most of the time, but this time (in my words) an impulse with comedy with a giraffe goes over from Lady's, this is a top British comedy and better than dodge-ball, so it will not prove you're wrong, since I do not laugh a lot through the movies, but this movie was amazing through comedy with the Best characters, but I was a little disappointed at how much Edward and Tabb's were there to rewrite by buying this movie and you will not be disappointed.
