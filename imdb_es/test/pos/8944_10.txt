Accidentally I came across this movie in Cinemax while I was browsing the channel. I must admit that what attracted me was Christopher Walken. And the configuration was the one I would like, so I started to see it. At first I expected a serious dramatic film, and it seemed to me that it was for a while ... until I started laughing here and there, and before I knew it I was laughing so hard throughout the movie. I really like how subtle and cheerful it is, but it still has a great impact on the audience. The plot is very simple, and it is far from being too difficult to be funny as many "comedies" in Hollywood are, but it almost made me roll on the floor. A must for a good night's sleep, or at any time in that case.
