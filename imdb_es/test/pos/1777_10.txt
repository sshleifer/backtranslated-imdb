It would be great if a discussion about this feature film started with a short story about the hypocrisy of Hollywood people. It was in 1988 when Chuck Norris saw this film at the Cannes International Film Festival. He made a silly comment saying it did not make sense. The murder depicted in Dekalog 5 is far more effective than the murders that have been filmed in his Hollywood movies with him as a powerful action star. He was talking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in Kieslowski's film by a reckless psychopath who cruelly hits him with a large stone. There should be no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a decent human society. This is the reason why Chuck Norris's statement appears as a cruel joke that defends violent means in a society that is becoming increasingly restless. An honest critic would not make a mistake if he declares that Kieslowski's film "Dekalog: Dekalog, Piec (# 1.5)" has universal connotations. This is because the events described in Dekalog 5 can occur anywhere in the world. The best lesson that Kielowski gives us is about the levels of violence that are acceptable in a just society. This is the reason why the brutal murder of an innocent taxi driver is capable of causing a feeling of disgust in us. We would not feel the same hatred for homicide when it appears in the movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme, as they seem too artificial. One can easily grasp the special effects and modern study techniques. You can only love small children, but it does not make sense to movie enthusiasts. Kieslowski also defends the impotence of human beings by rescuing their fellow men from the clutches of death and misery. This is particularly interesting since time and again it has been shown that strict laws and capital punishments have not been able to prevent homicide.
