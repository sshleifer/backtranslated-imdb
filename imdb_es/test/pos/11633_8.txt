I do not understand why everyone is hating Barney. If you hate the show so much, then YOU DO NOT! It is stupid for everyone to change the son of "I love you" to "I hate you." If you do not like it, fine. Whatever, that is your opinion. But there's no point in degrading the show, when it's not even that bad. OK, so it's corny, and yes, it has its flaws, but it's a children's show. Children do not want to be sad and miserable, they want to be happy. And Barney helps that. And even in the show, there are moments of sadness and anger, etc. And yes, Barney uses magic. But children see Barney as a figment of the imagination. Children need a place to escape to express themselves. The world is a miserable and difficult place. We all need a place to express ourselves and be happier. Barney does this to us. This show is great. I saw Barney when he was younger. Yes, some people find it stupid. But I saw it, and I'm the best of my kind. It may not necessarily make you smarter, but that's not the point. I think that Barney's goal is to provide a place where children can be children and the spirit of childhood can be expressed. Where the imagination lives. So many teenagers are now unimaginative and afraid to express themselves. Barney helps encourage that. Barney helped me not to be afraid and show me what I am. I am a sophomore in high school now, an AP student with a 4.0, a drama student with a love of theater and art, and a new cousin who loves Barney. I see him with him and I enjoy it and sing along with him. Yes, it's cheesy and silly, and whatever, but it's great for kids. Who wants to be an adult who does not have time to have fun? I'm a child at heart and I love Barney. It is great for children and for those who are children at heart. <br /> <br /> It is a great show for babies and small children. So stop hating. Say you do not like it, but stop it with the "Dumbest show ever" or "Barneys a load of bull" or whatever. Save it for yourself. Take a pill for the cold or whatever. Here's something: I never liked Sesame Street. But you do not see me going: "Grover is a load of bulls" or "Cookie Monster should die" or whatever. I hate all the BULLSS ** T that people say about books or movies, like Barney or Twilight. If you hate him, okay, whatever. Nobody cares. Do not go saying hateful things about it, because you might offend someone.
