This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines when the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is unique in her gender as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love witty dialogue, it is what makes it unique in the program. Kelly Bishop is tremendously cool, since Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman are great like Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy, since Luke Danes and the members of the band are unique in their class. The community, Miss Patty, Babette, Mrs. Kim, Taylor Doose, Kirk and others always laugh out loud, are extravagant and interesting, which makes the phrases of a single style stand out. This show has changed so much over the years that it will never age. Gilmore Girls is an original and intelligent show that keeps you watching. That's how good it is. I give this show a rating of 10/10.
