Cleopatra 2525 is a very entertaining and entertaining show. You should not take the whole program seriously, but if you want to have fun, that's your television show. Being made by Xena producers is a guarantee of quality, and Cleopatra 2525 is not that different from Xena. The formula of the warriors is brought to the future, where they do not have to fight against warriors or gods, but with the dangerous robots that inhabit the surface, and humans are forced to live underground. Throughout the two seasons of Cleopatra, they develop an interesting and fun underground world, and we meet the three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). Everyone is different, but as a team, they work very well. The three main actresses appeared previously in Xena, like most of the regular / guest cast (there are also some familiar faces of Hercules or both shows). I especially liked the character played by Danielle Cormack (Ephiny in Xena), which is very different from any of her roles I knew before. So, if you liked Xena and Hercules, you'll love Cleopatra 2525. If you do not know them, try it: I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
