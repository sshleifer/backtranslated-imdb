On a routine mission in Iraq, a group of Delta soldiers recovered a computer hard drive from an Alqueda training camp that details the location of weapons specialist Dr. Walsh. After witnessing the completion of his secret weapons development program, Dr. Walsh finds an alternative funding source and establishes a new research center deep in the famous Belzan forest in Chechnya, where he is developing weapons and selling them to the rebels of Chechnya. The Deltas team is sent to a black operations mission to recover the doctor and his technology before the Russians find him and his laboratory. What the Delta team soon discovers is that the doctors' latest weapons are a flock of large carnivorous bats that have been genetically altered to develop a taste for human flesh. I thought that this movie was much better than I expected. There is a lot of action and a lot of blood. It is more or less what you would expect from a creature characteristic. The performance is not good but it is passable. I have certainly seen worse things. In general, it's a nice movie for what it is. A good movie of popcorn.
