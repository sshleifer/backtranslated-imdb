I just watched 'The League of Gentlemen: Apocalypse' at a special screening in Manchester, with Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith from the League present. <br /> <br /> In the background was Peter Kay (who has a brief cameo in The Movie) Heck with affection in the back during the question and answer session after the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was complicated (in a good way) and very funny. Follow Geoff Tipps, Hilary Briss and Herr Lipp as they try to save the fictional Rosyton Vasey from the disinterest of their creators. <br /> <br /> The League plays with a wide range of its characters and themselves (or a character based on themselves). ) and are backed by the crest of British actors and comedies such as Bernard Hill, Victoria Wood and David Warner. <br /> <br /> Warner is a particular feature that reminds me of its smooth and sharp turn in 'Time Bandidos'. <br /> <br /> The film delves into several realities and allows some of the inhabitants of Rosyton Vasey a space to grow beyond the usual limits of their comedy game. <br /> <br /> Herr Lipp, by Steve Pemberton, has a great Bretchian moment near the end of the movie and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life, which causes a lump in his throat in an unexpected moment and surprised him with his tender love for the characters. <br /> <br /> This echoes something Mark and Reece said in the Questions and Answers later, that the league's plot is tired of its famous characters being fake and that the whole movie is really a love letter for them. <br /> <br /> For a format that started as a radio character - a show based on sketches, these guys have really evolved the idea of ​​holding a movie that takes you on a journey through fiction, the "reality" ", the comedy, the tragedy and a pleasant trip for two of the less obvious characters to wear a long form. history of his 70 strange existing creations. <br /> <br /> Program fans will love it. He pays dedication and attention to detail, the uninitiated may be a bit lost, but the joy of LoG was always the ability to tune in almost instantaneously with his sharply observed characters and take the stylistic leap to farce and homage of the expressionist film. <br /> <br /> There are many tributes in this that include 'The Shining' and 'La Belle et la Bete', to name but two that I saw and deftly demonstrate their love for film and history with a segment in La England of 1690 makes a lot of sense when you're committed to the movie. <br /> <br /> What can I say, I marveled, I jumped, I started to laugh and I chuckled and they definitely achieved what many have failed. A successful comedy of British television for film translation. <br /> <br /> If you have seen and enjoyed 'The League of Knights' in the past, go see it; will enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you have not done so, rent / buy a DVD and then go see it. <br /> <br /> Well done guys and thanks for the charming and humorous Q & A.
