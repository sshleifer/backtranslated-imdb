A sparkling movie. BB is wonderful. She is sensual. She is a feminist. She is still very much in love. <br /> <br /> The film presents Paris in the 50s. It is wonderful to look at the sites, the cars (DS!) and Orly. <br /> <br /> A simple but very nice romantic comedy. The music is horrible. Almost dissonant. On the other hand it is hilarious. But it is probably the only thing that is wrong, at least looking at it with eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The film comments on the French way of dealing with infidelity. It's that modern sense. A movie like an elephant is played enormously in the 80s. But the basic premise remains the same. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the manufacturers for giving BB this opportunity.
