It does not matter if 'National Velvet (1944)' is a little trite and sometimes unconvincing, Clarence Brown's equestrian fable is a very pleasant and endearing story with good morals. After achieving modest success through her appearance on 'Lassie Come Home (1943)', the young Elizabeth Taylor, aged 12, got her first lead role as Velvet Brown, a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses. Although filmed in California, the story, adapted from a novel by Enid Bagnold, takes place in a small town in the English countryside, and Technicolor photography is used to the maximum to present the vibrant and beautiful landscapes of blue skies and green bushes. . Mickey Rooney is positioned as Mi Taylor, a mistaken ex-jockey with tortuous intentions, whose relationship with the young Velvet again awakens his sense of dignity and opens a new optimistic chapter in his life. Although he struggles remarkably in a sequence, when he must confess the traumatic experience that led him to fear the horses, Rooney is nice as the tough but passionate young man who must prove his worth. <br /> <br /> It's perhaps a good thing that Elizabeth Taylor had those fascinating violet eyes, because her acting skills, at this early age, were quite limited. His more emotional sequences, in which he shows courage and integrity in the face of adversity, give him the feeling that they are quite empty, and the touching and naive notion that simply "believing" will achieve everything is something that has since been repeated until satiety practically. All inspiring non-memorable sports films ever made. However, Taylor is bright-eyed and enthusiastic, and works well with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a child star. Anne Revere plays a very important role as the mother of Velvet, once she was a famous athlete, who not only swam in the English Channel but was lovingly trained by the father of My Taylor. I liked that Mi did not tell me until the last seconds of the movie, with Mrs. Brown correctly deciding that the young man would first have to develop his own sense of decency, instead of exploiting the memory of his deceased father for profit financial, as I undoubtedly would have done at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The film reaches its climax in the Great National Draw, where Velvet, at the last moment, decided to mount his own horse, the Pi, in the world-famous competition. Under the guise of a Latvian man, she continues, as expected, to win the race, but is then disqualified, either because she is a girl, or because she fell off the horse before she was allowed to dismount (what a stupid rule! !). This extended sequence of the race is extremely well done, as it effectively captures the nervous tension of those seconds before the race and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as the character of Rooney, trapped behind tall spectators and anxiously waiting for someone to provide an accurate update. It really does not matter that we know it's a double acrobatic that makes most of the difficulties to mount, in several scenes, we can clearly see a creepy looking man with a wig, but the positive message remains the same. I bet that 'National Velvet' has nurtured the imaginations of millions of girls over the past sixty years, and their power to inspire has diminished little over time.
