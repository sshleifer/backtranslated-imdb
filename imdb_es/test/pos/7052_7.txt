When I was a young teenager when this came out, I was completely related to that. As an adult in the current American culture obsessed with sex, she does not have enough nudity to call herself domesticated. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for jokes, vulgarities or jokes and American-style jokes, the Meatballs will disappoint with impunity and a guarantee. <br /> <br /> If you like Bill Murray, and you like fun, you probably like it and enjoy this movie a lot. Similarly with Stripes, Ghostbusters, Caddy Shack, etc. <br /> <br /> I've already said, just go see it and stop intellectualizing it. It's meatballs, to scream out loud! Why read a review? Just enjoy it and have fun. And ignore the trash that others speak. Movies, like so many other things in life, are subjective. To each his own. <br /> <br /> Always be careful with the 'expert' who diminishes the taste of others.
