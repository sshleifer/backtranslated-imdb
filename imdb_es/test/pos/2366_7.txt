This movie is great! Being a fan of "The Comic Strip Presents ..." I knew I would love this movie. And I love that he does. I finally got to buy a copy of this movie earlier this year. However, it bothered me to discover that it had been cut! So I will continue to see the sales of boots for the original version. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson), who tries to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French) by claiming to be a drug dealer. However, Dennis is heard boasting one night at the Pub and abused! So Dennis becomes super, but the problem is that he does not know anything and starts to invent lies and gets into an even deeper hole! The irony of all this is that there is a drug smuggling in Devon. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as fun as I expected, but it's still a very good movie with good laughs and a great soundtrack. . It also has the best scene in a British movie (Robbie Coltrane's ride through the dock in Frankie Goes To Hollywood's "Two Tribes". <br /> <br /> So if you're a fan of "The Comic Strip Presents" ... ", from any of the cast members, or a fan of British comedy, see it as soon as possible!
