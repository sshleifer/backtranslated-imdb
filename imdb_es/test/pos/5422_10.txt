I've only seen him once, in 1986, in an "artistic" theater in Minneapolis ... but I remember him as I had seen him a thousand times this morning. Hilarious ("Sawing for Teens", playing Scrabble with all the "e" tokens), beautifully animated (removing the eyes, shaking them back in their position, then putting them back) and touching (the end of the world, the pettiness. a snit) ... <br /> <br /> Visualization is required for the human race. Calling this simply a caricature is like calling the GREAT GATSBY at the time of writing.
