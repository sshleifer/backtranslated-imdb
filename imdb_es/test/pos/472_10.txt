I am a nightmare of film directors ... especially of the Mega Buck multiplex variety. While I am not a student of art, I still have a high threshold for suspension of disbelief and buy the filmmaker's vision, if I can find it. That's why a gem like 'You Are Alone' is such a stimulating find. Intimacy and rhythm attracted me and they never let me go. Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage provide nuanced interpretations and director Gorman Bechard shows a clever hand in presenting an understandably disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged people. <br /> <br /> Spoiler under <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD version and shared it with several people. Reactions have been varied, from the incredulity in Daphne's ability to complete the task for which Buddy paid to an inability to see the entire film because it was too real and emotionally devastating. As a skeptical movie aficionado, I have to be grabbed by the necklaces and dragged for the ride or let me seduce by the filmmaker. This movie took the subsequent route for me and in the end I became so involved that I felt the horror and pain of Daphne for her role in the disappearance of Buddy. My reaction to this movie reminded me to see Peter Greenaway's 'The cook, the thief, his wife and his lover' many, many years ago. In the end I felt fascinated and rejected, and I could not take my eyes off that movie either. I have seen this movie several times and I really appreciate the eye and the ear that the director has shown. I am familiar with other works he has done, including a couple of cheeky movies, 'Galactic Gigolo' and 'Attack of the Killer Bimbos' and a mixed bag 'The Kiss' that I recently learned that she was murdered in the cradle by the producer and It does not represent the vision of the directors. Pity, because I loved the two previous films and I even thought that 'The Kiss' was interesting, but I would like 'The Kiss' to be available in a director's version with all the original vision and the music intact. I look forward to the future work of this interesting director and the leaders Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage.
