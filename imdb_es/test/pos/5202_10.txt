A movie like this does not appear very often. I'm surprised it took 9 years to finally see it. Politicians and civilian hawks should see this before making decisions about how the people they destroy live, I saw it the day after watching the TV version of "Uprising" over the Warsaw ghetto. Even with this fresh in mind, I felt sympathy for the German soldier. I felt sympathy for all parties that this tragedy could happen. It will take a while to thaw out of this. I'm surprised they did not make a movie based on "The Forgotten Soldier" by Buy Sajer. This movie shares the cold with the book. Both will chase me for the rest of my life.
