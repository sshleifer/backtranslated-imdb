"Any Gun Can Play" (1967), directed by Enzo G. Castellari, is a very good pastiche of Spaghetti Westerns, especially of Leone. The first half is excellent, which, apart from the opening that is a direct nod to "For a few dollars more", with Monco, Colonel Douglas Mortimer and El Indio seemed to enter a ghost town and then be killed by a bounty hunter. called "The Stranger", is completely serious, with great shootings (especially in the scene of train theft), fast and furious action and good performances by Gilbert Roland, George Hilton and (which is handled well, considering it is very bad) Edd Byrnes. But then, when the movie reaches the middle of the road, there's a fistfight between Hilton and Byrnes. It's not very funny, and it's the weakest part of the movie, but it throws everything you've seen before in a new light. You realize that, in fact, everything is a parody of the Western conventions of Spaghetti and, in retrospect, the first half is so well made that you completely miss this parody under the current. What now follows is a more obvious parody, with even some of Brynes' acrobatic jumps that predate all the 70's of Circus Westerns. The end, a complete dispatch of the climax of "The good, the bad and the ugly", is very well done, since in other hands it could have been very foolish. So, a very funny Western Spaghetti, that does not take itself too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Spaghetti Westerns.
