Having seen most of the Coen brothers' previous films, I expected something different and slightly off-center. OBWAT is certainly those things, but it also has a heart as big as ... well ... as big as Mississippi. It is one of the most enjoyable films that have been presented in recent times, intelligent, well-prepared, intelligent and with an excellent performance. <br /> <br /> The characters are delivered in their innumerable nuances by a group of wonderful actors. George Clooney completely won me over with his appearance and character as Clark Gable-ish. Only having seen him in Three Kings and his cameo by Thin Red Line, now I am a fan. More comedy, please, George. <br /> <br /> John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson can help, especially Nelson. If ever "The Simpsons" becomes a movie, then he must be a natural player to play Cletus, the boy with his mouth open. I do not think there is a performance that is not excellent throughout the cast. My special favorite is Stephen Root as the man from the blind radio station. <br /> <br /> Excellent old music, a Clooney Jiggy dance that I am trying to learn and a feeling of depression in the southern United States improved by sepia photography makes this the best movie I've seen So far in this century. The only drawback of the movie is that I almost broke the band buying the soundtrack, the DVD and a DVD player to play it ... IT IS THAT GOOD! <br /> <br />
