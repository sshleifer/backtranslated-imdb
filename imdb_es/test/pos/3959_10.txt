The author of the film, Stephan Woloszczuk, explores the depths of love, passion and brotherhood and the devastating results of the loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT. <br /> <br /> The dietary world of BLINDSPOT explodes with suspense and takes the audience on a sinuous journey to The Core of the Human Soul. As a director, he manages to extract the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With an excellent edition, especially in the flashback scenes and a beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a suspense that invites reflection from beginning to end. A thriller that leaves a lot in the eyes of the mind. <br /> <br /> What an amazing achievement for Stephan Woloszczuk! <br /> <br /> Greetings Stephan! Angela sander
