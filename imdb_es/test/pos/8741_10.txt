From or around 1965, American films took a turn for the shocking and iconoclastic, which was great for the times, a kind of seeds that would pave the way for daring and daring dramas. However, because the same decade that gave rise to these films was governed by their own convictions, most of the films released in this period have been dated. CACTUS FLOWER is not an exception. Its own title suggests a romantic comedy "sunny" with occasional failures in the risqu√©. This does not mean that it is a bad thing: on the contrary, films about topics of interest have to start somewhere and the United States is a culture rooted in specific traditions, tied to deep hypocrisies, which are surprised by the simple fact of seeing them . Indirect reflection of the customs of time. Meanwhile, European films address these same situations, move away like a million dollars and have a longer lifespan because what we consider scandalous, they shrug their shoulders, say "Next" and move on. <br /> <br /> Toni Simmons (Goldie Hawn in her role of tiebreaker), a bright young woman of the sixties, continues with a much older dentist named Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), who has commitment problems. He can not marry her: he is already married. Toni decides that, instead of withering, she really wants to meet his wife and "fix things." In the image appears his assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (a bright Ingrid Bergman, who returns to American cinema after an absence of twenty years), a woman closer to his age that acts as if she and he had the perfect marriage and house . There is a reason for this: she has harbored quiet emotions for Julian, emotions that he does not know, even when he asks her to play his wife to prevent Toni from wanting to take another step in their relationship. And then it goes a little further when Toni's happily innocent actions divert the action towards the unexpected and present Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston) as Stephanie's "lover". By the way, Harvey is also an older man who has an affair with a much younger woman (Eve Bruce) who is also in a very funny scene. <br /> <br /> It's funny how the person we are facing. What we are looking for is the one that has always been there. What could have been an ungrateful role for Rick Lenz, who plays Igor Sullivan, Toni's neighbor, becomes the man who sees not only the true beauty of his compatriot Stephanie, but also the one who saves Toni from committing suicide. . (It's not the subject of comedy, suicide, on the other hand, this is not your average comedy.) And it goes without saying that it is Ingrid Bergman's subtle and poignant portrait of a woman who has somehow lost her possibilities of loving, that has become irritable, that is due to a Lie told another who becomes the real person that should always have been. I can not imagine anyone else in this quiet but profound role. <br /> <br /> Movies like these can be enjoyed at a good price and be seen as escapist fun, a product of their time, or to see them The profound symbolism that, like its title, takes deep. It's a difficult film, in the same way that the performance of Hawn and Bergman is just as complicated because, apparently so simple, devoid of flourishes and postures, do not come out or proclaim what it is. His performance becomes "not really acting" but touching real people, warts and everything. CACTUS FLOWER is a story that never seems to take itself too seriously, but reveals itself to be profound and very human, after all.
