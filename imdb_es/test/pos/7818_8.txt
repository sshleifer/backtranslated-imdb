A charming film enhanced by musical and vocal background, especially during the competition. I understand that there was never a soundtrack, but could you, through its sources, advise me where I could obtain information about the singer and the possibility of obtaining a copy of the song he sang. Your help would be appreciated. The song really moved me and my wife, and we would like to secure a copy whenever possible so that we can play it as background music when we have our family and friends for our "Italian Nights". If you could give us this information, we would be eternally grateful. Even if you can notify the studio contact so we can go directly. <br /> <br /> Regards, <br /> <br /> John Payling
