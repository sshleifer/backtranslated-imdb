First of all, I must say that I really enjoy watching this movie. The way we follow different people at the same time works perfectly, and it's one of those movies that really makes you think. <br /> <br /> Spoiler !!!! <br /> <br /> The fact that girls who commit suicide are the ones you do not realize. That fact made me wonder a little, since that is why he commits suicide in the movie. The director impressed me with that, making a film that shows the plot to the audience and also conveying the message that not many people would have seen it coming. Some people might start talking about why nobody did anything to stop him before she did it, but nobody noticed her, like no one who saw the movie either ... I do not know about you, but I did not guess. that she would be the one who committed the suicide ... Did you do it? <br /> <br /> Regards Jan
