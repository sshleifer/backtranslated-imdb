A friend brought me this movie and at first I hesitated, the pace of the movie was so slow that it was pretty boring at first. But the scenes of life were attractive, it's like watching what to look at. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be simply amazing throughout the film, the way the director handled the scenes of life to reflect the reality was disconcerting, but somehow also overwhelming. It's like understanding the real life of a living person that watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Mr. Alejandro Polanco and Ms. Isamar Gonzales fulfilled their duties so well that it is more like telling us their own stories. In fact they used their real names in the movie.
