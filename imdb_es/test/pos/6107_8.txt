With the title of the sickest film ever made, PINK FLAMINGOS is an indisputable classic. Of course, the work of the camera is unstable and off-center, the story is confused and slow, and all the characters in the film are disgusting and despicable, but PINK FLAMINGOS has a certain playful charm and brilliant satirical wit that no other film can match. . <br /> <br /> While this movie is really offensive, reading the descriptions of what happens in the movie is much worse than actually seeing it. Only John Waters can make rape, murder, sadism, cannibalism, coprophagia and almost every other form of human debauchery known to man seem absolutely hilarious. This movie has to be seen to be believed.
