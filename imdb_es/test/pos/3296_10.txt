This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the quality of production is exceptional. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted at so many festivals and has won awards. <br /> <br /> Everyone can identify that Calvin has a bad day, a bad week, a bad life. Travis Davis plays the role excellently! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this movie the right twist. The old man joins the humor of the story. And who would not love the suicidal golden fish! <br /> <br /> This short will bring a lot of laughs. And do not miss the credits as they are playing at the end!
