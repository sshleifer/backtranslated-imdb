I never saw anything of La Liga's work until the beginning of last year, although when the channel jumped one night, I reached the end of one of the three episodes of the series. But last winter I fell in love with the show and its dark, eccentric and, sometimes, sinister characters. Then, when I learned that they had made a movie in which the adorable creators of the show knew their own characters, I could not ask for the DVD quickly enough and almost ripped it out of my mailman's hands when he delivered it. I was so excited to see what the knights had done and how they had done it. <br /> <br /> And it was excellent! From the beginning, where Jeremy (Michael Sheen) is terrified by Edward, Tubbs and Dad (Dyson, why did not you play yourself? He's perfectly capable as viewers of the infamous Highgate House of Horrors know!), And Bernice reprimands another of her flock, Geoff, Herr Lipp and Hilary discovering that THEY are characters, which is a great scene. The scenes set in 1690 are very pleasant, with the knights changing their hands to more characters and a new plot. The turn of David Warner as Doctor Pea is fantastic, slightly funny and very funny. <br /> <br /> The League has always been brilliant in mixing humor with sadness and emotion, and the climax of this film, where Herr Lipp is fighting The idea that he and the other residents of Vasey are fictional people who never they can change who they are or their purpose, and see how it is collapsing, it is really sad and beautiful to see at the same time and it really shows the talent of the Knights, something for which they are overlooked until today. <br /> <br /> And then you have that pretty smart ending, where you feel amazed, with the beautiful theme music by Joby Talbot. And you know you've enjoyed a very smart and funny movie.
