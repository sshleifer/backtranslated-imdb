Excuse me if I'm wrong, but "Chronicle for a breakfast" could be one of the funniest movies in the history of Mexican cinema for many reasons. We can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect middle-class Mexican family breakfast: a cup of Bu√±uel's surrealist motifs with a small drop of Ripstenian's desolate scenery; a pound of symbols phallus around the film and a difficult psychological complexity, more than the films of the movement The happiness and the dogma of Todd Solondz. There is a lot of sordidness, black humor, repressed dreams (the dream of Theodore's fly), lack of incestual control (the relationship between Marcos and Luzma), parallel stories without meaning, discrete violence, anachronisms and <br /> <br / > a small sign of hope (highlighted in Luzma, the return of the husband's home and "A Little Mas" used for the motive of the leit). Marcos (Bruno Bichir) is a charming character (I think in a Bukoskian way), the king, without a crown that expects nothing, but has a broken nose. Luzma (Maria Rojo), the adorable wife, put many faces, but the only thing that worried her was that her children had breakfast; She is a loser in many aspects and sensual in a few moments, but you will fall in love with her. The drag of the soundtrack (too many woods) feeds the lack of technical, intentional merits, of course: out of focus shots, close-ups highlighted (in introspective scenes), dizziness and sudden editing cuts. "Chronic" is something difficult to digest, it gets stuck in the throat and anything helps. Its flavor is bitter, like a rotten orange juice and sour like expired milk, but you want to enjoy it. So I recommend buying a little Melox before the show, because you will not be hungry after all.
