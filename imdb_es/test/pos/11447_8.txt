Night of the Demons (1988) was another in a long list of "teen" horror movies that were released on video and pay-t.v. During that mecca of cinema at eighty. But unlike most of the junk that was sold, this was actually a decent watch. A group of bored "teenagers" decide to party on Halloween night with a pair of strange sisters (Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley) at the infamous Hull House. Your usual cast of stereotyped teenagers are invited to the party. But an average teen party turns into a night of terror when they try to survive Halloween night when the undead residents of Hull House decide to crash into the party. Who will survive this night of bloodshed and horror? <br /> <br /> A good horror movie that looks better in the unrated version. If you look at the R-rated cut, you will lose all the effects of splash and nudity. Stay tuned for the fun epilogue! A bloody film that was followed by an equally entertaining sequel. Only for horror fans! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
