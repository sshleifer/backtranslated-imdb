Fulci ... Does this man bring one of the saddest and strangest movies ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert, is Fulci's latest masterpiece. Yes it is, it does not matter what some people will say about it. There is little data by which this film is one of the best films of Fulci. <br /> <br /> Fulci makes fun of himself and his films with this one. The main roll in this film is none other than Fulci himself, who plays ... the director of gore sprinkled with horror, who believes he is going crazy slowly. It is full of black humor that, unlike most modern horror films, works here. Being a Fulci movie, you need to know it's bloody. How much? Well enough I always loved gore in movies and I never get tired, but Cat in the Brain actually stopped my thirst for gore, and believe me, it's hard to file. Even Braindead did not stop him. CITB has to do with gore. Almost all the scenes revolve around Fulci, who after being hypnotized by evil psychiatrists of * khmmm * is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or for everything he sees. Some of the scenes involve accidentally dropping the whiskey, and instead, he sees a rotten corpse lying on the ground, which begins to spit some of the mud from his wounds. Forget about Beyond or Zombie 2, this is the greatest movie of Fulci! Now I like how Fulci manages to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie. He is such a brilliant director. Some funny moments and lines happen from time to time, like one in which Fulci says "making bloody movies is a kind of disease." The ending is very good considering that Fulci (and most Italian horror masters) is known for making the end pointless or many holes in the plot. If you are fun with the Fulci, be sure to check it out. If you have a weak stomach, avoid this and repeat "It's just a movie" ps. some of the bloody scenes within this movie: dismembered chainsaw (complete), tongue ripped out, eyeballs torn off, corpses infested with worms, zombies, decapitations, face in boiling water, stabbing in the shower (towards the head), throat cut , many parts of the body and organs are toasted to one side, the face crushed with a hammer ...
