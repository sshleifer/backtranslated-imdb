This is a simple episode ad so far, after watching all episodes of season 11 (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made me laugh the most, it's definitely my favorite so far of season 11. So that Basically Cartman sees in a toy store A child who has Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and it's great, since Kyle, once he knows it, is like "he's pretending". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the director, to anyone. On the other hand, we have Kyle, who is now intolerant, basically for saying that Cartman was pretending he was taken to meet children with Tourette's syndrome just to make him see that Tourette's syndrome is real and that it's great since Kyle it's like "well, maybe someone is pretending to have Tourette for fun", in short, Kyle could not explain that Cartman was faking. Probably my favorite scene of this episode is when Cartman is with Kyle's family, but right after this scene, another boy that Cartman is just pretending, the Tourette boy that was in the toy store, Cartman basically told that child: "isn 'having the impressive Tourette". But to say what you want and be for everyone, a brave guy is just the beginning of Cartman, his master plan: go to National TV to say what he wants ("people will call it bright TV, probably I'll give him an Emmy "- fantastic, in this episode the word" s *** "is used 26 times and certainly that's not all South Park won an Emmy about a month before this episode aired, but here is a twist, Cartman He basically removed all the bricks from the wall, he says now all without thinking, so we heard from Cartman that last night he wet his bed, now it's not fun for Cartman and it's like "I can not control what I'm saying" and certainly the person who was with he's like "well, of course you can not control what you say, you have Tourette's" so Cartman is like "my Tourette's got worse, before he released something great about the Jews being lame and stuff, but now he's gotten really bad. "There are also things about Chris Hansen and To Catch a Predator. Actually, what happened with a pervert here happens with many more perverts, Kyle and Thomas were behind that to stop Cartman. Kyle ends up being Cartman's savior. Fantastic! <br /> <br /> TSA VOICES CONCERNED by "South Park" October 3 Episode <br /> <br /> On Wednesday, October 3, Comedy Central cable network will broadcast an episode of the animated series "South Park" "in which one of the young characters, Cartman", receives "Tourette Syndrome. Given the nature of this program, we expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with TS and to receive numerous calls and emails from our members and the TS community. <br /> <br /> We have already taken some preventive measures. strikes, such as requesting that Comedy Central air our public service announcement (with comedian Richard Lewis) during or after the show. Also, once the episode airs and we can see exactly how TS is portrayed, we can respond to writers with specific problems we have with the program. <br /> <br /> "We were really surprised that the creators took so long to use the TS as comedy food in this program, since no disability, illness or controversial issue is out of bounds for them", said Judit Ungar, President of TSA. <br /> <br /> "" We always see representations of TS (good and bad) as an opportunity for awareness and education, and a show of this magnitude and popularity is certainly no exception and provides a way for the TSA disseminates objective information about the disorder, "said Tracy Colletti- Flynn, Public Relations and Communications Manager, TSA. <br /> <br /> We will be posting an official statement on this site with TSA's reaction to the program after the program is broadcast. <br /> <br /> TSA'S RESPONSES to the episode of "South Park" <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as has been the case with too many portraits of people in the media with the syndrome Tourette (TS), the South Park season opener ("Le Petit Tourette", 10-3-07) served to further perpetuate the myth that the majority of those affected by ST have involuntary outbursts of rude language. In fact, 85-90% of people with ST never They experience this tragically socially stigmatizing symptom (medically termed coprolalia). For viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, could not the deceitful message to be carried out have been clearer? Unless you curse, you do not have TS. <br /> <br /> Despite our pre-air concerns, we admit that the episode was surprisingly well researched. Despite the exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia, for the attentive viewer, there was a surprising amount of accurate information conveyed. The input from parents, a neurologist, peers and the therapy session with the "support group for children with TS" served as an intelligent device to provide these facts to the public. "Undoubtedly, this episode of South Park generated a greater national awareness of the TS, but we are very concerned that school-age children with TS will be mocked and even harassed by insensitive partners who may have seen the program." said Judit Ungar, President of the TSA. "We realize that for more than a decade, the satirical parodies of writers have spared no celebrities, disabled people or political figures in any group." The fact that TS was the subject of a popular television show demonstrates that the public is much more aware of the upheaval.Obviously, this increased awareness that we have worked too hard to achieve can sometimes be a double-edged sword. " <br /> <br /> TSA contacted the executives of the program before the broadcast and we will contact them again. Maybe we can turn this into an opportunity for a positive awareness of TS.
