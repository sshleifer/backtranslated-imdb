I had read all the negative reviews of "Anna Christie". You know, the complaints about the static camera, the outdated performance and the verbosity of the script. But when I saw it yesterday I found it remarkably moving and enjoyable. Yes, Clarence Brown's camera remains stationary for the most part, and I'm pretty sure one of the microphones was hidden in the light of the ship. Yes, there is a lot of dialogue and there are no spectacular action sequences. It is an early talkie with primitive technical aspects. But ... then there's Garbo, Marie Dressler, George F. Marion and Charles Bickford, all showing that the great performance is timeless. <br /> <br /> I think "Anna Christie" is still one of the most iconic performances of Garbo. And it is a wonderful performance of the Divine, in a role that for her is quite atypical. Yes, we have seen Garbo tired and almost defeated, but never with bags under his eyes or his whiskey strokes. Garbo played so many costume roles (charming) that to see her play a contemporary woman is fascinating. She is not overwhelmed by heavy dresses or makeup. This performance seems quite crude Garbo. <br /> <br /> The plot, of O'Neill's work, follows the tired ex-Swedish prostitute Anna, and her meeting with her drunken father, sailor. Anna has had enough problems for a twenty-year-old girl, as she says to Marthy (Dressler) drunk and disheveled in a bar. She finds solace in a life at sea, and romance with a rough, but good-hearted, fisherman (Charles Bickford). But his past threatens to ruin everything. <br /> <br /> Charles Bickford is overlooked in Garbo's long list of main (largely inferior) men. He is an actor who can really share the screen with her and not be swallowed by her magical presence. The two have a great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with each other. Dressler can never be accused of underestimating, and once again, the great lady is up to her old tricks, but she is stupendous and convincing in her role, never upset as in the terrible "Dinner at eight". I've never heard of George F. Marion before, but he was wonderful as Garbo's father. <br /> <br /> This is a Pre-Code, and rather gritty and dark by MGM standards. I really enjoyed it, and although it may creak in some places, it's still wonderful.
