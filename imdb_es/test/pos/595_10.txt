I have always loved the Muppets. Although most of the children's entertainment was not as enjoyable, The Muppet's was. The Muppet are very, very funny. They are probably the nicest children's characters of all time. <br /> <br /> Not only the Muppets have their own show. They have also starred in many movies. from the Muppet carol to the treasure island of Muppet. Muppet's first film, The Muppet, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent. <br /> <br /> The movie Muppet is about how they all started. Kermit the frog used to live in a swamp. Until one day a movie executive tells you there are auditions for frogs in Hollywood. Then Kermit leaves for Hollywood. On the way he meets many people like Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the great and Miss Piggy. Also, an evil man is trying to capture Kermit. <br /> <br /> All Muppet movies are very nice. I mean, they are all very funny. This movie has many movie appearances. Like Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, Richard Pryor and Orson Welles. Muppet movies are all very nice. I heard that Jason Segel is going to star one soon. I can not wait to see him.
