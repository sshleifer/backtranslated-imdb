I remember when I came home from school to watch, this was the story of a black family moving from the ghetto to a high class community. The family was named Wilson Frank Wilson Man with his own construction business. His wife, Joyce, was a bank manager. They had 3 teenage sons Kevin Valerie and Marcus. This was a very good show. It was educational without being a preacher. The show was well written. This show gave us a look at a successful African-American before the Cosby Show. Many a black actor appeared on this show from Ester Role to David Hubberd at 227 Stonnie Jackson, to name a few. If you can find this program on DVD, you should get it for your entire family.
