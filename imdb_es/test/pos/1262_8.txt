This was a great movie for only 67 minutes. There was one aspect of the black cinema contained in this film and I'm glad that Nolan chose to film it in black and white. The plot is simple but entertaining that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good along with the acting. It reminded me of what would come in Memento not being in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him, for example, saying that "everyone has a box" in which he put his personal things. In addition, in the door of the writer was the logo of Batman, that seemed ironic because Christopher Nolan would direct then Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, other two great films. There's a big twist at the end that I'm not going to ruin for anyone who has not seen it, even though I thought what would happen when Cobb gave young D the Lloyds credit card. I also liked that the writer had a copy of Plato's Republic, one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full look of it, plus it only lasts one hour. There is also a circular aspect that ends where it started, which I thought was quite bright.
