I am listening to Istanbul, attentive, my eyes closed: At first there is a gentle breeze And the leaves in the trees Sway smoothly; Out there, far away, the bells of the water bearers sound incessantly; I listen to Istanbul, I try, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, I try, my eyes closed; Then, suddenly, birds fly, flocks of birds, high, with a tone and cry, while the nets crawl in the fishing grounds and the feet of a woman begin to get into the water. I'm listening to Istanbul, I try, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to Istanbul, I try, my eyes closed. The great serene and cool bazaar, a riot in the center of the market, the courtyards of the mosques are full of pigeons. While the hammers strike and strike at the docks, the spring winds have the smell of sweat; I listen to Istanbul, I try, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, I try, my eyes closed; Still stunned by the festivities of the past, a mansion by the sea with dirty jetties is fast asleep. In the midst of the rumble and the buzz of the southern winds, I rest, I listen to Istanbul, I try, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to Istanbul, I try, my eyes closed. A pretty girl walks on the sidewalk: four-letter words, whistles and songs, rude comments; Something falls out of his hand. It's a rose, I suppose. I listen to Istanbul, I try, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to Istanbul, I try, my eyes closed. A bird flutters around your skirt; On your forehead, is there sweat? Or not? I know. Are your lips wet? Or not? I know. A silver moon rises beyond the pines: I can feel everything in the beat of your heart. I'm listening to Istanbul, intention, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> FOR YOU <br /> <br /> For you, my fellow humans, Everything is for you, The nights are for you, the days are for you; The light of day is for you, the light of the moon is for you; Leaves in the light of the moon; Wonder and wisdom in the leaves, green myriads in the light of day, yellow is for you and the rose. The feeling of the skin on the palm, its warmth, its softness, the comfort of lying down; Because you are all the greetings and the masts that you throw in the harbor; The names of the days, the names of the months, the fresh paint in the rowboats is for you. Mailman's feet, Potter's hands. Sweat on the forehead, bullets fired on the battle fronts; The tombs are for you and the tombstones, the prisons and the wives and the death sentences They are for you Everything is for you. <br /> <br /> BE NOSTALGIA <br /> <br /> The ships sail through my dreams, over the roofs, the boats In a colored party, And poor of me, Longing for the sea year after year, I look and I cry. I remember my first vision of the world Through a shell of mussels, I opened: the greenest water and the bluest sky and the crudest curly fish ... My blood still flows salty Where the oysters cut my skin. What crazy speed was ours at sea on the whitest foam! The foam does not carry malice, like lips whose adultery with men is not a disgrace. <br /> <br /> The boats sail for our dreams On the roofs, boats in a colored party, And poor me, Longing for the year of the sea year after year <br /> <br /> - Orhan Veli <br /> <br /> I could not have said anything better than what Orhal Veli Kanik said about Istanbul. About this movie, all I have is praise. A very pleasant and balanced introduction to a city and its music that connected Asia, Europe and Africa at a certain time.
