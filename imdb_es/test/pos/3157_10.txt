It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's a reaction of love or hate. You probably love him or hate him too. I think the best movies are those that divide people because they obviously have some kind of impact. I am in the five star camp because this movie made a large number of people and it made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was quite disconnected when all that was happening. Especially Afghanistan and I feel guilty about that. The music through the movie was beautiful. I kept getting lost especially during some historical flashbacks. Personally, I thought the audio was great. It seemed to me that the soundtrack with the speeches, the music and the radio combined to make you feel like you were in the RV with Jim, the main character, or in your head. Everything that was not on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio. Anyway, this is a very amazing DVD that made me cry.
