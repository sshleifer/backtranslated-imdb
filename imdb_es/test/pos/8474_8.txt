I agree that this movie was spectacular. The way Jamie Foxx captured, not only the impression of Ray Charles, but the essence of Ray Charles really made the film. His life made a great story and it is good to finally tell it to him. I also found an excellent interview with Jamie Foxx about this role of Ernie Manouse of InnerVIEWS on KUHT, Houston Channel 8. The link is http: //video.google.com/ videoplay? Docid = -3001837218936089620 & q = innerviews + jamie + foxx & hl = en. I encourage everyone to review it, as it analyzes in depth what happened in his role and his personal feelings about Ray Charles. The only problem I could cite with the movie is that the filming style was quite insipid at times, but in the end I think it helped make the story more realistic and kept the focus on the person, Ray Charles, instead of the movie Ray.
