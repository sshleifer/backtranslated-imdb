The proud, challenging working class porter (Mr. B. Cribbins) is eventually conquered by the upper middle class family with luck. Father (Mr. I.Cuthbertson) imprisoned for treason - for which the punishment was death in those days, so he does not forget), mother (the very beautiful Miss D.Sheridan) brave and witty, loyal and loving, and mainly - older daughter (Miss J.Agutter) reeling at the peak of adolescence: hurt and confused about the fate of her father. Mr. Perks, like many workers of his time, will have nothing to do with anything he considers "charity" and is a key moment in the film when he finally accepts the birthday gifts that the children gave him . Do not compromise its principles. Although the lovely Miss Agutter has received all the praise, it is Mr. Cribbins and Miss Sheridan whose performances dominate "The Children of the Railroad." Both know how Edwardian society works from opposite ends of the spectrum, but there is mutual respect and mutual understanding between them. . But this is basically a movie about the family. At a time when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and ask for a ransom and be considered "socially inept" instead of being able to live in a decent society, and when two "human beings" can hit and kick a baby to kill without being accused of murder, the "family" can be seen as a homophobic, elitist, racist and even old, but a century ago was the glue that kept the society together at all levels. Mr. Cribbins' and Miss Sheridan's families are archetypical for age. Strong and loving, united against external influences, integral units with a mocked moral certainty in the 21st century. What could seem a boring and favorite political stretch is turned by Lionel Jeffries into a delicious hymn to hope, faith, optimism and courage. That all those attributes were once considered the norm and that they are now too often objects of contempt and cynicism is a reflection on our society instead of that of Miss Nesbit. Nobody but a passing concern for the human condition can stop being moved considerably by this fairly perfect movie.
