Take a young liberal idealist, Christopher Boyce (Timothy Hutton) into a top secret classification in a government front company, because his father's position is to unite him to a drug dealer Daulton Lee (Sean Penn) who is wanted by the police and You need a new source of income and you have a recipe for espionage. Sean Penn played the role of the punk drug dealer with a certain froid sung, probably because of particular likelihood with such crispy types. The gall that Penn carries with him in every situation is unique; It even suggests that the Soviets administer drugs. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie again and again and every time I see something new. It seems to me that a major problem with the espionage organizations of the United States is their consanguinity, which leads to the hiring of a candidate obviously inadequate for reasons of temperament and inclination for a government company. <br /> <br /> I remember when Falconeer escaped from prison and led the authorities in a wild chase. I see that in spite of the escape he is now liberated. Too bad the Soviets are no longer here to accept the unfortunate! A cheerful Cherio!
