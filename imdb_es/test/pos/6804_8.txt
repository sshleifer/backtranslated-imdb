During the 13 years of schooling that I had from kindergarten through high school, there was only one day when my class took a field trip. When I went to school, you went to school, from 8:30 to 3:30 and the trips filed were not taken. But, for some reason that I could not remember at this advanced age, we went to see a movie: National Velvet. I do not remember the movie, so on the eve of my 57th year, I decided to visit her again. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about a time that no longer exists. A time when people trusted others and did not close their homes. A time when people were given the benefit of the doubt. It was a time when family was the most important thing. This movie shows all that and more. Shows love, trust, affection and kindness of people. <br /> <br /> It would not be a bad thing for every family to see this movie from time to time and discuss their message. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to see the young Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney at her best, the Academy Award-winning performance of Anne Revere, Angela Lansbury before Murder, She Wrote and Donald Crisp, who He acted for almost sixty years. <Br /> <br /> What a movie!
