They were alternatives before there was another alternative, The Residents is a band like no other, and I love them for that. This has all its classics, from 'Hello Skinny', 'Third Reich and Roll' to its tribute to the great James Brown with a version of 'This is a Man's Man's World'. But that's just the beginning. As an added benefit, he even has Renaldo & the Loafs, incredibly beautiful 'Songs for Swinging Larvae', and even features the cover of The Residents. Needless to say, I highly recommend buying this DVD, I would also recommend buying your latest album 'Demons Dance Alone', it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> Uncle Willie Eyeball Buddy # 502
