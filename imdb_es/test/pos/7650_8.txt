Definitely this would not have been my kind of movie, but my husband saw it on TV and said it was really good. So, by his recommendation, I bought a copy, since I did not know if I would ever be on TV again. I had never heard of anyone except Armand Assante. At first I had a hard time getting into the story, because the first part of the movie is a mixture of images, and it does not make much sense. It's only later in the movie that everything comes together. The cut scene, if that is what it is called, is a bit jarring: sometimes it seems that some frames of each scene have been cut out, and the scenes are choppy, but I think it was done to add to the scene. unusual (if that's a word). History revolves here and there, and almost at the moment when you have everything solved, everything turns upside down and you have to readjust your thinking about who is bad and who is not. Or bad woman. The acting is very good. I kept thinking how much Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio. The end was a real turn, totally unexpected, that I liked. A good show
