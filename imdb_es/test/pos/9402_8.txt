This is a television movie based on the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich in the mid-1970s. Based on the truth, it's hard to say. This is true. It is based on the book written by Mark Fuhrman. Anyway, the film describes The crime in retrospective scenes and its consequences, including the arrest of a suspect, some 25 years later, who was never considered a suspect at that time. In the film, Fuhram, of course, is largely responsible for the arrest and closing of the case for Martha's The surviving family, particularly her mother. The narrative of the film is from the ghost of Martha Moxley, speaking in the first person. This is a very effective device in this movie. For me, it adds more impact to the film and puts a human face on the victim of the murder (even if it's just an actress who plays the role) Maggie grace plays Martha, and I was very impressed. There is no way to know with certainty the motive of Mark Fuhrman to investigate the crime. I could have disappeared. of a sense of justice and maybe he really cared. Or maybe it's just Dollar Signs aw of a best-selling book in the future. Either way, it becomes an interesting movie. It is well acted and is quite fast. I do not think there are many additional and unnecessary things in the film, just what was needed to tell the story. someone could argue that he omitted the things that would have shed a little more light on the procedures, and one would be right. In addition, one can argue that the end was abrupt and again that one would be right. But, as I said, for me, I think they told the story with at least most of the essential elements. Anything else would probably have required a miniseries. In addition, there is a miniseries entitled "A season in purgatory" that came out 6 years ago. (1996), in which this film has some parallels, although it is only weak. However, if you like this movie, "Then it may interest you" A season in purgatory. "I believe that" a season in purgatory "is, in fact, a fictional account of the same crime. Murder in Greenwich "is an 8/10
