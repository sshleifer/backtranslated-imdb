An incredible movie, I just saw it and I want to see it again. I had never heard of Derek Jarman before watching this movie, but now I am, I can not wait to see the others. The film takes a completely new perspective on Shakespeare's The Tempest, I'm sure I would have appreciated it because of Jarman's use of the themes of love, magic, darkness and atmospheric tension of the work. Okay, there may have been a bit of nudity in the movie that I did not really anticipate, but it did not offend me, it just surprised me and made the movie more unpredictable. A Spoiler (for those of nervous disposition: fast forward in the flashback scene with Sycorax & Caliban and Ariel as their slave, it is quite graphic.) In general, if you are beginning to find the performances of Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare flaccid and monotonous, then you need see this Fantastic and surreal, it will leave you impressed, but only if you allow it, keep an open mind, and then let this movie work, it's magic for you.
