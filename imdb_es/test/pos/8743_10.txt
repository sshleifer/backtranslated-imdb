Traffik is an excellent mini-series dedicated to drug trafficking in Europe. This is the PBS series produced in Europe on which the film Traffic, nominated for an Oscar, is based. If you loved Traffic, Traffik is a must see. <br /> <br /> In general, I would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view. The script is exciting and unexpected, as it traverses the lives of drug dealers, traffickers, farmers, police and police officers. Unlike other films that sensationalize the drug issue, Traffik presents it AS-IS.
