The War At Home is so good that it has become my new favorite show. Me and my neighbors Carly and April see this together every Sunday and laugh at how true it is in life. every little problem. Once someone does something stupid, they never live it and that is so familiar. The father always insults the three children with every little thing. I love how parents have no idea how to treat children. It is so true in real family life and the fact that parents are so overwhelmed and have no idea how to solve their teen's problems simply puts the program above them. The War At Home is so brutally honest and so loyal to the world that living in that has become a milestone for situation comedies. It's not about Happy Days or The Brady Bunch, this is real life.
