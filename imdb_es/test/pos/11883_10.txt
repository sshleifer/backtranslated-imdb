Critters 4 is classified as one of the best films of the twentieth century. The word classic has never been used so precisely to describe this hallucinatory epic. I agree that the original Critters is the best of the series, but the claustrophobic tension of the space station in which Critters 4 is established must really be seen to be believed. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in seeing one of the main cinematographic landmarks of the 20th century.
