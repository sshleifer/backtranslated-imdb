King of Queens is a comic genius. Kevin James, who plays IPS distributor Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini, who plays Doug's wife, Carrie is incredibly sexy (# 19 on Stuff magazine's list of the 102 most popular women), and very fun The true magic of the show However, are the scenes with Jerry Stiller, are the most fun of the show. Jerry, a comic book genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, who lives in the always cold basement of Doug and Carrie. I must admit that I never saw this program until this year, 2006. Whenever I had seen it, I never found it funny, but with the cancellation of Friends, Still Standing and Yes Dear, I needed some new comedy. Actually, by giving the King of Queens a chance, I discovered that it was absolutely fantastic. So funny that I downloaded the first 7 seasons and saw each season in blocks of 8 hours. I urge anyone who has not seen this treasure to review it. You will not be disappointed.
