Of all Bat-films, Batman Returns is my favorite. This beautiful, dark and funny movie is one of Tim Burton's best works. Although it is much more violent and dark, this is the Batman that the creator Bob Kane imagined many years ago. Michael Keaton takes up his role as the avenger of Gotham City. This time he faces two deadly enemies, Danny Devito's penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's cat. With a cast and a great soundtrack by Danny Elfman, the film takes us on an adventure while Batman fights against the evil forces that try to take over Gotham City. Christopher Walken makes a great appearance as Max Shrek, a shrewd businessman who has an evil plan up his sleeve. But, of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who steals the show. With all these components, you have a movie that will leave you impressed. This is the reason why you go to the movies. Has it all. It's really a shame that Tim Burton has not been able to direct the other sequels. If so, I think the franchise would still be strong today. Batman Returns is an incredible experience for fans who like great movies.
