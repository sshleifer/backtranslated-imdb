When I saw this movie in my teens, I tried the soundtrack. Some bands of the soundtrack that still did not know. However, during the film, I already noticed its quality. U2, Blondie, Police. , Quincy Jones, Commodores. Sensational soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In Brazil, this film has not been on television for a long time. Today went on cable television and I remembered to access the site to make the comment. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie surprised me a lot, but it's what happens in real life. Not always, what I thought was the ideal, is what happens. <br /> <br /> Life brings us many surprises.
