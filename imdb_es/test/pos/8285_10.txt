AWWWW, I love this movie in bits. My cousins ​​and I really enjoyed this movie and I am a GREAT FAN! I hope they bring the TV series on DVD soon. Come and mention it, I have not seen the TV show in a long time. Such geart times! Where I come from, Australia Chipmunk Adventure is only known by people in their teens and in adulthood, which is a bit sad because young children do not know what is missing. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are the ones I like the most: the Boys / Girls of Rock n'roll, Diamond Dolls and the song that will surely make you cry to My Mother. <br /> <br /> This movie will surely thrill both the young and the old. GET THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE TODAY! 10 out of 10, an excellent movie.
