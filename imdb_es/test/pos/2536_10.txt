This is a difficult movie to watch, and it would have been even more difficult if I had known then that the actor who plays the protagonist was murdered at home by the police at the age of 19. Pixote (PeeWee) is a street child in Sao Paulo who is caught in a summary triggered by a murder in which he had no participation. He is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses the brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try to believe does not exist. When he finally escapes, he and three companions survive by the only means they know, which is crime. What makes the movie so heartbreaking is that both Pixote and the actor who portray him clearly do not want to be the characters that life's circumstances have made. Pixote tries to trust, love and bond, but there is simply no space in his world for the kind side of human nature. One is at the end wishing desperately to do something for the Pixotes of the world, but what? Building more prisons for children with higher walls is surely not the answer ...
