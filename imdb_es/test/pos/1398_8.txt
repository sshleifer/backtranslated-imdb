Screamers is an Italian fantasy film (L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce) bought by Roger Corman and released through his New World Pictures. Of course, Corman has to carve his initials by having one of his lackeys (Dan T. Miller) direct some additional recordings before it is released in the United States. <br /> <br /> L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce It is a very entertaining account of the island of Dr. Moreau. It is 1891 and Claudius Cassinelli is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with a few recently escaped convicts. Claudio meets star Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson. Johnson plays the evil Edmund Rackham: a man who is able to manipulate the scientist Joseph Cotton to turn the local native population into amphibious deep-sea diving creatures (it looks like a cross between the creature of the Black Lagoon and one of the Humanoids From the Deep), by convincing Cotton that mutations are being created for the highest scientific and humanitarian reasons. <br /> <br /> Having discovered the lost city of Atlantis, Rackham is using amphibious creatures to plunder his treasures. The sexy Barbara Bach plays Cotton's daughter who has a psychic link to these mutations. In a memorable scene, Bach takes a bath at midnight with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination. Claudio discovers that one of the convicts he has made friends with has become a branchial creature and then all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> Filmed at the same time and in the same place as Zombie 2, Richard Johnson did not. You even have to change the costumes between the movies. The house where the experiments are carried out is the same house Johnson uses to perform experiments in Zombie 2. Talk about economic cinema! <br /> <br /> The additional images show some bloody beheadings, (how will Roger go!), and a ridiculously bad Cameron Mitchell doing his best pirate imitation. All that is missing is the parrot. <br /> <br /> Title in Spanish: Le Continent Des Hommes Poissons
