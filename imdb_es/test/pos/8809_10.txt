If "you've been there" and "you've done that", you'll love this movie. I mean "there" and I mean clandestine clubs and parties in houses where it is much rarer to find people who simply get drunk than to find people at the height of their ears in conditions of speed, speed or LSD. <br /> <br /> With "that" I mean to dance and sweat like crazy for eight hours in a row without breaking a brake and then a long morning of not being able to sleep and almost wanting to die, followed by a week of waiting until the next weekend to do it all over again. <br /> <br /> So even though this movie is now one of my favorites, I can certainly understand why some people, or even most people, would dislike it.
