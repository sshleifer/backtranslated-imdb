I thought that the movie started a little slow and disconnected during the first hour. However, it became more absorbing, fascinating and surprising in its last two hours. Then, as it begins as a cheap horror movie, it becomes a beautiful and wonderful fantasy movie. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda stands out as the Queen of the Snows. This was his best performance and it is sad that apparently it was his last performance, since he has not performed in the last 7 years. She absolutely embodies the beauty and coldness of winter. <br /> <br /> My 14-year-old daughter found the film a little scary, so if she shows it as family entertainment, stay with her son and reassure her. or he is just a fairy tale fantasy and not take it seriously. <br /> <br /> It's really one of the best fantasy movies I've seen in a long time, a little bit better than "Eragon". or any of the "Lord of the Rings". It's as good as "The Golden Compass."
