This story of the problems caused by an overly possessive, domineering, unscrupulous and unscrupulous mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two adult children and their girls, is a solid vehicle for the stellar performances of Irene Dunn (the new daughter ). law), Joel McCrea (son number one), Eric Linden (son number two) and Frances Dee (fiancee of son number two). Here is the spectacle of the pure tyranny of jealousy and the possessiveness of the mother who go out of their way when four good people find their own life damaged, their plans change and their own identities are in danger. Irene Dunn is stellar in her role. Joel McCrea's performance is open and clear, and Laura Hope Crews is a teacher as a mother. <br /> <br /> However, this critic considers that Frances Dee's performance is the best of all. His is the first character in history to show the strength of his inner feelings. His representation in his broken heartbreaker, the engagement scene is heartbreaking, and even raw. Dee pulls the viewer and takes her to her pain without even showing her face. <br /> <br /> Frances Dee, like Laura Hope Crews, has been overlooked for a long time, and now she's almost forgotten as the magnificent actress she was. No actress who started in the cinema after World War II has had anything to talk about in Frances Dee. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to see The Silver Cord, which was never released for television, you will find this. The "old-fashioned living room drama" is an outstanding film that is shown very well 74 years after its premiere in 1933 because it is full of excellent performances.
