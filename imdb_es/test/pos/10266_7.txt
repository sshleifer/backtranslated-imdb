I had a great time watching Femina Ridens a couple of mornings back, with some hangover. For most of the film, it is practically a game of two, showing the games and the strange relationship of Dr. Philipe Leroy and the impressive Dagmar Lassander. I had seen her before in a couple of Fulci movies dying horrific deaths, but here she is young and beautiful. The film is quite predictable and certainly gentle on the front of the exploitation, but entertaining due to its wonderful sense of colorful kitsch. The scenery, music, lighting and cinematography are classic Italian style of the late sixties, a surreal party for the eyes and ears and, although the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to foresee, there is more that enough unusual events and incredibly extravagant visions. and sounds to keep things interesting throughout. Both tracks are pretty good, and it's worth repeating that Dagmar Lassander is really good. The music, by Stelvo Cipriani is also gnarly, perfectly suited for the images. The director Pierro Schivazappa has come up with a good cookie here, but it's not perfect. Although it is very attractive, there is little substance here and the elements of exploitation are as gentle as they can be. I guess this gives it a kind of charm and innocence, but I can not help but think that the subject could have been more sordid, more threatening, something like that, especially because it's pretty simple to imagine what's going to happen. I suspect that it is a bit useless for the strongest exploitation fanatics and, certainly not for people who want to have sex or a lot of nudity. It's more a matter of light and funny pop art, adorable but insubstantial, like a bubble bath. Recommended mainly for fans of the 60s, Dagmar Lassander or sweet designs.
