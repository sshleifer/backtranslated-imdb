When I saw this movie, I had no idea what it was about and I had never heard of it before. But I must say that I was positively surprised. The first minutes are almost the funniest of the entire movie. The store clerk in India is too funny! Anyway, the story is not really too much to talk about, but I think it's fine. The acting on the other hand is quite good, and still the only actor I recognized was Mickey Rourke, who was not really in the film until the end. And the end is where the detour is, I think, not bad, but I do not feel that it really ends. I feel there should have been something else. A final battle in some way. I do not know. In general, this was a good movie and I recommend it to anyone in Tarantino movies with a lot of violence and a dark and sinister humor. I rate it 7/10.
