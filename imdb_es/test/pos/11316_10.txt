Dirty War is absolutely one of the best TV, drama and television programs, well written, in the 25 years. <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent, the writing is spectacular. <br /> <br /> Diry War reveals the true side of why we are not prepared to respond to a Nuclear, Biological and Radiological Terrorist Attack here on American soil. <br /> <br /> The Dirty War must become an important film: it's that good! I recommend this great drama to all who wish to know the truth. <br /> <br /> This television drama reveals how the British Intelligence (MI5 and MI6) tries to expose a terrorist plot and a conspiracy to destroy innocent victims, due to England's participation in the Iraq war. <br /> <br /> Scenes from different parts of London, England, are also spectacular. <br /> <br /> The Dirty War is a must see!
