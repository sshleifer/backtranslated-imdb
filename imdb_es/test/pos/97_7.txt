Well, I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin in this animated short. He loves him and said he was hilarious. I enjoyed it but I did not see any humor. He does not even like hockey or know anything about it, and he still loves history. Living on the other side of the Canadian border, I've seen hockey for 50 years there and in Buffalo ... but I did not really like this caricature. Oh, it was interesting and I know what would happen if you put on a Toronto shirt in the Quebec area, a disaster! That is especially true in the glory years of Canadians. However, that does not make the story funny. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, everyone in the provinces of Quebec idolized Montreal Canadians and their star player, Maurice Richard, and everyone wanted to be like him. When his mother orders a new sweater, he has the emblem of the Toronto Maple Leafs, so the child does not want to be caught dead. When it finally does and goes to the local track, it is excluded from the rest. of his hockey buddies. What's funny about that? I could see what is happening to a child in Boston who is the Red Sox and his mother gets him the Yankees shirt! The horrors You could not use it, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Maybe for someone who does not follow sports, like Maltin, this situation seems strange and funny, but it is a fact. of life or of any sports fan and his favorite team. It was an interesting story, and totally believable, but nothing that made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The art was fun to see in everything, almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings made by a talented school kid. . The Canadian French accent was also good. This movie was part of the DVD "Animation Favorites by Leonard Maltin from the National Film Board of Canada.
