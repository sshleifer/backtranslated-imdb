Suppose for a moment that you have not experimented with the psychotropic fungus and you are wondering about the so-called bad experience and how something like this might work. Well, go ahead, get yourself a new copy of The Beguiled. Look, with the movie you have your trips clean (Solaris and anything else directed by Andrei Tarkovsky), whack trips, that is, the experience that you never recover from (Sweet Movie and El Topo), and you're bad organic travel, a category specifically reserved for a film like The Beguiled, which is the kind of content that the enthusiastic writers of the Times made all the right decisions with their lives and graduated from the Harvard English Department as "hallucinogenic tone". For the third act of this film directed by Don Siegel, it is possible that he does not notice exactly that his two heavy hands in lead have shrunk and assume all the characteristics of an insectivorous mammal that digs burrows, nor will he fall under the suspicion that his column vertebral has achieved The same sinuous shape and knotty texture of a pome fruit tree incalculable in age, but you will feel something. <br /> <br /> In 1970, when this movie was filmed, most Americans were looking for a bland for their collective. pain, a movie like The Graduate maybe, a lot of world endism was happening and, of course, had the nightmare of the war in Vietnam. What you get with The Beguiled, aside from the banal metaphors of drugs, is a script adapted from a novel by a boy who at least for the moment wanted to be known as Grimes Grice, and the director's address that helped achieve the job and the career of Sam Peckinpah. In Beguiled, Donny Siegel, born in 12, Chicago, Illinois, less than 45 years after The Great Fire is showing its attempt to deal with all that contemporary cultural madness of the early 70s in the form of a film artifact classic. Beguiled is an amazing film and an outstanding contribution to the cinematographic arts in almost every aspect: filming, editing, directing and storytelling are fantastic, and you probably will not see anything like it. Undoubtedly, a sinister film, its effects, as I have said, both vertiginous and adulterating; frankly, it is hard to believe that Universal has attached his name to this image, but you will see it when you see some of the sweet and sweet movements of the camera, and the director of photography Bruce Surtees exploiting every bit of the dark myth that you harbor in your head about the American Southern plantation, combining beauty with evil in each location shot. Needless to say, Clint Eastwood has never been like that. Old Clint, he moves instantly from timid to livid, his eyes are like two spirals of Archimedes in the middle foreground. The rest of the cast is equally demanding and surprising. <br /> <br /> This Beguiled will never do the AFI 100 in my life, but that does not stop me from saying that it is one of the best synchronized sound films in the United States. It has never been done. While most people label it as a western, to include the people of The Western Channel, The Beguiled is a problem because you really do not know what it is: a kind of war movie? A drama? Psychological thriller? Maybe the answer to all those emotionally forged Noir movies starring Kirk Douglas? Actually, I call this piece a horror movie because when my father, who likes to relax with the free gratuitous violence projected in entertainments like The Wire, he saw that mid-angle and high-angle picture of Geraldine Page wrapping a tourniquet around of Clint's bloody leg. Pa was very quick in suggesting that we see something more like the Outback Bowl, just before he went to another room. My advice: look at this one and make sure it is on a very large screen, preferably run it on the DPL home theater projector that you are contemplating. I would order The Beguiled along with that important consumer purchase, discard the overhead, throw some cinematic light on the big blank wall and try not to lose control because, like Norman Bates, "we're all going a little crazy sometimes, "even the deceived.
