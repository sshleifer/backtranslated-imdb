First, let me confess that I have not read this Balzac novel in particular, so perhaps I am unfairly directing my caution to the director and editor. Even so, my experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist, not as an obscurantist. This is undoubtedly a worthwhile movie, but in the end it is a bewilderment. Was the Colonel a fraud, used by the lawyer for his own purposes (or for whom beyond himself); or the Colonel was not a fraud, but was used as previously mentioned by the lawyer; Or did the lawyer really try to serve the honest Colonel? The director and / or the editor seem to me to have deliberately hidden these questions, which does not seem to be the realist Balzac. At the same time, the film does an excellent job of delineating the characters, if not their motives, and the cast and production are excellent. That opening scene of the battlefield is destined to torment dreams. Still, one wonders about the common inclination among contemporary filmmakers to favor ambiguity above all else. Were not the problems and motives of all these characters complicated enough for Yves Angelo?
