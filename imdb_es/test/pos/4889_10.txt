I'm addicted to the television show, to the live shows and everything they do. And this was the last work they did in TV / movie like "The League of Knights". <br /> <br /> If you love the series, you will love the movie. It's a nice ending to your television series. <br /> <br /> It's smart and fun. <br /> <br /> Although it does not focus on some of the most popular characters, it is still great to see all the characters together and with the writers. A must for any League of Gentlemen fan. <br /> <br /> Look at it!
