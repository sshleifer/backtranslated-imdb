Without a doubt, this is the great mom of all the music videos !!! Unlike most of the music videos that are badly written "dance videos" and / or badly interrupted lyrics, this was done well. Jackson was a co-writer and, as a test of VH1, he choreographed and directed to a large extent this masterpiece. In fact, you could say that Thriller is more creepy than most horror movies with that last sparkling second eye. For me, this music video is what you judge all the other music videos. You can easily see the ominous influence that M.J. in the first break dances with the zombie march number. For dance, comedy, history and horror. I give it a 5 out of 5.
