There are too many people in this forum who have obviously missed the subtle ingenuity of this series. <br /> <br /> This show is great because it is a hilarious parody of itself. Are men who proclaim themselves stallions given a fair chance to convince us of their seduction skills until they "enter the field" just to expose their complete lack of "play" on national television? It's absolutely hilarious and the guys who are really skilled are extremely attractive to watch while effortlessly seducing the pretentious women who frequent these fashionable nightclubs! <br /> <br /> He celebrates a unique charisma when he deserves it and mocks delirious douchebags when he deserves it. Either way, it is always entertaining because, unlike other dating programs, it perfectly captures the real discomfort and emotion of a "pickup." I recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor.
