I saw it when it first came out and I've seen it several times since then. I have the DVD It's one of Drew Barrymore's best works and it's worth seeing more than once. <br /> <br /> Not being popular in high school was one of the things in the movie that I could relate to. I was not as tortured as Josie (during her royal high school days) or as Aldys, but I was not the type to go to the big party either. In the prom scene, the three popular girls were victims of their own joke when Josie pushes Aldys (the victim), it's my favorite scene and I applauded when I saw her for the first time. <br /> <br /> I can still watch this movie today. it's excellent.
