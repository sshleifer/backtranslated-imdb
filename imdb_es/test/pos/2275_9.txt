I entered the cinema, without expectations for the movie I was about to watch, "Everything is Illuminated." I left with a joy that I have hardly come to feel with American films. The directorial debut of actor Leiv Schreiber, the film follows a man on his journey through the past, accompanied by an eccentric group that includes an English-speaking punk from Eukraine, his grandfather who believes he is blind, and his crazy dog. The first half of the film is fun and smart with an extremely European flavor in the use of small but wonderful characters, while the second half of the film descends into a grim story of discovery and the holocaust. This little film shows so many emotions and so many colors with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than a story of enlightenment, but also of relationships and connections. The performance is incredibly powerful, the mysterious and interesting story, and the artistic appeal of cinematography, to die for. With some brilliant and absolutely touching scenes, "Everything is Illuminated" managed to capture my heart.
