This is a novelty in Danish cinema. The mood is not very different from that of Blinkende Lygter, also from Anders Thomas Jensen, but with a novel touch. One difference is that there are fewer characters, which leaves much more space for them to be inhabited. And what characters? The two butchers are perfect. Mads Mikkelsen is a dominant and deranged parody, and Nikolaj Lie Kaas, an indifferent loser with a twin brother, more or less a profane couple of the two.
