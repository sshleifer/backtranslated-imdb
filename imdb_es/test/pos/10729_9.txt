Normally, movies are kept outside the scope of "domestic drama," and for good reason: who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to deal with in life? real? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all classes and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it. That's not escapism, the number one reason why an average person resorts to movies is the sad reality. <br /> <br /> Normally, divorce or custody is simply part of a larger story and affects the way we understand or relate to your characters. "Kramer vs. Kramer" focuses on that and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so worrisome. It is a challenge for both this film and its audience: to turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel rancorous as the mirror gets closer to our face. Writer / director Robert Benton definitely achieves both things and impressively by adapting this Avery Corman novel. <br /> <br /> The story, as expected, is quite simple: the big business publicist Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) comes home to find that his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him and his son Billy (Justin Henry), 7 years old. Ted must quickly learn to be an active parent in the children's lives and, as soon as he does, Joanna presents him with a custody claim. <br /> <br /> To make an Oscar-winning drama about something so generic and particularly heavy dialogue first takes tremendous acting talent. There's nothing better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is at his best in this role: his first Oscar win after three other notable nominations. Create a complete character, one whose self-centered and quick-tempered ways change clearly as you learn to be a better parent and the only caregiver. Streep wins her first Oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who does not have much time in front of the screen but must communicate both the inner torment in her decision to leave and the renewed sense of identity when she returns to custody. Streep does it effortlessly. The young boy, Justin Henry, who at his age was the youngest competitive category candidate in the history of the Academy Awards, performs exceptionally well to the personification of all children of 7 years. <br /> <br /> Benton's writing and direction takes these performances to the level where we see more deeply the problems of this family than ours and, therefore, we reconsider our thoughts about love and formation of a family. Benton's previous notable credits ("Bonnie & Clyde" and "Superman") do not indicate a strong grasp of family drama, but man can write outright. Numerous scenes give us strong images that show us much more than the typical family scenes they represent. The first morning that Joanna is gone and the French toast of Ted make Billy is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent of this film in a scene that happens in the kitchens of the Americans every morning. <br /> <br /> Rarely see a story as simple as "Kramer vs. Kramer" better. There are no surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately stuck to the screen. The film then has to rely on their talents and everyone is safe, providing a new understanding of a subject that is so familiar.
