This is sweet The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira's mistress of darkness. Another small detail is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring to the owner of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is the most glorious story that has ever been told. I should sell more copies than the bible. My parents participated in suggesting the release of this film to a local cinema. The film lasted a week and we were one of the 4 families who saw it. The lady who gave the go-ahead (friend of the family) was let go through the theater. He was 3 years old. I recorded 4 copies on VHS and finally I converted it to DVD. It's nice.
