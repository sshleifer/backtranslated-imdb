"2001: A Space Odyssey" is set in 2001 and the main character is HAL. A computer. That's right, a computer that speaks and thinks completely by itself. This was done in 1968 and to think that by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers speak is a joke. If this were in 3064, a computer that spoke and had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered as absurd as this. There is nothing in this movie that causes some kind of emotion. It causes two reactions and one is called: sleeping. Start with nothing, but a black pitch for more than two minutes. Then, the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is the sequence of "The Dawn of Man". So, if it is in chronological order, the darkness before this, is it the birth of the world? <br /> <br /> During the "The Dawn of Man" sequence from nowhere, where does a huge monolith come from? out of the earth, from heaven, we will never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another it is there. The monkeys go to Apesh! T, once you find this monolith that only man could have done, but is that the problem? Man has not evolved yet. So, who did it and where did it come from? What's its purpose? Monkeys find a tool. Monkeys use bones to fight against an opposite group of monkeys. Monkeys with weapons are now the dominant group because they have used their minds to gain an advantage. The most advanced monkeys and, what is more important, the most intelligent and innovative monkeys, are the dominant group, since they have taken over the trough. <br /> <br /> We jump quickly into space, millions of years later, where we see a lot of spacecraft floating around classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe and, for a film made in 1968, the visual effects are impressive, but outdated. The score is legendary. The cinematography is spectacular. The edition is atrocious. There are innumerable shots of square-looking spacecraft floating in outer space, what you feel, an infinite amount of time. Once we board the ship there is not much to talk about. During the next hour, Kubrick shows several images of life in outer space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very boring, and we receive the message completely. The interior and exterior ships are bulky and outdated. Do you remember what the first cell phone looked like? Me neither, but that's the way it is in 2001. All the characters have clothes and hairstyles that look like 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red colors and have a strange shape because we all know, in the future, we will be sitting in strange looking chairs. Computer screens look horrible and this is obviously earlier than HDTV because the clarity is atrocious. All the TVs look like they are from 1968, so it's not so futuristic. Like all movies set more than 20 years in advance, they look terrible and unconvincing. Just because this is Kubrick, we should not say, "Well, that's how you'd think you look." No I would not. Simply, as if I did not think a computer would be talking to me in the year 2047. It's not going to happen, and if someone made a movie at this time, it would set 30 years in time and have a computer that would speak and think for itself. laugh at the stupidity of it. As I did with "2001". <br /> <br /> HAL is the most animated person, shoot ?? I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but it has more life than any of the characters silenced in the movie and actually believes it is alive. HAL is the only thing that is alive and sees humans as his maintenance men who take care of him while doing all the work. HAL "reads" the lips, from one of the few conversations between Dave and Frank, and "sees" that they are planning to turn it off. This is where the only dramatic part of the movie comes in: a subsequent battle between a red light and a man in a spaceship trying to enter the larger spacecraft. Oh, the drama. Once HAL thinks he has the advantage, Dave returns to the spacecraft, demonstrating man's ingenuity. Dave proceeds to terminate HAL. HAL, pleads for his life while slowly fades, which, like everything else, seems to last forever. <br /> <br /> The final act is as tedious as the first two. Once again, the monolith found by the monkeys appears at the end. It comes out of nowhere, again. Then, a baby is born in a shield similar to the placenta that dominates the earth from space. What is Kubrick saying? Is it about transformation? Dave to an infant? Is man evolving again? Is Kubrick saying that this is the end of man and the beginning of? whatever that alien-looking thing is? Maybe I'm going crazy trying to figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think the more the beginning and the end make sense. There are so many unanswered questions, especially for the purpose of the monolith. If you can do it through the movie, you should awaken some thought. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film struggles to get where it wants to go. The first act and the third act are strong, but the second act snakes around, floating in one place for what seems to be eternity. There are some intriguing things in the movie that will provoke some thought if you give it a try. Once the beginning of the movie makes sense, the ending works much better, even if you still do not understand what Kubrick is trying to say, which I do not do.
