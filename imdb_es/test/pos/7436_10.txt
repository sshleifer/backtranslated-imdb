It's really not difficult to understand this movie! I saw it without expectations and without knowledge of the history of the games. I was completely impressed! <br /> <br /> Initially, I wondered how most of the characters have some kind of superpowers, but it's called "Final FANTASY ...". I also wondered about Cloud's past, but that was easy enough to look at. However, by no means these questions ruined the enjoyment of the movie. Just the opposite; It shows that I kept thinking about the story long after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It's one of the most beautiful movies my eyes have seen. The music supports the movie completely. The characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> I want more!
