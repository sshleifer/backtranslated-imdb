I have been reading many different opinions and criticisms of this film, and I understand why many people have mixed feelings about Ponyo, be it history, animation, dialogue, etc. And I think the simplest way I can respond to this is that it's a movie for a much younger age group. An age group much younger than that of Tonarino Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro). <br /> <br /> Being a fan of Miyazaki like most surfers on this site, I expected the wonderful animation, the musical composition, the complex storytelling. , the constant great development of the characters, how the story intertwines with the current society, etc., etc., of a typical Miyazaki film with which we grew up. And to tell you the truth, I did not really understand what the hell this story was supposed to be about or what the hell was happening up to an hour and twenty minutes (with twenty minutes left in the movie), that this movie is NOT for the deep thinkers and the hard-core ghoulists, but for young and young children and happy lucky Japanese. Also, I think that this film is based on simplicity and creative animation; straight roots of Ghibli Studios style. <br /> <br /> The fact that a villain is not present really surprised me, apart from the father and maybe that crazy ass typhoon. But other than that, this movie is just fun; Stimulate the mind of a young person and make happy the good time. That is all. <br /> <br /> The animation goes back to the old school era of the mid-'80s, early '90s, of Miyazaki's films, where very specific details were not a big focus, unlike Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) and the latter. I admire the simplicity that created some nostalgia when I first saw Ghibli movies as Tonarino Totoro when I was a child. The reaction and movement of the children are very similar to those of the children, and the body language of Studio Ghibli is very noticeable. Studio Ghibli added some creative moments and landscapes that they can only do with their wonderful animators, but it probably will not surprise the Ghibli-ist ritual. <br /> <br /> The Japanese dialogue also sounded very child-friendly and many scenes and dialogues are very, very relative of what Japanese mothers and children said and acted. The music is very hoppy and "fluffy", I think you could say (similar to Totoro) from beginning to end. Even the darkest scenes do not seem to be assertive. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is one of a kind. Almost every aspect of this movie is for children. And I waited a total of 80 minutes to realize that. Frankly, I've never seen a movie told or shown like Miyazaki did. It's comforting to see that Studio Ghibli can still tell a story to a wider and very different audience, and still maintain that trademark impression of Ghibli.
