When I saw this movie, it reminded me of all the great dreams that I had (mostly full of robots). <br /> <br /> I can relate to the problems of Eledore and I have a similarity with Shiro, and this is a great movie for see (if you're a goth that is bitter and eccentric like me). In general, look at it before it runs out!
