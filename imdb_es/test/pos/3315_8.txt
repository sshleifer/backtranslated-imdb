I saw the first moments at TCM a few years ago, but I stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it on the schedule list at the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto, and I promised that I would drive 40 minutes by car. Stanford is an old movie house that starts each film with the curtains still closed. Yes, they have curtains. They opened when the fanfare of the Fox logo began to sound. When "Best of all" appeared in huge pink letters stretched out against the New York City skyline, I knew I had reason to wait. <br /> <br /> I started this movie. There were so many small moments that added to the appearance of the film: when Hope Lange enters the publishing office for the first time, the titles of the published magazines are engraved on the glass (The Teenager and Elegance); Joan Crawford's elegant apron she wore so she could serve her guests at her party without ruining her attire; the way the camera bent to indicate how crazy Suzy Parker was becoming (at one point it was almost sideways); how Hope Lange still lived in that disheveled apartment she shared with others, although she was obviously making much more money than at the beginning of the movie (I guess it was too outrageous for a single girl to live alone). <br /> <br /> Esperanza Lange was so beautiful; This was Suzy Parker. And what about Mark Goddard in a paper that does not speak? I fell in love with him when I was a child watching Lost in space. <br /> <br /> Seeing this jewel on the big screen prompted me to plan another trip to Stanford to see The Old Dark House. By the way, I bought a small soft drink and popcorn at the food stand, and I was surprised when the worker asked me for two dollars.
