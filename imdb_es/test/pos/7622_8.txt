This movie is something good. It seems that they used the Tyrannosaurus Rex as an inflated balloon, like Godzilla, maybe in the 60-70 days, the scientists do not have enough information. In all kinds of dinosaurs. At that time, scientists still made dinosaurs, so I guess this movie was based on the movements of a Tyrannosaurus Rex in the 60s-70s. Even a part where a giant rock, fired by someone in the Tyrannosaurus Rex, damaged the Tyrannosaurus Rex and was eliminated for a while. In the end, the Tyrannosaurus Rex came back for food. There is also something wrong with the film, like a rifle, how can a rifle kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex, when it could be 1,000-5,000 stronger than us? If this movie is going to make a new version, I suggest it be more good and excited, because watching an old movie seems to have a new version of it, if it is lucky.
