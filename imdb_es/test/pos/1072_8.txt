Our critic from Toronto told you what you need to know about this film (except that it is necessary to edit it, the hand technique becomes very old, very fast). I saw this movie last night in Menerbes, France, we are in the Luberon valley, which is covered in vineyards and, of course, wine makers. They were all there at the Salle de Polyvalente for the presentation. Finishes Educated, patient, cordial. Although my French is irritable, I understood the essence of the film but I noticed that the audience loved the "old" horror farmers interviewed, especially. that of a communist village in Languedoc. He laughed a lot. This is unusual in France, laughing loudly. There is no doubt which side of the war against the globalization of terrorism are at stake! YE
