This was an amazing movie with flight scenes that were incredibly realistic! I have seen it several times and it has kept my attention at all times. I myself am a big fan of the Air Force and I love watching any movie where I can see an F-16 flight. If you like Top Gun, then I guarantee you that this movie will love you too. Except for a few words of curse, this is an excellent movie for the whole family. It has a great plot and it does not have a boring moment throughout the whole movie. Every second is full of action and keeps him on the edge of his seat waiting to see what happens next. So once again I recommend this movie !!!
