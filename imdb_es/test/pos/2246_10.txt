The installation episode of the previous week, which lasted a little longer, was rewarded in unequivocal terms with an episode that reached the heights. There was a certain deus ex machina flavor in the resolution of the cliffhanger, but it was a good start for all that. As is now common with this doctor, the moral, ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were the focus of attention. They were always there in the classic series, but they were a secondary problem, which was overlooked when the Doctor was in full battle. This regeneration even apologizes to a cyberman during the battle! This episode finally shows Mickey embracing the heroic side that had been hinted at in previous episodes. His journey from zero to hero is complete, and has been absolutely compelling. With fears, humor and scenes that made you a lump in the throat, this episode had it all. After much consideration, I can finally say that the new series improves the classic series in all aspects. Coming from a hard Whovian you can not get a better recommendation than that.
