I was lucky to see this sequel before the original because I'm not sure I would have done everything possible to see if the opposite had been true. I found "Mission Cléopâtre" better than its predecessor for different reasons, but the main one is this: it was almost word for word an adaptation of a book, not an amalgam like the first film. The physical resemblance of some characters with their animated self was very funny, especially the bad boy (whose name escapes me, but he is the other architect). I do not know how this movie was played in English; My first language is French, so I did not have that problem ... I guess some of the jokes were not so easy to translate. I learned something over the years, it is better to watch a movie with subtitles than with dubbing, maybe you do not understand what is being said, but do not lose the rhythm and I think that is also important. I would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves "Astérix et Obélix".
