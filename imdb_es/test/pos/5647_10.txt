Kon Ichikawa lived through World War II and saw the effects he had on his people in Japan. But so did the novelist Shohei Ooka, whose book was the inspiration for Ichikawa's film, Fires on the Plain. It is a film about men in this war, or perhaps more universally in wars in general, that they lose their humanity. The soldiers who walk along these fields and jungles of the Filipinos in this story are almost completely hopeless, if not already that. It makes Stone's platoon look like a picnic: at least they had certain things, like food, after all. <br /> <br /> They have little or no reservation, supplies or ammunition, they have no backup, they have no meaning at all. Following their path in this combat in which they have been pushed. They can not even receive adequate hospital care, unless they can no longer walk or have lost limbs (for example, say, if they have TB, they are on the way). But it is really through the prism of a soldier, a private Tamura, that we have a complete idea of ​​the futility of war, both in its dark scenes of nothingness and boredom and decay, and those flashes of intense and brutal violence . <Br /> <br /> In the movie, Tamura just wants to get medical attention. This is just at the beginning, and his superior officer told him that he is already with eyes that stare and an expression that has been exhausted by years of battle, that he will die if he does not find a hospital. He does not do it, actually, but he does end up with some soldiers: at first with a platoon that seems to act together, but is actually led by a power hungry beast that just wants Tamura's stash of salt, and then, with Two other street soldiers who are part of a group that had previously been ambushed while crossing a street at night. <br /> <br /> The story is not quite a straight line, but it is not necessary to be. Tamura's road in Fires on the Plain is told in cartoons, little stories like when he meets a seemingly desert enemy village. Two of the populous return to get some supplies, and Tamura stalks them. It is an unbearable scene, because so far with Tamura we have not seen him do anything openly * badly *, but he does it in this scene, not so much because of badness but because of fear and desperation (this is also, without spoiling him, how he gets a stash of salt). Small scenes accumulate so brilliantly and devastatingly, as a simple task of finding a pair of transitable shoes, which seem to be missing. Or when Tamura, later in the film, discovers that her teeth are tearing and falling due to lack of total hygiene. So much for the food, for what happens. <br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that this is an Ichikawa film made in a disturbing way, filmed in a black and white view of the fields and forests, with the cinematography that fills everything. We see it in black-white and warm white-white. Ichikawa also makes sure to get all the authenticity of his actors, not only emotionally, but with his own emaciated look and looks of despair. It's as if Ichikawa had to make everyone survive the film, as well as the characters who survived in nature; By wild, by the way, I mean also cannibalism. The impact of this is double; The first is the way a soldier says half joking at first about eating them to Tamaura, who asks if it was true and only in response received a word of "do not ask" and the second with the description of cannibalism. in itself, the crazy man hungry on the hill that takes the guts out of his lap and tells a serious face to our hero that "you can eat me when I die." <br /> <br /> This makes things especially brutal when it comes to the director filming the brief "action" scenes. These are, I would say, more brutal than "Private Ryan" in his descriptions of battle violence, the carnage that is completely random. A scene that I would point out, and that contains only one shot that is unbearable to see, is when from a high angle we see a group of about twenty soldiers walking slowly, there is a rain of gunfire that kills only four or five, but it just happens very fast, and the soldiers keep walking at the same pace. This is not the only picture of the horrible butchery that shows up, when you need to bleed, it's sprinkled across the screen like something completely macabre, but it controls the whole point. <br /> <br /> All the acting is amazing (especially Funakoshi, who seems to be more at peace and more horrified by what she sees in the more subtle appearance most of the time), all the main pieces provide something more to the frightful experience, and everything amounts to the final question with a film against the war: how can people fight in wars like these, or why? It's almost too depressing to put it into words, so Ichikawa sticks our noses in dirt and dirt and blood and demands that we assimilate it, so, someday, it will never happen again. Or one can expect this, at the end of a film as dark and great as this one.
