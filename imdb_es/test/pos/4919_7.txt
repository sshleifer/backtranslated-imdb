To be honest, the critics of IMDb, I enjoyed this show very much. The reason? Well, he did not try to be more than he is; I mean, a comedy with regular expectations, with a well-known and repeated plot, fun and talented actors, and intelligent jokes aimed at a post-university audience. <br /> <br /> This is Grown Ups: try to be mature but in a fun way. <br /> <br /> Jaleel White is funny as always and offers some witty and hilarious sex-oriented jokes. The humor is very 90's without taking into account the trends of the new millennium and that is the main reason in my opinion why the program was not successful. He got stuck in the 90s. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Mrs. Ribisi was very funny and cheerful. <br /> <br /> My favorite show has to be the one dealing with Karma biting his ass! It's not a cult classic, but I'm sure it's part of the usual nostalgia of the early 2000s.
