Peter Falk shines as Morris Applebaum, 90, the patriarch who has decided that it is time to "verify" after holding a final, an explosion. His three children, Lauran San Giacomo, David Paymer and Judge Reinhold are notified / invited by letter and immediately arrive at their door to deal with their eccentric father. There is a great father / daughter chemistry with Laura San Giacomo, whose character goes through to experience the greatest growth of the test. It is a complete example of your average and dysfunctional family and your memories, pain, growth and ignorance / tolerance of the lives of others. The musical score is one that you will enjoy and the phrases are very timely and hilarious. Although I found that the real "Checking Out" party was disappointing, the rest of the movie will surely make you laugh, cry and leave the theater with a smile on your face. Move over "Big Fat Greek Wedding" ... the "Big Fat Jewish Suicide" has arrived.
