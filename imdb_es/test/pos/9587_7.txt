Tiny Tweet and Sly the Sneak are locked in cages for a train ride to who knows where. Sweing Tweety starts singing an unbearable song as soon as the train leaves the station, so let's hope Puddy Tad gets it this time. Sly tries out a couple of funny tricks for the hand, but the driver's man from the loot sport puts the bird in a safer place among the luggage. The next attempt of the cat has it in the coal furnace of the steam engine. And the persecution is under way. Of course, there is also a bulldog, and the silly Sly can not keep his big mouth shut. <br /> <br /> Next, the persistent kitten tries with the old stack of suitcases (twice) producing a reward Tex Avery would be proud of it. Unfortunately for Sylvester, that bulldog seems to be everywhere. He even shows a talent for changing shape and producing huge clubs out of pocket. Not even the skill of the Sylvesters to overcome a train at high speed can save him when he is ejected, in the Silver Streak style, several times in a row. When arriving at the new place of the grandmother (Gower Gulch, population 86), the last attempt of the cat involves the transvestism. But you know what happens to men in dresses, they always get more attention than they expected. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
