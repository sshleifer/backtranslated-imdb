Well, I saw it yesterday and it was much better than the other version of VH1, very bad that this one is quite outdated but you can see all the staff that makes South Park, very interesting things. <br /> It's also fun that this documentary portrays Trey and Matt as selfish greedy and selfish people who do not work and spend all their time having fun or relaxing (which is a bit ironic because they work pretty hard on the show) . <br /> <br /> It also shows the whole animation process to make an episode of South Park, an interview with the actors that bring the voices of the characters and much more. <br /> <br /> If you're a South Park fan, I recommend it. I recommend this
