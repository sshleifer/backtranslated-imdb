The Director of Kannathil Muthamittal directed the first Indian film that had seen "Dil Se", which took me on the road to buy more than 122 Hindi DVDs over the course of four months. I can say that I understood the total attraction, I was <br /> <br /> in some way confused as to why the movie would stop by "music videos". It was an excellent movie, I did not know what to do with the dance, and the female voices were a bit sharp for my western ears, but somehow I found the hypnotic AR Rahmen score. I bought the soundtrack the next day and then Lagan, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G the following week and, with the exception of "Ichi the <br /> <br /> killer", some other Korean movies, I can not be bothered. to see much more Something strange for someone who has only seen a strict diet of Hong Kong movies, Horror <br /> <br /> and Action / Science fiction for the past 30 years. <br /> <br /> But I should go back. for Kannathil Muthamittal, it is one of the last efforts of Mani Ratman and I laughed, I cried, I became totally angry, terrified and, above all, I did not feel manipulated. The performance was excellent, the photography was beautiful, I think you can stop the movie at any time and you would notice that any frame would be worth painting. The music suited the film perfectly, and after the credits ended, I wanted to see them again ... and it did. <br /> <br /> It would be foolish to discuss the plot of fear so that you do not see the pleasure of seeing how the events unfold and how the characters develop. This is what the great movie is about! I stopped and applauded in my home theater when it was over. <br /> <br /> My wife is watching now, and I can not wait for her reaction, I can not expect her to be anything less than mine.
