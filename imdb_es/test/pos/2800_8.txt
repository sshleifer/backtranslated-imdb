"L'Auberge Espagnole" gathered the audience where it was shown. He collected prizes from the public at many film festivals around the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to see a joyful and surprising work of art. And it's wise, by the way. "L'Auberge Espagnole" is a very funny comedy about youth and growth. But, above all, it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is a student of French economy, Xavier. For your future carrier one year of studies is sent to Barcelona. In Spain it turns out that the lectures are given in Catalan. That probably does not help the increase of knowledge. But it helps to strengthen relations within the group of exchange students. Especially if they rent a large apartment together. There are 3 girls: English, Belgian and Spanish, as well as three boys: German, Danish and Italian. Our French will also arrive. One year is a long time. Enough time to get close and make friends. And know some of the European stereotypes while trying to separate them. <br /> <br /> Klapisch deals with this special case of a process of uniting Europe with humor and without good sense. It came out of the idea that young people are everywhere the same. They like jokes. They like to make irresponsible relationships. But do not neglect your aspirations. The most interesting is the sum of experience of this small community. They live together in the fire of daily tasks struggling with the surrounding reality. They are full of unusual ideas for life. Young Europeans return to their countries to take the life of an adult on their own. They are the hope of Europe to fight against the many problems of the Union. For example, the frightening administration system. In the end, they show that they can not only communicate and make friends despite the many differences. But also now how to live a full life. And they will not allow that to be taken from life.
