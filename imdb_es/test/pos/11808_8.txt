Middle and high school teachers will find that "The Cure" is an excellent teaching tool, as a partner of "Huckleberry Finn" or as an independent lesson. Although AIDS is supposed to be the main theme, the strong text of friendship and love, as they evolve between Eric and Dexter, is a powerful message for teenagers. The writing messages centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. I also suggest a class-led discussion on how Eric evolves from a manipulative user to a loving friend.
