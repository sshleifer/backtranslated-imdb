With the Second World War over, film studios rushed to focus on veterinarians returning home. "The best years of our lives" was probably the best example. It portrays several people returning to their homes and how they should readjust not only their pre-war lives, but also the changing world in general. Probably the most interesting cast member is the non-actor Harold Russell. Having lost his hands in war, he plays a man with hooks where he used to be, and reminds people that he wants to be treated like everyone else; He then won the award for Best Supporting Actor and a special Oscar for the role, becoming the only person to win two Oscars for the same role. There will probably always be a debate over whether this deserved Best Film more than "It's a Wonderful Life", but I certainly think they did a good job with it. Very well done.
