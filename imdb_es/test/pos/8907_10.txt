Like so many other critics here, my memories of this show are universally warm. In fact, I love my dear memories so much, that I recently bought the DVD set to revisit that happy and carefree period of childhood, in which I used to sit completely hypnotized, while watching the ongoing search of Monkey, Pigsy, Sandy , Tripitaka and later Yu Lung, a horse / dragon / man (you'll really need to see him to understand it), when the much-loved show aired on BBC 2 on Friday nights, as a souvenir. <br /> <br /> Well, I am pleased to say that even after all these years and now seeing this with adult eyes, that is, more cynical (!), the program has not lost any of its inimitable charm. <br /> <br /> Simply wonderful entertainment From magical characters and their comic interactions with each other to perhaps not so special effects (which actually serve to increase the fun) and, of course, without forgetting the sequence of titles of enormously memorable opening of the first season, the passage of time has by no means, form or form diminished any fascinating spell of Monkey. <br /> <br /> As the same monkey would probably say, 'Oi! You there! Get out and grab some nostalgic fun.
