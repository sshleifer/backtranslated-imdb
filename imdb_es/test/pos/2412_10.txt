THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts movie. I thought Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked good in their graduation attire. For me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real bully. This was because Julie had problems with director Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a real murderer! This was because he was a very hard man who would not tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the prom and the confrontation between Julie and Alpha Elite. In conclusion, I recommend this great success to all those who like martial arts movies or are fans of Hilary Swank.
