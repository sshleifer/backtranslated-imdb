THE FOUR SEASONS TRADER was the first shot by Rainer Werner Fassbinder to general acceptance. In a turbulent career of only fifteen years, he managed to create an amazing body of work in film and theater, both as a performer and as a producer, actor and creative director. Although this movie may not be appealing to many viewers, the film has a lot to offer. The plot is quite simple. A man is excluded from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems, and is unable to control his downward spiral. THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS is decorated with a servile devotion to elegant details, and each set is designed and constructed with great care. Each object on the set seems to be carefully arranged to elicit layers of emotional texture. Many paintings and religious icons decorate the walls of the different rooms and seem to speak of Hans's desperate search for spiritual meaning or direction in his life. Much thought was given to how lighting and color were used to contrast and enhance the drama. Several times during the film, I froze the frame to marvel at the beauty of the composition of the shot. I transmitted this film, and the impression was almost impeccable and insurmountable. Fassbinder employs his actors in an "unnatural" style almost vehemently. He does everything possible to avoid that the actors react in a normal or colloquial way, and this creates a quite forced effect. However, in doing so, it injects a "hyper-reality" into the narrative. More than the presentation of a worldly melodrama, the lack of involvement of the actors almost militant forces the viewer to confront the film in a different way. The Fassbinder film intentionally prevents the viewer from easily connecting with the characters "tests and tribulations, you are constantly outside, looking in. This will be a disconcerting experience for many, but it seemed like a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.
