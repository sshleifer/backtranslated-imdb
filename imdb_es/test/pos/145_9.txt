There is this whole theory of horror that some people adhere to that monsters and violence must stay off the screen. Park Chan-Wook launches that concept completely through the window and directly shows what he wants, and what he wants to show is almost anything that comes to mind. Leaving actors and dialogue to create subtlety, from a stylistic perspective, Park seems willing to do anything to express his point of view. Whether I've been involved in scenes with the camera for a long time circling around a mah-jong table or whole weeks confined to a single shot between two other scenes, the dialogue of the scenes before and after bleeding over them, Park does not maintain a specifically structured style but focuses more on telling the full story of a couple's relationship, from virginal disappearance to absolute codependency to absolute self-annihilation, and uses vampirism as the link and priestess as drama. It is that simple and complex at the same time. <br /> <br /> You have to give him credit. Too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie with Twilight, with Twilight almost always being the least of the plays, but here the stories are actually comparable, but this is more raw and honest. None of this shines in the window during the night to speak ill, but something that goes from the scene of sex more dirty, desperate and virginal to an eventual conjugal abuse when the two protagonists begin to compete for power between them. It's the same deal: the boy and the girl meet, the girl discovers that the boy is a vampire, decides to join him anyway, but never happier, only a limited and direct time, since they are forced to be closer and closer. run out of options The girl's motivations are particularly interesting as someone desperately craving power and attention, for a failure, frustrated by the boy who just wants to live a good life as best he can in these circumstances, but he is a hypocrite who can not admit that he simply he is using his vampirism is an excuse to act against his moral training. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect and tends to spread (here there are no three acts, five acts or any structure of acts, only scene after scene of character building and dysfunctional romance), but the good thing about this is that Park Chan-Wook is willing to show everything with frankness and honesty while delighting the horror sensitivity of tension and blood. It also provides a soundtrack chosen by experts to play the emotional high notes quite effectively, too. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
