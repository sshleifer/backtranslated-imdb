I think several others have already commented on this movie, but I liked it so much that I wanted to say how good this movie is. I gave him a rating of 9 out of 10. He did not get a 10 because it's a very slow start. I almost left it, but I'm glad I did not. Hang in there, it's worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> This is mainly a film about relationships: deception, trust and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Lange and Jason Robards Everyone does great works in this movie. <br /> <br /> Located in the agricultural region of the Midwest, the character of Jason Robards is a farmer whose grandfather settled there. Jason's character is getting old and he decides to establish a trust that divides the thousand acres of farmland between his three adult daughters. That's when the plot of this movie really starts to cook. <br /> <br /> The sisters turn against each other because of misunderstandings instead of greed for the land. They also make some discoveries about each other's childhood, and their current marriages, including an adulterous affair, while the father becomes increasingly abusive, demanding and paranoid, until the terrible truth of all finally overflows. <br /> <br /> This movie really hit me emotionally, I got angry along with some of the characters and I became sad. I could feel his pain due to the excellent performances that were given. <br /> <br /> The ending was a surprise for me, but in keeping with the growth of the characters. <br /> <br />
