This film recreates the historic Lindbergh flight across the Atlantic while playing episodes in his aviation career through flashbacks. Stewart was around 20 years old and could not play with the young flyer, but his excellent performance, particularly in solo flight sequences, makes this a minor issue. The Waxman score is a great advantage. Despite the long execution time, Wilder manages to make it quite exciting and is able to sustain the drama even though the result is known. What year 1957 was for Wilder: besides this, he also wrote and directed "Amor en la tarde" and "Witness of the prosecution". And his next two were "Some Like it Hot" and "The Apartment". What career!
