A documentary about a nomadic tribe in Tibet that goes out to a dry lake to get salt does not sound very attractive. But this is not a popcorn movie, but a visual cultural feast in which you participate in a bite of humanity that quickly fades away. Superstitions, epic songs and poetry, the faith of a people that really believes in following their own patterns of life are something that the West had in Homer's time, but which now, unfortunately, is completely foreign to most of us in the world. "Developed world: We have lost the spiritual serenity that comes from following well-established patterns of life, often with terrible mental consequences in our increasingly soulless society." The filmmakers have woven us intimately into the fabric of these men of salt, materially poor but spiritually rich and scandalous, and it made us see that there was more life than the mall and pop culture, so disconnect your land lines, turn off your cells, turn off the lights of the road and sit back and relax in a timeless adventure.
