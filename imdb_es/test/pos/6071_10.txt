I've heard a lot about 'The English Patient' and finally I decided to get the CD and find out what the ballyhoo was all about. What I discovered was a cinematic delight and should, I repeat, "should" always be watched with an open mind. If you are a moral and religious fanatic, I am afraid that this is not a movie for you, since you will not see the beauty of this cinematographic masterpiece, as you will continue to insist on the moral dilemmas that this film creates. As I remember correctly, before watching this movie, I read the review on this site and I disliked the opinions of the person I quote who said "that the protagonists deserved what they got". When it comes to morality, I agree with him, but this is not the way to comment on a movie of this magnificence. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I have rarely seen such a wonderfully designed movie. I keep listening to the background soundtrack in my subconscious. First of all, this is a love story and yes, it is an extramarital affair (moralists beware) but let's not keep focusing on that. Instead, let's focus on how the story was told. It is a mixture of flashbacks and the present. It is set in World War II and tells the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy played beautifully by Ralph Fiennes) who is cared for by an army nurse (Juliet Binoche) in war-ravaged Italy just before beginning of the End (defeat of the powers of the axis). The patient with scars from burns suffered a lot of pain when recalling the torrid affair he had with an English woman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown in flashbacks set in prewar Africa. The past and the present are woven so ably into the story that you feel transported in the story and feel like a firsthand spectator. The places in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters. I am a romantic and I am not ashamed to say that I had tears after it was over. Look at it with someone you really love. The film begins and ends with the same image of the desert where the sand dunes twist and curve like the body of a woman and it was impressive. The feeling of loss and pain was transmitted so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why God! Why do we have wars that destroy beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of Innocence? <br /> <br /> Anyway, he deservedly won a lot of Oscars and I'll go look for other works by director Anthony Minghella. This gives me back the romanticism in the David Lean film genre. It almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia, which was also based on the desert. Happy people to see.
