'Fama' (1980) is brilliant. It has all these qualities that made the films of the late 70s so cool. He is proud of his frankness and is not ashamed to be above. <br /> <br /> What really matters here is the trip, not the destination. Ignorant idiots with soap opera mentality, will never realize that 'Fame' is about the struggles, anxieties and triumphs of these young people, not about their careers. <br /> <br /> Ironically, none of the very talented 'Fame' actors did it in Hollywood. 'Fama' marked the end of an era. The end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness. It is the last statement of a generation that had its own voice. <br /> <br /> 10/10
