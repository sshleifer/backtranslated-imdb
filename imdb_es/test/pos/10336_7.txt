A touching story told with tenderness: a clumsy Jewish girl in World War II in America befriends a German prisoner of war who runs away in his clubhouse. They talk about their lives and beliefs (he is anti-Hitler), she steals his food, he becomes his only friend and ally. All this reminded me of the much better theatrical movie "Whistle Down The Wind", where Hayley Mills befriends Alan Bates, but certainly can not fail the address here, which is smooth, or the performances, which are excellent. Mature in her preteen years, Kristy McNichol carries most of the image and never hits a false note. Suddenly, when the prisoner is discovered (and Kristy is also discovered), the movie becomes very hard. His father, surprised and ashamed that his son was reunited with "that Nazi", lies with her with a silent fury that I have rarely seen before (he says "You are dead to me", which must be devastating for a little girl. The final scenes are not removed; There are no large meetings, there is no climax to hold hands. The girl has to face the world and, in doing so, learns a bitter lesson about neighbors, friends and family. A surprising movie
