When watching this movie, I can not help but draw the comparison between it and Wild Reeds, another reflective film about most teenagers. <br /> <br /> Like Wild Reeds, this movie is slow and the director would not rush. So if you want a quick resolution of things, do not look at it. This movie is like a portion of life, starting imperfectly and ending imperfectly. There is no resolution at all, never happy forever, like real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is as real as it can be. The acting is surprisingly good. The director is fond of long, very long shots, and the actors and actresses stand out in showing subtlety and internal thoughts. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I almost did not see it but now I'm very glad I did it. It is not a movie for everyone, but if you are willing to let it grow in you, you will be rewarded. <br /> <br /> 10/10
