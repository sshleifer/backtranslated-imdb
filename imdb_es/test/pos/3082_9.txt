Like many children born in the 1980s, I grew up in Mel Brooks films that were not necessarily the most "racial" like Blazing Saddles and History of the World part 1 (I saw them, of course, though not as often as now) , but those destined to the "whole family", Spaceballs, and this movie. I knew that at that time I was not seeing a great art, but only a little cheesy, silly, although always worthy of laughter in Robin Hood and / or adventure films. But to call it a family movie in quotation marks means that a) adults can really enjoy it as much as children, but rather by silly jokes and vulgarities, and b) once a child sees it, when he sees it again, as I have done several times, it is still fresh but with some things that were not understood at all the first time. It is a comedy that is not only full of jokes about the Robin Hood movies and other films (the Godfather, of course, as well as small mentions for other movies of modern times), but also one that refers to the films themselves. Brooks; This is a filmmaker who is not above making fun of even his own style. <br /> <br /> Basic story: Robin Hood (Cary Elwes in one of his best turns) returns home from the Crusades to see that things are there. danger with King Richard disappeared, and so goes out to reclaim his land and, naturally, rob the rich to feed the poor. On the way he meets Achoo (Dave Chappelle), he runs into Prince John (Richard Lewis) and the Sheriff, and of course he still worries about the love of Maid Marian. This, of course, is Brooks's usual clothesline to let the comedy seep into the scenes, and although sometimes a joke may not work or may become obsolete in a replay of the visualization, it both gets stuck and it's hard not to laugh . It also helps that a couple of bits are some of the best in any Brooksfilm, such as the Godfather bit (Dom DeLouise at its best), Brooks' own cameo as the Rabbbi, Lewis and Chappelle's acting turns, and a endless amount of characters Lines and a couple of ironic songs. Part of this is obvious, yes, part of the Blazing Saddles pages, of course, but is it a good time for the right people? Definitely, and for the parents who grew up in the 70's work at Brooks, it's a great way to introduce young people to their work through this (even suggestive sex jokes and others are not rated R, everything is very funny).
