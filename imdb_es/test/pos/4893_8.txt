The best British comedy movie! For years, English comedy television shows have become movies and have failed: "Are you being served?" 'Dads Army', the list goes on. However, the BBC's popular black humor television show; 'The League of Knights' has not only managed to create a film that has managed not to be a failure, but has also managed to be the best British comedy film. With its dark and horrendous twists and turns, the Apocalypse of the League of Knights is the British talent at its best! His intriguing demonic plot written by the League of Knights (Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson) matches the excellent performance of Gents (and guest cameos). I hope this is not the end of Royston Vasey, not after this great success anyway! Do not think that if you have not seen the League of Knights on TV, you will not understand what is happening. Everything is well explained and at the end of the film, you will be happy with the result, but you will still be left wanting more ... Mmmm, special things.
