I see many movies: DVD, movies and classics, whatever you want. The night I saw JERICHO MILE, my wife (who had asked for it on the Internet) said that she remembered him from when he was in high school, that he had been with her all these years. Somewhat reluctantly I sat down (with our daughter and son), and was fascinated from the opening sequence to the final titles. We all were. <br /> <br /> She, who remembered the original, and our children (aged 18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about could not believe it. Our favorite scene? However, when Peter Strauss hits his fist so passionately and says: "I would do it again!". He did not defend violence because it was a crime of defense, but it evoked so much intensity that we could not believe it ... when his cellmates gave him their food in support of their efforts, there was not a dry eye in our house. <br /> <br /> Someone, please, make more movies like this one. AMAZING!!
