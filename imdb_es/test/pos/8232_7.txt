After cleaning Dodge City (with a little help from Wyatt Earp), Bat Masterson goes to Liberal, Kansas, where they have a small war of ranks. Besides a pretty interesting scheme of sharecropping. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is Bat Masterson and looks for the villains Billy House and Steve Brodie, who are expelling the farmers from their farms. The owners who are expelling are in a partnership plan financed by Robert Ryan. It seems as if you are betting the various farmers on a plot of land to take home for a percentage of the profits from your harvest. Ryan is about to lose his shirt as a result of all the scams. <br /> <br /> As Scott portrayed it, Bat Masterson is a Western hero who has a passion to go east and become a reporter that everyone I know did it later in life. <br /> <br /> Anne Jeffreys and Madge Meredith are involved in a romantic secondary plot involving Brodie and Ryan, which is a bit silly and detracts from the action. Although Anne Jeffreys sings well. <br /> <br /> Of course, Gabby Hayes, as always, provides great comic relief. <br /> <br /> A good addition to Randolph Scott's westerns collection. It is also interesting because his later Western films do not have it with a hat as white as the one that is here. <br /> <br /> This review is dedicated to Kasey Hayes, of Professional Bull Riders, who is a proud resident of Liberal. , Kansas, a city with a great tradition, whether Bat Masterson met there or not.
