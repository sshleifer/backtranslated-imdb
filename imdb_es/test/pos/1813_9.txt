One of the best comedies for teenagers that were filmed during the 80s, Valley Girl has a young Nicolas Cage in a starring role. Deborah Foreman is funny as the object of Cage's desire (and what happened to her?). Look for veteran actors Colleen Camp and Frederic Forrest as Julie's hippie parents. They are very funny!
