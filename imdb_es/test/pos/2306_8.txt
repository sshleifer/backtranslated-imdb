Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death command the dialectic of Life. At the end of the 19th century, in a remote Japanese village, a young man and a married woman, older than him, fall in love and decide to kill their husband to be free and enjoy their love. But they never enjoy that freedom, since Remorse begins to torment them, beginning as always at that moment for the weakest member of the couple, the woman, of course. From now on, in an environment where the dream (nightmare) is mixed with reality, the ghost of the murdered husband appears first to the woman, but then also to the man. It also torments the dreams of other villagers creating a climate of suspicion and rumors about the couple, which is aggravated by the arrival of a police officer investigating the disappearance of the murdered husband. But what makes this film more interesting besides this almost common story of adultery is the evolution of the couple's feelings in a deep psychological and dramatic development of remorse, anguish and fear that turns their love relationship into a nightmare until its end. Expressionism so loved by Japanese theater or film acting is also present in the performances of the players, but not in an exaggerated way. Only to the extent necessary to more effectively show the deepest feelings of the characters represented. This is indeed a good solid movie.
