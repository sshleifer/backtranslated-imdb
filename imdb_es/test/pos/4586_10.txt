This movie is BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> I do not remember this movie, not even being in theaters, so to think that it was a "direct to the DVD" I have low expectations, although I am a big fan of Mike Judge. It has some of the same kind of comic satire of the future as "Brazil" and "Demolition Man", but taken to the next level. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the cast; Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, who were all brilliant in their roles. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that this movie won me in the first 5 minutes, where it shows people above average who have fewer children and the poorest, stupid and evil people who have many ignorant children, and how this leads to a kind of reverse evolution. Take that concept and then show where we are going with this contamination of the gene pool. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I do not think it will take 500 years as shown, but probably only about 50. I already see the surprising increase of "slight delay" in the general population, media and culture. People who like classical music and art are ridiculed instead of respected. The lowest common denominator seems to rule out, especially in Hollywood and on television (for example, "Jackass the Movie" and any reality show where they make you eat something nasty or humiliate you for money). <br /> <br /> Everything Leaving political / social satire to one side, this movie is also simply LAUGHTER! And I do not say it lightly; few movies really make me "LOL", but this one does. <br /> <br /> Many of the best jokes are word jokes / sight in the background, so you really have to pay attention to get some of them. I even had to pause and approach some of them (like when Joe got his government ID and for "hair" he said "yes" and for "eyes" he also said "yes"). In addition, the prison has recorded on the front "House for Individual Individuals", since the cops in the film (like real-life cops) call all "individuals" instead of people, etc. Once again, this was on the screen for just a moment ... this is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and dissect it through the layers of funny. <br /> <br /> Also, I usually watch movies with subtitles, and that gave me clues. In some jokes that could go through your ears in the combination of dialogues, for example, the police constantly talk about people who "make a break" instead of "escaping", and there are many other bad pronunciations that just annoy me. But, once again, you may not have picked them up just because of the dialogue mixed with music / sound effects; It is very subtle but still hilarious. <br /> <br /> In addition, the special effects were REALLY GOOD for a science fiction / social satire. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but in general, I think this is one of those movies that if you do not think it's funny, it probably makes fun of you! I plan to recommend this to many, many people!
