Zeke Rippy (Mic) is great, you totally believe in his character. And it's scary as hell, I spent half of the film covering my eyes, the other half on the edge of my seat. It's great to see something so scary and frightening that it's not just blood and guts, but it gave me bad dreams. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a great movie; Get it the first chance you have.
