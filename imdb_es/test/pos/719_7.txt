To summarize this movie: nice for television but too small for the theater. I enjoyed watching this movie at home but I will not see it a second time. The concept is good, but what ends in the movie is just a summary. The end had a "nice" turn, but it's still unsatisfactory. Maybe it was the director's intention, but it did not develop as it should be. But, again, it's a good kind of movie.
