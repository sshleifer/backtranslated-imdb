This is one of the L & H shorts most often cited as the first "real" L & H team and perhaps one of its best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he has never seen. At first, Ollie laughs with everyone when this strange little man moves around and attracts a lot of attention to himself for the way he behaves during his medical examination, but he feels rather humiliated when it turns out that this is the guy who is supposed to be do. he is greeted. He has been told that Philip is a good boy, but he has a weakness: women. Mumblethunder and Philip left to go home, but their trip there is interrupted continuously by Philip breaking into a small dance every time he sees a woman, and then chases after the woman. Every time this happens, huge crowds gather, not so much because he is chasing skirts, but because Philip is also wearing a skirt (a kilt). Finally, Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip to a tailor's shop to have a pair of suitable pants measured, but Philip escapes from there as well to pursue more skirts. There are many laughs everywhere. It is also good to see a short film like this because the kids are not exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is more or less his usual character, but it's a joy to see Stan acting so differently from his usual man-boy character. It shows that he was not a pony of a single trick and stood out in other types of roles when he had the opportunity. With a run time of 19 minutes, it is short and sweet, and offers classic liners that still have me in stitches.
