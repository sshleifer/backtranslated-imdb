If you're going to make fun of James Bond, it's a great idea to find a protagonist who resembles both Sean Connery and Leonard Rossiter, so take a step forward to Jean Dujardin, who perfectly captures Connery's mockery that disguises itself as a smile plus the self-deception of Rossiter's thought. he is soft Dujardin plays him like a Clouseau who can defend himself from karate. The plot has it looking for Our Man in Schtook, who has mysteriously disappeared and includes improbabilities as a Nazi cell hidden inside a pyramid. If there is a discordant note, it is the protagonist, Berenice Bejo who has all the sensuality of a tallow pudding and is eclipsed, but only, by Aure Atika. It's good for a vision but that's it.
