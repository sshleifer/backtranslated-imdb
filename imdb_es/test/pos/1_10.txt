My boyfriend and I went to see The Guardian. At first I did not want to see it, but I loved the movie. It was definitely the best movie I've seen at any time. They represented the USCG very well, they really showed me what they do and I think they should be more appreciated. He not only taught, but it was a really good movie. The film shows what they really do and how hard work is. I think being a USCG would be challenging and very scary. It was a great movie for everyone. I would suggest this movie for anyone to see it. The end broke my heart, but I know why he did it. The story was great, I give it 2 thumbs up. I cried that it was very emotional, I would give it a 20 if I could!
