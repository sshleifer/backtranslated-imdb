It's not a movie, it's an experience! <br /> <br /> It's not the usual eye candy I thought it would be. Too many things are happening at once, your senses almost could not handle it. A cutting-edge technology product (we split between just sitting down to enjoy the show and putting on our 3D glasses to decipher the magic), the music is excellent (it's a concert!), The Disney characters are in it (and you get to BE part of your world), it's fun, it's magical, it's exciting. I know this is starting to sound like an ad, but it's really amazing! Defeat Christmas by taking the child out of you! <br /> <br /> This attraction alone already makes it worth going to Disney. ;)
