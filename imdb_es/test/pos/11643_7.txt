This film has two new features in relation to the message conveyed by other equally good films about the death penalty and executions. These are the tensions that are also given to the drama endured by the parents of the victims, without thereby disguising the hatred and desire for revenge that feel or diminish the horror that represents the execution, and the Christian view of all questions involved . We must also point out that in this film the condemned man is not the nice and innocent person we see in other films dealing with executions, which does not lead us to abandon the idea that a criminal execution is nothing more than a legal murder. Last, but not least, we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight placed in the last moments of the execution course with all the catharsis shown by the last words of the condemned and the detail with which the act of execution is seen in a cut parallel with images of murder scenes in the forest to emphasize that we are facing another murder as ruthless as the last, but done in a cold and supposedly "legal" way.
