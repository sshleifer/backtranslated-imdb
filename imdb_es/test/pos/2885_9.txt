The adaptation of "Picture of Dorian Gray" by John Osborne is an excellent tribute to the talents of Oscar Wilde as a novelist and playwright. On the screen, with some editions, it becomes a bit neglected due to the cut of 3 crucial scenes of the work (one is an important scene between Basil and Henry that shows that time has passed.) However, the performance is brilliant. John Gielgud returns to his Wilde roots as Lord Henry, and although a decade is too old for the role, he becomes totally enigmatic and life-loving and in the cynical that Wilde gave to life so meticulously in his Jeremy Brett is also strong and offers a poignant portrait of the anguished artist Basil Hallward.Peter Firth, although it was not originally my vision of Dorian, handles the paper with style and grace ... and later with a convincing strain of cruelty. The cast is equally good, Gwen Francon-Davies, co-star of Gielgud, "Importance Of Be Earnest", plays her philanthropic Aunt Agatha with dignity and Judi Bowker creates a moving Sybil Vane. My only other obstacle is with hairstyles. Many of them seemed out of place, looking more like the versions of the Victorian hairstyles of the 1970s than the real style. However, in general, acting and writing elevate this production to a high level. Small screen excellence level
