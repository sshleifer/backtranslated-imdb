Personally, I thought the movie was great. I had it pre-ordered for a month and I saw it twice the day I received it by mail, and several times since then ... Yes, the time lapses can be a bit excessive, but the rest of the movie makes up for it clearly. . All the cast of amateurs, however, the performance was correct for each party. The plot itself is just ... emaciated! There is no other way to describe it. Who makes a movie about someone who is being fucked? BAM, that's who. Genius. Simply genius. Two thumbs up. I would be honored to work with him any day, at any time, in anything.
