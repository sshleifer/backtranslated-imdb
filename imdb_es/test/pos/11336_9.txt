Having seen many of Wong Kar-Wai's other films (Happy Together, Fallen Angels, Ashes of Time), he knew what to expect when entering the theater; The cinematography would be exuberant, the use of space and perspective would be varied, the performance would be excellent and at least one of the characters would be consumed by an ineffable loneliness. After all, these are precisely the techniques that make Wong Kar-Wai's art what it is. What I did not expect was the degree to which I was involved in a film that some critics considered "unfinished" and were forced by characters that "seemed consumed by ennui". <br /> <br /> I find it interesting how people make a film that shows emotions and settings so vividly that many of us take it for granted or work hard to forget: the overwhelming sense of pain that results from being betrayed; the guilt awakened by the thought of not being better than the traitor; the mundane but deeply intimate moments of relationships, where the need to express oneself verbally is completely superfluous. This is what Wong Kar-Wai tries to portray in the film and what he accomplishes so well. <br /> <br /> Too many Americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a film full of values ​​dialogue; Ingenious jokes, disgruntled sarcasm and excessive confessions seem to be the pinnacle of the "best" American movie he has to offer. Wong Kar-Wai sees things very differently. Instead of the character needing to keep the public informed of all their feelings, perceptions or beliefs, Wong's characters make their feelings and understandings clearly known through facial gestures, body positioning and, yes, silence. <br /> <br /> If viewers simply contemplate this movie from the point of view of character development and action, then they may be disappointed by what it has to offer. If they are willing to let themselves try and intuit what the characters feel, then they may feel very different about what Wong has to offer them.
