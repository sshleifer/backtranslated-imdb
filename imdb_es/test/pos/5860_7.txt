This is about a homicide detective who is fighting a couple of rich young people who have nothing better to do than to plan a complex murder and cover it up, they seem to outwit the police force apparently at will. They make fun of the detective by planting clues and guiding them in a wild goose chase. This has a decent plot with a few good twists at the end of the film, Sandra Bullock does a good job in this as a woman on the edge, not sure of herself and fighting against her inner demons, it seems that she can not do it. keep a man in his life, especially his partners, it seems that they continue to abandon her for some reason. In general, this is not a bad movie, it keeps you guessing the very shocking ending.
