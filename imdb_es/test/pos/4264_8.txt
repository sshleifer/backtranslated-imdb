This documentary focuses on the events in Gothenburg 2001. In the Swedish media, the protesters were represented as criminals representing anarchy and violence. This movie shows that no, in fact they are intelligent and articulate people who have something to say, and say it with the strength of the bricks. They believe in a better world, a world in which people can think and say what they want, without having to aim. But are their beliefs to have the possibility of changing the realistic society? I think not. <br /> <br /> This documentary gives us an idea of ​​the problems of greed, capitalism and the future that it could bring. It is a great documentary that is not propaganda, because it is not shown as what they say is correct. Everything that shows is what some people think and it is the decision of the spectator to decide if what they do and what they defend is right or wrong. <br /> <br /> I've heard many people label this as propaganda and that's why they choose not to see it, I think they're making a bad decision because even if they sympathize with the police or with the belief of the protesters, everything What you get are more facts you can trust, for example, the child who shot says he thinks it is. Good to throw a brick through a McDonalds window because it is the step between thinking and acting as one thinks. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie scared me because it really can not rule out the facts that the few policemen who fought violence with violence, did not get convicted or stopped in custody, however, proof that they threw bricks to the march of manifestation (and in some cases it hits the people with the truncheon, although they are in the street without making resistance). how it gets. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10 - Very good, but not the best!
