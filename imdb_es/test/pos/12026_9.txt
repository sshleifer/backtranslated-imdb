This was really one of the nicest specials I've seen on TV. He is simply an incredible artist. His personality shines in each of the songs he makes. I really wish it would be available as a DVD without cuts to be able to see it again and again without the explicit language "beeps". I have not had the chance to see it live, but that's something I really want to do now. I can not forget your backup singers. They really added a lot of substance and humor to the show. With their campi style and extravagant dance moves, they really complement Dan's true talent. I wish there were more songs on his live CD, which is also amazing. It's refreshing to see someone like him act. So incredibly nice and real, I really can not say enough about Dan and this show. Once again, I just wish it were available as a DVD without cutting.
