"It is easy to kill a monster, but it is difficult to kill a human being." <br /> <br /> Located in the St. Thomas Housing Project and Angola Prison in New Orleans, "Dead Man Walking" is the true story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a sister nun from Louisiana who became friends with Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a murderer and a rapist destined to a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage couple. Sister Helen agrees to help the condemned and stay with him until the end, an act never before attempted by a woman? <br /> <br /> At his first meeting, Poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot the two children and asks for his help for a new trial to convince the audience of the pardon board to save his lifetime ?? <br /> <br /> The film challenges the audience to reflect on the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to angry and angry parents whose children were shot, stabbed, raped and left in the woods to die single?? <br /> <br /> As Poncelet's execution gets closer and closer, his character looks deceptively complex, harboring doubts about the correctness of what they were doing to him. In a moment, we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector to let his mother know that he is innocent, in another we see him furious playing the victim, blaming the government, drugs, blacks, children for be there. Poncelet never understood that he had stolen both the Percys and the Delacroixs, giving them nothing but pain. They will never see their children again, they will never embrace them, they will love them, they will laugh with them. <br /> <br /> In the scenes prior to his execution, the death row prisoner drops his terrible facade and reveals his identity. Luckily, both Sarandon and Penn are here exceptionally, successfully carrying out an exquisite and tangible harmony of souls. When Sarandon looked at Penn, she projected compassionate eyes full of tears. Does she ask you to visualize her while she dies? "I want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love." In that moment, we really believe that she will be the face of love for him.
