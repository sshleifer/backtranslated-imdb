A very funny look at some of the current affairs and political events in Australia. The Chaser really seem to have fun with this show, and what I enjoy is that everyone has their strengths; some are brilliant (Chas) by making complete idiots of themselves, while Julian can achieve everything. "I'm interviewing a famous politician and I'm about to suggest that he disguises himself as humor." br /> <br /> They have large segments in the program, eliminating all kinds of aspects of the Australian culture, such as our current affairs programs, our announcements and the early-morning television programs. Some of the material is a little tired and predictable, but in general it is very fun to watch and will leave you with a smile on your face.
