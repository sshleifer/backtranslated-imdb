Protagonist: Kelsey Grammar, Rob Schneider, Lauren Holly, Rip Torn This film is a classic favorite of the family. At least for most of the members of my family that is. One of us rolls his eyes when mentioning this film and thinks: "What a stupid movie." Although I am not that person. I still find this movie very funny. I just saw him again last night with someone who had never seen him, and I laughed as hard as the first time I saw him. It is still very fun for me. <br /> <br /> Naval Captain Tom Dodge (Grammar) is a little black sheep in the navy. He is the type of person who will play golf while on a submarine, and gives a ball to a golf course as they pass by. He is the type of person who will get drunk, faint and wake up with a hangover and a tattoo in his backpack. He is not the kind of person that everyone wants to be in charge of a subcommander. <br /> <br /> But Dodge is at the end of the line. He has placed requests to get control of his own sub several times, and if he does not get a sub this time, he goes to a desk job, which means it's for naval life. The Admiralty decides to give him his own ship, but they do not give him a new nuclear submarine. They give him a diesel submarine, an ancient relic of World War II. Its mission is to clean it and take it to the Atlantic for a war game. <br /> <br /> Dodge is, obviously, a little frustrated by the fact that they have given him such a horrible ship when he has worked so hard to get it. to the point where he is, so he goes and talks to Admiral Winslow (Torn) about it. Winslow explains the purpose of the war game. Diesel submarines are still being sold in the real world, to countries like Iran, Iraq and Libya, to name a few. Winslow wants to know what would happen if a renegade captain in a diesel submarine came to the United States and tried to smuggle a nuclear warhead into one of the bases. They would? Dodge and most of the Admiralty do not believe it, but Winslow wants to know for sure, hence he has devised this war game. Dodge's mission is to take the Stingray to the sea, then try to evade the US nuclear navy. UU And fly the US naval bases. In the simulated battle, of course. <br /> <br /> So, that's as deep as the plot gets. This is not a movie based on the plot. It's a stupid movie that's just a big joke. He makes fun of himself, and you do not expect him to take it seriously. If you're looking for good silly laughter on Friday night, I urge you to see it. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: 3 of 4 (worth seeing)
