I was a bit surprised to see all the hate comments here. Of course it's not the best children's show, but do people still despise Barney so much after the fifth grade? <br /> <br /> Okay, everybody hates Barney. Okay, I think your voice and your songs are annoying. It's okay, it's a bit creepy and weird. I'm fourteen years old, so I know pretty well. But here is the thing. Children? LOVE this show. <br /> <br /> When I was a child of two or three years, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than doing anything else. Nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. Accept it, that's how the little kids are. Even the most patients can not sit still long enough to give their parents a break. There is a lot to do, see and explore, too many problems to enter. <br /> <br /> And then Barney came. I do not know exactly what the purple dinosaur is about, which is so fun for children, but I'm sure they love it. I know I did it. I was hooked to the program and wanted to see it again and again. Yes, the songs like they went crazy to my parents, but in order to see their children learn and feel excited about something that can really maintain their attention span, it's worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123, the magic words and brushing my teeth. Of course I had grown up at five or six, of course, but by that point I was at least a little more patient and gave my parents a break. <br /> <br /> My nieces and my nephew spent the Barney stage growing up, to the delight of their mother. I know what keeps Barney in the air. He entertains Of course there's Big Bird, Ernie and Oscar, and they're great too. But in the stage of small children, it seems that more children prefer the big dinosaur singer. And that is enough for me.
