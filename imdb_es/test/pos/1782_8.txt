This is the episode that probably relates most closely to his law of partners, "You will not kill", as it directly raises the ever-controversial issue: "Why do we kill people who kill people to prove that killing is wrong?" This problem occurs in two parts within the episode: before the murder, when the film shows the dichotomy between the idealist lawyer and the street thug so trapped in their ways that their life is no more than a representation of what is. They are supposed to do so, followed by the post-trial period and before the execution, when both suffer for the deaths they feel responsible for and, therefore, share. <br /> <br /> One of the great things about how these episodes work are both small and large, the story is fully developed, so we understand both the motivations and the stories of the characters with the that we can only spend a little less than an hour. Despite all his criminal intent and ridicule, the murderer is still very nice and turns the most important part of his actions around a story of accidental death. His killing is more a desire to control death than any desire to really destroy. Similarly, the idealist ingenuity of the lawyer shows that one is not willing to allow death to happen in a world where he can not control it. Your meeting is, in fact, important; both have to yield to it while they do not propagate it. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is interesting how this episode affects the visualization of Rouge, the later completion of Kieslowski of the Trois Colors trilogy. One of the major influences of Kieslowski seems to be the idea of ​​justice, and considering that the Decalogue is a meditation on something that represents Divine Justice, this seems to be the most self-conscious. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
