This is a little-seen anti-war film that has been ignored for too long. The time is Thanksgiving Day 1972. The place is a typical suburban house somewhere in Texas. The eldest son has just returned from Vietnam and is having a great time readjusting himself to the life he had left behind. And the family does not know how to handle the problem. Honestly, I do not think I'm exaggerating when I say that this is one of the most harrowing war movies I've seen. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences throughout the film. Most of the story takes place inside a house for a period of a couple of days. But the kind of war that takes place in this house is as intense as any real action on the battlefield. The film does something that is difficult to achieve; Somehow, Est√©vez and his team have created a film that embodies the whole experience of Vietnam. And considering the similarities between Vietnam and the current invasion of Iraq, the film is surprisingly relevant. Estevez does a magnificent job with material. Get a lot of help from a hand-picked cast. Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates in particular are excellent as parents. A really moving movie. Highly recommended
