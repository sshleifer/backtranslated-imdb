I do not usually like romantic movies, but I really like this movie. The story is really moving, and the ending is very appropriate. I feel like I really care about many characters in this movie. I feel like I can feel his feelings. While most romantic movies always make me feel distant and boring, it makes me feel completely involved, from the scene of Capshaw running along the beach with Scott to the final scene. I want to rate this movie 11 out of 10, because I want to give an extra point to the end. The acting party is very strong. Kate Capshaw has a good chance to show her talent. Although I am not impressed with Scott in `Dead Man on Campus', this film completely changes my point of view towards him. He is so irresistibly charming here. Geraldine McEwan is as great as ever. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be as good, complex, profound or credible as other films that deal with the same kind of relationship, like 'L' ecole de la chair 'or' Post coitum, sad animal ', but' The Love Letter 'can still be proud of itself, as it sheds a different light on that kind of relationship. And that difference makes this film extremely enjoyable. Being unambitious and trusting in the great charms of the small stars, Dreamworks, this time you really make my dream come true.
