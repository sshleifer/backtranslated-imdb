At 20, Francis Ouimet (Shia Lebouf) as his whole life ahead, somehow. The son of an immigrant family who lived in the United States from the late nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, the class was a very limiting fact of life. If one is born poor, one remains poor; if one is born in the bourgeoisie, it has a little bit of opportunity; if one is born in the moneyed class, they essentially do so in the shade. The golf idol of British gold champion Harry Vardon and Francis (played by Stephen Dillane, who is criminally undervalued) is the exception that confirms the rule. Born and raised in a poor British family, his skill in golf allowed him to climb from the dirty mess of the poorest slums to the lush greens of English country clubs. He has not forgotten this lesson of life. Francis wants to follow in Vardon's footsteps and, similarly, uses his great golfing skills to enter the US Open in 1913 at age 20. But a difficult course and formidable opponents (including the idol of Francis Harry Vardon) is not all that Francis must face. An unsympathetic father and a cruel social framework get in the way of his way of living his own dream. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking, I thought so too, a film produced by Walt Disney about the United States of 1913. Open starring the irritable Shia LaBeouf has the possibility of being entertaining, but it can not be a great movie. Well, I'm here to encourage you to think again. Despite what may seem to some on paper, The Greatest Game Ever Played is one of the best sports films of creation. <br /> <br /> As with all great sports movies, The Greatest Game Ever Played includes many exciting sports scenes but it's not a movie * about * golf - it's a movie centered on the character on how to use the talents , follow dreams and break class barriers. Where The Greatest Game Ever Played works excellently as a themed sports movie, it also works just as well as a period film: the costumes and sets featured in the film are the best choice for time travel. The movie also just * looks * great, and the practically unknown music composer Brian Tyler sets the film on a wonderful piece of music. The cast is also great with a subtle but powerful Stephen Dillane as the British golf champ Harry Vardon, a hilarious Stephen Marcus as the male golfer Ted Ray, a hammy Josh Flitter as the caddy of Francis, Eddie, and a surprisingly good Shi LaBeouf In the main role as Francis. Actor Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Titanic) becomes director here for the second time (directing a feature film) in The Greatest Game Ever Played. It produces an excellent product: it incorporates a lot of heart, ingenuity and attention to detail in the making of the film.
