A young couple: Father Ben (Charles of Charles Bateman), his wife Nicky (the lovely Ahna Capri) and his daughter KT (the cute Geri Reischl of the fame of "Dismember Mama") are trapped in a small desert town Of California. by hysterical madmen. Worse yet, there is a pernicious satanic cult that has been kidnapping young children for their own diabolical purposes. The director Bernard McEveety, working from an unconventional script and inspired by William Welch and L.Q. Jones (the director of "Devil Times Five", Sean MacGregor came up with the strange story), tells the intriguingly strange plot at a slow but steady pace and creates a spooky, nervous and mysterious atmosphere of ooga-booga. Strother Martin offers a wonderfully evil and robust performance as Doc Duncan, who is the gleefully sinister leader of the evil sect. The high-level cast of excellent actor actors qualifies as an important asset: Jones as Sheriff Hillsboro, brusque and carefree, Alvy Moore as friendly local to Toby and Charles Robinson as a cunning and fierce priest Jack. The brilliant and brilliant cinematographic screen of John Arthur Morrill, the spooky score of Jamie Mendoza-Nava and the wild ritual of the rising black mass are also up to date. The idea that toys reach the murderous life is simply ingenious (the opening scene with a toy tank that becomes real and the fact of crushing a family in your car is really a shock). Nice ending mysteriously ambiguous, too. A pleasantly idiosyncratic and little appreciated winner.
