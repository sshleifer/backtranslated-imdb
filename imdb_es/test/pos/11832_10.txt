I loved this movie, the actors were wonderful and they fit their roles. The story itself was great (and true, the scenario was perfect and the message about the human response to the war, the danger and the risk was exceptional.) The person who wrote the musical score also made the music of Life is Beautiful (other of my favorites) - his comment was apparently that "... this was not like an English movie, it was like an Italian movie." I think he's right! Callum Blue is perfect for Eric Newby's part. everyone who wants to see a true and morally uplifting story, as well as a beautiful love story.
