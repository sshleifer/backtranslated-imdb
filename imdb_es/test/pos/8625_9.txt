Approximately 12 minutes into the song, in the scene where Daryl Hannah and JFK Jr are embracing for the first time, there is a beautiful song that is playing ... what is that song ?! And to whom is it sung? It is a song that sounds very romantic and is a singer, playing piano, etc. I've tried everything in the world to search for music on Google and iTunes, etc., but it just does not appear, not even on Lyrics websites. So, if you listen to it, I'd love to know enough to try to get the CD with that song or find it on iTunes. I do not know if my email will be published, I am new to this ... but I will look again here.
