Who is the man ~~~ what do I hear? A resonant scream from Kevin? Well, if you did not shout for the "usual suspect", I would recommend changing your prescription. Anyway, this is not a first class movie, just a very well produced story, which is almost credible. Considering that it is an Alien, you are likely to wonder what? All the performances are the best and also the first thing I have seen is a sarcastic and balanced Alien. All I can say is just nice and almost for the whole family (if not for the scene later in the movie). SEVEN STARS
