The basic plot of this movie has already been detailed in several other comments, so I will not bother. First of all, I would like to congratulate the producer, the cast, the directors and the team for creating a beautifully appealing movie with a meager budget of $ 1 million, a small fraction of the standard Hollywood rate that does not LOOK cheap. These people have the impulse to do something new and entertaining without spending a fortune doing it. This is essentially art for art's sake. I know, I know, some of you will decide that this is not art but something less and that's fine. For my part, I am happy that people like you continue to dedicate time and effort to our benefit without expecting huge multimillion-dollar payments. <br /> <br /> Now to the criticism. I feel that the scenario presented is credible up to a point. It's wonderful when everything works and heroin / heroin saves the day and everything goes well. What attracts me is the flagrant manipulation of events, so that blind luck is more responsible than courage and strength. <br /> <br /> When Lee was attacked but not seriously injured, he somehow washed on an adobe bank right next to the dead guide. Then, miraculously, his loaded revolver is still in its holster and it really works (after of a little cleaning and handling). Finally, when Lee is attacked in the mud bank and jumps into the water, once again the crocodile can not kill it. She finishes with her hand in her mouth and manages to repeatedly squeeze the trigger, and finally to explode the crocodile's brain (literally). <br /> <br /> I came to the conclusion that having Lee out of hand to the mouth of the crocodile was just a way to end the film with the human triumphant. Based on what I have seen, the attack of the crocodile continues and continues until the prey stops fighting. Croc will turn and turn to dismember and drown the prey. That happened to the first 3 victims, but not to Lee. She had tooth marks but they were not deep. <br /> <br /> I think the end would have been better if the crocodile had won, frankly, thus demonstrating its dominance of the mangrove, its territory for millions of years. But then, how many of us would have been upset or disappointed that the pretty girl did not come out alive?
