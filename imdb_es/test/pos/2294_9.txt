I agree with BigAlC: this movie really prepared me for many of the cultural differences and practices before I went to live in Japan for a year in 1993. Tom Selleck does a fantastic job here, as always, and the movie is very funny and fun educational. I am a big fan of Tom Selleck, and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma in this part, giving life to the film in a way that I can not imagine that no other actor can achieve. <br /> <br /> This movie featured some top-notch Japanese actors, and it was very entertaining to see them interacting with Selleck. I imagine the fun he had during the actual shooting of the film: Japan is an amazing place to go, whether you want to party, sightsee or just try to take everything.
