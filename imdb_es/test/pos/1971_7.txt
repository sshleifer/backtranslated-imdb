David Cronenberg's films are easily identifiable, or at least some elements within the film stand out as his trademarks. Fetishism, the blurring between the organic and the inorganic, the things that throb and that should not be soft and throbbing. "eXistenZ" is Cronenberg's classic. In short, it is a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, the visuals are supplied by your mind. The game connects directly to a "bio port" at the base of the spine and while the game is running, the player can not distinguish reality from the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the game developer, guiding a novitiate marketer, Jude Law, through the steps of the game. While in the game they discover strange events and possible crimes. But are they real, or is it the game? Not even the author of the game knows. <br /> <br /> The movie is a delight, keeping the viewer busy, but in the dark until the final minutes. Another thing I like about "eXistenZ" is that it does not use a great dependence on special effects, it's the story itself that drives the movie. Recommended for Saturday night when science fiction is required.
