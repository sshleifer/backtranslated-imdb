This movie sets the standard for all rock biopics to follow. This was achieved through the energetic performances of the drivers, the stability of the camera work (avoiding the clich√©s of the 'rock videos' that were actually invented by the Beatles in their first two films), the compact edition and a non-critical presentation of The Star as a human being instead of a symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a bit unnecessary, and there will always be a debate between the families of the people personally involved in details. But the theme here, as in Elvis's much-recent biography "I walk the Line" or Carpenter's famous Elvis movie of the same era, is whether the meaning of the artist's life, in its time and place, as a catalyst for the ideals of the fans. And the appreciation is manifested in the performance, and this is clearly the case here. We got out of this movie and we understand not only how Buddy Holly became a star, but also why. I do not see what else can be asked for in the movie.
