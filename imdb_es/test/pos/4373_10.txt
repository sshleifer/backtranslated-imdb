My brother hooked me to Carlin in the 70s. I've always loved his observational humor. That is, look at everyday things and find humor in it, like asking: "Have you ever tried to throw an old trash basket? You can not do it! They bring it back!" And ask questions such as why the word "kill" is more acceptable than the word "F", while it makes a lot of sense with the discussion. <br /> <br /> However, during the 1990s his things were less fun and more angry. What he seemed to be doing was putting a mirror in the face of society and saying 'take a look!' At this point, his programs were less comedic and more of a complaints session. But to be fair, it always had a tremendous sense. It really made you think. <br /> <br /> Here was Carlin, old and new. Start with the fun one could have as they grow older, and later criticize the state of the world. Again, it makes perfect sense. <br /> <br /> This was his best moment since "Jammin 'in New York", and as it turns out he was the last. <br /> <br /> I think what 'The Shootist' was to John Wayne, or 'A Prairie Home Companion' to Robert Altman, 'It's Bad For Ya' is for George Carlin. An affectionate farewell to a true great icon. Love him, or hate him, I think he will be remembered.
