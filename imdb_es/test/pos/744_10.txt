'Do not look in the basement' is so easy to play, but the truth is that Brownrigg is one of the real underground stars of Horrors and, in my humble opinion, it is a big delay. 'No' is his undisputed masterpiece. This sympathetic psychodrama immediately catches the viewer in such a strange, disjointed and claustrophobic world of sweaty madness that he has no real idea of ​​what the hell is going on. It makes you feel strangely dirty, just dirty, because Brownrigg's world is this prison cell, crazy and dirty, full of ranting, obsessions and all kinds of mental illnesses. And he uses his low budget palette to wrap his grotto blanket around you as a bad memory. There's something so wonderfully strange about this whole damn thing. In a word, classic ... Also, if you look at 'No' first, then you will have an idea of ​​the demented psychodrama style that marks the other Brownrigg films. In short, they really are not more esoteric than this, well, actually yes, they track the theme "Keep my grave open" by Brownrigg. Crazy genius Do not accept substitute.
