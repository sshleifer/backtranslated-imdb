Rich businessman Bill Compton (played by Dennis Patrick) accidentally kills his daughter's hippie boyfriend after an argument. Terrified by panic, he retires to a bar and meets Joe Curran (played by Peter Boyle): a noisy, angry fanatic who is bitter about how his beloved country has become. Unwittingly, Bill allows Joe to discover that he has just killed a hippie. And this is just the beginning. "Joe" is a classic movie of an unlikely friendship. A bond between two men, one with a white collar and the other with a blue collar. Bill and Joe have one thing in common, they are in disgrace because of how crazy the world has become. Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle have given very realistic representations of their characters. The director John G. Avidsen with this effort "prior to Rocky", directs this gem of low budget with the same delicacy as a movie with a budget of $ 100 million. The script is loaded with an excellent development of characters and a very agile and realistic dialogue. Despite its strengths, this film has its weaknesses. The script falls asleep about 3/4 of the way, but wakes up just in time for the discordant climax. This film also features a very early and uninspiring performance of Susan Sarandon, 24, as Bill's daughter, Melissa, along with her hippie boyfriend, Frank, played very blandly by Patrick Mc Dermott. One could only be grateful that he was killed at the beginning of the movie. Despite its few flaws, this is one of those forgotten movies of the 70s that should not be. Although "Joe" is very outdated by today's standards, the chemistry between Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle is completely relevant today, and it is the glue that holds the entire film together.
