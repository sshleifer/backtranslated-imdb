What a pleasure. This is really a parody. Only the French can do that kind of thing without being crude. And as a result, you spend a very good time watching Jean Dujardin playing dumb. Most of the film is on his shoulders, and he has them wide enough to make this movie good. He has the perfect way to exaggerate with the kind of James Bond guy who is no match for Mike Meyers in Austin Powers, for example. The dialogues are also good enough to keep the viewer's attention, with many stupid jokes, that's really perfect. The two women who have the main parts in the film support the comparison with the main character, and that was a challenge. There is really no argument in this movie, but that is not what is expected in this type of film. He only wants to laugh one hour and 40 minutes, and that is precisely what the film manages to do. It deserves the success it has in France.
