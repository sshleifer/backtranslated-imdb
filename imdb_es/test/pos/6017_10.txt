Watching this on Comcast On-Demand. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch this musical, I'm surprised by the songs ... one show-stopper after another. <br /> <br /> This interpretation is, for me, magical. The songs shine ... the voices, the orchestrations and the choreography are incredible for a movie "made for TV" ... better than many stage versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> The debate about Bette simply does not make sense. She's mamma. Her voice is bright and yet full of the pathos of the stage mother who lives with her daughters. I still feel tears at the end when it finally has its moment of glory, no matter how faded that glory is. <br /> <br /> The Tulsa / Louise duo / dance is now underway. Fabulous. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondheim is the king of musical theater. His lyrics just come out of the tongue like silk ... Styne's music is perhaps the best written for the stage / screen. <br /> <br /> Thank God, we have this masterpiece from the American Musical Theater captured on DVD.
