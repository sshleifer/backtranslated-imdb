Fred Carpenter screened Eddie Monroe at Boston College and, judging by the enthusiastic response, he has a lot to be happy about. An Indy taught and well done, impressive for its appearance and large budget. This movie has it all: a tight script that catches you and does not let you go until the surprise ending. This viewer did not see it coming! Excellent performances around. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were specially chosen to lead, offering excellent performances. And congratulations to Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado for creating two detectives as attractive and interesting to watch as any movie. I enjoyed this movie very much. It confirmed my belief that some of the best film work will come from independents, and Fred Carpenter seems to be one of the best.
