A recent reissue of the French crime film (original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes'), with its famous sequence of silent jewelry thefts of 20 minutes, now appears in the USA. UU With a new and beautiful impression of The Criterion Collection with improved subtitles. and some extras. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut) who was forced to make films in Europe because he was on the blacklist. Rififi was well publicized in the USA. UU And he got good results in the art houses. Later, Dassin became much more famous in the United States for "Never on Sunday" (1960), starring his wife, the Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was again glamorized and popularized for Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihalis Kakogiannis' 1964 'Zorba the Greek', which was even a huge hit in Cairo.) The new Rififi DVD includes a recent interview with Dassin. I had not previously realized that one of the main thieves, CÃ©sar the Milanese, was played by Dassin, who intervened when the original actor was not available. He is one of the most memorable characters, a reliable Italian cracker who does not speak French. <br /> <br /> Although this classic has all the characteristics of French cinema: the black and white world of well-lit apartments. Bright black cars, men in suits, nightclub scenes, which include a song dramatically filmed and lit in the club, stone faces and Gauloises in the hand or mouth. I do not think it's so atmospheric or so distinctive. A style like the Melville movies do. But there is the fascinating theft, which still remains a tour de force. It goes like a clock, with a fine sense of craftsmanship and teamwork among thieves. Some meddlesome policemen are treated efficiently. Things quickly go wrong after they go home and distribute the booty when one of the players is careless and gives a touch to a lady with a million dollar bracelet. Has there ever been a robbery movie whose perpetrators lived happily ever after? <br /> <br /> It's the sequence of words without words that guarantees that this is a special place, and Dassin, an American director who had an unusually varied and exotic career, deserves all the credit for it. He took a novel so conventional that he would reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. In the event, he could not stop making the adjustment: he needed the money too much. Jean Servais, who plays the main character, Tony le Stephanois, was a rather unlucky actor. His grim face is perfect for paper. Later, he became the protagonist of He Who Must Die (1957), by Dassin, who used French actors in Greece for a political story. 'Topkapi' is a disappointing 1964 film (it pales in comparison to 'Rififi') that also had distribution in the United States. It has a good fit, but it is wasted, it becomes soft, shiny and beautiful. Of Dassin's post-Hollywood work, "Never on Sunday", with its catchy theme and its charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won the Best Film at Cannes 1960); 'The one who must die' the political choice; 'Rififi' the choice of gender. A strange piece is his 'Phaedra' with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). Hard-working Hollywood gentry purists would avoid them and favor Dassin's early films, which include a prison drama, 'Brute Force' (1947); a police film, 'The Naked City' (1948); and two hard core noires, 'Thieves' Highway' (1949), and 'Night and the City' (1950). Personally, I like French French and the American neo-American spin-off more than the original material of American origin, hence my great fascination with the 'Rififi'. But Dassin is quite unique, since he not only made Hollywood Noir but then went to Paris and produced a memorable example of his French derivative of the fifties.
