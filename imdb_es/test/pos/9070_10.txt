Generally, I distrust the movies that go around the 6/10 mark in IMDb. I would like to think that people know what they are talking about and know what they like. I guess the trick with the review is to adopt a "Hey, if I liked movie types like these, would you give a higher score than I'm about to give now, since I do not like these types of movies ? " Then, again, people judge differently, based more on acting, or maybe on a story or direction. Anyway, landing the plane here, I had rented this movie before and I had not had time to see it, this morning I did it. <br /> <br /> Wow! Watch this movie Personally I'm interested in the paranormal / I've read a bit about the near-death experiences, so I was automatically hooked. I'm not sure about some of the comments here that say a quality cast was wasted here, I do not agree, the performance here was excellent for everyone, I think this is the only time I did not care about Julia Roberts, it was good to see the 24's Kiefer Sutherland (Currently at the time of this review, serving a prison sentence for DUI) and Kevin Bacon wearing an interesting hairstyle. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the direction, the atmosphere, the performance and the story line, especially, particularly the idea of ​​karma, and, to quote Nelson Wright, "Everything we do it matters. " Very true! <br /> <br /> 10/10!
