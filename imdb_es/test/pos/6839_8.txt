This was the first directorial work of Sebastian Gutierrez, the writer of Snakes on a Plane and Gothika. Anyone who has read my comments knows that I love capers, and this was disgusting. A kidnap and a woman fired in the process. The FBI has Emma Thompson in the kidnapping case and the Chief of Police (Roscoe Lee Browne) assigns Alan Rickman to solve the murder, which turns out to be the wife of a Senator (Hal Holbrook). These two form an outstanding couple as they work together. <br /> <br /> The kidnappers / murderers have the lovers Simon Baker (Land of the dead) and the ultra hot Carla Gugino (Sin City), along with a couple of partners. They kidnapped a computer mogul and took him to his accountant throughout the city before obtaining the dough. Things go fast from there when new twists and turns are introduced. Everything is brilliant and it is definitely a "piss in your pants because you can not go to the bathroom or you will miss something" emotion. <br /> <Now, to be completely honest, I would have given this movie a 10 if there had been more movies that the security guard was seeing at the opening. I would have loved to see more of Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lera, but, hey, that was not part of the adventure; just the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Thompson and Rickman should definitely make more movies together. A treatment: <br /> <br /> Agent Hawkins: So inform me. Detective Friedman: That comment could be misinterpreted as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's get off the road then: you've never worked with a superior woman before. I got to where I am pushing the paper and playing well. I've never fired a gun before, I'm just in this job to show my father that I'm not a coward. I give my head decently, so I was promoted to all worthy candidates, all of them men, all equally gifted in fellatio, but there was a gender quota to fill. I am also stupid and idealistic; You're tough and cynical, and you're usually right. I'm secretly in love with you but it's hard for me to prove it. Did I miss something? <br /> <br /> Damn, that's a great dialogue! Guti√©rrez not only directs a great movie, but he can also write. <br /> <br /> And, did I say that Carla Gugino was in fashion? <br /> <br /> Put this on your list.
