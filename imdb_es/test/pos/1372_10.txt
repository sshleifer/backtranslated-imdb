I must confess that I know some of those involved, I was a precursor of The Planet, Evil Unleased, however, this was more than 10 years ago and since then I lost contact with them. It happened that I was watching BBC Scotland News and an article about Scottish Cinema, which mentioned and showed clips of The Planet and comments from its director Mark Stirton, which led me to request a copy of the film on DVD. <br /> <br /> Now, for the movie, the level of acting, writing, directing and sfx is one of the best, well, it's not Star Wars, but I've seen a lot of Hollywood products that are very inferior. It's very strange to see a movie spoken with my local accent in northeastern Scotland, but that soon happened. <br /> <br /> ^ Light Spoilers ^ <br /> <br /> The planet is based on several science fiction classics; Star Wars, Alien, Pitch Black, Forbidden Planet and Predator, a handful of the merchant crew of a deep space ship survive their ship being attacked and destroyed by unknown ships, escaping to an abandoned desert planet, one by one they are killed by the invisible attackers, the only passenger on the ships, a mysterious prisoner also arrives on the planet, a battle is fought while the crew struggles to survive. <br /> <br /> The planet is a brilliant piece of science fiction movie that does that. he certainly hides his limited budget, well done for Mark, Mike and everyone involved, I look forward to his next job.
