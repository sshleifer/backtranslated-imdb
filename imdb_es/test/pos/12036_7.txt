Granted, when it comes to plots, this movie is far from believable and also a bit silly. However, despite its many shortcomings, the film manages to work, provided you turn off your brain and enjoy the madness of all this. If you can not, then you probably will not like this movie very much. <br /> <br /> In one of the weirdest plots of the 1930s, Robert Montgomery plays a guy who lives near the Arctic Circle on a wireless station. It is not known exactly how he arrived at such a remote outpost, but in this very lonely and isolated existence, a constant series of guests arrive, although for years he had seen no one but the Eskimos. <br /> <br /> First, Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy arrive when their plane crashes. Supposedly, they are heading to Montreal, how they have stayed so far from the impossible! Reginald is a boring and boring guy who is really worried about Montgomery, since Robert has not seen a woman in a long time and Owen seems in constant fear of Montgomery going to steal Loy for him. As for Montgomery, that is EXACTLY what his plans are. For a long time, you never really understand why Loy is engaged to Owen, as he is as attractive as wet bread. <br /> <br /> Soon, Loy and Montgomery fall in love, but this is useless when. Suddenly, again, Montgomery's old fianc√©e arrives to announce that she is there to marry him! Keeping in mind that for more than two years he never wrote it and refused to follow it, Montgomery naturally assumed that the relationship was over, but the sudden arrival of the chipper and the annoying girlfriend is enough to destroy the plans that Loy and Montgomery were making. . <br /> <br /> How all this is resolved is something you can see for yourself. As for the film, the plot is very silly and artificial: I can not defend this. BUT, it's also quite funny and charming, and I see this movie as a funny comedy that is only one or two steps below contemporary movies like BRINGING UP BABY. Silly, light but also very charming. It's worth seeing, despite not being especially credible.
