This is undoubtedly one of the best western films produced in the new millennium. It is a tribute to all the stars of the great classics of Western television, and it is the definitive rebirth of the western film. The story of two brothers who meet after the War between the States and end up on different sides of the law is not new but it is interesting, and the shootings and the atmosphere are great. There is some graphic violence, like the bad guys who are cut with an ax or women shot in cold blood, and Lee Majors does not participate in the action until the end, so I gave him 9 out of 10 points. But it's still one of the best new western productions I've seen. I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Chris McIntyre at the Festival of the West and having a good conversation with him, and I had the opportunity to meet Buck Taylor, who plays the role of municipal doctor. In my opinion, we should be very grateful to Chris McIntyre for his efforts to gather so many stars from the classic television and SASS westerns around him to act in a new western like this. Chris also has an outstanding talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters. Both are young and promising, and I think we should see more of them in future Western productions. I sincerely enjoyed this western movie, it was worth every minute. I hope that Chris McIntyre continues working on other western films and presents us with some great productions like this one. Great job, Chris! Jasper P. Morgan (Pete)
