With "Anatomy", German film producers have tried to do something totally new. Usually, there are only drama or comedy movies: the horror genre is (or was) totally new at that time. <br /> <br /> The story is also new and impressive. Franka Potente plays her brilliant role and I bet you will not find out who the killer is. It is possible, but difficult. A really great movie with many talented actors.
