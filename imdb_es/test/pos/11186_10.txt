"Curse of Monkey Island" is a treasure; In my opinion, the series as a whole was the holy grail of adventure games, not to mention LucasArts. <br /> <br /> But to return to "Curse", what is beautiful about CMI is that he is not afraid to be himself. It deviates from the first two, but remains true to the productions of Ron Gilbert (if only you could say the same of the fourth installment of the series!). The voice work is impeccable, with Dominic Armato playing our favorite protagonist, Guybrush Threepwood. The animation, while quite different from the classic pixelated characters, is beautifully done. It really is absolutely beautiful. And the music is fantastic! It is never annoying and you never have the need to turn it off. <br /> <br /> Although I am not too much of a fan of romance, the romantic scenes and the themes are not at all overwhelming. They also have the rare ability to get out candies instead of cheesy. That says a lot about a girl who habitually falls asleep during girl movies. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, it is the classic element of MI humor. CMI is quite adept at the delivery of dead lines, a totally absurd humor and simply fun. Gary Coleman makes a cameo appearance as a budding young entrepreneur, and world events are attacked with discretion without leaving the game. <br /> <br /> It is not entirely fair to compare CMI with MI and MI2 because it really is in a realm of its own. Personally I can never find a favorite among the 3, since they are all very different from each other. However, if you want to have a good time with the charm of the classic series, I insist that you give this game a chance. You will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars, without a doubt. <br /> <br /> - Emily N
