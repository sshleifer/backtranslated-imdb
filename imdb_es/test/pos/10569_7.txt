Historical drama is one of the areas where the British simply can not be defeated. So, although I'm not a big fan of the genre, I can usually convince me to see something small if it's British and with decent actors. <br /> <br /> I've never read anything about Sarah Waters, which is of course something I should do. Therefore, I really did not know what to expect from this. I had heard that there would be a lesbian love story, but not much more. While I was watching it, I found it much more interesting than I had anticipated. Without saying too much, the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected and well done. Although there was almost a twist too much somewhere, it took me a minute to get everything right. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are good, the actors are very solid and the pace is decent, although I thought it was a bit slow in the last half hour. Although it could be just me, I usually have a problem with the films that are prolonged after the plot is more or less finished. In short, it's about three pretty nice hours. I recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas.
