The first time I saw this film in the cinema was two years ago, and I fell in love with this dark tale of two meditative, half-faced teenage sisters who clash at home in their big country house with their father and stepmother. His relationship with his stepmother is tense, at least, and it seems that the stepmother is becoming increasingly unstable in his battles with younger girls. The film leans with the effects of ghosts and horror of the oriental style, which adds a strange and disturbing aspect to the story that, when seen for the first time, is not clear, but it is even more intriguing. <br /> <br /> The direction is incredibly good, and the acting is impressive, with the stepmother, in particular, incredibly good going from one style of humor to another in the movie. The big house adds curiosity, and there are enough points in the movie where you will jump out of your seat. This movie for me clearly shows why Korean cinema is possibly the most original best in the world at this time. Unfortunately, in the Western world you do not see anything like this, and I can really see that it influences filmmakers around the world in the next decade. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, highly recommended. a true joy and fright ...
