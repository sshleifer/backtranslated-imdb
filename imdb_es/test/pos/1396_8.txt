When a group of escaped convicts manages to flee to a remote island, they soon discover that their new home is inhabited by a strangely threatening doctor (Richard Johnson of the fame of "Zombie 2"), a mad scientist (Joseph Cotten), his beautiful daughter . (Barbara Bach) and a horde of superstitious natives. The members of the tribe say that the doctor has created crotescas creatures half human, half fish for evil and secret purposes. And although at first the prisoners do not believe this, since they disappear, one by one, they begin to change their minds. "Screamers" is a very entertaining mix of "Mysterious Island" and "Humanoids from the Deep". There's a lot of blood with a really great decapitation scene and a throat tear to improve. Acting is like that, but the film is fast and entertaining. Take a look.8 of 10.
