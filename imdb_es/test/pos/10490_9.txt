This is an exciting story that takes elements from the Kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent western tale. <br /> <br /> The film has a good musical score, although it is based on repeating the title theme too much. Giuliano Gemma and the rest of the cast are excellent. This is a spaghetti western more cerebral than usual that is based more on history than on action, and is successful because the story is excellent. This does not mean that there is no action in the movie. There is a lot, and it is very well made. This movie attracts you immediately and keeps you absorbed until the end. You will always be wondering what is in those documents after all the world. He also has some scathing comments about American politics. <br /> <br /> This film shows why Valerii, in my opinion, is tied with Sollima and Corbucci for the second place in the ranking of spaghetti western directors.
