This is a fabulous movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a good thread, and it has imagination in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view. What was deliberate and what was coincidence? Who is in love with whom? <br /> <br /> You have the opportunity to put yourself in the place of each of the characters (sometimes literally), and this helps define each character to a satisfactory depth. <Br /> <br /> With a little effort following the twists and turns, you can understand each of the characters; and the key events of the film are captured again from the point of view of different people. <br /> <br /> Take advantage of the opportunity if it is again your auteur cinema; It looks good on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Rather than keep you guessing, the plot twists to the point where you just sit back and watch what happens: challenge anyone to predict! <br /> <br /> But it is more likely that you need more than one visualization: I saw this in the photos of your original release three times, and it improved each time. <br /> <br /> The performance was very good, with a prominent performance of Romane Bohringer as Alicia torn in three directions by the other three characters of the set. <br /> <br /> A classic. The second best movie of the nineties.
