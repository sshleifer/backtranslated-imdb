People who know me say that I have a weakness for animated films. <br /> <br /> To be fair, those people have the HALF right. My real weakness is for the exceptionally well-made animated films, like this vintage Max movie. and David Fleischer. <br /> <br /> You may be thinking, "Well, if it's so good, why have not I heard it?" Good question. This movie was released the same week as the attacks on Pearl Harbor. The inevitably bad weather caused the film to sink into relative darkness. However, things are getting better because finally it was released on DVD with the title "BUGVILLE". <br /> <br /> It's funny that the movie has gone through all this, because it reflects the real storyline. Although some people claim that the film is trying to send an environmental message (ugh), I personally believe that the main idea of ​​the film is perseverance through adversity and difficult times (after all, the country had barely left its mark). the Depression at that time). <br /> <br /> Our grasshopper hero, Hoppity, desperately wants to help his community in danger of extinction. Problem: every time you try, either by the bad will of others or by simple bad luck, fails miserably ... and slowly begins to win the disdain of the very people you are trying to save. Although he does his best to maintain a positive attitude, he occasionally collapses and it is only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he stands up and fights the good fight. Just a healthy reminder that, when all is said and done, nobody is really self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> "OK", you're saying. "He has a good message (two actually) Does that really make it EXCEPTIONALLY WELL DONE?" <br /> <br /> My answer: Partially. <br /> <br /> It's not just the message that makes this film special. It is the characterization. This is one of those movies where you can see the personality of each cast member in their animation. You almost do not need the spoken lines. A good way to summarize it is "energetic" or "lively". Many films have used the point of sale, "cast of friendly characters". Every time I hear that phrase, it always makes me think about this movie. <br /> <br /> At this point, the bad guys: Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito. Many movies have "adorable" villains, but I do not think you'll find any as entertaining or attractive as these comrades. Forget those 3 cartoons jokes of the 60s. Swat and Smack are the closest thing to an animated version of Moe and Curly (but unfortunately not Larry) that you will never find. Virtually all the funniest moments somehow involve this dreaded duo. Yes, they are rotten not-good, but you still care about them. That is the kind of power that can only be seen in a writer, director and very talented team. <br /> <br /> The film has two brief jokes that revolve around racial stereotypes (Native American and Chinese). I do not think they were meant to be malicious; but they are there, independently. They did not bother me, but it would be very unfair of me not to warn someone who could potentially be bothered by them. <br /> <br /> So, if you share my weakness (and I think so), give this one a chance.
