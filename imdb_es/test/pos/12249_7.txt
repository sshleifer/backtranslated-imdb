I have not seen many movies with Holly Hunter, but seeing her on Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. She is a tough journalist, Jane Craig, who has devoted all her time to the television news program. His colleague Aaron Altman has carried his torch for a long time without saying anything. The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick. He is the former athlete who is the new reporter. For Jane, he symbolizes everything she does not like about the news: turning it into educational entertainment, not a serious matter. To her surprise, Jane is attracted to Tom. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter is doing a great performance as a happy journalist. But I do not see at all what she finds so charming about her new colleague, Tom. It is something with them that prevents us from approaching him personally. Almost as impressive is Albert Brooks, who gives everything in the role of a professional who gives more than 100 percent for his work, but does not get as much in return. Actually, for a while I thought it was Steve Guttenberg from the Police Academy (1984). It has some funny lines and if this were an image of Meg Ryan, they would call it romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> With more than two hours, some scenes could have been edited or omitted altogether. eg Jane and Aaron's trip to Central America. Also, I am a fan of happy endings and I preferred a different ending to just one meeting between three and seven years later.
