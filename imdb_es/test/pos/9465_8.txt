I have to be honest, I really had a great time watching She's the Man. Despite being a typical teen comedy or if you want to change the sex movie, I had some pretty decent laughs that I think anyone could get. Adults and teenagers alike will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is your typical rebellious teenager who dresses and acts like a man, and when denied the opportunity to participate in the boy's soccer team, decides to take charge of his brother's appearance to show that he is worthy of being on the child's soccer team. Of course, love manifests when he meets another boy who believes he is his brother. She also has a girl who is chasing her. Well, the label line says it all. <br /> <br /> This is a fun little drama for teenagers that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes demonstrated something in the movie, it's really hard to act like a man. : D Well, it's true! <br /> <br /> 8/10
