This started excellently. Photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (well, months). Especially, the use of "warm" and "cold" colors in individual sequences is surprising. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to achieve with that. <br /> <br /> Now, for the least. The script was horrible. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally useless for the plot. She seemed to star in the movie just to sell herself and the picture. The three beds seemed too obvious. The baptism of the child Carl was a psychologically too underlined way of embarking on the reason why Carl "worked". And so on ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie had a great way of showing where Singh comes from. Why is it that the most talented directors seem to emerge from India today?
