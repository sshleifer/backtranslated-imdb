Let's remove the defect from the path, the film should have been much longer. Ray Charles was a brilliant and fascinating man who led a complex and challenging life. There was simply no way to fit everything, or even touch it all, into a standard length movie. Given the above, the creators of this film did an admirable job (and I'm pretty agonizing) to put together a film that could not tell the whole story and managed to expose a representative sample of the man and his music. The strengths of Ray Charles were evident throughout the film and their weaknesses were not amplified or coated with sugar. We could have wanted one more hour of chronicle of his life after 1980, but I suppose he would have tended to turn the film into a tribute and, although it would also have allowed the resolution of several things that were hung at the end, in balance, I think it was better as presented. <br /> <br /> Now, for the big question: what are the criteria for an Oscar? The wife and I have seen countless movies in our years, but we immediately agreed that we have never seen a performance like that of Jamie Foxx. The line between the actor and the character was not blurred, but disappeared completely. We had heard a lot of exaggeration before watching the movie, but this was amazing. Foxx was Ray Charles. He did not see the film with the feeling that he was watching Foxx do an outstanding job of portraying Ray Charles: he saw him somehow believing or understanding that he was seeing Ray Charles in person. I do not know how to put it. We were completely impressed. I admit we have not seen all the other performances for an Oscar this year, but that does not really matter. Foxx took this to a more complete level, one that we have never seen before and we doubt that we can see again. I can not think of any other film I have seen in which a person who plays a role so completely and convincingly becomes the person represented. We salute you, Mr. Foxx. We understand that the awarding of an Oscar has to do with much more than performance, but win or not, we want you to know that you have done something that is in a class absolutely by itself and you should feel very proud. his incomparable achievement. <br /> <br /> PS The music was naturally great. I told the wife that if there is a moment in the history of music that I wish I had witnessed, it would have been the genesis (in Kansas City, is not it?). What did I say? The movie did a wonderful job with her, I wish I could have been there!
