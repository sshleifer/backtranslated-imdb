I finally got to see this movie ... after so many years of expectation ... <br /> <br /> I was so curious to see if this movie is as bad as some people say ... <br /> <br / > And my opinion is that this movie was not bad, on the contrary, it was INCREDIBLE ... <br /> <br /> I enjoyed every second of it ... from the beginning to the end ... <br /> <br /> The actors were great, they sent me the feeling that I was living the story at the same time as the movie ... <br /> <br /> The landscapes were so beautiful was the movie that was filmed ... and I loved it ... Also the music was extraordinary and I have nothing <br /> <br /> to reproach .. <br /> <br /> I think the plot was very original, I do not think I saw a movie like this ... <br /> <br /> It's a shame that you do not recognize yourself in the whole world ... to the bad of those who did not. You do not have the opportunity to see him I give him this movie 10/10
