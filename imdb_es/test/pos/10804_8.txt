Unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/, this movie does not provide background information. We are shown a snapshot of Danton's fall, his sham process and his execution, but, unless one studies the revolution extensively, it is difficult to understand where the characters come from (Fouquier-Tinville, Philippeau, Desmoulins, Robespierre ...) and to appreciate them for what they are: Danton and Joe Blobb could be the same person for the viewer. For example, Robespierre and Desmoulins were close friends since their youth, and this explains how Robespierre acts. However, those who know the facts will be easily oriented and appreciate this good movie with actors who provide a solid performance, without unnecessary secondary arguments and a good reconstruction of the times. Desmoulins and Danton are the best characters, but they all do a good job, even the "insane" Saint-Just, represented as a kind of psychopath. 'Terreur' was a period of massacres whose importance has not been fully documented and which, for the most part, were driven by ambition, greed and resolution of personal disputes, fueled by ignorant sans-culottes as the next step of epoch against tyranny. .
