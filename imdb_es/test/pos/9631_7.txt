It seems that all the people did not like Steven Seagal: just take a look at his list of nominations, there are only nominations for the razzie awards (with a victory) for him, but I think he won none of that. I saw good movies with Steven Seagal, I saw bad movies with Steven Seagal. AND THE PATRIOT (1998) is one of his best films, almost as good as UNDER SIEGE (1992) or HARD TO KILL (1990). THE PATRIOTA shows his activities to protect nature. Surely, this movie is not very good, and I must say that there is more violence than I like, and why should Seagal's best friend, L. Q. Jones die for the death of a victim? The role of Dr. McClaren is one of the best performances of Seagal. He has, as always, a very good charisma. And in summary, THE PATRIOT is a good entertainment, and with an average score of only 4 points the most underestimated movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Regards, Hans-Dieter
