It is a very sensitive portrait of life with unrestricted or restricted desires. What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? A husband finds an exit with the immigrant, since the immigrants do not belong or are not accepted, they do not need to conform and repress their desires. The other husband seeks consolation in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness. It fails, of course, and it breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons. Sita still cared enough to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for his departure diverted to his blocked desires. The mother in her still could not find the strength to destroy her myth. She sees him as a child who glorifies himself in his control of lust, but should he give her the chance to grow up eventually? Both wives find courage and unity through the shared rejection of their husbands. <br /> <br /> But the final act of rejection was of the grandmother: she could not free herself from her rusty mentality to accept Sita's desire. A decade and more of attention was not enough to break the chains of their culture. <br /> <br /> It seems that it was easier for the help of the house to let their desires flow, since in any case it is cursed for their culture: to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. Since there is no respect and expectations anyway, I could also prove sin.
