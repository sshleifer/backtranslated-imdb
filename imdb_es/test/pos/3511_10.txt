I saw it for the first time one afternoon in the 80's on the television network. I think he was 9 years old. (Imagine seeing a violent horror movie today on normal television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered, it's a really good and terrifying movie. I think the reason why it can go unnoticed is because it was not followed by a lot of sequels, that is, on Friday the 13th. But it is one of those films that takes the original idea and makes it better. Even though this is a killer in the woods movie like Friday, it has more in common with the original Texas massacre. This is because the film creates a certain atmosphere and a sense of fear, even in broad daylight. And murderers feel more threatening than on Friday. There is also a good amount of suspense. I recommend seeing it now that it will be released on DVD at the end of July.
