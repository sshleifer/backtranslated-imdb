-Facts (I): "Mar Adentro" tells the well-known story (at least in Spain) of Ramón Sampedro, a Galician quadriplegic who committed suicide (helped by some friends) after 28 years prostrated by his condition. The judges had denied their requests for active euthanasia several times. <br /> <br /> -Hechos (II): "Mar adentro" becomes THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR in Spain. Everyone talks about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people ... Everyone likes it, even the opinions of critics are unanimous. The film wins many awards (Golden Globe, Oscar, Goya ...) and annoys the Catholic community and quadriplegic lovers of life. A star has been born. <br /> <br /> -Facts (III): the intensity and quality of the actors in "Mar Adentro" are incredible, and this makes me wonder why we have to see the same badly. Young actors in most of the latest Spanish films. I do not know if Javier Bardem is a great actor or a great imitator (there is a big difference between one thing or another); Anyway, his work is impressive, like that of Lola Dueñas, Belén Rueda or the work of all the invited stars. This is (the selection of actors) the strong point in Amenábar's film. <br /> <br /> -Hechos (IV): Alejandro Amenábar learned his lesson there at the Film School, there is no doubt about it: he has a privileged brain. He takes good control of each and every one of the technical aspects, he knows what the audience wants, he knows how to play the right chord, even if that makes him a demagogue (as Spielberg is one of Amenábar's idols). ). <br /> <br /> -Facts (and V): If you criticize a movie like "Mar Adentro", it will appear that you have some kind of problem with the moral issue that the story talks about. There is a trap in this type of images: we have to differentiate between the film itself and the moral concepts. If you do not like the "Schindler List", that does not mean that you agree with Hitler's philosophy (or do you?). So, for me, it's a good movie and an extraordinary story (since it's a real story that makes it much more extraordinary). Grandilocente, friendly, and anything but neutral (no matter what Amenábar or Bardem have said about it: the characters who are not in favor of euthanasia are not good at all!). 50% difficult / 50% too sentimental. <br /> <br /> -Epilogo: "Mar Adentro" would not be in any way in my ranking of the best Spanish films of the 50 of all time. No one has special merits in history, except Ramón Sampedro himself. He is the movie Now, Alejandro Amenábar will become the most international Spanish director in history, maybe he will go live in Hollywood; but some of us would like to see him film a simple story, without final twists, without dying dead or dying alive ... "The Others" is still his best movie. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
