If you want to see a brilliant performance by Mikado, played perfectly with expert timing, do not look at this version. If you want to see a hammy version with Eric Idle walking in the society of private clubs of English gentlemen of 1930, this is the one you should see. It's a lot of fun and a good introduction for Gilbert and Sullivan, but after that, hurry up and rent the Canadian version of Stratford. You will see the difference between good and great. Nobody does G & S better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford group.
