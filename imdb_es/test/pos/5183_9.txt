Rosie Perez is the protagonist of this very attractive subject, played as Mercedes, a young girl from Brooklyn who has decided to become a film actress, although she is not favored by her circumstances, she lives in East Los Angeles and fights with a series of unsuccessful auditions for anyone. part-way at all Mercedes has teamed up with a married and fallen actor, Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel), who had once acted in a Western television series during the 1970s, and rarely since then, accepting him as his lover, partly because of loneliness. and also for the hope that the parts of the film will come in their direction due to their "contacts", but the latter are of little importance since Harry is simply self-delirious in his attempts to recover what he perceives as a renown cinematic past. In order to stay financially, Mercedes is busy as a taxi dancer at a Skid Row bar / ballroom in downtown Los Angeles as she continues to strive to succeed in the movie business, and that is while in the dance palace that Ernesto (Michael DeLorenzo), a young immigrant from Mexico, falls in love with her and most of the narrative describes her efforts to please the object of her affections, even if they can mean losing her completely. This melodrama, essentially rooted in tradition, is given only a moderate budget, despite the presence of a number of well-known players, including Steve Buscemi, Anthony Quinn and Stanley Tucci, and remained in the can during about a year before it was quite difficult. The efforts of distributing and marketing lead on his behalf, more than worth it, since its solid production characteristics are complemented firmly by the admirable controlled direction of Alexandre Rockwell, a constant virtue of his work, and shown in this film from his opening scene, frames that form a montage behind the credits, with PÃ©rez on Fifth and Main streets of Skid Row. Rockwell has often shown that it operates very closely with its cast, and this is true in this case, since it allows its actors to create their roles, while any ad complements itself well through the editing process, resulting in an artistic success for the director. , despite the negative comments of some general evaluators. The score of the film is esthetically successful with a good part of the contribution of Tito Larriva, who also plays as head of the band for the taxi dancers. The honors that act here must be granted to the always vital Perez, although a performance below the average is not granted. Fair proof of the quality of any film is given when a viewer sees it twice in a short period. Sitting through this undervalued work will be considered a great pleasure for many.
