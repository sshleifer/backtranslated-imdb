It's a deeply stupid mood ... but I loved it. Jean Dujardin is a great actor in this movie. Bérénice Béjo is cute. He mocks all secret agents like James Bond: refreshing! It's probably the most hilarious movie I've ever seen. I've seen it three times already and I still want to see it again. Buy the DVD as soon as you can. You will not regret. It's the kind of movie where you do not need to have a big stage because it's a parody. The only flaw is that OSS 117 is too short. It's a gem. It's not very common to see a French movie succeed in the United States, but I think it has everything to be successful. Trust me!!!
