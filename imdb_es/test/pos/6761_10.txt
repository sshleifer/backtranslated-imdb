This movie is the funniest Danish movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The plot is fun, surprising and exceptional. Danish humor is different from any other, and it catches you every time. The entire audience laughed 90% of the time ... it was amazing. The characters are very well interpreted, and the two actors, Mads mikkelsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas do their best. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend watching this movie, you will not regret it, believe me:)
