Do not listen to most of these people. I will give you a better review of this movie that I love to me and my friend! This is Jill Johnson, played by Camilla Belle, who takes care of children in the house of Mendrakis and someone bursts in. If you're wondering how he got into the house, he most likely went through the garage. so anyway, do not listen, "the worst performance." He has an incredible performance. With a great story. I think there are 2 benefits that Jill has. 1. She is a fast runner and is on the track team. 2. She came out alive! LOL. <br /> <br /> it's a great and pretty scary movie. Take a look, you will be happy with this masterpiece. Do not listen to the other people on the site. is very good. Trust me, I'm good at reviewing movies. I am a future film critic. I totally want to buy this movie. and you will also do it when you see it. It is amazingly impressive
