I am so excited that the Greek is back! This season is really full of events. I'm glad that Casey is trying to take school seriously, but that she's still involved in the fraternity. It's really funny that she wants to get into politics and that they are highlighting her 'intriguing talent'. I loved Calvin's new haircut! It makes him look more mature. They should also shave Cappy's head. All the guys are hot, but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I can not wait to see more of him! I'm especially interested in what happens between Calvin, Adam and Rusty! I love Rebecca too. She is really cute. In fact, I think Rebecca and Calvin should connect. Come on, Calvin! Join my team!
