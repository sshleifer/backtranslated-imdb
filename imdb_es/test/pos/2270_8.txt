The actor-turned-director Liev Schreiber (The sum of all fears) makes a version of the novel above the average, Everything Is Illuminated, by author Jonathan Safran Foer. This story of travel and self-discovery is highlighted by a strong set of performances and a marked direction with a story that enriches and illuminates the soul. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who has seen his grandfather. Safran, die. Jonathan has the peculiar habit of taking small objects and small memories of life and sealing them in plastic bags with plastic clasps for display on his wall. Safran gives Jonathan an old photo that shows a young Safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved her life many years ago. So Jonathan begins a long journey to locate this mysterious woman in Ukraine without knowing if she is still alive. Recruits the help of a young and daring tour guide named Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) to take him to his goal. At first, the journey reaches dead ends and false leads, but as the group approaches its goal, men find themselves in the middle of the ruins of a dark chapter in history with memories of war and past ghosts of a nonexistent city. There, they find their own respective destinies and will be changed forever for what they learn. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have been directed by someone who knew how to get the most out of their actors. Sometimes the film is spoken in Russian and looks like a foreign movie. The title itself is a work of self-discovery. This is a thoughtful journey of a man to his past, and his past ironically involves his companions; Jonathan's obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather as well. It is a story of long-term bonds and the guilt that one must carry throughout life. At the end of the film, all these characters have experienced life-altering events that will be permanently intertwined in their lives. Prove that memories can be powerful to traumatize and also to cleanse the soul. It is also about one's legacy and how others see an event or a person in the past. Alex finally sees his grandfather in a completely different light. Even our perception of these individuals will have changed by the end of the film, which is a tribute to a well-told story. <br /> <br /> The story is deceptively simple. It works like a road trip movie (like The Straight Story) combined with an interesting mystery story. It really involves many layers of emotions and subplots that go from the past to the present. The ending is a little surreal with his feeling of déjà vu. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood (Sin City, The Eternal Sun of the Spotless Mind) has chosen a wide range of roles since his appearance in The Lord of The Rings trilogy. Here, he does a good job with what is essentially a minimalist paper and there is not much to show. Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin perform better as Alex and his grandfather, respectively. Even Grandpa's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (that's right) is fun as a fiercely loyal companion. <br /> <br /> Paul Cantelon's spare music is a grumpy compliment to the reflective nature of the film. The editing is effective, since the images of the past and the present are linked and transitions are made without effort. The photograph of Matthew Libatique (Gothika, Requiem for a Dream) is strictly rigid and lifeless, with some impressive images of the war and its consequences. <br /> <br /> The coincidences that emerge during the last half of the film do the drama well, but they are a bit too casual. We never fully understand the background story of Alex's grandfather and what his motivations are. In the same way, Jonathan's blank stares and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a peculiar man. Sometimes, the movie feels a bit depressing and depressing as more horrible revelations are revealed. But these are minor criticisms of what a good introspective story is with good performances and interesting themes of remembrance and closure. Schreiber not only directed, but adapted the script to this part of the story that is worthwhile, it is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future.
