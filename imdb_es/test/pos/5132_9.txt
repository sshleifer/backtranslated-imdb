Hoot was great. The owls are adorable and the film highlights an interesting environmental problem that I did not know existed. Florida is full of so many funny characters and the movie does a great job of bringing that to the screen. My children particularly loved all the different animals, from snakes to owls and alligators. It's really a simple story, but also one that they need to listen to at this age. When children are small, it is when they really develop their sense of values, and yes, one of them must be taking care of our environment and all the creatures that live in it. I think it was great that the film has provoked a conversation with them about the trip home about the animals and how to help them. It was really sweet and lasting to hear my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the little birds. Anyway, in general, it was really a great time and I would recommend the movie to anyone looking for something entertaining and meaningful.
