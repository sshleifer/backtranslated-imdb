Jordan takes us into the sordid crime of Sydney, Australia, after the desperate attempt of Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), nineteen, who does a job for a local gangster and needs to make amends before they reach it. The gang members, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing group with a streak of humor in them. That's what makes the movie work, because we always see the gang members as a difficult group to fuck you. But this mafia also tickles your fun bone. A structured and intelligent script from Jordan has characters that cross and get caught in the web.
