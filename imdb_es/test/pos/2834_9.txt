Gregory Peck and Gig Young compete for the same girl and after Peck sends Young to a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck follows an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where the Indians outnumber them in number. Peck chooses for this mission the soldiers who consider the scum of the earth and the actors who play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand, among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren, specialist in Westerns, as a writer, director and producer. The idea of ​​using these types of men as heroes inspired many films that were published later, such as "The Dirty Dozen", made in 1967.
