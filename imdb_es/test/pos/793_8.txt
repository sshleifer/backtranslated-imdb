Not all, but most of this story is that Buster was confused with "Dead Shot Dan", a notorious criminal. <br /> <br /> There is really no story, just a series of adventures to show Buster's physical talents, which are incredible, and his comic rhythm. The 27-minute movie is basically one adventure after another that mainly involves someone chasing our hero. <br /> <br /> Before, it's a couple of cops in their rhythms running through the streets behind Keaton and then it's "Big Joe" Roberts, a resounding cop and father of a girl whom Buster is interested in, who pursue Those last scenes were the best I thought, with many clever gags related to the hotel elevator where Big Joe and his daughter live. That was Keaton's best. <br /> <br /> It's only a crazy half hour that makes little sense, but do you mind? Buster is in his slapstick better, or close to him, and that's why he fulfills his purpose: to entertain us. Just think: 85 years after this movie was made, there are people (like me) who are still discovering and enjoying these classics of silent comedy. Cool!
