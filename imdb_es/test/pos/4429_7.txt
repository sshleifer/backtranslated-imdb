I think the title of the film describes it well. If you are looking for a documentary about louis kahn and his work, you will have to look elsewhere. Although part of that is covered in this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I eat almost everything that feeds me, and I do not know much of the family history that revolves around this case. so I believed what they told me about Nathaniel and his father, etc. <br /> <br /> for what this movie was, I thought it was pretty good. a little slow and attracting attention at the same time, I wish Nathaniel had focused a little more on his father's work than on his family drama (although much of the story was interesting, Louis was a bit of a player). <br /> <br /> This is really a journey through someone's life, and I was happy to continue the experience. A learning experience for me, and so it seems, also for the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> oh, and the images of some of Kahn's works are * impressive *
