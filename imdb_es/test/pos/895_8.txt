Laura Gemser plays a photographer from a magazine that is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There it is found by a couple and other swing couples. Everyone stays in this huge tourist hotel with a huge pool. One night they have a pool party with "live" native dancers. It is very politically correct and very kitsch. Later, Emanuelle finally has her photo shoot, which turns out to be one of those self-service safaris and stays in your car (although the photography is great). Throughout the film, Emanuelle pursues all the men she knows. Photography is very well made in this film. There are scenes with waterfalls, galloping giraffes and ancient ruins. The movie is worth seeing on the soundtrack of Nico Fidenco alone.
