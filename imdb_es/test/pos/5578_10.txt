I found out about this series in 2001 that a friend of mine was recording on television every week. I never bothered to look, although I knew the series through the magazine that I looked at from time to time in the bookstores. I recently bought the series one on DVD and I have become addicted to this fascinating and original series. At first, the characters seem unpleasant, but it is amazing how quickly they grow and become a united force. As they begin to take care of each other, it becomes easy to take care of what happens to them (taking into account that this is just a television series and that they are fictitious). <br /> <br /> However, it is not the world of Star Trek PCs and so, while each character shows a good trait, each has its own defects and demons with which it must deal. The individual story lines combined with a general multiple story arc make this one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences I have had the pleasure of seeing. I absolutely enjoy watching each of the characters interact with each other. <br /> <br /> This strange and new world presented to us is brilliantly represented through the eyes of astronaut John Crichton and, as he learns and adapts to be in the other. Next to the galaxy, strange creatures strange, different cultures, being hunted by a character who wants him dead and being treated as inferior by his companions, we can easily relate to what he must be feeling. As he gets used to his surroundings, so do the spectators and his compassionate, brave and courageous character. It is a joy to see. <br /> <br /> I've seen only seven episodes of the first season of Farscape and I hope to continue through seasons two and four and the miniseries. Maybe one day we can all enjoy a season five. Highly recommended to see and it is worth booking a time to see. Buy and enjoy! 10/10.
