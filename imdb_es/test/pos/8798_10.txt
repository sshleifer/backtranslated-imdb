The film itself is absolutely brilliant, it's that buzz, that rush that makes you want to go out, blow up your salary and lose yourself. It's what weekend is about, it's our sanitation where we can unite as one and be ourselves without a care in the world. The film has layers of depth and dialogue in some places is perfect, especially with Jip. The characters themselves are friendly at once, one in particular is obviously a dyer character and his views on what "Star Wars" really means, genius. <br /> <br /> If you ever have an hour to kill before leaving, stick to this, you will immediately feel growing in confidence, I definitely recommend it.
