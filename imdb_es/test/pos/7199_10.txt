I saw this movie 6 times and every time I see it I find other subtle jokes. (like the scene where Waldo is part of the Egyptian crowd). It's the funniest movie I've seen, finally a cheerful comedy, which does not include bathroom humor or sex. Numerobis is also what makes the film, everything that comes out of that mouth of the boys is very funny. This movie is almost perfect, except for some clich√©s, like the fact that Asterix regains its power because it is kissed, that's just stupid. But in general an excellent movie !! 9.5 out of 10
