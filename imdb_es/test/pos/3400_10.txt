I had always heard about this great mini series, but I saw it for the first time this week, in July of 2007. I can see why the career of so many young actors started. The story is intriguing and offers a wonderful insight into the previous period and during the Civil War. I was concerned about the characters and how they evolved their lives during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 19th century. Many historical facts were included in the story and it was interesting to see how the history books come alive. The costumes and sets were beautiful! I really enjoyed watching both parts I and II. Part III is a disappointment.
