Well ... first for the fans of Anne Rice BOOK ... <br /> <br /> I'm sure lestat's eyes are not blue ... I'm sure he's not blond in this movie ... but despite that Marius is not a lestat Creator ... although they have COMPLETELY modified the story ... <br /> <br /> how can you say that it is not a good movie ... <br /> <br /> this movie ... it's the BEST vampire movie I've seen ... and lestat looks perfectly in it ... maybe not its features ... but I do not think you can find a better lestat ... the way who talks ... and the way he sees simple mortals ... his arrogance ... and his love of fame are represented without problems. <br /> <br /> if for once ... consider it just a movie ... and do not try to relate each scene to the book ... you will love the movie as much as I do. <br /> <br /> now ... to non-readers ... <br /> <br /> prepare to fall Absolutely in love with this movie ... it has everything ... and gothic music ... it's like an additional gift ... the dialogues ... they're beautiful ... and they catch ... and even though it's a vampire movie ... you'll find yourself smiling ... for the wit of the characters ... and you'll find yourself sympathizing with vampires ... <br /> <br /> in general ... one of my favorite movies ... !! 10/10
