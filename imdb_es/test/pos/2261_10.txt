If you have ever been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely fun. From teenagers who wear gold chains, listen to hip hop and dance dancing to the side, to jokes about airbags in cars and waitresses in total shock to meet a vegetarian, this film really captures fragments of Ukraine that I would never know if it were not there . I spent most of the movie nodding and thinking, "Yes, that's exactly right." It's very funny if you understand Russian too, because subtitles do not always do justice. The actors are so believable and Elijah Wood does a great job playing a socially inept Jewish boy. My favorite character is definitely Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., the "sight dog" of Grandpa, who is really a psychopathic border collie. The characters are so eclectic and nice that you think they are real people.
