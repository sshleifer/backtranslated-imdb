"The Beguiled" is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies, and a departure from his typical early roles. Directed by Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood collaborated in several films, it was made a year before the directorial debut of Eastwood with "Play Misty For Me". An alternative title considered for the film was "Pussy-Footing Down At The Old Plantation", which fortunately was not used, otherwise, I'm sure that the jokes about the fact that it takes place in a school for girls would be difficult to avoid. The first time I saw this film in one of my university film classes in the mid-1970s was immediate. I just had an old and battered VHS tape until I recently bought the widescreen DVD, which also includes the hilarious and horrible trailer that makes the movie look like a soap opera from "Peyton Place", and does not convey anything of the creepy of the movie. . <br /> <br /> Interesting notes: Eastwood and Siegel had to battle with Universal Pictures to maintain the original ending, and they won; and, the film was cataloged as an Eastwood western standard, which certainly is not. It is a Gothic tale of deception and horror set in the Civil War era, with an underlying tone of eroticism and sexual tension everywhere. <br /> <br /> I am not putting any spoilers on this revision, and if you want to see the movie as it should look, then be careful to search it on the internet, since spoiler reviews abound. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood plays John McBurney, a Union soldier who is shot on the Confederate grounds and discovered by a young girl from a nearby girls' school. She rescues him and takes him back to school, but instead of notifying the local patrol of his presence to be taken to jail, the director, Miss Martha (Geraldine Page), his assistant Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), his black servant Hallie (Mae Mercer), and most teenagers take it, heal it and fall under its spell. The film sets its tone of chill and Gothic horror from the titles, as it shows true battle shots of the war, while Eastwood's voice is heard softly singing a funeral song of the time. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of his encounter with the girl who saves him, sets the tone of his character and the tone of the whole movie. Saying something more than that would ruin the surprises in that first scene. Saying much more about the film itself could ruin it for anyone who has not seen it ... if you like gothic tales, find them out, find them and rent them. Eastwood is excellent in the film, and it's interesting to see him in an early role, or in any other role, where he plays a character who for the most part is very unkind. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page had a plum role in the film as the director, and I can not imagine another actress of the time who is so good on paper; A very remote possibility could have been Piper Laurie, but I do not think Laurie could have played the role in the same way as Geraldine Page. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Hartman (whose wonderful performance in the movie "A Patch of Blue", as a blind girl who falls in love with the character of Sidney Poiter is another important point in her short career) is at its height here , delicate and masterful at the same time. Unfortunately, his finesse at the movies was also part of his real life; she committed suicide at 45 years old. <br /> <br /> I end this review with this observation: a lying and manipulative Yankee man is no match for a house full of deceptive and libidinous southern jeers.
