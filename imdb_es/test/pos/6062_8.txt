'Rejseholdet' is one of the best new Danish TV series I've seen. <br /> <br /> The series is about Unit 1 of the Danish police force, an FBI team that helps solve murder cases around the world. the country and the cases in which they work, plus the influence their jobs have on their personal lives and the price they sometimes have to pay to be part of a first-class police team. <br /> <br /> I did not do it. I did not wait long when I started watching this series. I was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes funny, it has both drama and suspense, I love it.
