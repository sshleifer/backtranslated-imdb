Twenty years after seeing this, I'm still quoting things from this movie like "Look between the two giant melons," or I'll start singing the "Pabst Blue Ribbon Theme." On the other hand, 20 years later, I can now understand the "Meat Machine", since there are still many of the stereotypes like this that were used for this film. Those are signs of a good movie for me. I could say that this movie is the test of time, which I can not really say about many films from the 80s. I keep saying that this movie is still on the list of many people's favorite movies when I was a child that grew up in the 80's. If you like games and you dream of becoming a "Master of the game", or if you discover yourself through these 80's movies to relive your childhood, you should see this. Also, sometimes it's sarcastic, and fun. But one thing is for sure about this movie, if someone ever invites you to a "Great Night Hunter", do not refer to an X party or acid party, they mean, get ready for something like Midnight Madness! Oh, you'll see. Everyone will die for playing! hehehehehe
