THE GREEN BUTCHERS (Anders Thomas Jensen, Denmark, 2003). <br /> <br /> How do the Danes continue with these films that are consistently fun, carefully written, exquisitely filmed and full of great performances? THE GREEN BUTCHERS is a dark and perversely funny comedy, in many respects it is the Danish counterpart of EATING RAOUL and DELICATESSEN, but it offers more than just laughter or parody. <br /> <br /> The film brings us the duet of the chronic quarry Bjarne (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) and the chronic perspiration Svend (Mads Mikkelsen). Sick of his evil boss, the two friends decide to open their own butcher shop in a small Danish town, but initially the business is slow and customers stay away. When an electrician is accidentally locked up and frozen in his meat locker, Svend decides to turn the man's thigh into steaks that seizes "chickie-wickies". Suddenly, this special dish causes everyone in the city to come to his counter and Svend, unable to resist this sudden leap into popularity, becomes a serial killer with Bjarne as his reluctant accomplice. But soon, led by his former boss, many people in the city begin to wonder what special ingredients the two men are using. <br /> <br /> Without the extraordinary performances of Kaas and Mikkelsen, the film may not have risen. Above the level of the average black comedy. On paper, Svend's character might be in the caricature, but Mads Mikkelsen's portrait is that of a serious, insecure and deeply twisted man, but Mikkelsen makes it terrifying, funny and touching at the same time. Kaas actually plays a double role, much like his comatose twin brother Eigil. When I saw the movie, I never realized that it was the same actor. The other performances are just as wonderful with each character in the city, with some really wonderful vignettes. <br /> <br /> The subject material is, of course, a bit morbid and it is possible that the material is not completely new. , considering many predecessors who handled the same type of material, but director Jensen gives a new twist and manages to build some real characters with the strange duo of Svend and Bjarne, with this wonderfully strange tale of two social misfits. <br /> <br /> Dark Chamber --- 9/10
