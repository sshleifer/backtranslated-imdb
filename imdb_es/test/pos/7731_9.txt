An extremely smooth account of Shakespeare's work (and much more obvious about it than Forbidden Planet). Cassavetes is always a pleasure to watch, and even more so with Gena Rowlands sharing the focus. His version of the role of Prospero is very appropriate for the kind of sheer expression of everyone who contributes to the story. This, especially, appears in the foreground in a scene in which, seeing his wife away and his lover in a speedboat, evokes a storm (accompanied on the soundtrack of an appropriate selection of "Go" by Stomu Yamashta) . This is just one of the moments in the film where the line between reality and fantasy becomes blurred, and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one might believe. Add to this an excellent performance by Raul Julia, in addition to the good work of Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the film becomes a nice little gift to occupy the space behind your eyes.
