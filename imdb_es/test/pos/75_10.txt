This often defamed movie is a must for fans of Blake Edwards, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini or the Hollywood musicals. Other writers have commented on the changes of tone, the confusion of the plot, etc., but the film has many things to recommend. The score is one of the best of Henry Mancini (and has written many wonderful), Andrews sings several songs to perfection, Julie's performance is nuanced and is dressed in some beautiful clothes, (is at its most beautiful point here), The shots in the place are impressive, and there are some jokes in sight of Inspector Clouseau to boot. Rock Hudson basically phoned in his performance, but it's pretty good. An element of real curiosity in what was Julie's last important film for about 10 years and, in many ways, is a precursor to Victor / Victoria. It is lovely to look and listen. When will it be available on DVD? When it is, for my part, I would like both versions: the longest and shortest, the director's version. Since they were lampooned in S.O.B., they would make a great package of two!
