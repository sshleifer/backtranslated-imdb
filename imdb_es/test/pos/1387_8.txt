Okay, I'm just going to disagree with the previous comments that criticized this program. I think this show is amazing. (I mean, when Jasmin Weber was still on and Franzi was still alive, so addictive!) And I was surprised to learn that this was classified as a soap, because it just does not look the same as soaps in the United States. The soaps here are absolutely horrible! At least the GZSZ films in place, presents real music and more plausible stories. In addition, the performance on GZSZ, for the most part, is quite credible, especially with Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jascheroff. (In addition, soap actors are some of the most difficult workers in the business, since they have the most demanding work schedules). If the ratings are so high, you must be doing something right; Soaps in the United States are shown during the day and, historically, they have always had background ratings. Give GZSZ a chance! Trust me, it's good!
