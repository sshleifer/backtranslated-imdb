Apparently, this Australian film based on the Nevil Shute novel exists in more than one way. Beware of the very cropped versions that are sometimes shown on cable or satellite, with a duration of 95 minutes to 2 hours. Only the full version of the 5-hour miniseries tells the story correctly. It is a very close realization of history, which suffers only from editorial failures that are commonly found in television films: itching and episodic progression. But this excellent cast carries the story very well with values ​​of good production in general that accompany their work. Yuki Shimoda is notable as "Gunso Mifune", one of the guards assigned to accompany the women on their dying journey. In the end he becomes a friend. You will agonize with him when his loss of face leads him to death. Helen Morse as "Jean Paget", beautiful but not a great beauty (looks a bit like Sigourney Weaver) records the right amount of spunk and sympathy that the occasion demands. . The mini-series appropriately emphasizes the beautiful love stories, three of them: "Joe" and "Jean", "Noel" and "Jean", and "Jean" and Willstown. Gordon Jackson plays "Noel Strachan" in an attractive way, but as a man somewhat younger than Nevil Shute indicated in the novel. The third love story I mentioned does not receive the emphasis it deserves, and the full meaning of the title diminishes. "Jean" is dedicated to the goal of bringing business to Willstown that will attract young women and girls and their civilizing influence to this abandoned town in the city. She wants to do it "A Town Like Alice"; Alice Springs, that's it. We only received some indications of this in several scenes. If you have five hours to spare, this mini-series is a truly rewarding experience. Nevil Shute based his novel on the cruelty of the Japanese military by diverting a large group of women and children from one place to another on the Maylay Peninsula in a real story. However, it happened in Sumatra, according to Shute, rather than in the peninsula. The crucifixion of "Joe" by a Japanese officer for stealing chickens to feed the women is probably a fiction, but the cruelty of the Japanese in dealing with the prisoners is certainly a matter of record.
