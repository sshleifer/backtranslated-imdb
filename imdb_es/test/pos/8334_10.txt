A caricature of SUPERMAN. <br /> <br /> When the United States presents its colossal new bomber, the JAPOTEURS, an elite force of Japanese spies and saboteurs, attacks. Stealing the giant, with the intrepid reporter Lois Lane on board, and fate, whether it's Tokyo or destruction, it's time for Superman to get involved ... <br /> <br /> This was another of the series of excellent drawings animated initially created by Max Fleischer for the study of Paramount. They have great animation and fast and tense diagrams. Presented to be shown in cinemas, they are far ahead of their Saturday morning counterparts. Bud Collyer is the voice of Superman; Joan Alexander does the honors for Lois Lane.
