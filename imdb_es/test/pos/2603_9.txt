The four signs on the road say: "If you're looking for fun ... You do not need a reason ... All you need is a gun ... It's rabbit season!" <br /> <br /> In the forest, we see hundreds of posters of "Season of Rabbits" published in each tree. We see more and more signs that point exactly to the Bugs Bunny hole. Who is putting all these signs? Daffy Duck! <br /> <br /> Daffy saves the last record, stands on tiptoe and tells the audience: "Very malicious on my part, I know, but what the hell, I have to have fun! duck season. "<br /> <br /> From that moment, now we see Elmer Fudd, shotgun in hand ... and a semantic war between Bugs and Daffy with Bugs winning every time. Only in cartoons, fortunately, we can see someone who is shot in the head five times and move on!
