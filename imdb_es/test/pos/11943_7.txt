This is a nice little life movie about a man (Peter Coyote) who lives the perfect middle class suburban life when, one night, the police suddenly entered his house and arrested him for the murder of a guy 27 years. <br /> <br /> In his prison cell, Coyote tells his wife about the fateful events of 27 years ago and how he came in contact with Wayne Kennedy, the man he allegedly killed. <br /> <br /> From here the story is told. in retrospect, and the more you learn about Wayne and Coyote and how they met and what happened when they did it, the more you became interested. <br /> <br /> The acting is nothing to write home about, although the guy who plays Wayne Kennedy is pretty creepy. The true strength of the film is that mystery of what really happened on the mountain. The wife passes the movie running unearthing clues about the mystery and every time something new comes up we are treated with another flashback that reveals more of the mystery. Actually, it's pretty good. <br /> <br /> So, in regards to the Lifetime TV movie, this little movie is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
