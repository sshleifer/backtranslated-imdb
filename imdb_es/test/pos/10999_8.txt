The Squire of Gothos is one of the "dumbest" episodes of Star Trek, and therefore one of the most entertaining. The entertainment factor, in general, is driven by the confrontation between William Shatner and the hilarious guest star of the episode, William Campbell. <br /> <br /> During an unspecified routine mission, Sulu suddenly disappears into the air and Kirk. Follow shortly after the room. Spock immediately starts looking for his missing colleagues (and, although he hated to admit it, friends), while the two stranded crewmembers must deal with the mysterious, all-powerful, extravagant Trelane (Campbell), the self-proclaimed Squire of Gothos, a being able to create or destroy whatever you want through the power of your mind. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the plot may seem recycled from previous episodes (honestly, is there a science fiction program?) that did not have at least one God-like character), but that feeling fades quickly thanks to the exaggerated use of the script of exaggerated humor, which is transmitted through Campbell's camp deliberately: his Trelane is essentially the Trek version of a spoiled child in The Body of an Adult, while his curiosity fueled by ignorance for the The human race (his knowledge is quite limited) probably served as inspiration for Gene Roddenberry when he came up with the character of Q for the pilot of the next generation, some two decades later. This episode aired. <br /> <br /> In summary, the key to appreciating The Squire of Gothos is the following: "dumb" is not necessarily "bad".
