An interesting and involved film about a "lifeguard" who tries to live his days in peace. The main character's elements appear in Michael Mann's later films, such as Thief (1981), Heat (1995), etc. You can see it at UCLA's Media Instruction Lab, one of the only places in the country that has copies available to the public. It's great!
