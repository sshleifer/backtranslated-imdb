I just finished watching this movie for the first time and I must say that I am very impressed. <br /> <br /> How bleak. How full of despair. How nightmare Amazing. <br /> <br /> Visually amazing, several scenes are embedded in my mind ... the first appearance of the ghost car ... the soul of David Holm when he gets up from his corpse ... his spirit on His knees, pleading. <br /> <br /> This movie takes a simple story, that of the ghostly driver of the ghost car, condemned to collect the souls of the dead for a year, takes it to the current stage of the film and then uses flashbacks as a means to explain how David Holm ends up in his situation. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this posted on DVD so that more people can see it. Everyone should.
