"Hell to Pay" announces itself as the renaissance of the Classic Western ... it succeeds like a western genre film that the whole family could see and not very different from the movies that baby boomers experienced decades ago. The good ones are good and the bad ones are really bad! . Bo Svenson, Stella Stevens, Lee Majors, Andrew Prine (excellent in this movie) Tim Thomerson and James Drury are great and it's fun to see them again. James Drury really shines in this, perhaps even better than his days as "The Virginian". In a way, "Hell to Pay" reminds me of those films in the 60s in which the actors you know from so many programs make their appearance. If you are a certain age, Buck Taylor, Peter Brown and Denny Miller and William Smith provide a surprise factor, since we rarely see these icons these days. "Hell to Pay" presents screen legends along with newer names in Hollywood. Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah), most notorious in the cast of "newbies", whom I've seen lately in "The Young and The Restless" and Kevin Kazakoff, who plays Kirby, a man tired of the war that is in the middle of war. want to live and let live or intervene to "do the right thing". William Gregory Lee is excellent as Chance, the evil and womanizing brother of Kirby. Katie Keane plays Rachel, Rebekah's sister, a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive, but renounced her pride in the process. In a small but memorable role, Jeff Davis plays Mean Joe, a former Confederate with a rather nasty streak of stockings. I think we'll see more of these good actors in the future. "Hell to Pay" is a fun movie with a great story to tell. Grab the popcorn, we head west!
