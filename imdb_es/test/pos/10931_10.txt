I just read what I think is an analysis of this movie by an Irish lyricist. Lovely to read. <br /> <br /> However, a concise analysis of this film is that it is an interweaving of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice. <br /> <br /> Envy, greed, Pride, laziness, anger, etc., and justice in the forms of retributive, distributive, blind and divine. <br /> <br /> I was able to demonstrate three examples of each, one for each of the three protagonists; however, it is much more fun to write them down for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it.
