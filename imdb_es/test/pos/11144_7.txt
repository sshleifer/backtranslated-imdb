A film especially nice for those of us who saw this when we were young because, after all, it was meant to be seen by young people. When we see him again as an adult, it is better that pink-tinted glasses appear. It was the first of the 16 Jungle Jim movies and later television series, Johnny Weismuller continued with Columbia (in the last 3 movies he had to use his own name, since they had lost the rights) after getting the dismissal of interpreting to Tarzan for Sol Lesser. Johnny Sheffield also stopped playing Boy to become Bomba the Jungle Boy in a series of 12 movies. <br /> <br /> Jim and the party go on a dangerous safari to hunt the hidden temple of Zimbalu, manned by a dark tribe of the devil Doctors who seem to have the secret of a poison that could also be a cure for polio . Edgar Rice Burroughs probably approved. After 16 years of talking monosyllabically, Weismuller seemed awkward to put phrases together, not that it mattered. In the fast march, we meet many of the inhabitants of the jungle, interesting but generally playful, unless the sinister crocodile is going to eat the protagonist with one leg caught under a twig and the stampede of surreal elephants (archive images) in a corner of the frame). Skipper the dog and Caw-Caw the crow had many adventures, none of which proved essential to the plot in case you were focused! The biggest problem with the movie is the climax, which can be exciting, but unfortunately, does it remind you of the end of a serial part? and the excellent original series had been made 12 years before. Although I personally would not have cared that this would last for a couple of hours too! <br /> <br /> The only heavy thing about this was Weismuller; In many ways, a nice movie for children of the old days, not recommended for serious adults, so I love it.
