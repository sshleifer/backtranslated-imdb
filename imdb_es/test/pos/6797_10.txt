Two of Hollywood's biggest children's stars (Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney) are perfectly combined to offer one of the family classics of all time. The story of a determined girl of 12 years whose adoration for horses will not allow her to move away from her goal of winning British nationals. Mickey Rooney is the newly orphaned wanderer, who seeks to tie himself up until he can follow his own dreams. <br /> <br /> A beautiful side story reveals that the girl's mother had ambitions of her own as a child. Repeatedly rejecting the father's decisions in favor of his energetic daughter, it is the mother who seems to know more.
