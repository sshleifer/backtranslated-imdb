Dexter (Kurt Russell) returns from The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes for a new adventure that may be independent. Dexter, always the university student prone to misfortune, has an idea for a formula to make things invisible. Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn) is less than impressed and pinpoints his hopes of winning a lucrative science prize with the student who studies bees. However, bees sting the student and turn out to be allergic. There goes that opportunity for a prize. But, wait, Dexter does it! He really invents a liquid that makes him invisible. The problem is that an unscrupulous businessman (Cesar Romero) finds out and decides that he can use that formula, thanks, for something illegal. Can you manage to steal the bottle from under Dexter's nose? This is a film that accompanies the TCWT, but it is not necessary that you have seen the first movie to enjoy it. Russell is a great leader who comes when he really counts. The rest of the cast is also a dream, with Flynn, Romero, Jim Bacchus and others showing why their comic skills are still held in high esteem today. The script is simply an innocent fun that is charming, with special effects rather simple, by today's standards, but, nonetheless, effective. If you want to sit back and relive a bygone era or just want to share a quality G rated movie with your family, this is an excellent choice. Although he is over 30 years old, there is a great possibility that even now you will see your loved ones laugh at the blues with a sample of this excellent film.
