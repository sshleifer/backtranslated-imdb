This is one of my favorite comedies of "Capra-esque". This film is meant to be enjoyed, not deconstructed, analyzed microscopically. It is not a religious comment. It's fun. It's fantasy The surprisingly negative comments (IMHO) reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to believe should be part of each film. <br /> <br /> Others have described the role of Travolta (which is why you'll see the movie again and again) and the excellent cast (including Sparky!). <br /> <br /> Sometimes, a cigar is just a cigar; Sometimes a movie is just fun. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
