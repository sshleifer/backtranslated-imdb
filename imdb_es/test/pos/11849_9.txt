I went into the studio this morning during the scene where Ed was involved in the 3-Way and I thought my wife was catching up with some porn in the morning! To my surprise, it caught my attention and I rewound it and we started seeing it at 4:30 in the morning. What is a script and script very entertaining, rich, fun and well developed. We both enjoyed it very much, both my wife who shared the experience with her friends at work! Continuing to recommend it and saying what "kick" it gave. I am in my last 40 years and she in her first 50 years. I think this movie could be attractive for both young and old. An unexpected surprise, very pleasant. Good job! Thank you! Two thumbs up!
