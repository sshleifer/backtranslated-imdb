I really liked that movie !! Great performance by Carla Gugino. An interesting story about a kidnapping that goes terribly wrong (is not it?). Some surprising twists and turns in the film and the plot were easy to follow without being too complicated to be totally incomprehensible. It was a totally unexpected delight. More "Quentin-ish" than most movies try to be.
