I was very impressed with what Eddie Monroe was able to achieve with respect to its overall effect on me. I say this because I know that this independent film had a limited budget / resources, but despite this, it is presented as a convincing and well-designed work. <br /> <br /> It is enjoyed from start to finish with several relatively unknown aspects. actors in which I can not stop believing that they will make a big noise in the industry in the coming years, Eddie Monroe did not stop keeping my interest and my emotional emotion dancing. It's a well-written story with a surprising ending despite my effort not to be taken by surprise. <br /> <br /> Many of the names of the actors listed for this film are names that you have to pay attention to in the future. Someone told me that Paul Regina had recently passed away, and if this is true, it is a real tragedy since his stoic performance in Eddie Monroe is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Fred Carpenter, who has really won a winner with this one. !
