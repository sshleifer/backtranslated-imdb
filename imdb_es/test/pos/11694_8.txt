I recently saw it at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival. The title of the film and, in fact, much of the profile of the film is from Robert Graves' poem Beauty in Trouble. Jan Hrebejk directs a screenplay by Petr Jrchovský based on a story by Hrebejk and Jrchovský. the story begins in 2002 when one of those devastating 100-year floods that destroy the home of Marcela (Ana Ceislerová) and Jarda (Roman Luknár) and their two sons Kuba (Adam Misik) and Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) hit Prague. Due to the mold conditions where they now live, Kuba's asthma is potentially deadly. Marcela works and Jarda has an article store in the garage where they live. The murky occupation of Jarda opposes him to the law and one of his victims of theft falls in love with Marcela. Evzen Benes (Josef Abrhám) is a rich businessman who divides his time between Italy and the Czech Republic and offers to take care of Marcela and her two children. Jana Brejchová is the mother of Marcella who lives with her husband, Uncle Richie, played by Jirí Schmitzer in the best role of the film. To complete this excellent cast, Emília Vasaryova is the mentally fragile mother of Jarda, who gives all the money she receives to the local religious charlatan. There's a lot to do here for a small movie and it's a good story with a great script and a lot of comic relief. Ales Brezina provides the music with additional music from the Czech singer Raduza and the Irish singer Glen Hansard. There are many things that I like about this movie and I would give it an 8.0 out of 10 and I would recommend it.
