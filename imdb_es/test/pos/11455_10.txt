This movie took me by surprise. The sequence of opening credits presents a well-made animation. After that, we submerged ourselves in a semi-cheesy production, betraying its low budget. The characters, typical American teenagers, are presented slowly, with more personal details than those usually found in films like this. When the Shlitz hits the fanatic, we know each of the characters, and they like or hate them according to their different personalities. It is a slow uphill configuration, something like climbing a steep roller coaster. Fortunately, once the action begins, it is the old school HORROR! The makeup effects of Steve Johnson are impressive. Equal in quality to bigger movies with budget. And the fears are shaking. Kevin Tenney offers his best film ever, with poignant surprises and creepy suspense settings. The ironic humor, sometimes corny, marks this film as pure 80s horror, unlike the somber tone of the previous genre such as "The Night of the Living Dead" or "Hills Have Eyes". But for true terror fans, it's worth checking out. Play as the first entry into a double account with the new 1999 version of "House on the Haunted Hill." The configuration and dynamics of the characters are so similar that you really have to ask yourself what movie they were really remaking.
