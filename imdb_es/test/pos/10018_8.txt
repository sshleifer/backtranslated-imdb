I certainly have not seen all of Jean Rollin's films, but mostly they seem to be naked women's festivals with vampires, that if you like that kind of thing they are not bad, but this is a great way out and it could almost be Cronenberg minus the biography . Mechanical nightmare stuff. Except that it is in French with subtitles of course. A man who drives on the road at night meets a woman who is in her slippers and bathrobe and lifts her, while in the background, another woman remains, with nothing. As they go, it is obvious that there is something that is not right in the woman, in which she forgets things almost as fast as they happen. However, that does not stop the man from having sex with her once they return to Paris and his apartment. The man goes to work and some strangers show up in his place and take the woman to this "block of the tower", a huge apartment building known as the Black Tower, where others of its kind (for whom the " I do not remember "it's something It seems to be the least of your problems" are carried out for some reason. Time and events go through the film, which involves mainly trying to find what's going on and leaving the building for this woman, and she manages to call Robert, the guy who picked her up first, to rescue her. its. The revelation about what is happening comes in the last moments of the film, which has a rather strange but moving ending. By avoiding what seemed to be his "typical" formula, Rollin created, in this, what I feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film. I really like this one, take a look. 8 out of 10.
