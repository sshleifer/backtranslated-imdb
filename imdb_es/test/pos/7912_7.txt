A psychological mystery thriller psychologically directed and photographed with an exceptional performance of Donald Sutherland gloomy, and powerful supporting roles of Donald Pleasence and David Hemming. The material decides to keep everything dark and goes from the period of investigation to the background story of the victim. The infrequent and rather sad investigation attracted me, but when the retrospective next to the victim showed that his last days were not so convincing, it became heavy and similar to an inventory. Although the script is very detailed and, to a certain extent, complex to link us, however, the final and surprising revelation should have been more disconcerting and has not been helped by its careless execution. The musical score of Howard Blake has an emotional touch that simply extends, and the ability to manage director Claude Chabrol (well, for the most part) has a strong and stylized style, allowing you to get the best of the places of Bad mood and the flexible cast. The young faces, Lisa Langlois and Aude Landry, also do an incredibly good job.
