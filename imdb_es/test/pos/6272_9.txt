This film must have been released quietly somewhere else in the world, perhaps even in English. Hopefully nobody has understood a word, anyway there is nothing to understand in this movie! Haha Call me crazy, but I think this is one of the best movies in history. Why would I come to that conclusion? Because it's my national pastime to sabotage horrible movies and this begs for every minute! Once I became a fan of Myster Science Theater 3000, I had no doubt in my mind that they would find it somewhere and use it. Pretty sure! The version they acquired was called "Cave Dwellers" and used some strange introduction sequences, not even from the film itself (apparently, they were ashamed to use images from their own movie!). I can not say that I recommend buying this movie. Rather, I highly recommend getting the MST3K version. Surely you will find it anywhere where MST3K DVDs are sold, do not miss it!
