I just came back from watching this awesome movie! I can relate to that a lot ... It reminded me that when my sister had to go to college, we had to move from one place to another, and my mother acts like Adele August! Children may not like this movie, as it brings tears to your eyes. One of the best real life movies I've seen in my life! and Natalie Portman rules! 10/10
