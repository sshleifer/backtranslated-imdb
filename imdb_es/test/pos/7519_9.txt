If you liked the "Red" by Paddy Chayevsky, you probably like this black comedy as well, since it is another brilliant script by Chayevsky, a wonderful satire in hospitals in big cities and a perfect vehicle for Geo. C. Scott. He plays a chief of medicine burned in the most chaotic day he or his hospital has seen. Your personal crisis is reaching a critical point and your hospital is falling around you, as local residents show against the hospital and patients and doctors are dying at an alarming rate, thanks to a murderous and biblically inspired saboteur . The latter, who declares himself theatrically as the "Fool for Christ," "Parakleet of Kaborka," "Wrath of the Lamb," and "Angel of the Bottomless Abyss," hits doctors in the head, administers lethal injections and exchanges identities. of the patients, which makes the treatments and operations are carried out on the wrong people. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, since deadly mistakes like these occur (hopefully not so many, not so often and not in one place) and at the same time make you laugh at portraits of characters that have no price. One is Richard Dysart ("L.A. Law") as Dr. Wellbeck, a kind of famous surgeon who spends much more time worrying about his investments and shares listed on the stock market than his patients, who suffer lethally their vast indifference and negligence. There's Diana Rigg as the hippie-ish Barbara Drummond, who seduces the beleaguered chief of medicine (Scott) and tries to escape with her. Then there is the deceived assassin, who is Barbara's father and who "works well enough" in the Indian reservation where he lives with his daughter and even runs a clinic, but who is mad simply for having been returned to civilization. The strongest portrait by far is Dr. Scott Bock, who discovers his soul as a former child genius, failed father and husband, brilliant doctor and responsible administrator, who constantly dreams of suicide but who must endure the demands of his life. work. Scott is exceptional in this demanding role. <br /> <br /> Until the final scenes, one does not know if Bock will leave the hospital for Barbara's Indian reservation and a quieter and simpler life, if her murderous father will be captured or if the locals protest and riot they will take over and take the hospital to their knees. Seeing the assassin crazed at work, one suspects that Chayevsky is telling us that our society of madmen forces him to do these things, since they tell us that he is a different person from cities and people. <br /> <br /> As my own father was Over the years, as the principal administrator of several large hospitals, I had an idea of ​​the demands of his work and the enormous responsibility he assumed. This story makes that responsibility the axis on which Scott's crisis revolves. This is a funny and terrifying movie, with the actors up to the considerable demands of the Chayevsky script. It is also a film that I take out more than every time I see it.
