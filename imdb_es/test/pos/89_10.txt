This is a piece of cinematic beauty, and it shows more of Quebec's culture to others than probably to any other work from the province of Belle. Take everyone to a first-person experience of culture, to the point that you wish you had stuck your hair in place and lived, breathed and eaten all Maurice Richard. The book does this as well as the short one, and I'm glad that during all the time I spent studying French in high school, I was required to read in both languages. <br /> <br /> I thought it was brilliant For Roch Carrier to tell this story. His thick molasses accent brought a lot of realism to the story. The animation was good, too, very surreal, which draws attention to the idea that it is a fantasy ghost, fantasizing about the best days of the past. <br /> <br /> Again, as a symbol of Qu√©bec culture, this is unsurpassed. You can almost smell the tourtiere cooked slowly on a wood stove. This whole film deserves an endless compliment for making people proud to be Canadians, and encourages us all to appreciate the best things about the family and our roots. I'm from Ontario, and this movie made me fall in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard is going to live with his coeurs.
