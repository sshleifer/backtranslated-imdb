I was a 20-year-old college student who lived with people when I first saw them, and I've never forgotten them. I'm a big fan of Joan Hackett, and this movie was perfect for her remarkable talent. I am so happy to see that so many other people have such a good memory of having seen this. Naturally, it is not available in any medium! It would be perfect to show it on Lifetime, but because of their age, they will not. You never see anything there before the mid-eighties. I can still remember what made me see it when it was first published: Rex Reed reviewed it in The New York Daily News, and said it was like a reminder of the great Hollywood films of the 1940s, and if it had been done in that moment. , the parts of Hackett and Grimes would have been interpreted by Stanwyck and Crawford. Think about it! PD So sad that Joan Hackett left us so tragically young.
