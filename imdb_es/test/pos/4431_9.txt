Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film says a lot about how little everyone knew. Your child's desire to discover who he is, and most importantly, what he was, is moving and emotional. <br /> <br /> This film captures the spirit of what architecture really is, the good design and the emotional price it has. You pay for it. Equally disturbing is the sound track. If you watch the movie and then listen to the soundtrack, you can revisit the movie by simply listening. As an architect practicing for more than 30 years, my heart ached and I rejoiced for the film and it is very simple, although with emotional honesty and sincerity. <br /> <br /> I had the honor of seeing this film in Chicago at the National Convention of the American Institute of Architects. The film was presented by Daniel, and he was kind enough to do a question and answer session afterwards. Throughout the presentation of the film, not a sound, not a cough, not a distraction. The entire audience was fascinated, and the real pleasure was that Daniel's mother was present during the screening of the film. <br /> <br /> I will always remember the movie and I will constantly reproduce it in my mind every time I listen to the soundtrack ...
