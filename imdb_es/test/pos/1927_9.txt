Note: it should probably be read only after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It is very rare to find a documentary or a film that focuses on the loser. Deep Water does just that, which makes it one of the most provocative movies in a long time. It does not give us a hero to admire, but an anti-hero who forces us to see ourselves. <br /> <br /> The film is about a group of men trying to navigate around the world. , without help, and without stopping. Only one does it, several die, one decides not to return home, each of them on a psychological journey intriguing enough to deserve full movies for themselves. However, the most interesting thing is Donald Crowhurst, or rather the way in which the filmmakers portray him and our reactions to him as spectators. <br /> <br /> From any point of view, this man must be considered a despicable character, but why? Did he represent it so heroically? Why are we so nice to him? From the beginning he made all the wrong decisions. He risked his family financially to get the boat, he went at a more dangerous time to get more publicity, he ignored all the warnings despite his lack of experience, he chose to lie instead of admitting defeat, these elections form a ball of snow until the inevitable and final: suicide. Everything for what? A place in history? A feeling of achievement? Maybe. What is important to keep in mind is whether this man's situation was inevitable. <br /> <br /> Each individual must ask himself if his natural human impulse for fame and achievement will lead him to such recklessness, and I think to examine his own reaction. The story of Crowhurst will offer at least some answer to that question.
