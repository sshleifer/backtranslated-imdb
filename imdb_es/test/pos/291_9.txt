This is a classic war movie. One of the best, a festival of images of flashing lights, dark rippling backgrounds and helicopter blades that transform into ceiling fans. A show full of stars of immense power. <br /> <br /> Martin Sheen is a mercenary sent river to assassinate the general who has gone astray, a sadistic dictator driven by the great Marlon Brando. Also along the trip are Robert Duvall as a high level DI with a penchant for "napalm in the morning" or at least for its smell. Dennis Hopper is an avant-garde photojournalist with a skewed view of the war and its leader. Also in this incredible movie you will see stars like Laurence Fishburne, R. Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall and you will also be attentive to Harrison Ford ... <br /> <br /> Behind the goal is that Francis Ford Coppolla delivers a film with perhaps more intensity and drama than the acclaimed films of The Godfather, highlights the war in its most basic form, which for the most part is something that can not be seen, can only be felt, as the boat continues upstream , the feeling of war is quite unbearable. The feeling of this is quite a claustrophobic feeling and really creates an unusual mood of the viewers. Honestly, no movie has made me feel that way. <br /> <br /> Criticism is hard to find. The biggest obstacle for some is that Brando won tons of money for a ten minute paper, but to be fair, this is not justified. It was a well-earned money, a role that restricted him physically, being at that time a sick man, and a role that he really made his own. I can not imagine anyone better for the role. And if you get the version of Apocalypse Now Redux, there are some extra fragments of the great man, and I think the Redux makes the movie better. <br /> <br /> The final impressions are that if you are lucky enough to get the Redux version you will be blessed with a completely satisfying movie with a fresh 49 extra minute footage. If not, then you will not be disappointed, this film is among the best, and deserves a great recognition, and a firm place as one of the 50 best films ever made ...
