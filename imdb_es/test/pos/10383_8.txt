A wonderful cast released in modern mystical romances for intellectual adults. Yes, they also need a love story to remove those hidden impulses without the fluff of Hollywood. All this under the magisterial direction of Antonioni and Wenders, who love to lock their characters in exotic places and have overshadowed by the environment with long and wide shots. It is fantastic to see that there is lust in the crisis sector of middle age.
