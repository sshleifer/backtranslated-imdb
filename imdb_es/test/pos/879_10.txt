An excellent thriller of all time. Vijay Anand stands out as Director and Editor. The performances of Dev Anand, Vyjayantimala, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar prove to be an advantage for the film that has its script solved down to the smallest detail. Cinematography adds to the mystery, glamor and other requirements of the story as it evolves. And to top it off, the music of Sachin Dev Burman is unforgettable. "Yeh dil na hota bechara" by Kishore Kumar, "Raat akeli hai" by Asha Bhosle, "Rula ke gaya sapna mera" by Lata, "Aasman ke niche" by Lata and Rafi and "Hothon pe ais bai main" by Lata, Once again, reaffirm the unique stature of Burman Dada as a first-rate composer with his own style.
