I LOVED this movie when I was younger, and actually I've been looking for it again! I would love to see him again !! The information is correct, but the cover does not seem to match, although I can not say for sure. As far as I remember, the film was about these kids (Alyssa Milano, Tina Yothers, etc.) in a driving class, and it also shows the prank they get out of class. Edie McClurg was the mother of Alyssa Milano in the film. I remember that I really liked it, so if anyone knows where I can get a copy (preferably on DVD) of the movie mentioned above (with those stars in it) I would love to know. Thank you :)
