"Meatballs" is an ode to summer camp. Those of us who have to go to the camp will see many of the scenes that we remember or wish we had been. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray plays the lead counselor of children Tripper Harrison, who actually runs the camp. It reminds us of the fun member of staff that everyone loves. Young campers gravitate towards him and if he speaks to you, you feel that you are a family. This is one of Murray's best roles. Drive the movie with your liners and ad-libs. <br /> <br /> Chris Makepeace plays Rudy, the lone camper who is taken under Tripper's wing and escapes from his shell. <br /> <br /> The rest of the campers and the movie staff were excellent too. <br /> <br /> The general theme of the film is the obstacle to overcome the obstacles to finally win. From Rudy to Spaz, to the Camp and even to Tripper himself, the losers of the film are the stars. The movie has a heart. <br /> <br /> The film is fun and funny without being cruel or exaggerated like some teen films are today. The cast looks and acts like real people. <br /> <br /> The comedy and the heart attract you to the point that in the end, as in the camp, you grieve to leave. <br /> <br /> In my summer camp experience we had underwear mounted on the flag posts, mysterious flesh, trying to take a look at the girls' cabin, the stories of lunatics with hooks around the campfire, and get the sleeping people out of their cabins and put them elsewhere But we also have a dedicated camp staff that guides us to be the best we can be. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the CIT of the night when they are canoeing across the lake singing a ridiculous song. The only line that bothers me every time is when Tripper is announcing light exits the night before Father's Day and ends: "Tomorrow is the day of the parents, and you must look rested or Morty will be sent to the state penitentiary."
