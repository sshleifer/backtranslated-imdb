Epic early movie, directed by D.W. Griffith. Mae Marsh, her little sister and her dogs are orphans, they must go live with an uncle. On board his coach is the young couple Lillian Gish and Robert Harron, celebrating the birth of their first child. The coach arrives at Elderbush Gluch. Marsh's uncle tells him that he can not keep the dogs and that they take them out. There are Indians (Native Americans) nearby; and, the Indians love to eat dog meat (is not that a joke?). These Indians are hungry! Lionel Barrymore sympathizes with Mrs. Marsh, who wants to help her recover the dogs that have fled. Upon rescuing the puppies, an Indian is shot, resulting in a confrontation of "Cowboys against Indians." <br /> <br /> This "Saga of the American West" is undoubtedly an important film; however, reliable Griffith artists begin to exaggerate their hands, and the story is too artificial. Many of Griffith's elements are in place, some good and some bad. "The Battle at Elderbush Gluch" announces the later epic, "The Birth of a Nation." <br /> <br /> ******* The battle at Elderbush Gulch (3/28/14) D.W. Griffith ~ Mae Marsh, Robert Harron, Lillian Gish
