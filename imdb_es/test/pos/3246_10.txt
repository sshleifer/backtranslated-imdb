This movie gives you more information about how Australians act. Although The Castle is a great Australian film, it is a bit out. This movie is by far the best Aussie movie I've seen (I have not seen Dirty Deeds yet) and it's probably my favorite movie. The point is, if you have not seen it, go see it. If a crime / action / comedy is your thing.
