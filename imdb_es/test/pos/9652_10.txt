This is the best French movie of the year! I saw it twice and it seemed great both times. I did not find anything boring, although it is very long (3 hours). I am seventeen years old, so obviously I could not live the events of May 1968 that marked an extremely important turn in the history of France, but it does not really matter since I still enjoyed the movie a lot. Actually, it is quite universal: people of my parents' age can identify with the characters and also people of my age. Garrel seems to perfectly understand young people, their way of thinking and the complications of love, as well as the loss of illusions about the possibility of changing the world. Maybe it's because the character played by Louis Garrel (his son) is actually destined to represent Philippe Garrel himself. Well, anyway, a great movie, no action (you have to be honest at that point) but feelings so strong that you can not remain indifferent to it. If you are looking for a relaxing Sunday night movie, do not waste your time on this, you will be disappointed. But if you like movies, you will like Les Amants RÃ©guliers, which is a fascinating film close to those made in the 50s and 60s by the artists of Nouvelle Vague.
