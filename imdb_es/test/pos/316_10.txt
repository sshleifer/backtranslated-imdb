During the final agony of the war of Vitnam, our central character, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to assassinate a commander of the US Navy. UU., Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who allegedly has become "completely crazy", but who is successfully waging a private cross-border war from his base in Cambodia, a neutral country and, therefore, prohibited. <br /> <br /> The whole story told of what Willard sees and does. While being transported by the Da Nang River by a patrol of undisciplined marine patrol boats and terrorized to murder, Kurtz is a great metaphor for the excesses, decadence and, ultimately, the weakness of the Anglo Saxon psyche: yes we do not understand something, and we can not control it, exterminate it. Kurtz eventually came to know this. <br /> <br /> Unless you pay full attention to every emotional gesture, to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two are alone in Kurtz's darkness. Den, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle deal with his executioner, his one-sided 'surrender' in exchange for Willard's acceptance (he nodded?) To tell Kurtz's 'son' (another metaphor for us, the next generation, those who watch the movie) the truth about all the horrors that both had seen in Vietnam, are things that expand the mind. The union between the two men while Kurtz examines Willard, intertwined with some of his own horror stories, is incredible, no, genius, movie. The final scene (interspersed) of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the most powerful symbol. Coppolla has done, intentionally or not, the last declaration against the war, one that should resonate through the centuries.
