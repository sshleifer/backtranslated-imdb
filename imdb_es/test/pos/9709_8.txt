This film surpasses the previous incarnation by a mile, taking everything to the next level. As always, the JackAss guys are simply amazing, and I personally laughed more at that theater than in a long time. Like the first JackAss, this is not so much a movie as a series of eighty minute tricks and jokes. It is pure circus entertainment carried to the highest level. Essentially, these guys are clowns, degraded by the fun of others. And it's great. The shenanigans are so low, scandalous and, often, disgusting that they transcend to a superior form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> You can not rate this along with other movies, it's in a class of its own. And it shines. Go and enjoy it for the sheer spectacle it is.
