THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN is a magnificent example of an anti-80 film. While many other films of the decade in general lacked substance, this film is pure substance. There is nothing elegant, false or superfluous about it. It has two great performances: Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as longtime friends Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee, respectively. Hutton, Penn and Tom Cruise were a triumvirate of the actors of the early 80s who seemed to be directed to much bigger and better things (the 3 starred in TAPS). While the popularity of Penn and Cruise soared, Hutton has largely forgotten, and that's a shame. Actually, Hutton is the first of the 3 to win an Oscar for his casting role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980, but I think his acting in this film is even more exceptional. <br /> <br /> Hutton really captures the post-Vietnam rebellion of the war in his character Chris Boyce. A failed student of seminary school, Chris has a love and hate relationship with his father, well played by the great character actor Pat Hingle. The scene in which Chris quotes the poem that his father thought he had forgotten a long time ago is particularly powerful. <br /> <br /> Chris gets a job at the Department of Defense and uses his hatred of the US government. UU And its foreign policy. sell seemingly useless plans from old projects to the Soviets. He gets his friend Daulton, a hyper-server for drug trafficking, to be the messenger of the microfilm project plans. While Chris does it based on his beliefs, Daulton does it strictly for the money. The Soviet link is interpreted excellently by David Suchet. Penn and Suchet have a real quirky chemistry and it's a kind of fun exchange between them. But, make no mistake, this movie is anything but that. It is a serious study about pessimism, discomfort, paranoia and distrust. <br /> <br /> Once again, the protagonists make this movie. Hutton offers a brilliantly underrated performance as Chris, a pretty smart young man who has a lot of potential. Penn, as usual, makes a tremendous characterization as Daulton, a pathetic loser who acts before thinking, and most of the time does not think at all. The end of this movie based on facts is very sad on several levels. A truly powerful character study.
