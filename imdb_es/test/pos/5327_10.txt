I'm not Ebert. What I am is compassionate and I have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than for Leland P. Fitzgerald. Sorry if I do not offer a review, but I see nothing but perfection in this movie. I'm sure many of you who watch this movie will never see the same things that I did, but if you watch with enough attention maybe you'll see something you did not expect. I read that the character of Leland was defective. It seems to me that whoever wrote this could not see beyond the Question that this film presents. I'm sorry for anyone who does not see the answers that this movie offers. Open your heart more than your mind and you can allow Leland P. Fitzgerald to show you a world that really has a meaning. Exceptional story with extraordinary performance. Ryan Gosling deserves to be talked about.
