The Railway Children is perhaps my favorite movie of all time simply because of the brilliant performance of the cast, the warm and human interaction of the 3 children and the people they meet who live near the railway in the beautiful English countryside. Jenny Augutter is especially credible in her role as "Bobbie", the older sister of her sister Phyllis and her brother Peter. The adventures they discover and the relationships that form in their new home and surroundings are very real and fascinating. The scenery is beautiful, the trains a part of the vast history of Britain and the soundtrack is very moving. This moving film never stops crying, every time it makes me feel nostalgic. I often wonder if I should have been born in that era, since I think I would have adapted well as people are treated. With such chivalry and decency. <br /> <br /> In summary, I consider this film a masterpiece and a must-see for anyone who considers themselves a "sensitive or humanitarian type". Edith Nesbit wrote this story in the early 1900s and what a wonderful story it is. Nowadays, more children need to read this or watch the movie instead of playing violent video games. If we had more films of this nature, the world would become a better place.
