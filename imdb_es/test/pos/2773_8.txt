My children loved this movie. We saw it every time we had a chance. It was a fun and funny movie. We saw him as a family and we all enjoyed it. It was a movie that you could see without any uncomfortable point that you would have to explain to the younger ones. My children loved this movie and would love to see it again. Even after all these years they remember him. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very pretty girl. all my boys were in love with her. They loved her like the pink ranger, so, to begin with, we watched this movie. (As you can see, I'm rambling a bit to fill in the LOL lines). But seriously it's a funny movie and it's worth watching. Disney please give us a DVD or replay!
