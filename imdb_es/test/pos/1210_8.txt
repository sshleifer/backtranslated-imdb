This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that, in my opinion, does not compare today. The colorful characters, with their stereotypical dress, brought a certain charm to the show that has since been violated by society and overexposed. Wrestling had a bit of innocence back then. A child could watch it without seeing an episode of Jerry Springer. <br /> <br /> Looking back now (I was 5 years old at the time), although I loved both Warrior and Hogan, I think I enjoyed Warrior more because of its mystery. Hogan was the brand hero who created an impressive public image. The Ultimate Warrior, on the other hand, was a masked man of few words, a hero outside the spotlight for a different audience. <br /> <br /> This rivalry was as exciting as a child because of this. The duality in me falls asleep for each combatant. He had a place for both of them. Because there was also bloodshed in this long and heavy battle, the stakes were high, at least for me as a child. On a similar note, due to Hogan's defeat, this made him more human. I remember that I felt a kind of sorrow for him. <br /> <br /> All these emotions at stake in the soap opera of the youthful boy made Wrestlemania VI such a good place to watch this game
