I watched this movie many years ago on television and I recorded it from there. I could never understand why my mother was upset to see it! It was because he was very young at that time. I just sat down and watch this movie again. Now I have 2 children and I had to try to fight against the tears, but that did not happen. I was crying for most of the movie. I just want to show how different it feels. when you have children of your own! Such an amazing family, a movie so heartbreaking, really wonderful! Someone has said that 8 are still living more news, are they all in contact? I would love to know! Touched by the movie everywhere!
