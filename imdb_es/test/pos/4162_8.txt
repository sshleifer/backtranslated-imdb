Emanuele Crialese did a fantastic job with one of those films that remain in the back of your mind for years. It was Respiro (see comments and synopsis here in IMDb). <br /> <br /> Now, with the magnificent young talents that I had for the first time on the screen, it takes the audience to a dark void. A literal plunge into dangerous waters. The issue is migration. In this case, from Italy to the New World (the name of the film). A great deal for its launch in the United States "The Golden Door". <br /> <br /> The story of a family that leaves everything behind and risks the rest, that is, their lives, for a dream. <br /> <br /> I hate to spoil the program by telling the story, so I'll stop a little bit from the work that Crialese and his whole team did brilliantly. <br /> <br /> First of all, I decided to stick to what He knows: direct sound as much as possible. This means, the whole movie. The textures, the pain, the nuances of reality are always mixed with smells, heat or cold, sweat and blood, life and death, as vibrant as in real life. <br /> <br /> The squeaks of bent metal and milled wood, the infamous buzz of the wind and the sinister sounds of the big engines and the boats' horns are some of the points that make this film so enviable. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is in the hands of a French couturier The symbolism of light is present from the first shot (again, almost the first shot of Respiro) and extends throughout the film with intimacy and a terrible feeling of despair. The faint tones and the very gray and somber depictions of the people who suffer from the narrow and dirty boat that sail to hope are fascinating. <br /> <br /> Light is used sparingly, almost to discover each character in the dark. The beauty of each shot, and each scene is accentuated with period costumes and perfectly selected physical characteristics of the actors. <br /> <br /> Once again, as usual, Vincenzo Amato is definitely alone. He is the father of two children (the same actors who were fifteen and twelve years old and now nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always transmits to his very complex characters. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gainsbourg is more or less. I guess he will never reach the perfection he achieved in The Cement Garden and in his first film: L'Effront√©e. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's that he seems a bit clumsy in his role. <br /> <br /> The locations and sets are hard and convincing, they almost represent a character on their own. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most notable character is the one played by Filippo Pucillo, the dumb younger son. The contrast here with his first paper is complete. Then, he played a supercharged child who was as relentless as anything around him. Now, his character is all expression. And only that: there are no words at all. His eyes tell the whole story with a sublime power. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is one of those films that will not be very well received in the United States. It is absolutely Italian in everything. It is so Italian that most of the time, the language is one of the many dialects that is much older than the Italian itself. In the United States, this movie may be too much for Americans because of the subject. But anyone who remembers the history of their families when they came to the United States, will see these movies with amazement. <br /> <br /> And, again, the minimalism that goes hand in hand with the ideas of Crialese comes back with an ending. Scene in the water. Only this time it goes from underwater photography to aerial photography. <br /> <br /> In short, another great story very well told by this filmmaker who only this year (2006) has collected 6 awards and was nominated for the Golden Lion Award. It is not a small fact!
