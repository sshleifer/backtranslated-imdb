OK, the show was a bit irregular, but I still loved it. I found the two main bunnies upset, but Hamton and Plucky were always fun. <br /> <br /> I really want the Baby Plucky episodes on DVD (or even VHS). Release those! <br /> <br /> Specifically the episode of "Potty years" issued on 11/22/91; The episode "Going Up" aired on 9/17/92 and the episode "Minister Golf" on 11/92. <br /> <br /> They are the funniest parts of the whole series and even more than a decade later, we continue to make reference to these bits! <br /> <br /> (I have nothing more to say, reduce the minimum to approximately 5 lines and reward us for its brevity!)
