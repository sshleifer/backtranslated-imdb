I loved this movie so much. I'm a big fan of the Amanda Bynes show that just ended. I admire her (in addition to her body) for her ability to act. She is a good actress. <br /> <br /> The movie was great. This is a girl named Viola who wants to play football, but when her school cuts the women's soccer team, she gets angry. His brother is ready to go to a prestigious school and he decides to go to England. So Viola wants to impress by playing in the boarding school football team. She goes to school and tests for the soccer team. She enters. Meanwhile, he meets Duke, a sensitive guy who plays on the football team. He really likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey), who likes Sebastian, who is really a viola. Sebastian is dating Monique and suspects Sebastian is not being himself. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a movie for girls and I enjoyed it a lot. It is so funny and adorable. I do not think I've seen AManda act better.
