Night hunter is a B-style action movie sold. Get a life and people grow. Don "the Dragon" Wilson is a kick boxer, (Hall of Fame) and not an actor. If you are looking for an Oscar, brother is not here. Looking for a kick ass action movie with a lower budget than the low one, here it is. The plot line may have been a bit thin, but film B is not. I understand that everyone is critical and that the trash of one man is the treasure of another. Get real people, judging each film as if it were an Oscar candidate, just silly. Incredible fight scenes, mixed with a new twist in vampire moves. See if you're a fan, rent something else if you're a fan.
