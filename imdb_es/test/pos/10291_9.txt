Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting movies I've seen in my life. I experienced extreme frustration as I watched this movie while searching for the two clues to get together. That never happened in the end, which disappointed me until the end. But the ending gives an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie. It is not a movie that people can see again, but a single clock will have a profound impact on people. So far I have not seen the movie again and I do not think I will. <br /> <br /> The story follows the experiences of a man, Max, who is committed to marry Muriel. Remember your old girlfriend Lisa (he considers it the love of her life) while listening, by accident, to Lisa talking on the phone. So try to find Lisa. Here begins your extremely frustrating search for Lisa. There are many layers in this movie. There are hidden currents of jealousy, vouyeurism and so on. There is also another character named Alice who is involved in all the confusion. The film then moves through a whole series of twists and finally leads to an ending that could be interpreted in many ways. It's fascinating how this movie has only four main characters, but intelligent writing makes it interesting and unique. What I love about the fact is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done in such a cheerful way. It has a very fast pace, which is probably why it can attract a large audience. The main character, Max, has shades of gray and I felt that the ending was perfect. I do not think he's supposed to be a clean character considering the fact that he's looking for his lost love while he's engaged and also has an affair with Alice. <br /> <br /> Alice's character is even worse. His manipulation and compulsive lying can really irritate the spectators (that's the point, I suppose). The scene where he breaks in front of Lucien really shows another facet of his character. It shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that is tired of all the lies and games and wants to lead a normal life. In the end, she understands that she needs to get away from everything. The end gives a cynical touch. Because it seems that Max's love for Alice is temporary and false. It's like saying that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option (ie, Muriel) than to pursue something that is so fleeting (ie, Lisa or Alice). In many ways, this is not really a romantic movie, but a satire on romance (in a way). <br /> <br /> The performances deserve great praise. Vincent Cassel as Max gives a great performance. He perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure of his commitment. Its geeky appearance is an added advantage, since it fits perfectly to the character. But the real star of the film is Romane Bohringer as Alice. His nuanced description of a woman who is jealous of Alice and is in love with Max. The scene in which she shouts "I'm crazy too" really shows her desperation and her longing to live a normal life with a man who loves her. <br /> <br /> By the way, I also thought that lesbianism is another interpretation that can be. extracted from this movie. Alice's actions can be explained in many ways. And his irrational obsession with Lisa can also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. It may be unlikely considering that she encourages Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. But I have the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time. She also avoids Lisa's questions regarding a boyfriend. She spends a lot of time with Lisa and she is happy during that time. That can lead many to question their sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> In general, I would give it a 9/10. I think he deserves it, but I subtracted it because of the surveillance capacity factor. I think it's a perfect movie to the contrary.
