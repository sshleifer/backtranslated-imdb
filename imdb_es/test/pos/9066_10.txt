I saw this at the Newport Beach Film Festival the other day. The movie is REALLY exceptional. The crowd that I went with everything I loved. Funny, moving and great acting. I'm tired of the proven and true romances of Hollywood, who can relate? David Krumholtz (Max) is really amazing as the true and sure lover of ultra-graceful Grace (Natasha Lyonne, who is also excellent). When Max falls in love with Grace, we believe him. Why? Because love at first sight is crazy and we are dealing with two lost souls, and maybe not so crazy. Giullmo Diaz also stands out as Hector and Rosanna Arquette as a sexless / sexy neurotic, both "roommates" of Max and Grace before embarking on their trip to Sheboygen, WI and finding themselves. Do not miss it, it's something special! PS The soundtrack, directed by Kevin Hearn (from Bare Naked Ladies fame) is also really super cool.
