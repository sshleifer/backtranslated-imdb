This is definitely one of the most terrifying and fascinating movies ever made. You're stuck to the movie from the beginning to the end. Even though there are some holes in the plot, it's still exciting for the final showdown. In addition to "8 MM" and "Peeping Tom", this is one of the best movies about "Snuff Movies", a taboo subject of our culture. If you like the SCREAM trilogy, you will probably love that one.
