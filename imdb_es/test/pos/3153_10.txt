I have destroyed my brain for another movie that reminds me of this one. I really can not get to one. I think it's because most of the films that address this theme (war, peace, violence) have a fixed documentary style. There are some great ones out there, all better known than USA TM, I'm sure, but they pretend to be informative and take their emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, somehow may seem more intellectual, but in reality it is not. It is philosophical, perhaps, but it ignores the information mode and goes directly to the same place as a piece of music. It makes you feel, but sometimes you do not even know why. They simply take you somewhere in a wave of feelings. When you see it, notice how well it is put. It may not be for everyone, but it is for all those who are looking for a rare cinematographic creation that respects you.
