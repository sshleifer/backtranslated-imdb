Although I saw this movie about 4 years ago, long before I started commenting on IMDb, I decided to review it now, which is unusual for me, since before, I often reviewed something right after viewing it. What can I say? Well, the best performance is that of the late Peter Boyle as the main character who, after learning that a man is killing his daughter's drug dealer boyfriend, wants to bond with him even though he is a Madison Avenue executive who He has nothing at all. common with the very conservative low class Joe. In fact, there are many funny scenes of Joe at this guy's party that makes intelligent comments there. Oh, and it should be noted that the actress who plays the daughter they seek after she disappeared from the hospital after an overdose of some drugs is none other than Susan Sarandon making her film debut! This was a pretty compelling movie by the time it was made (late 60's and early 70's) and it was a convincing work by screenwriter Norman Wexler (later Saturday Night Fever) and director John G. Avildsen (more Later, Save the Tiger, Rocky, and the Karate Kid). Certainly, the end packs a lot even today after all these years! Highly recommended for anyone who is curious about the counterculture of that time. PD Among the cultural artifacts seen here are a Raggedy Ann doll, a box of Ritz cookies, a bottle of Heinz ketchup and, exclusive of the time, a Nixon poster that asks: "Would you buy a used car for this man?"
