This program has to be my favorite of all the horror television shows of the 80s. Like Tales from the Darkside, also from the same creators, this show is a rare gem. If you agree with me, PLEASE sign this petition that I started, to spread Monsters' voice and get it out on DVD. Here is the address of the petition: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes would have to be Glim glim and Rain Dance. I also loved the initial introduction with the family of monsters. That used to scare me! One of the things that I would have to ask the DVD creators to include would be the organ sound that was heard just before the commercial break. I do not know if any of you remember that part, but that is one of the main things that brings back memories. Well then! War of the Worlds, the TV series has already been released on DVD, so I say Monsters, and also Tales of the Darkside, and on Friday the 13th the series should also be released. We the fans need to tell our minds! We need this awesome program on DVD, so PLEASE, spread the word!
