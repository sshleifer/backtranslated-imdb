This is a beautifully made film, which finely balances the fragile human stories (before and after 1945) and the indiscriminate combat of war. The use of footage from the Battle of Britain (a film that does not portray the 1940s so well!) Improves, rather than detracting from the whole. A deeply impressive job, this lived in my memory during the 2 years since I saw it, and I just bought it to explore the manufacturing extras. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. Like "Aces High", it alternates viscerally exciting (or frightening) aerial combat sequences, where the viewer can experience the actual loss of the characters that interest them, but also unpredictable interactions on the ground, where the skillful and real writers life experiences inform some events that are affecting and moving. This also underlines the fact that for many people, 1945 marked not only the end of one conflict but the beginning of another, and even today we do not recognize the loss, courage and sacrifice of so many unnamed heroes, or even worse, revere them. at a distance without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that it entails, making their sacrifices even more courageous. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is an experience that will take you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy and back to love that lasts even beyond death. If all the war movies were like that, we would never have to fight again. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that it's worth seeing? ;-) <br /> <br /> 10/10
