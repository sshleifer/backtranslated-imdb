SIR. BASEBALL is a movie of paradoxes. Written and filmed as a "light and sporty comedy", it really has a moving heart as human and universal as some of Capra's finest. In the plane of the plot, you have the paradox of baseball, a very old American game, as it is played in Japan: it has been turned around, with discarded American values ​​and Japanese values ​​printed in the game. (Part of the superficial "sports comedy" is due to Jack's lack of understanding of the way "basa-boru" is interpreted in Japan). He also has a main character who appears as an aging baseball star on the hill, but who is actually quite immature - the professional ball allowed him to postpone growth. And you have a main character who is rudely resistant to the changes in his life that are being imposed on him, refusing to accept the curve that life has given him, in the midst of a new country, a new manager, a new team, and a new girlfriend, who have welcomed him and try to accept him. Does it sound like something heavy? Not really. It is a charming comedy of "clash of cultures" that develops nationally, sports, romantic and professional. But if you look at it with enough sensitivity, you will also find a great story about a man who has to abandon his immaturity and grow up too late in life (causing a certain amount of personal pain), and find success in places where he never expected it. . I love history, but I also have great respect for Selleck's performance; discover his efforts (literally) to portray an ugly American, insulting people and throwing tantrums in public, and then let us enter this character to understand his dismay. It does not hurt either if you're a big fan of Takakura Ken as I am. SIR. Baseball is a surprising tale of "loss of innocence."
