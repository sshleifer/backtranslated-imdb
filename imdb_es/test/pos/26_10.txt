This movie has its detractors, and Courtney's Fey player can offend some people (who, frankly, need a good blow to the head), but the film is first class in all aspects: attractive, moving, relevant. Finney, naturally, is bigger than life. Courtney makes an ideal sheet. I thought the performances were terribly strong on both tracks, and Courtney's character offers a lot of dark humor. The period is well captured, the support cast well chosen. This must be seen and tasted like a good cordial. I wish it was already on DVD ... (* sigh *) ...
