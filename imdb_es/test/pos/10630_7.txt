First of all, those who are fainting should definitely avoid this movie. Even those who, like me, are insensitive to the most violent and sexual acts in movies, should be careful. I'm not telling you to stay away from the movie, but keep in mind that what you're about to see is a disturbing material. It is definitely not a pleasant movie to watch, but nothing is put on the screen strictly by impact value. But I must admit that when I saw the movie for the second time, I had to skip to the next chapter when the "razor blade scene" came up. <br /> <br /> The main character is one of the nicest and most sympathetic I can imagine, but we began to better understand the humanity of his character later in the second act of the film. In one scene, he slips the broken glass into one of his student's jacket pockets after being dissatisfied with his seemingly unsatisfactory performance and getting nervous when he finds himself in front of a live audience. The student slips into her pocket and screams in pain as she watches her hand stained with blood. Next to the scene of the razor blade, that was what bothered me the most. The student's mother is not much more understanding than her. When she receives the news that her daughter will not be able to play, she talks about it as if she had also injured her hand, being one of those spoiled mothers who tries to torture her daughter so that it becomes overcrowded. <br /> <br /> Although the film intrigued me and attracted my interest for the most part, I felt it was necessary to be explained more about the character of Isabelle Huppert. When a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porn movies and becomes involved in that behavior, you want to understand the root of the problem. The movie states that she desperately wants to be loved. So why the attitude of hatred towards all? Why does she receive sexual pleasure from pain? <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent and I liked the bright and stylized lighting. In general, it is not a movie that I recommend if you are in the mood to have fun, but as I said, it is very intriguing. And I'm sure if I saw it a couple of times more, I could detect certain subtleties that would shed more light on aspects of the film that I had not initially realized. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
