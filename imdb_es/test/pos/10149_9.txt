I can not believe that this movie only scores 7.4! This surely aligns with the best of Hitchcock's films like VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason I can think why the score is so low, is that for the most part, THE MAN ... renounces violence and certainly will not get a diploma in "sex and crime". <br /> <br /> What derives its tension is not violence, it is the reckless energy of these criminals who take a child from their parents and are ready to kill him if the operation fails. Today, after having seen many hard kidnapping movies like Mel Gibson's RANSOM, this seems normal, but in the 1950s, where the family was in contemporary America, the idea of ​​such a crime has surely aroused many emotions. <br /> <br /> And this tension still works for me, today. Yes, these guys are selfish, ignorant bastards, disturbing in the way they act: it's a deal for them, and they want to be "good businessmen", without taking into account the fact that the businesses here are kidnapping children and Murder politicians at the opera! <br /> <br /> However, what makes the movie great are the creative aspects, the perverse ideas of Hitchcock, the scandalously disturbing scene in the church (what draws the viewer's attention to how lonely, how abandoned there are the protagonists, nobody cares, nobody helps, the people in the church have just gone home ...), the meeting with the owner of that store filling and preparing dead animals (which underlines the somewhat "oriental" style which has the film of the initial scenes abroad), and last but not least, the role of MUSIC in this film. <br /> <br /> Music is the key principle here, since *** SPOILER *** the murder of the objective politician must be done exactly at the time of a strong tutti / gong orchestra; so Hitchcock lets the camera follow the score of the orchestra and now it will happen in a second *** BANG *** And then, of course, DORIS DAY singing Que sera, which became more famous than the film itself; she sings it to notify the child that her parents are in the embassy ... <br /> <br /> In short: a classic!
