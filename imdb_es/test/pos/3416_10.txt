We watched this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard about the process of Truth and Reconciliation, but as others have written, I did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and growth that can occur when people can face their pasts, understand events from the point of view of others involved and cry together. Archbishop Tutu and others involved in the development of the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions. Watching this movie gave me hope for the human race. If we can do T & R, we may not destroy ourselves. People will again look at T and R as the first step to emerge from human adolescence and toward maturity. <br /> <br /> As a movie, of course, there were flaws. I did not notice any major problems when acting, directing or writing, but for the first time in years I completely lost myself in a movie, so maybe I did not realize it. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. The audience in Toronto did not leave the stage for the next movie, we had many questions and comments for the stars and the director. Tom Hooper, Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor went out on the sidewalk to continue the conversation. People came just to shake their hands and thank them for the movie. We were all moved.
