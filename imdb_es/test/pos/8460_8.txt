Although the premise of the film implies a great "coincidence", all the actors do a work worthy of credit and they look great to give life to the story. I found myself encouraging the characters played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti, empathizing with both and wanting to be reconciled. Sam Waterston and Ted Danson are also doing well in their roles, doing a decent job with the relationship of stereotyped friends. While the story tends to leap in time, from time to time it leaves the audience somewhat anxious to lose details, it still flows and avoids any real confusion. This interesting story has all the elements for a good "movie for girls".
