I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard it when I saw it in the video store. I saw that Kathy Bates was in that, so I thought I had to be worth something, you know? I saw him the first time just shaking his head. . . eh Then it was the last scene and I found myself with the pain of smiling so hard. I clicked on "play movie" and saw everything again. It is without a doubt the most extravagant movie I have ever seen. But the more I see it, the more I love it. It is absurd and crazy and sweet and dear. Kathy Bates is impeccable, but the rest of the cast is also fabulous. What strange characters are all! The dwarf is too funny for words. And Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow are hysterical. It's just a fun and fabulous movie. I have a craving to see him again. Whoever is seeing it for the first time, please, give it to the end. Worth it!
