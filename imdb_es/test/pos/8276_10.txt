I was, unlike most critics, who was not born in the 80s. I was born on May 14, 1994. Despite this, my life was very much like the 80's. When other children had play stations, I was playing Zelda on my NES, etc. Now, this movie has a special place in my heart even though I was only 15 years old when I wrote this review. I, because of my early childhood style of the 80s, saw many television shows and saw many movies that other children did not see, and this movie was one of those, and one of the best as well. <br /> <br /> It begins at the Los Angeles home of Alvin Sevilla, Simon Sevilla, Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, the adoptive father of the Chipmunk, is in a hurry to get to the airport, since he is going on a business trip to Europe. Your taxi is almost there and the Chipmunks help you pack. While they talk, Alvin expresses his willingness to come with Dave and see the world (although, technically, Dave only goes to Europe, so Alvin, apparently, only America and Europe qualify as "The World"). David is leaving the Chipmunks in Miss Miller's care, to the displeasure of the boys. Soon, Dave goes to the airport and the Chipmunks stay home with Miss Miller. Later, at a local Caf√©, the Chipmunks are playing a game of "Around the World in 30 Days" against the Chipettes (Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After losing the game to Brittany after a crocodile ate her Hot Air Balloon hot air balloon, Alvin fights with Brittany about who would really win a race around the world. Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, Klaus and Claudia Furschtien listen to their arguments and, needing a safe way to transport their diamonds around the world, decide to trick the children into handing them over. They organized a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in its own likeness (secretly filled with diamonds) in deliveries around the world and receive a doll in the likeness of the opposing team (secretly filled with the payment of The Diamonds) to "vary they were there". The winning team would receive a reward of $ 100,000. They do it because they believe that Jamal (an Interpol agent who has been on his heels for a long time) would never suspect them because they are only children (However, this seems to be redundant, because in their travels, children do. to go through any security checkpoint and I'm not even asked about the dolls, I suspect Klaus and Claudia would not have taken him personally there either.) And so begins a great adventure. This movie is a classic and I do not see any reason why someone does not like it. It has a great animation and a first class voice acting, not to mention the music of Kick-ass (Pardon my french: P). My favorite song is without a doubt '' The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll '' An incredible rock song that can not be beat. It is also my favorite moment in the movie. Other notable songs include "Getting Lucky" (type of suggestion for a children's movie, huh?) And "My Mother", as well as "Wooly Bully" and "Off to see the world" without mentioning The main theme of the film is He listened during the opening credits made by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with '' My mother '' still brings a tear to my eye. In relation to the song "Getting Lucky", I did not think about anything about it, but when I grew up and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a bit suggestive. That song, along with the fact that the animators insist that the public know the color of the Chipettes' panties. This is especially evident in the scene in Egypt when the Arab Prince's men chase the Chipettes, when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While this has nothing to do with the overall quality of the movie, it's one of those unexplainable things like why no one in the world seems to care that there are 4-foot-tall Squirrels walking around and talking with incredibly sharp voices and treating them. As they would with any human child. Anyway, a little after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds on the dolls and decide to go look for the Chipmunks and get home. The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this film since she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr., know the characters better than anyone else. They even make the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Speaking of male characters that are voiced by voice actresses, Nancy Cartwright (The Voice of Bart Simpson) makes its appearance in this film. She plays the role of the Arab prince, a very small but important role. The ending is, of course, happy. The Crooks were caught, the loose ends tied and The movie ends when the Children, Dave and Miss Miller are driving towards sunset, Alvin complains about not having obtained his reward of $ 100,000 to win the race, which annoys Dave until he finally shouts "ALVIN!" And the screen fades in black <br /> <br /> Classic end, by the way. I hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you have not seen this movie, give it a watch, it's worth it. This nostalgic classic of the 80s gets a solid 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> '' Headin 'for the top, you do not know! we never stop believing now ''
