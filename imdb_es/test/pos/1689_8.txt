The film was certainly true to the real-life story on which it was based. I found it difficult to find newspaper articles about the real events, but when I located them, I could see that the truth, in this case, was more strange than fiction. Judith Light was terribly evil in her role as mother in this film, to the point that it was difficult to separate her from the role, the brand that I consider an excellent performance. Rick Schroder had no idea that his son also defended her in court, an example of how difficult it can be in some circumstances for a child to accept the actions of a parent, no matter how criminal they are. One can find flaws in the film, but not with its treatment of the reality on which it was based.
