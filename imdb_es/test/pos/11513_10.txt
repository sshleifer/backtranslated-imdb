It's the best movie I've seen in the last 5 years. Surely, will be in the same row with masterpieces such as The Platoon, Apocalypse Now, The Doors, The Dog's Heart (Russian film). Actually, the game of the child and his parents is so good that you can not even say that they "play". No, LIVE as if it were happening to you. Notice the smile on the faces when the main hero agrees to walk with them. Hate and love in one piece. And the final scene! <br /> <br /> Actually, I'm still under the impression of that movie. It is very difficult, even impossible to combine humor and tragedy, but if it succeeds (and Frederikson did) the impact would be twice as strong. <br /> <br /> I compared it with "ONE FLOW ON THE NORTH OF CUCKOO". I also like this movie (and the novel itself is also good), but after the Frederikson movie it seems simple. (The same difference I noticed after watching the movie "American history X" and "BREAK STOMPER", the latter is deeper). I mean that Milos Forman only showed the material point of view of the problem. You see it, then you say yes, it's a good movie, I like it, I do not like it, and that's it. But the "angels" leave you with a broad base to think about. There are no bad and good guys in the movie. Because each of them has the right to behave as they do. As the girlfriend of one of the patients. Of course she is young and pregnant and that is a problem for her because her husband is in the clinic, but the feelings and emotional experience of her ex-boyfriend are even stronger (the result is her suicide). Why ask him what he has done? Are not you crazy for asking? Why do not they support it, help it, understand it? Finally, it's even funny when those people talk to each other. They say great things! There are many things that I would like to say about this film, but I am not very good at English. But I'm sure, those of you who have seen the movie, understand me. <br /> <br /> Good luck! <br /> <br />
