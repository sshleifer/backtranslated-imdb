Screenwriters Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and (of all people) Dorothy Parker allow director Alfred Hitchcock to explain what his favorite subject of the film might have been: an innocent man, wrongly accused of committing a crime, risks it. Hitchcock, who has some credit for having originated the story, creates a lot of suspense in the plot about a warehouse worker who is blamed for the explosion that killed his best friend; Take a trip to find the real culprit. Much enthusiasm on a large scale, with generally colorless actors (Priscilla Lane, Norman Lloyd, Alan Baxter) doing a surprisingly fine job. Even the eternal Robert Cummings gets into the proper spirit! *** since ****
