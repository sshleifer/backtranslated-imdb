This wonderfully witty dramatic comedy captivated the crowd at the Philadelphia Film Festival, throwing them to wild applause at their conclusion. Supported by performances by a nuanced cast, a robust performance by director Jeff Hare, a fast pace and one of Peter Falk's best performances in years, the film emerges as an affectionate homage to the highlights of family life. <br /> <br /> Falk stands out as the Jewish novelist Morris Applebaum, an extremely eccentric Shakespeare reckless who decides to end his life, but not before bringing together his three grown sons and launching a "big suicide party" Jews". The film is full of indelible delights. There's Morris's "dirty room"; The passionate interpretation of Laura San Giacomo of the cynical daughter of Morris; Fast comedy dialogue that recalls the work of Neil Simon and Woody Allen; the ironic moment of David Paymer, who plays the son of Morris Psychotherapist; and Morris's patented egg creams (but be careful, drinking them too quickly will cause an unpleasant brain frostbite). Everything is wrapped in a pleasant and intimate atmosphere located in New York City. <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare proves to be a master craftsman, extracting memorable performances from his cast and lending the film a wonderful humanity. I was lucky enough to see a previous Hare movie: the dark and powerful "Perfect Little Man", starring Neal McDonough ("Minority Report") as a man from Los Angeles who is becoming crazy. The visceral value of "Perfect" and the nostalgic breeze of "Checking Out" are a testament to Hare's eclecticism and wide-ranging talent. I am anxious to see your future work. <br /> <br /> I heard that "Checking Out" lacks a distributor at this time. Some wise company would do well to collect this gem for the public, as it is a potential box office titan in the line of "My Great Greek Wedding". More nobly, it would give people all over the world the opportunity to experience the joys of this movie.
