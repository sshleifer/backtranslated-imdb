Sam Elliot is brilliant as a tough Detective Charlie Fallon from San Francisco. When his partner is killed while meeting with an informant, Fallon takes a beating, beats him to death and throws his body into a river. The next day, Fallon is assigned a rookie associate and assigned the task of investigating the murder of informants. Sam Elliot does a good job of portraying a man who was tortured for the guilt of his own murderous actions, and mourning the death of his partner who may have been involved in police corruption.
