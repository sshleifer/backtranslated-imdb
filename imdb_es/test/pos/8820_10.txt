Michael Sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant representation of a comic genius. If you are familiar with the gestures and diaries of Kenneth Williams, this drama captures the essence of them perfectly. When I read about Kenneth Hoovering in his swimsuits, I laughed and then came alive on the screen, but this time I did not laugh, because it was put in perspective as the actions of a repressed and tortured man. It must have been such a lonely existence to be in Kenneth's skin, yearning for attention but avoiding it when it really mattered! The last 20 minutes are heartbreaking, as he sees Kenneth sink gradually into the depths of despair and consider suicide as the only alternative. I've seen it a dozen times and I'm still crying uncontrollably the moment I say good night to LOUIE. I can not recommend this drama enough. Sexually explicit, but leaves aside the fact that Kenneth could not allow anyone to invade his world and this is where the sadness of man lies. For a genius who brought happiness to so many, it is a pity that his private life is full of despair and sadness. Pauly
