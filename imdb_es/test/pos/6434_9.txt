Co-directed and starred by Rutger Hauer, this short film was based on a story by the Dutch writer Harry Murlisch. <br /> <br /> In the 10-minute duration of the movie, you can see life as 'Harry' unravels his fascination for a long time with a room that goes on constantly in his youth. When he returns to the city, many years later, he discovers that he has rented the same room. <br /> <br /> Using a black and white film, the textures are accentuated in this delicate narrative of a story. The voice of 'Harry' takes you to his world. <br /> <br /> A subtle and tight interpretation of Rutger Hauer and 2 characters who do not speak. Wonderful soundtrack by the Dutch musician Dyzack. <br /> <br /> At this moment it is difficult to see this movie, since it is only available on DVD region 2 "L'infidele" (Liv Ullman) as an extra song. But it's expected to be on the reissued DVD of "The Hitcher" - another close but very different performance from Hauer! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you can!
