<br /> <br /> Oh my word !! I have never seen a film that lacks moral judgment or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires by showing an impetuous world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he feed us with a spoon with a hell on the earth that is seen through Bronson's face, but he also shows us the spoon he is feeding us with and says "look what you are seeing now, look at yourself and do the question: Are you having fun with this? " And even if you tell yourself NO, IT CAN NOT BE !!!! You will know that deep down you will know ... it is a masterpiece
