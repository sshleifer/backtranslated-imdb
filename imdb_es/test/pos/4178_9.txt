For a long time, I, a fan of the television series "The Monkees", refused to see "Head" because it was not about the characters of the television show, which were warm and wonderful. "Head", on the other hand, was said to be a dark and cynical movie. Finally, curiosity made me give in. Of course, I did not find a new episode for the television show, but a fascinating movie that attracts my dark side. <br /> <br /> It has always fascinated me. for dreams, and "Head" was very much like watching someone else's dream, with incomplete clues of stories and a small detail at the end of a scene that makes the film go in a new direction, much like a current of dreams consciousness mode. The unfinished stories really make my imagination fly, again and again! <br /> <br /> The film also presents a very attractive and beautiful cinematography, the epitome of which is the white-on-black, white-on-black look of "Papa's Song". The music is disturbing, especially the exuberant arrangement of "The Porpoise Song". ("The Porpoise Song" is the favorite song of my dark side, while my bright side prefers "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah".) <br /> <br /> In the end, I think the series of Television could have used some of the drama, intrigue and intensity of "Head". But "Head" could have used some of the warmth, humor and friendship of the television show.
