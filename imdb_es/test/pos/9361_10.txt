*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** In the immediate post-war years there must have been something in the air that made night cities attractive for movies. At that time, a gang of nocturnal and urban films was made, and not only in the United States. One of the most notable was Carol Reed's Odd Man Out, an English image of a wounded gunman staggering through the streets of Belfast. In the United States it was midday, or rather, midnight, of the black cinema. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not really black cinema, but it has the black world adornments, although it uses them for its own purposes. , which have to do with fanaticism. Directed by Edward Dmytryk, written by John Paxton, it was adapted from a novel by Richard Brooks. The book was about the murder of a homosexual; In the movie the victim is changed to Jewish. Although filmed as a mystery, there is little suspense in the film, as it is quite obvious who is the killer from the beginning. What makes the film so visible and beautiful is its evocation of a city, Washington, DC, just after World War II, by some of the most talented craftsmen who work in movies at that time. Unlike many nighttime movies, Crossfire takes place mainly indoors: at police stations, guest houses and nightclubs. Soldiers are everywhere in the movie, and most are eager to get back to their civil lives. However, one feels that, from most of the men we meet, that their personalities have been shaped by their military experience, it will be difficult for them to return to their old neighborhoods; for some maybe even impossible. It seems that they are more linked to each other than to any other thing or any other person. <br /> <br /> However, some men are never truly linked with anyone in the military. The killer, Monty, is one of those individuals. One feels that he was never connected in his civil life, either. He is a lone wolf who also needs people. Desperately alone, he has a sadistic streak one mile wide, and he always needs someone nearby to be the target of his jokes. The man he killed did not hurt him and, in fact, he was a stranger to him. But once Monty discovered the religion of man, that was enough. He really did not want to kill him, since his intention was "simply" to humiliate him and beat him up. But since he was quite drunk at that moment, Monty's fists overcame him. It is this act that sets the story in motion. The history in movement. <br /> <br /> Once the film creates a steam head, the other characters focus quickly. The opposite number of Monty is Keely, another soldier, who, although introspective as Monty, and somewhat distant, does not harbor resentment towards anyone and seems a reasonable, even kind, type. Finley, the pipe-smoking homicide detective, is dandyish and a little short-lived compared to the men in uniform, but he proves to be more than a match for the various and mostly recalcitrant soldiers he deals with. The actors who play these roles, Roberts Ryan, Mitchum and Young, give excellent performances, each in a different key. Ryan, like Monty, is tense and paranoid, always looking for someone to choose from; and one can feel their anxiety to become a victim. Like Keely, Mitchum is discreet, almost carefree; never raise your voice; and it seems to have more to say, more to offer, than the script allows. Young's performance has often been criticized for being too soft, but I find it deceptively strong and very unconventional. He opposes the stereotype of the tough policeman, and makes the character of Finley a prince of crime detection. <br /> <br /> There are few surprises in Crossfire, although the script is sometimes surprisingly well written. , even bright. Character actor Paul Kelly offers one of the best short performances in movies as the "boyfriend" of a woman that a soldier picks up at a bar. Kelly may or may not be her husband; and he may or may not live with her, although he seems relaxed enough in his apartment. The beauty of these scenes is that nothing is clear, and this man himself seems more than a little confused about what his role, was or should be. In a way, these few scenes form the thematic core of the film, which is anomie. With the exception of the detective, all the men in the film are adrift, aimless and basically lost, some more seriously than others. In this regard, Crossfire is, for all preaching near the end, a film about the vagueness of identity and the ease with which it can be lost or distorted. Men go from one bar to another in this movie, while engaging in a kind of camaraderie, their personalities merging into a kind of general American male template. Then something happens, something gets stuck. A word is mentioned, either 'Jewish' or 'mountain', and things suddenly get tense, and the very notion of individuality, of an identity outside the group, of someone who is not like them, becomes deeply offensive , even disgusting. Then, after the moods are ignited and everything that caused them has been resolved or forgotten, the men return to their normal non-personal and loose group, and order is restored.
