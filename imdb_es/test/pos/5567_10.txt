Farscape: is the only science fiction program that resumed the interest in science fiction in me. <br /> <br /> But Farscape is much more than simple and simple science fiction. Comedy, drama and much more :) The acting is very good. Luckily, Farscape also survived its cancellation and showed with Peacekeeper Wars that it is not dead yet :) I hope Farscape has a future :) In my opinion, it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the Show are muppets. You have to look behind that and you'll see how beautiful Farscape is. <br /> <br /> Farscape set a new standard in television and I think it will be really difficult for new programs to prove that they can be the same or better. Better than Farscape. I love this Show :) <br /> <br /> SaphirJD
