This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I watched him for about 20 minutes, a little confused by what was happening. Then I started to laugh and I did not stop until long after the movie was over. Such inexpressive satire is really weird. Christopher Guest has a true eye for the inherent humor in those who have no sense of humor about themselves (to begin with, about 90% of white heterosexual men). As in "Waiting for Guffman," Guest invokes the idiocy that America's medium has in the United States. I can hardly wait for his next movie.
