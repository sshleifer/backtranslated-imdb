I'm sorry to repeat myself again and again, but here's another great episode of Columbo. I guess that's why I'm such a fan: most episodes are really cool! The best episodes always have a prominent feature of some kind, and in this case, the murderer and his accomplice are possibly Columbo's youngest villains. <br /> <br /> After watching many episodes in which Columbo and his adversary act as close friends, it is good to see an episode where tempers fade and bad feelings come to the surface. It only gives one episode a bit more drama and bite. Columbo quickly realizes the fact that the two students who claim that they are helping him are not secretly laughing at him and giving him false leads. He happily plays along, deliberately climbing the whirlwind in front of them to make them underestimate him! But, of course, he knows instantly when they're talking nonsense. <br /> <br /> The murder itself is another complicated one, in line with the episode The Bye Bye Sky High IQ, with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that manages to kill the desired target while giving the assassins an alibi apparently hermetic. In the intervening years between 1978 and 1990, technology has shifted from record players and firecrackers to locking systems of cars with remote control and to hidden cameras. <br /> <br /> Stephen Caffrey presents a great performance as Justin Rowe, the nasty, spoiled student. Gary Hershberger is low profile but good as his friend "Cooper-man", the man of the "yes-man". And it's good to see Robert Culp as Mr. Rowe, Justin's father. <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in every way.
