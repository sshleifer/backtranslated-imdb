I have to agree with the comments of the previous author about the excellent performances and the plot. I started watching this movie by accident ... (Sunday afternoon I was clicking on the channels to see if there was something good) ... and was hypnotized by Martin Sheen and Emilio Est√©vez. Woohoo! Gut tear! Congratulations to all (I have always admired Martin Sheen), but I was particularly impressed by Emilio! Excellent acting and directing work ... simply excellent! So, why have I never heard of this movie before? I'll have to spread the news.
