Dario Argento is a filmmaker that I'm slowly getting into, following the iconoclastic efforts of Deep Red and Suspiria; It is not a filmmaker who always cares directly for silly things like "argument". That might be his only minor responsibility (but, for me, apparent): he will not let a small thing like common sense ruin his plan for his elaborate sequences of murders, since his murderer (s) can go through any type of details. configuration of being invisible, until revealing beyond the point of the tracking shots POV of said psychopathic killer. But it's exciting to see a filmmaker risk that way anyway, of a pure Italian aesthetic breaking through in the soul of a Hitchcockian warp (in fact, as a note of interest, if one has recently seen Scorsese's short film where he took three pages of a film of Hitchcock not filmed, that also took place in an opera, Argento had it won by almost twenty years, probably without knowledge of the text). It is also blatantly 80s (CD players and heavy metal and hair, alas!) And with an absurdity that makes it even more enjoyable to swallow. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a Macbeth opera is being produced, with highly stylized pyrotechnics and trained crows. There's even a talented promising star replaced at the last minute, Betty, played by Marsillach. But a murder happens during the premiere, interrupted not by that but by a falling light, and now the murderer is behind Betty! She can not go to the police (how can she let the opera be really cursed?), But will that matter to a murderer who does not give in? Probably one has seen premises like this in other Argento films, pursued by a murderer, but it's like Argento, like De Palma, builds and executes his sequences, and adds a distinctive flavor of his own to add touches of strange humor. (the breaking of the crows to attack the killer, and the later version of pointing in the lineup), a kind of wing of Leone (the bullet through the peephole through the door probably inspired a similar shot in Kill Bill 1) , and even a sado-masochistic inspiration with the pins stuck in Betty's eyes, more than once! <br /> <br /> Argento puts his actress through the drainer, and she is willing to do it, even when things seem to simply go to the territory of 'what the hell' (I was raising my hands almost saying I give up when she is taken by the secret passage of the girl, as if suddenly we were in Aliens now). And through that dark genre material, Argento keeps the violence dense and fresh, both the suspense and the music of the opera that comes directly from a speaker of a stereo system and a cinematographer who may have taken some drinks (And rightly so!) During some scenes, the way they shoot and vibrate at a heart rate. It should be considered garbage, but it is overcome by the limitations of the genre due to the mocking attitude of the director, this despite a silly ending, more foolish than everything that preceded what came before (thanks to the lizard) and an attempt to Break the curse of Macbeth, which, unfortunately, does not seem to happen in real life on the Opera set. 8.5 / 10
