Not surprisingly, the majority of the highest-rated votes were presented by women over 45 years of age. This is the time frame in women's lives when they become caretakers of elderly and infirm parents. I lost my mother, due to cancer complications, in June, and I went through most of the same emotions that Zellweger portrays in this film. Yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real and the development of the plot was extremely precise. Congratulations to the entire cast and crew for a wonderful portrait of life and death, and the promises of tomorrow.
