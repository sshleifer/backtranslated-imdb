This is a story about a trip made by a man who once had a dream and guts. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur sailor who competed in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, a yacht race for everyone. <br /> <br /> I was very intrigued by the story after listening to a radio interview from producer John Smithson, who is also a producer of "Touching the Void", one of the first documentaries to be commercially successful in 2003. I went to the cinema with great hope and little prior knowledge about the historical event, and I am relieved that I was not disappointed. For 92 minutes I was guided through a disturbing story and came away with a lot to think about. <br /> <br /> Without any recreation, this film made great use of the limited audio and video archive file they found and turned it into a compelling story that allowed the audience to understand Crowhurst from a personal level. The story was revealed as people who had direct links to the events, including his wife and his son, and the eventual winner, also the only one who managed to get out of the 9 competitors, Robin Knox-Johnston gave his own accounts of what happened. Almost 40 years ago <br /> <br /> The records of Crowhurst (newspapers) that he kept during the 243 days at sea are so disturbing that it made it much easier for me to understand what it can be to be in total isolation. a man. While Crowhurst's body was never found, the other competitor, Nigel Tetley, whose yacht sank just a few weeks before claiming the prize for the fastest passage, committed suicide three years after unsuccessful attempts to complete a circumnavigation. <br /> <br /> Toll, especially the sea. <br /> <br /> Principal Louise Osmond was also in the question and answer session after the presentation with producer John Smithson. I had no idea I was a director and that was a very pleasant surprise. The film has a limited release in the United Kingdom (a couple of days in certain cinemas). Capture it in the cinema while you can, unless you have a state-of-the-art sound system that can recreate the sound of the strident Southern Ocean ... then I'm sure you'll soon have it on DVD too.
