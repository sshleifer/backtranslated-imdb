It's a science fiction / horror thriller game about a well-known and famous video game designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), whose latest game, "eXistenZ", not only attracts the attention of people who volunteer to try the game. game, but who almost killed her (and also his game). Since being forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is left with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing apprentice ("PR nerd") to be his bodyguard, although he only has a weapon made of flesh and blood and the bullets. They are teeth The director David Cronenberg, well, used some fragments of his previous films ("Videodrome", "Scanners", "The Fly", etc.) and placed it in certain parts of the story with a good rhythm. Law and Leigh are fine here, as are some of the supporting cast (Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccelston, etc.) that has an international twist. Dafoe is anything but diabolical like Gas, a deceptive garage mechanic. One of the best scenes in the film is to witness Ted eat (fish and frogs), build a gun and admit Allegra: "I can not help it." "eXistenZ" manages to show that he (Cronenberg) lives up to his old tricks and still works like a charm.
