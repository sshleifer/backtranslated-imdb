Being the second last of the films of Chaplin in Essanay, CARMEN is a parody of the drama of Cecil B. Demille with the same title. It is quite obvious that the well-known Demille film did not impress the comedy king too much, which he later admitted in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> The parodies were not a new experiment for Chaplin. He had already done several of them, namely, HIS PAST PREHISTORIC and HIS NEW WORK, and he would continue to do so until the end of his film career (for example in A KING IN NEW YORK). <br /> <br /> Chaplin makes a very good representation of Don José, and Edna Purviance is very good as Carmen. Neither do we act as we are used to; Charlie is not the adorable bum and Edna is far from being an innocent woman, but neither were Chaplin's intentions. A BURLESQUE IN CARMEN is a somewhat strange film by Chaplin, very different, but still includes good material. <br /> <br /> The main story is, although in a very different way, as in the original drama. Don José is very much in love with Carmen, but he is not alone in that field; "Carmen, Carmen, (the) beautiful Carmen, (is) loved by all men under 96," but has the great advantage that is an officer, and there we are; This is the famous story about rivalry, love, greed and honor, viewed from a humorous perspective. Thanks to the performances of Chaplin and Purviance, and to the wonderful and wonderful music of George Bizet that I admire a lot, this could have been a masterpiece almost of comedy, it is a moment that must be taken into account. May have been. But unfortunately, even though it's a good enough comedy, I do not think it's fair to blame people who say that A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is far from being a masterpiece. But it is important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with the lack of talent, but rather as a result of business-related conflicts. When Chaplin refused to re-sign the contract with Essanay after completing his last film for the company, POLICE, they avenged themselves by editing all the scenes that Chaplin had originally released from CARMEN. Thanks to this, the film is somewhat confusing and has several meaningless scenes that are more annoying than fun, and the film turned out to be rather a feature of Ben Turpin - Turpin played Remendados - than a short film by Chaplin. Naturally, Chaplin was desperate when he discovered what Essanay had done and had to stay in bed for several days. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is highly recommended for fans of Chaplin and admirers of beautiful music.
