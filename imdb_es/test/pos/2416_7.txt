This movie was very different from the previous ones and I had to ask myself: "Where is Ralph Macchio?" I could have been involved in the plot somewhere like Myiagi's old friend who teaches Julie what she already knows, so Myiagi can come and add something else! Macchio could have been the love interest for Julie in this movie! No matter! <br /> <br /> On a serious level, I enjoyed this film because it involved teaching a teenager how to do Karate, and her feelings are very different from Daniel's. Julie is much wilder than Daniel was and needs to be domesticated, something that Myiagi finds very challenging; She is a pretty troublesome girl and a rude and nasty brat! <br /> <br /> It was very satisfying to see the transformation in Julie as she warms up with Myiagi and comes to understand more about Karate and her life in general. We can all learn a thing or two from Myiagi's wits!
