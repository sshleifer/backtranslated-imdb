Greetings to all the wonderful fans of this film who have not only seen and appreciated it, but (based on the many comments that can read and write) actually get it! For my part, I have always considered the "Tempest" by Paul Mazursky as a reflection on Shakespeare's work of the same name, as has been pointed out in some of the other reviews here. On the other hand, if you are looking for a simpler adaptation of the work, you should look elsewhere. However, as an experiment, it has spectacular success. Charming, moving, funny, sad, dramatic ... it's all that and much more. Cast, places, script, music are simply fantastic. Cassavetes and Rowland were never better. The turn of Susan Sarandon more than hinted at the great work that will come from her in the future. Molly Ringwald makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love Raul Julia's performance ... she steals the show in several scenes. What's more, the always brilliant Cassavetes was confident and confident enough to have left it. A study on what thematic elements of Shakespeare's classic could be life if they are updated in more "modern times", Mazursky's "Tempest" burns brightly!
