I found this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3am. My brother and I were sailing on a canal and, who we see, only a young Russel Crowe. But it was not the phone that launched Russel Crowe that we had come to know and almost love in the United States. This movie, to my surprise, was surprisingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of uncomfortable teens with funny stories of bizarre sexual experiences, including a sly salesman, prostitutes and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to meet this movie, I strongly suggest you pick it up. I have to say that this movie was incredibly entertaining and I thank the good people of Australia who made it ...
