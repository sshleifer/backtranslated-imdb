The Kid Power Hour featured two segments: Hero High and Shazam. let's start with Hero High. <br /> <br /> Hero High was meant to be a new cartoon of Archies, with their superhero identities: Pureheart the Powerful (Archie), Captain Hero (Jughead), Superteen (Betty) and Evilheart (Reggie). However, Filmation could not obtain the rights to do so, so they modified it a bit and came up with this. Here is the breakdown of the characters: Captain California (Archie), Glorious Gal (Betty), Weatherman (Jughead), Dirty Trixie (Veronica), Rex Ruthless (Reggie), Principal Samson (Mr weatherbee) and Miss Grimm (Miss Grundy) . The show featured live action sketches as well as cartoon adventures. Humor was the typical Filmation joke, but at least it had a sense of fun. It was entertaining enough for the children, although not quite from the previous standards. <br /> <br /> The other segment was Shazam!, which was very faithful to comics, unlike the previous live action show. All major villains made appearances, as well as the entire Marvel Family (including Freckles Marvel, in at least one episode). Uncle Dudley had the correct voice of WC Fields and his somber character, as well as his perpetual "Shazambago". Burr Middleton, a veteran of 70s television shows such as Fish, voiced the Big Red Cheese, while Alan Oppenheimer (Rudy Wells in the first episodes of 6 Million Dollar Man and the voice of Skeletor in He-Man) handled to Dr. Sivana. <Br /> <br /> The Marvels had always had a sense of fantasy, so few alterations were required for their adventures, to comply with the requirements of Standards and Dissemination Practices (the censors). As such, the stories were very imaginative and inventive. Among the villains that appeared were: Dr. Sivana, Black Adam, Mr. Atom, Mr. Mind, Aunt Minerva, Ibac and the crocodile creatures. Mr. Tawny Tawny also made his screen debut. <br /> <br /> Hero High will be launched from BCI, but Shazam! It is still in limbo, as well as the live action show. Hopefully, the proposed movie will help shake them on DVD. It is worth seeing and deserves a treatment on DVD.
