I was very excited to see Rock Star because I'm a huge Mark Wahlberg fan. I was surprised that I would have liked more than I originally thought I would like. The script left something to be desired, but the performances of the movie made up for it. There were a few moments when the visions of Spinal Tap came back quickly, and I can not help thinking that this movie would have been even better as a memorial. But, I'm rambling. <br /> <br /> Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent, while playing with the credibility of a common man whose biggest dream comes true. He does it with the wonder and innocence that makes you not only believe him, but also worry you a lot about his character. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston, who until now has not impressed me in the movies, is surprisingly good as the girlfriend / manager. She shows more real emotion than I've seen in her latest combined movies. <br /> <br /> But above all, it is the music in this movie that really attracts you. Seasoned with some 80's tunes (Let's face it - Bon Jovi would have any 80s music fan playing in his seat), the movie really rocks with the original Steel Dragon songs and the Wahlberg performance. <br /> <br /> I plan to see this movie again, but first I'm going to rush to buy the soundtrack!
