I have to admit that thanks to this movie I am now afraid of the mannequins. Hahaha. <br /> <br /> but yes, first of all the acting in this movie, at least for my level is quite good. Most of the actors are quite decent in their roles. The script also seems to be pretty good too, sure there are some corny things there, but also some decently written characters and some scary scenes. STILL gives me chills to think about that scene with the guy and the mannequins. brrr. <br /> <br /> Yes, I will say that you should see this movie, it is quite good and very entertaining. a good watch 8/10
