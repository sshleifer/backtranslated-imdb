I love B's horror films. However, I'm not generally a big fan of "so stupid that they're funny" movies. I had to rate this simply because Death Bed: the bed you eat is unique in its class, and very original. There are a lot of question marks, a lot of holes in the plot, and the WTF factor goes up to 11, but I really did not get bored for a second. I really could not call him creepy at any time. Every minute I said to myself "what the hell is this bed / movie going to do next!" I saw him with a friend who is by no means a fan of horror or B movies, and even she liked it a lot. The effects were really very inventive and the colors and the atmosphere were quite good. It maintains a very consistent and uniform tone in most of the movie (although with an incredibly ridiculous consistency) and the performance was not TERRIBLE. From the point of view, I can see that there are certain inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make the suspension of the belief almost impossible, but the film itself was such a unique and strange concept, that fact did not really bother me. . Seriously, for me, this film is a success that I will not only never forget, but I also guarantee that I will think about certain scenes in the future. Does anyone else know about other movies in inanimate objects that eat the genre of people? totally fantastic
