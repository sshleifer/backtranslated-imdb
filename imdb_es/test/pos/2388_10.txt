I watched the film for the second time on September 30, 2006 and I thought it was even better than the first time I saw it. I really enjoyed the performance, especially "Uncle Benny". I thought Fred Carpenter did an excellent job writing and directing this movie. The story line definitely maintained your interest and I hope this movie reaches the top. I felt that he moved very smoothly between scenes and the surprise turn at the end, well, let's say I did not see it coming. I also thought that Craig, the actor who played "Eddie Monroe" did an excellent job and I hope this movie helps him go further in his acting career. From start to finish, I enjoyed it a lot.
