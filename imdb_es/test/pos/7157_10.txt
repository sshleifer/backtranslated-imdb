Forgiving the Franklins is the best movie I've seen in years. The acting was fantastic ... especially Mari Blackwell who was truly remarkable in the role of Peggy Lester. He brought Peggy to life with incredible ability and made her as real as my neighbor next door. I also enjoyed Robertson Dean in the role of the father ... he is a true professional, and managed to perform even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace. The performances of the entire cast were very good, excellent, in fact, but the role of Peggy played by Blackwell made the film. The cinematography was beautifully done at all times and was most impressive. The only criticism I have to offer is a slight weakness of the final scenes, which were too extensive, repetitive and a little too focused on the wrong character. I would have liked to see it end with a note of forgiveness ... but despite this small defect, it is worth seeing and applauding everyone involved in its development.
