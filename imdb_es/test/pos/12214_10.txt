I do not think so. Sixty percent of the voters voted this program as ten. Now, how the hell is the score of five points eight? It's impossible, I do not understand, it's totally pathetic, I mean how. Anyway, the show is great, the story is great and the characters are interesting, definitely, ten of me believe that the creatures are great, they look great and I would like to have a great show. Many were left unanswered in the first season and when Nimrod gets bigger since the rest of the creatures are huge, again, why is the score so low when the votes were so high? <br /> <br /> 10/10
