Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he's been! I love watching him !! I was 10 years old (1979) when I saw it for the first time. I look forward to everyone and everything in what will be acting. Hopefully one day I can see it in person. It is very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is dominant and strong! He is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely awesome !!!! In my opinion, he's the best actor I've seen! I adored him in "Dracula" (along with many other girls) and in "Woman created by God", "House of D", "Jason and the Argonauts" and many more. I thought he was a genius! I can not wait to see him on "good night and good luck".
