The film, although not faithful to the original novels, manages to create a modern vision of Gothic vampires. Someone tried to insult QotD by calling it a 1.5-hour video clip. Actually it is a complement. The ever-present gothic music combined with the shots similar to music videos made the film so capricious, and "Queen of the Damned" is a story motivated by the mood. <br /> <br /> I do not understand Die Hard fans. They complain about the modifications of the story. The plot has been modified to make it less confusing for viewers who do not know the novels. The amount of characters had been reduced and I have no problem changing the creator of Lestat or skipping the character of Mekare. The biggest change, the romance of Lestat and Jesse, seemed like a good addition. <br /> <br /> Actually, I believe that a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. The slow and gloomy mood, which was perfect for the anguish of Louisiana and New Orleans of the nineteenth century, would not fit with the rebellion of Lestat and his music. And while the book can be slow, descriptive and combining multiple elements and still convey them well, the film simply can not do it without becoming chaotic. "Vampire Lestat" and "Queen of the Damned" can be divided into at least three films: the creators had to choose something. <br /> <br /> Some of the special effects, like flying or leaving the flames was the only thing I really did not like in this movie. But Akasha's death was very pleasant. The cast was good, Stuard Townsend was convincing as Lestat, especially in the concert, but I prefer Flags like Armand. Although he loved Jesse, Maharet and Marius. And, of course, Aaliyah was perfect with her quasi-ancient Egyptian accent. <br /> <br /> So if you like gothic music and the vampiric dillemas of loneliness and eternity (and do not consider books as movie sets) "Queen of the Damned" is one of the few films that They show the vampires as something more than blood sucking monsters. But please do not compare it with the movie "Interview". It has a completely different style, as different as Louis and Lestat. Personally, I find it exciting to first see the existence of a vampire from Louis' "bottled hunger" point of view, and then change to a non-moral, but surprisingly extroverted one for a vampire, Lestat. <br /> <br /> I 'D: "Reina" 8 out of 10, since I had some technical flaws, but I decided to give it 9, since it is very underestimated by people who hate it simply because it did not match their vision of the books, which can be clearly seen by Looking at the breakdown of votes.
