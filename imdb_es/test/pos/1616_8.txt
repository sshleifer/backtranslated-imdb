I bought this DVD from Walmart for little money, thinking that it would be a typical trash of monsters directly to video, but it turned out much better than expected. There is really no criticism to say about it ... obviously it is low budget, but that adds to the traditional fun. It is great and entertaining. <br /> <br /> There is everything: horror, sex, a big plane crash and good characters. And I'd say it's quite original, because it does not really come out like any other movie I've seen. It has its own unique appearance, which I really liked, that's why this movie deserves credit. I hope to see more of these incredible "The Scare Master" movies, Brett Piper, whom I had never heard before. <br /> <br /> The DVD menu is really creative with wonderful music playing on it. , so it's perfect to keep it on when you're still not ready to sit and watch it. It also includes some special features, which are really interesting. But we can never see the director or hear him in the comment, we must be shy. This leaves the Edgewood studios in Vermont, USA. UU I recommend it to all terror lovers, you will love it!
