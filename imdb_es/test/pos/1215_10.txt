This movie is incredible. You will NEVER laugh any louder. It's a goal No, I think it's ... yes, it's ... BOOB! This movie becomes more fun per second, like when the character of Jackie Chan finally dies in his final fight scene. This movie is velly velly sailboat as treasha! Congratulations if you buy or rent this. You will never return it, in my opinion. I did not do it, and I have not found it in a store since then. I watched this movie once and I was always in love with the Kung-Fu action movies. If you are looking for an incredible movie in the area of ​​great production value, good or even mediocre performance and good special effects ... it is NOT that movie. If you are looking for eternal laughter and wonders, collect this for a dollar and probably never let it pass. With friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect night.
