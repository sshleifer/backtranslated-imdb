I caught this a few times on television in the late seventies. He only played late at night (past midnight). <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre plays a kind and happy man whose face is disfigured in a fire. He is rejected by his girlfriend and left alone and full of despair. It becomes a life of crime and eventually it becomes very successful. He makes a mask to hide his disfigured features and falls in love with a beautiful girl (Evelyn Keyes) ... who is blind! Try to go directly to her ... but she can not escape from her life of crime or from her hatred towards her own face full of scars. <br /> <br /> A movie without a budget B. Very short (runs only a little over an hour) but well done and with an excellent performance by Lorre. This is much deeper than you would expect from a fast B image. Ankers especially takes the ungrateful role of "girl" and makes his character fresh and attractive. Unfortunately, this has disappeared from television and was never recorded on video or DVD (to my knowledge). TCM showed it recently and it was great to see that the film still holds up. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
