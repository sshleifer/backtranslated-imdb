In addition to being a representation of a lesbian love story, FIRE is also a comic satire of middle-class Indian culture (?). It seems to me that this is a quality that is little appreciated by the film. These two genres (ie, a deep and meaningful alternative love story and a comic satire) usually combine the same as oil and water, but Mehta (somehow) manages to achieve balance almost perfectly. The behavior of the servant Jatin, the treatment that the family gives him, the constant and inescapable presence of the grandmother in bed, the obsession of Ashok with the teachings of a swami: coming from a culture very similar to that of India, these These are things that I can immediately identify as typical. They have been clamoring to be singled out and ridiculed. In developing his main theme, Mehta manages to achieve this secondary theme with skill.
