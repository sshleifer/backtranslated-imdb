When I saw this movie for the first time, I was surprised and surprised by the vibration of the story. It's a very artistic drama with incredible special effects, spectacular performances, not to mention an excellent job in the makeup department. Jennifer Lopez has retired from previous roles that went into her career with this film, introducing a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to enter the minds of comatose patients to treat them. Vincent D'onofrio played incredibly well. His interpretation of a sadistic serial killer was perfect for a T. The emotion that transmits his performance is amazing. Vince Vaughn is not my favorite, but he still has exceptional performance. The symbolism and art were intriguing and exciting, sometimes surprising and sometimes shocking. In general, I say that this is a wonderful movie, with excellent acting and beautiful illustrations.
