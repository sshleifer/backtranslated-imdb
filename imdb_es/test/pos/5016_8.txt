Stuey Unger was a legend of the card game. He was quoted in an interview saying: "Someday, I suppose it's possible that someone is a better No Limit Hold'em player than I. I doubt it, but it could happen, but I swear, I do not know." I do not see how anyone could play gin better than me. "There is a gummy rummy scene in this movie that is so amazing you could have left it on 'X-Men' as a showcase for the mutant power of a superhero. . <br /> <br /> I have some minor problems with this movie, as dark as this movie was, Stuey's real life was darker. "During the last World Series of Poker, Bob Stupak, Mike Sexton and I took a drink and we talked about Stu. Mike told us he could barely talk, he had not showered in weeks and how his fingers were. "Burnt black by a crack tube." In the film, Michael Imperioli looked too healthy to be a student in the last years of his life. lifetime. when Stuey won his last wsop, he looked like a skeleton, but let's be honest, this production lacked the time and the "deniro" to make that kind of transformation. My other problem was that I would like there to be more poker game, with real hands and situations. Surely it could have bored the average poker enthusiast, but it would have been good for hard points. Too bad the movie did not last more than 6 hours. <br /> <br /> I saw her with 3 players who were not poker players and they all enjoyed it a lot. Just as it is not necessary for you to be a former member of the colonial army to enjoy the "patriot" of Gibson, you do not have to be a poker player to see this gem. I can not wait for the DVD.
