Do not watch this movie while eating, or shortly after, eating. <br /> <br /> Having said that, Begotten will stay with you for the rest of your life, like it or not. Based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing more than a human spasm (paraphrasing the title sequence / introduction), this will probably contain the most intense and horrifying images you will ever see in a movie. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue, only image after image that describes the cycle of life. The combination of black and white photographic photography combined with some really spooky background sounds works to take home the manufacturer's message. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with God (portrayed as a bandaged and obviously insane man) opening his Torso with a straight razor and then dying in his own filth. After her death, Mother Nature emerges from her corpse to impregnate herself with her blood and semen and gives birth to Man, represented by a human worm convulsing on earth. <br /> <br /> The landscape is a sterile waste, populated by gigantic covered humanoids that eventually meet Mother Nature and Man. After a series of violent scenes depicting the violation of Nature and the destruction of Man, these humanoids proceed to hit the remains of the corpses again on the ground, and the cycle of life begins again. <br /> <br /> I actually rented this from Blockbuster one night, based on the cover and the hype content, but it's definitely not a Blockbuster type movie. Do not expect narrative, dialogues or any hit thrown. This is an intense image based on a dark theme. <br /> <br /> I give this movie some high notes for the work of the film and the audio, but I do not think I'm watching it too often, again. I like my dark and unique films, but this is exponentially more than I expected.
