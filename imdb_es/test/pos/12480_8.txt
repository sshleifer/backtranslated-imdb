Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is a quiet example of French transition cinema. A film between the realism of post-war cinema and the magic and symbolism nouvelle vague. With some spots of the American classic films (but without imitating it), the director tells us a story about love, crime and the importance of points of view. We can also find great actors (Suzy Delair is impeccable). <br /> <br /> It is also interesting, how we can find aspects of this film today. The heritage of Quai des Orf√®vres is palpable in the tradition of Woody Allen. Deepening a criminal situation in a picturesque environment. The naive ending is also typical in Steven Spielberg's good films. And, finally, I would like to point out the feeling left during the photo shoot between Jenny Lamour (Suzy Delair) and Dora Monier (Simone Renant) in which the first confesses that she believes that her husband is being unfaithful and exactly with the woman. who is photographing it That scene is exactly what is between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in Closer (Mike Nichols, 2004).
