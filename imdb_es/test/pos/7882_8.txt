Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), a fanatic who is getting drunk there, at first takes it as a joke, but then the story is confirmed in the evening news. Instead of calling the police or something like that, Joe decides that, since the guy killed a hippie, they must be like-minded spirits! He blackmails the man so that he becomes his friend. At first, the film seemed harsh and critical, but, as it was revealed, it actually became a fairly complex portrait of today's society. Yes, I think it exaggerates a bit, but in fun ways that do not really detract from the power of your messages. Susan Sarandon debuted in this film, and it's a shock to see how beautiful she was around 23 years old. It's worth seeing.
