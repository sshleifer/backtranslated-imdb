Along with Cops, The Goat is one of Keaton's two funniest shorts. What makes it one of the best shorts ever made. This has a decent "plot" for short, and forms a perfect line to hang some large gags. Keaton gets confused with an escaped convict (how error is a classic) and then must elude the authorities. The best gags - the bread line and the "elevator".
