I really enjoyed Gabrielle Burton's story about a mysterious gift and how it affects its recipients in the past and present. The talented Burton family of five sister filmmakers, a mother author and a dancing father offer a charming plot, edited with respect for clarity, memorably chosen songs and a beautifully filmed piece that made me laugh and cry when the vulnerability of the characters invited me in his predicamant. There was a farce attitude about this work with touches of innocent wonder tones. Fanat√°stica
