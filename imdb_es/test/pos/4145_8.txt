If the film has to do with vision and real life, this film is quite perfect: NUOVOMONDO talks about immigration in the US. UU from Italy at the beginning of the '900, but also speaks for now, when emigration / immigration continues to be a central issue. <br /> <br /> It is not rich to be a visionary movie. <br /> <br /> Acting at an extra level, Charlotte Gainsbourg is a star. A good challenge for the 2007 Academy Award <br /> <br /> After Crialese's first attempt, "Respiro", an emotional but too intellectual film, this one has learned the lesson of Fellini and Taviani, to name only two Italian masters. <Br /> <br /> The plot is to argue, to direct with precision, perhaps a little less melodrama would be more effective. <br /> <br /> If RETURN (challenging for the Academy Award next year) of Almodovar is a mature film of a Always brilliant director, NUOVOMONDO deserves it more, due to his good effort to be a European film for the American scene. <br /> <br /> And this is it!
