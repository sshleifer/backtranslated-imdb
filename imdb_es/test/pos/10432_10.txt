This is absolutely the best movie I've seen in my life. At the age of 12 I got up late and found the movie. It was on the United States channel, Gilbert Godfrey's Up All Night. I will never forget. At that time, my friends and I were really struggling with different problems, some sexual. You know that 12 is a very rough and strange age. It seems that you are caught between being a girl and being a girl. This movie really helped me answer many questions. Now I have a daughter who is 12. I've been looking for a couple of years for this movie. If it ever comes out on DVD, it would be the first to buy. I would recommend any parent to see this with their child when they reach that difficult and difficult age.
