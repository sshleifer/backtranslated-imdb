The 221 episodes of "The Lone Ranger" were originally aired on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years they played in local syndication. During most of the original broadcast years, the series was the most watched piece of ABC programming. <br /> <br /> The new Pop Flix DVD set contains the first 16 episodes (September 15-December 29, 1949) and, for some reason, episode 22 of the fifth season, for a total of 17 episodes (the same 17 available in the Mill Creek Entertainment version of last year, so they are probably in the public domain). These sets practically make the movie "The Legend of the Lone Ranger" superfluous, since the three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the film are included in these releases. <br /> <br /> The first episodes go back to the radio, since it uses considerably more narrations of voice-overs as an introduction and to introduce key moments of the plot. <br /> <br /> The series itself was a pure western for children with clear and good distinctions, and without romance. The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started with the Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide the background of his transformation to the status of Lone Ranger, his association with the Indian Silly (Jay Silverheels) and the domestication of his horse "Silver". <br /> <br /> There is an unmistakable code of positive morality that infuses each episode. The Lone Ranger is totally good, but adopts the appearance of evil. While good citizens usually feared a masked man in the west and distrusted the Indians, those who would do evil fear the lone ranger. A persistent theme is that when Lone Ranger and Tonto meet an average citizen for the first time, they are met with suspicion, and at the end of the episode, the citizen has been convinced of its value. The end of the brand was a secondary character who asked the question: "Who was that masked man?" <br /> <br /> To truly enjoy the series, you must accept it for the simplistic morality it purported to be. If you do not take it seriously and still want some self-reflexive parody elements, you will only be frustrated. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
