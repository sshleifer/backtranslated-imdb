This was an interesting movie. I could have done it without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWW! Apart from that, I loved the music that hit the head in this movie. Chris / Izzy's parents are AWESOME! They fully support the interests of their children and believe in him enough to support him, now that is AWESOME! What really surprised me was the realization of Chris at the end. It was not exactly the end of "Hollywood" on its way to self-discovery. The general rise to stardom and its fall was a great roller coaster.
