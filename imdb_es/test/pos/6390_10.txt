It gives the boy / girl the opportunity to be on television singing as their favorite stars. <br /> <br /> In most cases, they sound like the singer they should play. <br /> <br /> Another twist: a team of makeup artists and clients dress the contestant like that singer. They may not look like them, but the likelihood that someone who looks like a person who looks exactly the same is very thin. <br /> <br /> It's very fun for your Saturday night, and the participants are not. Try with the aspirants as if they were in another program of television singing. The fact that there are no prizes involved and that it is for fun means that it will attract a different type of person. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is with the children's version: it seems that they have done the round of stage schools, what happened to normal children?
