I saw this movie more than 20 years ago and I still remember how much I loved it. It really touched me, and I really enjoyed Noel Coward's work on him. Highly recommended: atmospheric and moving. <br /> <br /> I think about this movie from time to time, and I am disappointed that I have not enjoyed a rebirth as much as many classic films. I had not realized until I looked it up today that it won a prize from the academy for the best original story by Ben Hecht and Charles Macarthur. that. He dies, but redemption is allowed if he can convince someone to shed a tear on him. most of the films show it in the pursuit of this goal. well written and charming I had known him for his works, so I was surprised to see him in this role on television one night in New York. A must see if you ever have the chance.
