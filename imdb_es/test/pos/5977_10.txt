Even if Voskhozhdeniye was your favorite movie, it would only be possible to watch it, at the most, every ten years. It is too emotionally exhausting. Considered the best film by Shepitko, THE ASCENT is the story of partisans operating in the Belarusian forest in the middle of winter in the occupied German Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> While they attack the audience with pure physicality of the wartime experience, particularly the deprivations of cold and snow, the real struggle for survival against nature and the fascists, there is always a subtext of subtle moral judgment, barely inferred, and the question about whether a man can be. Morales or immoral in one context, but otherwise in another. <br /> <br /> A party group hiding in the forest is attacked by a German patrol and loses its food supplies. Two men, Rybak, who knows the area, and Sotnikov, a Jewish school teacher, are assigned the task of going to a small town to eat. They find the village burned on the ground with nothing edible and nothing but charred beams and foundations in which in a cubicle there is a hidden children's mirror. The overwhelming feeling is that who brings the brutality of war to a land and a town becomes truly cursed. I thought about the war that the Americans and the British brought to Iraq and how to bring the horrors of war to the people is the act of a degenerate nation. <br /> <br /> The two move to a larger nearby village where they obtain, under duress, a lamb from the collaborating chief. The Germans arrive and the two partisans escape under fire. Sotnikov is hit on his foot and stays away from the German when Rybak escapes with the lamb. Sotnikov becomes so desperate that, prepared not to be taken alive, he takes off his boot to put a bullet in the head. At that moment, Rybak returns and drags Sotnikov out of the line of fire. <br /> <br /> Rybak drags Sotnikov through the forest, bloody meter by meter, all in one shot. Each meter is an agony, and yet it still drags it through the deep snow, the ridges, the depressions, the stumps of black bushes that crack when they break under the weight of men. Here there are several similarities with Tarkowsky's cinematic vocabulary: the long duration of the documentation of a process, the effect of the use of repetition and the resulting emotional stress that accumulates the longer the shot is prolonged. In the background, unnoticed by the action, hangs a question: Did Rybak commit an immoral act when returning for Sotnikov? Either under the moral standards of Marxism-Leninism or simply the common imperative of group survival, was it not their duty to return food to their hungry gang and leave Sotnikov to cover their escape? Sacrifice a man so that the group survives? What leads to the question: can one expect a man who is immoral under a philosophical system to be moral under a different moral system? Partisans arrive as a new curse of war on a farm that contains a woman with three small children. She is embittered by the scourge of war and barely with her three children. They barely rest when more Germans appear. They make their way to leave and go to the loft to hide. <br /> <br /> Sotnikov's cough drives them away. When a German pokes his head to look and no one responds, he threatens to shoot through the attic and Rybak's nerves break and are captured. Now, who has the moral responsibility here? Sotnikov for coughing or Rybek for cracking? The two partisans and the mother are tied and taken to a nearby city sinisterly passing under a wrought iron arch in the entrance. They find the boss and a little girl already in custody. They are interrogated by a Belarusian cover interpreted by Tarkowsky's favorite, Anatoli Solonitsyn. Sotnikov keeps his head during interrogation and torture and only asks what was the pre-war profession of the interrogator. He does not respond, but because of his ease in standing behind a desk, the likely answer was "school teacher". <br /> <br /> Rybak, on the other hand, begs for his life and even offers to join the police. The previously unnoticed character flaw, which takes a "wrong" moral decision, the ambiguity (sentimentality) of the one who disguised it from the judgment, now becomes obvious, disturbing and very ugly. <br /> <br /> The five sit in a dark cell. All of them are scheduled to die the next day. From here the elements of a Christian parable become stronger. The lighting and the genuine compositions of Rembrandt are used as other ancient poses of Christ represented. He decides that he can save everyone if he assumes everyone's fault. He must stay alive until the morning to be able to save everyone. He apologizes to the mother and the boss knows that what is happening does not feel so desperate to die uselessly as before. <br /> <br /> Morning is here. The Germans do not care if Sotnikov assumes all the sins of his companions or not. All of them will be hung. They walk down a very steep street that is a virtual Via Dolorosa. A bank is taken to the execution site, which is the gateway to the city. Five ropes hang from it. The bank only has three, so Sotnikov stands on a tree stump that Rybak kicks out from under him. All are hanging. <br /> <br /> When Rybak descends on the road with the Germans, someone in the crowd calls him Judas, an unnecessary allusion, the only false step of Shepitko. Rybak imagines several times that he is shot in the back trying to escape, dying for an honorable death and tries, unsuccessfully, to hang himself in the soldiers' house, but leaves with the Germans like the beaten dog he is. However, if Rybak was morally correct to return and save Sotnikov's life, is he wrong to try to save his own life?
