Ok, when I rented this several years ago I had the worst expectations. Yes, the performance is not excellent, and the image itself seems outdated, but when I sat there, something strange happened. I started to like. The action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump. Brion James, perhaps one of the best B-grade actors with Bruce Campbell, is great as always. The story is not bad either. Now I would not rush to buy it, but you will not waste your time at least seeing this good b-grade apocalyptic western.
