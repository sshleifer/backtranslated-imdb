I have seen a lot of television in my 51 years, but I had never had so much fun week after week, as I had seen Oz. The performance of the entire cast was excellent. The writing was simply perfect, and all the characters remained consistent over six years. I also enjoyed the chaos and the ultra violence. It may sound strange, but sometimes it was funny to discover how one of the characters would end up dead. I particularly enjoyed the true romance and love between Beecher and Keller. Those two men really knew how to tear down, in every possible way. I really hope that HBO continues to show us repeats of this great show FOREVER! I've seen all the episodes at least 4 times, but I still look forward to Tuesday and Thursday nights at 11 p.m. For an episode of this fun and very entertaining show.
