He was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at the Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and it was such a lovely movie. It was filmed very well in India and now I want to go there. The main actor ... Vijay was absolutely amazing. It was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Mononon Wedding. He was the star of the show. The character of Benoit broke me ... it was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was also great. Everyone was great! There were many tremendous scenes like that of the monkeys. And I basically loved the movie. All those who came out were enthusiastic and it was undoubtedly a highlight of the film festival. It was my favorite of the festival. It really captured the vivacity of India beautifully and I can not believe how beautiful India is. The feeling when leaving the cinema ... was really high. It's a lovely movie, happy. I loved!!
