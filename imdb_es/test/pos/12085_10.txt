I saw this movie a long time ago, but it remains in my memory as the saddest movie in history. I cried without stopping. My mother will never see this movie again because it is almost painful to watch her. Anyway, aside from that, the story is not exactly complex ... Ann Margaret is dying and has to give away her 10 (?) Children. As if that was not bad enough, it's during the depression and she has to separate the close brothers one by one. I suppose this was very sad for me because I am also from a very close family and could identify with the pain of each child for leaving their mother and siblings. <br /> <br /> Maybe I am a masochist, but I would like to see this movie again because it was well done and the end, surprisingly, is a bit happy (so we could at least smile and sob simultaneously). He should appear on television at some point so he can see him again.
