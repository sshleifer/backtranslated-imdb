Excellent cast, plot, performances. Totally credible I am aware of the united group that exemplifies the Marine Corps. But this movie brought fear to my heart. The Marines let the principles be condemned. It seems that this movie was based on real-life incidents. It shows how difficult it is to face the establishment. Anne Heche was absolutely convincing. The representation of Sam Shepard of a gung ho Marine was sober. And Eric Stoltz, as his lawyer, was so skilled that he balanced his loyalty to the Corp, but also his loyalty to his client, while he was up on his tightrope. He knew what his true course of action was. But it was set apart by its immersion in the marine tradition, loyalty to the Body above all. I sat nailed to the TV screen. All in all, I give this a resounding 9 of 10.
