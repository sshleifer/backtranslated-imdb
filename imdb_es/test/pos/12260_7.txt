BROADCAST NEWS opens with a series of short vignettes that are a smart way to start a story about TV presenters who have no idea what they are reporting. <br /> <br /> In a speech before a group of people - Be reporters, all bored by their presentation, most leave. When the last one comes out, the co-presenter of the event says in a low voice to HOLLY HUNTER: "I do not think there are any questions and answers". Subtle line in a brilliantly written low-key comedy, a farce about the business aspect of television. <br /> <br /> WILLIAM HURT is the inept news anchor who is working with HOLLY HUNTER as the host of the network. Hurt needs a lot of help in corrective reports and Holly refuses to catch the bait, at first. He knows that he is only capable of looking good, but he is not a reporter. It shows that it is a quick study, as long as your headset is working and you get all the direct information from the executive producer Hunter. <br /> <br /> Holly's other host presenter (ALBERT BROOKS) helps by providing the information she transmits. hurt. Of course, he is in conflict over his feelings for reporter Brooks and the equally strong attraction for Hurt's presenter, who has his own alliance with a staff member. <br /> <br /> You have to wait up to twenty minutes. before the movie ends to find out which man he will end up with. Brooks tells her that Hurt is wrong because it represents everything she is against. In this unpredictable comedy, there is no way to know who Hunter will end up with (the neurotic heroine). <br /> <br /> Appropriately, HOLLY HUNTER, WILLIAM HURT and ALBERT BROOKS were nominated for the Oscars (Brooks in the supporting role), as well as the film itself and the director / writer James L. Brooks. In total, seven deserved Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> The script does not opt ​​for a conventional happy ending, and, in this case, that is the only flaw for the brilliant script. I felt cheated and somewhat disappointed by the melancholic conclusion.
