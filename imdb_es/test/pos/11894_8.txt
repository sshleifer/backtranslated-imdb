I saw the movie and I am very pleased to see a film so different in character and history from the stupid and major American productions. It is a film with an interesting background for both young people and all age groups. Contrary to certain reviews, the audience seems to divide my evaluation, since the film is very successful wherever it is exploited all over the world. For example, in the Netherlands, number 3 was classified. Negative statements must be respected, but one must expect such statements to be guided based on the facts. If you have the opportunity to see the movie and enjoy it.
