The "good news" is that the circus is in the city. The "bad news" is that it is right over the underground house of Bugs Bunny. He wakes up when his place trembles like an earthquake hits him, when the workers hit the stakes in the ground and the elephants go stomping, etc. <br /> <br /> To be more specific, the lion cage is exactly over Bugs' hole. The lion smells the food, and by the process of elimination, he realizes that it is a rabbit. The bugs, curious what this whole racket is about, meander through the tunnel and end up in the lion's mouth. <br /> <br /> I'll say it for BB: he's totally intrepid, at least in this. Cartoon, and at least for 30 seconds. When it reaches his senses, he runs like crazy and we have a lion battle against a rabbit the rest of the way. Once again, Bugs faces a foolish opponent, one he calls "Nero", but the lion is ferocious and Bugs will need all his wits and a little false courage to defend himself against this beast. <br /> <br /> Approximately half of the gags are stupid and the other half funny, but always fast, colorful and good enough to recommend it. I mean, not every day you can see a lion in a trapeze, or doing a hula dance!
