Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film that describes an era full of different emotions and characters, as seen through the eyes of a child. The film clearly supports "it takes a village to raise a child" and recalls an important moment in black history and culture. I won an incredible amount of respect for Macy Gray as an actress. His character was a little crazy, but adorable; Clearly we have all met someone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic like Nanny. I never realized that Epatha was a great actress. Law & Order never showed the depth of Epatha's acting skills as Lackawanna Blues. I was pleasantly surprised and surprised! The music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood ... it was a nostalgic and sweet stroll along the path of memories. I really enjoyed the movie and I am looking forward to the release of the DVD to add to my collection.
