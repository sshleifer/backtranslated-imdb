Over the years, it seemed that I had missed this picture of Ronald Reagan, and because of his recent move to the big screen in the sky, it was recently aired on television. This is a great low budget black and white movie from the late 1930s, however, it is very interesting to see how criminals used their talents to steal money from insurance companies with false claims during this particular time period . I was surprised by the role of Ronald Reagan, (Eric Gregg), "The Killer's, '64, played in this photo, along with a great veteran movie star, Sheila Bromley, (Nona Gregg)," Nightmare Circus ", '73, He was a great supporting actor, it was a great movie that showed Ronald Reagan as a very young man who was looking for the stars in his career in Hollywood at the time, God bless him!
