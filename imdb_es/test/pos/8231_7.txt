This is a modest, unassuming traditional Westerner with a formulable plot about the opposition between ranchers and crop farmers around the city of Liberal, Kansas. The story is essentially routine and presents several of the classic Western conflicts. There is a farmer against a rancher; there is a clash between cultivated land and "civilizing" tendencies, on the one hand, and the spirit of the desert / border, on the other, and what this ultimately represents is the opposition of two value systems: democratic values and established community in front of the rude individualism. /> <br /> Randolph Scott plays the legendary lawman Bat Masterton who turns to Liberal at the behest of an agent of the land (Robert Ryan) to help him solve the bad guys who are heavy drinkers and fighters. The two men fight but meet to address the problematic elements of the city. <br /> <br /> The script is clich√©, but the action is strongly driven by director Ray Enright and there are solid performances throughout. In addition to the harsh performances of the male leaders, there is a comic relief provided by George Gabby Hayes, an oily villain well played by Steve Brodie and attractive contributions from Maggie Meredith as a primordial and appropriate Easterner courted by Ryan and Anne Jeffreys as a singing salon As long as I do not make a prize for originality, this is good entertainment for lovers of the West.
