In the world of "shorts" (most of which are not), this movie is a gem. <br /> <br /> A calm and concise look at the world of a young woman who is a reader of a blind woman. Here, the star Elizabeth Franz: this film contains the textures, layers and visual narrations of a sumptuously painted still life. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is minimal, the cinematography is impressive and the direction is safe, clear and convincing. I saw this film at a film festival held in a noisy and crowded Tribeca bar, and in the first two minutes (and for the first time that night), the crowd fell silent. <br /> <br /> That says it all. .
