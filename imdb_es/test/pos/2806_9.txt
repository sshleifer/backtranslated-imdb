I have to say that this film was excellently produced and heads the ratings as a typical science fiction movie! I enjoyed it ... it's a science fiction movie, if you want a thriller watch another channel ... This is what science fiction lovers want. Excellent production by one of the best science fiction producers Scot Vandiver. OK, the special effects were not excellent, but what a great cast! You could have used a little more money for the effects, but again, science fiction has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you do not like this kind of movies. Movies like Mission Impossible and Braveheart are great, but they are not science fiction movies. Science fiction produces excellent films like Sabretooth, Alien Hunters, etc. done .. keep them beating!
