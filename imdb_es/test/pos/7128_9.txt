This innovative film is truly a work of art. I entered the screening at the convention in Indiana with very few expectations, I had already seen 2 other films with "player" in the title (both were so bad that at the end of the second I had released one of my works). my own eyes with my straw and a twisted paper clip that I found between the seat cushions). But from the opening credits "Dorkness" I had. The tempered environment of the Northwest made a beautiful backdrop for the drama surrounding the frustrated game master, Lodge (powerfully played by Nathan Rice) and his maladjusted band of friends who reserve the real-life dramas they face every day to face fantastic dramas at the lodge. provides for them After the first scene (set in the fantasy world in which they live), they are violently pushed back into the world and try to escape desperately. This caused so many comparisons with my own life that I was moved to tears. Rice's performance is such an incredible caliber that I really believed in the first 20 minutes of the film that it was really a man in his twenties who was suffering from frustration, male pattern baldness and an annoying group of "friends" who do not seem to can understand Concepts such as good and evil. Lodge's friends are of some importance here: Leo, the oldest and heaviest trio, seems to be the only other character with a job, apart from Lodge. However, it seems to gravitate socially to Gary, the youngest of the group. This seems only a little strange at first until you realize that Gary is, in fact, a sexually confused sociopath with very few possibilities outside his "fantasy" world. This dichotomy serves, not to confuse, but to inform and raise the audience about the importance of diversity in our society. My only complaint about this is that the actors who play Leo (Scott C. Brown) and Gary (Christian Doyle) seem to play the characters to laugh sometimes, as if they were informed that they were acting in a comedy instead of a HDD. Act of action / drama. Speaking of action, Brian Lewis makes his film debut as Cass, the third and most influential member of the varied Lodge team. the tension is always high when he is on the screen, both when he is passionately arguing about his beliefs about Lodge or when he shows off his fantastic martial arts skills as "Silence" of his fantasy character. Or even when he turns around suddenly to look at the audience and plunges reflexively into the audience to not be hit by his fantastic chin. Lewis illuminates the screen no matter what he is doing and I hope to see more of him in the future. Once the action starts in this movie, it just does not stop. drama and action combine so perfectly in moments that you can tell whether you are in the middle of a frantic action sequence or a moving dramatic moment. Really an exciting trip of epic proportions, I would recommend "The Gamers: Dorkness Rising", since a visualization is required for anyone who loves cinema. It was almost worth losing an eye on top. <br /> <br /> ~ Chip Deedlenick
