This movie caught me by surprise. For years I have avoided many of the sound images of Harold Lloyd (as well as those of Keaton) because they have a well-deserved reputation for being dreadful compared to silent films because the basic formula has been lost. However, when I saw this movie, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I really liked it, ... once I accepted that it was not really a "Harold Lloyd" movie (even though he starred in it). This is because, although it does not look anything like the style of his previous films, it is VERY original and Lloyd is not misinterpreting a completely different type of character. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, the formula of The old movies are almost completely gone here. Lloyd does not do the old family trick, the romance is very different from his first screen romances, and the plot is just weird! Instead of the usual roles, he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to the United States for the first time since he was a small child. Because of this, although he looks like an American (except for his white suit and the explorer's helmet), he thinks and looks a lot like someone who is Chinese. In many ways, he is very naive about the United States and is like an innocent among the wolves. At first, meet a man who happens to be a head of a local party. This boss ALWAYS produces a losing candidate for the mayoral race, because the corrupt mayor buys it and pays him to produce a "symbolic" candidate who DOES NOT HAVE THE POSSIBILITY to win. Well, the old man they traditionally directed for the job just died and he decides to take over the naive Lloyd. You do not have a prayer to win! Well, the unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins !!! This, and Lloyd's decision to clean up the city greatly disrupts the old political machine and stop at nothing to destroy Lloyd. Just when it seems that Lloyd is headed to jail for a falsified corruption charge, he creates a scheme that is 100% impossible and very illegal to obtain signed confessions from the scammers. However, despite this, it is incredibly fun and a great ending. So, my advice is in the end, just suspend disbelief and enjoy. <br /> <br /> An important note: this movie is definitely NOT politically correct. The word "Chink" is used repeatedly. I found it offensive, but considering the times, I ignored it as you should also. However, if you are someone who CAN NOT and you like to be angry, I suggest you never watch movies anyway, since you will be offended again and again.
