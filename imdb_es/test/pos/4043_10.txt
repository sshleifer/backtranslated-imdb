Charming. The best time to see this movie is at some point when it is sad or sad. Everything is so cute, everything, even the way the white bear loves the Queen secretly and in the end he gets it, also the achievement that the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. His music is also very beautiful. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very moving result and if you look at both parts at once, you will see that the Snow Queen is not so bad. She just tries to surround herself with love in the wrong way. The night this movie was here (first part) I only saw it because it was boring, but I loved it much more later and I got very angry when they did not show the next part because of the Pope's funeral. Yes, that was terribly sad for me. But when they said it would be next week, I was so happy, I recorded it and now I'm glad I did it.
