The Ascent (1977) <br /> <br /> Larisa Shepitko is a name that very few are familiar with. His brilliant career as a director lasted only a decade, and ended abruptly in a tragic car accident. Despite his short career, however, he managed to create some of the best Soviet films of his time. His latest film, The Ascent, is considered one of the best Soviet films of the seventies. However, his work remained in the dark over the years that followed, usually only available in rare and poor copies on video. That has changed thanks to the people of Criterion. They released two of Shepitko's best works through his Eclipse department: Wings, and his penultimate masterpiece, The Ascent. land in search of food after his party is attacked by Nazi patrols. Originally they are only to go to a nearby farm, but when they arrive, the Germans find it devastated. Not wanting to return empty-handed, they continue deeper into enemy territory. On the way, they must face not only the enemy soldiers, but the harsh conditions of the Russian plains, the possible betrayal and their own souls. <br /> <br /> The film is not framed in simplistic devices or plot destinations. Address difficult issues with painful rationality. Never take the easy way or give us comforting answers. The second half of the movie is full of moral dilemmas. Shepitko shows us the intimate horrors of war through the internal conflict between the other Russians, those who collaborated and those who defended themselves. While it shows collaborators as clear heels, it also shows why many resorted to such tactics: survival. <br /> <br /> The film contains a series of religious references, in particular for the period leading up to the crucifixion. This is a spiritual journey, towards the hearts, souls and minds of the two partisans and those with whom they meet. Shepitko and his director of photography capture the trip in a beautiful black and white photograph. The camera moves in long shots, similar to the camera work of another of the best Russian filmmakers, Andrei Tarkovsky. Shepitko, like many others, was clearly influenced by Tarkovsky's style, and the Ascent takes some of his rhythmic notes from Ivan's childhood. It's an amazing movie in sight and does a fantastic job of capturing the cold and terrifying atmosphere of occupied Russia. <br /> <br /> Shepitko's husband would pay tribute to his great movie a decade later. Elem Klimov made his own masterpiece of war with one of the best movies I've seen: Come and See. The history and themes of that film were clearly influenced by The Ascent. Although that film is also quite dark, it received much more attention than any of Shechtko's films. However, that served as a bridge for Shepitko and has been one of the best aids to keep his work alive. <br /> <br /> The Ascent is a truly magnificent film, and it must rightly be considered one of the best films of the 70s. It is impressive the cinematography is inspiring; his mood is terribly authentic; And his lessons are unforgettable. It is, in any definition of the word, nothing less than a masterpiece. How unfortunate that Shepitko's career was interrupted just as it was peaking.
