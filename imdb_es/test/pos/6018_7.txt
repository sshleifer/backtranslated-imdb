"Gypsy" is possibly the best musical ever written, so it's a shame that his film version has been so disappointing. To compensate for that, we have this new version that, if it is not impeccable, is a pleasant and well-made adaptation of the musical. The script is completely accurate, all songs included, and the staging remains close to the original staging by Jerome Robbins. Bette Midler is an excellent choice for Rose, her singing and Merman-esquire personality, and her splendid performance. Peter Reigert is an excellent Herby, if not a great singer, and Cynthia Gibb is a simple and natural Louise. In truth, a live recording of the 1989 resurgence with Tyne Daly might have been a better idea, if only because "Gypsy" is simply more exciting on stage, but this movie is a good translation of a great musical.
