Danton was a hero and one of the founders of the French Revolution of 1789. This film takes place five years later and the revolution has turned into something ugly. While initially the revolution promised freedom, at this point the small committee that administers the country is extremely repressive and is a dictatorship. Danton and his friends were angry about the way the country was not better in 1794 than BEFORE getting rid of their king, so they start criticizing the government. The film begins when the printer who makes critical brochures about the government is hit and his business is destroyed. So much for "freedom, equality and fraternity"! Then, as a result of having been silenced in this way, Danton and others begin to publicly criticize the government. Finally, Robespierre (the committee leader) and his friends invent charges, have a trial trial and get rid of dissent. Some have mentioned that the Polish director, Wajda, also intended that this be a criticism of his own nation, which, at that time, was dominated by the Soviets and also very repressive. This makes sense when he sees the movie unfolding, especially when the government destroys all dissent "on behalf of the people." <br /> <br /> The acting is fine, the story is convincing and I do not have an important critique of the movie. However, I really wish the end was handled differently. Especially because apart from history and French lovers, it is most likely that they have no idea that this execution helped to end the government. AFTER this purge of Danton in April 1794, Robespierre himself was executed in July 1794 because the country had just had enough, and in addition, the French survivors knew that they too would face the guillotine later or later if this disease system was still standing. . Some kind of epilogue would have been good, like showing the soldiers who came for Robespierre. He responded by attempting suicide first, but only managed to remove a part of his face; still alive, he was guillotined shortly after. This would have been a small dandy epilogue and could have been done in about five minutes. However, not showing a connection between the death of Danton and the fall of the government is something strange to omit.
