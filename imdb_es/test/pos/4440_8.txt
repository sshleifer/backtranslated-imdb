My impression, after having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before making the film. <br /> <br /> It took five years to do it, a work of love and longing. I can only imagine the agitation of the editing process, what to leave, what to take out. <br /> <br /> His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn, is presented as a man too selfish and egocentric to be emotionally available to one wife, not just three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were haunted by distance and fascinated by creativity. <br /> <br /> One of her lovers said it was "accessible" but that is never explored. Other comments from people who knew him well suffer the same fate. A shame <br /> <br /> The tension between the three half brothers in the room of a house that Louis designed is also palpable. The unsaid looms over the conversation. The only traces his father left were in the buildings he left behind, some great, others not so much. <br /> <br /> I was captivated by the musical ship and the Salk Institute. Sad for the new-born mothers who were trapped forever by their insensible impregnations, never more exemplified than what she told the director's mother when she was informed of her pregnancy: "Not again!" <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, beautifully filmed, genuine. <br /> <br /> It appears, in this case at least, the son is not the father of the man.
