The Thing by John Carpenter is unquestionably the best horror film ever made. Not only that, but it is also one of my favorite personal movies of all time. What makes the movie so big? It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions when everything seems to fit. The film is even superior to Alien in creating a kind of atmospheric hell of a bad mood. The fact that it is not just the gore (which is wonderful by the way), but that is capable of creating a paranoia that is unparalleled in the movies. A truly wonderful movie that is adored by all horror fans, and anyone who has good taste in movies.
