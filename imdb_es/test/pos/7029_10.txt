<br /> <br /> When this movie premiered, I dismissed it as light pop nonsense. That was a mistake. <br /> <br /> After watching repeatedly and watching a documentary about the realization of DIRTY DANCING, discovering the depth of this film undoubtedly increases its appeal. <br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING is a film about change. The evolutionary nature of the relationships within the family, the changes in vision that the world of the world has during its coming of age, etc. The story takes place during August 1963, the last weeks of the last summer of innocence for the American people. The many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in American society that would be marked by the murders of Kennedy and Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Movie fans loved this movie and repeated trips to movie theaters. It is the most successful dance film in the world. As a man, I find it very difficult to accept the romantic partner of the great stallion Patrick Swayze with the simple Jennifer Gray. This would be fatal to most romantic dramas, and may also have created the intense aversion expressed by most male critics. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film found the state # 1 before the release of the movie. Until today it is almost impossible to attend a wedding without listening to a DIRTY DANCING song. <br /> <br /> Near the middle point of the movie, Baby's mother wakes up and asks Baby's father: "Is there a problem?" <Br /> <br /> The father of the baby, the family member against the change, tries to keep everything that is happening secret. He tells his wife to go back to sleep. However, resist as you can, the change is unstoppable. DIRTY DANCING is the story of a person who wakes up just in the final moments of the last dream of our country in innocence.
