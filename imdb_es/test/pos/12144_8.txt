Abel Davos (Lino Ventura), career criminal and crime boss, has been fleeing for more than 10 years, hiding in Milan, Italy. In his absence, he was sentenced to death in his home country, France, for his crimes. Disillusioned with his life in Italy and with the police approaching him, he decides to return to his old land in Paris. After sending his wife Teresa and their two young children to Nice, Abel and his next in command, Raymond Naldi, carry out a final robbery to finance their new lives in France. The theft offers half a million francs, much less than their sources had suggested, despite this and with the police in their pursuit, both arrived in Nice, where they briefly hid. After stealing a pleasure boat from a local, they try to get to San Remo, a tourist place where they will mix more easily, but the armed customs officers stop them on a deserted beach, there is a shooting and Therese and Naldi are both killed The police will easily detect a Davos now wounded with two children in tow, so he calls his old friends in Paris to send him help, but they have moved on since his old friend hid and are not too willing to accept They risk themselves, so they send the thief, Eric Stark (Jean Paul Belmondo) to rescue him. Davos is disgusted that such a humble thief is sent to his aid, despite the fact that he immediately gets angry with the charming Stark, goes out to discover why they have rejected him, but his betrayal does not stop there. <Br /> <br /> Classe Tous Risques (also known as Big Risk) was written for the screen by the ex-convict sentenced to death and the criminal writer Jose Giovanni (Le Trou, Le Clan des Siciliens), with Ventura already at board for the project, Giovanniwanted Ventura, who was someone unique to directing the project, suggested an assistant director who had drawn his attention in a previous project, Claude Sautet, better known at that time for helping Georges Franju in Les Yeux sans Visage . Sautet accepted immediately and the rest as they say is history. Sautet created an excellent gangster movie, which relies heavily on characters and relationships. Davos, who hides constantly, has a lot of time to reflect on his life, past, present and future, his friendships that no longer seem to be what he thought they were, his now deceased wife and what will happen to his two small children. Ventura as a character actor has always surprised me, being comfortable and convincing both in the police and in the criminal fraternity, here his tired performance of the world is sublime and powerful as his world crumbles around him, as the loneliness and loneliness of a man in the world. Execute Ventura's old profession as a professional wrestler becomes very useful when he throws the Parisian thugs with consummate ease. Belmondo as Stark animates the other story within the film, that of his budding relationship with a girl he meets on the road trip. With his frank spell, the fact that he approaches this woman in danger of him being no more than a "Voleur" and that "the only good thing about me is my left" when he hits his aggressor, it is also a pleasure to contemplate , since she falls in love with him anyway. Belmondo's performance was overlooked at that time, since A bout de Souffl√© by Godard was released just three weeks ago, and Godard got the credit for discovering the new kid on the block, his versatility within these two films, being there for all to see and admire. The Sautet film is a class affair, with many attractive locations, the film also has a very sparse dialogue, Sautet prefers to let the actors do the work with a simple look or enough looks to promote the story, needles to say that this Noir fan Check out more of Sautet's work in the future.
