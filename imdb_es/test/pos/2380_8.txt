Monster of Mexico I agree that it is the weakest of the modern films of Scooby Doo, mainly due to the weak plot and how predictable everything was. However, the Loch Ness Monster is a considerable improvement, with a magnificent animation, honestly, Scotland looked beautiful. The music is good, and the plot is well thought out. In addition, there is a great dialogue and the voice acting was fabulous, with Casey Kasem a constant delight as Shaggy, and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena Easten was a pleasant surprise in a guest starring role. In fact, my only complaints were some strange accents in one or two members of the vocal cast, with the exception of Easten whose accent sounded genuine, and somehow the Loch Ness Monster was not as well designed as it had the potential to be. In general, a solid and enjoyable movie by Scooby Doo. 8/10 Bethany Cox
