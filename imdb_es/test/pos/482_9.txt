There are times when I am convinced that Mikado is the best opera of Sullivan and Gilbert, but that is only as long as I do not listen to Iolanthe. Be that as it may, El Mikado is probably the most frequently filmed of the Savoyard Operas. (Yes, first I put the composer in. No one says Hammerstein and Rodgers, or Hart and Rodgers, or Boito and Verdi, or What's-His-Face and Strauss.) You do not even hear the names of librettists from Offenbach, Suppe or Balfe. The biggest name (and the biggest ego) at that time, so they put their name first It's time for the stupid practice to rest. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the Mikado is a complete one. Operetta S & G has some of Sullivan's most appealing numbers, combined with some of Gilbert's cleverest lyrics, an interesting book and a cheerful dialogue, a wonderful degree of madness, and leaves the door open for a sophisticated wardrobe. capricious. <br /> <br /> This particular production, filmed in a live performance in 1990, spins his imagination towards a surprising simplicity.Located in a British seaside resort towards the end of the Art Nouveau period, it is projected completely in the Japanese of l The result is the costumes and ambience in a mixture of white, gray and black ocular caresses, accented by occasional fragments of red (and less frequent uses of yellow and green). It takes some time to get used to, but it's really elegant. Of course, when the chorus tells you that they are gentlemen of Japan, you have the right to exclaim: "Oh, pooh, Bah!" (Did I just say that?) It is very gratifying that this good production is now on DVD. However, a warning: the impression seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity, so that the expected sharpness of the image softens and becomes slightly blurred. The tendency to superimpose images is, unfortunately, annoying. Why do people who are doing a really elegant production want to ruin it with things of that kind? But it is performance that counts most. We can omit the overture, because although one is made, Sullivan never wrote one. (It is true that he may not have written any for any of the Savoys, but Mikado's overture does not even date from Sullivan's life and was compiled by observing the techniques used in others). As for the rest of the operetta, it is first class and extremely fun. <br /> <br /> The Ko-Ko here is the esteemed Eric Idle, who credits him. There is a tradition of bringing a big name on paper. It was a television production in the United States years ago in which Groucho Marx played Ko-Ko with mixed results. Idle's performance is deliciously extravagant ... he does it "Taken from a county jail" assisted by a tennis racket. Your "I have a small list" is done as a speech to a microphone; Of course, it has the usual updated lyrics, which is much more fun than the usual execution of those things, and its delivery is positively hysterical. Keep it up all the time. <br /> <br /> In this operetta, it is important to have a good Katisha; It's not fun if they do not shout at you with style. This Mikado has a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer, on his way almost as a name as big as inactive. She screams with the best of them in a rich rich contralto ... wonderful, especially for a soprano. And his disguise ... !!! (Not to mention his recital with Franz Liszt, apparently, accompanying). Nanki-Poo is played by Bonaventura Bottone. I have trouble moving around, it's a chubby lack a bit non-nanki-pooish, but her voice is definitely a solid and rich addition to the vocal palette. There is a nice touch during "A Wand'ring Minstrel", where the chorus reacts with disgust at the mention of "your naive in the knee": note Mikado's decree about flirting. Be that as it may, Bottone is an excellent singing actor and if his appearance does not put the best face on Nanki-Poo, his performance does. <br /> <br /> Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and his friends They are appropriately pretty and stupid. She and Bottone make lovely duets. Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his character like a blageur and does it very well. Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of water ... a role that was later killed in American comedies (you know: arrogant butlers forced to care for spoiled children, that sort of thing). The Mikado (Richard Angas) is bloody, with an imperious voice in absolute discrepancy with his ridiculous lyrics. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend that you get this as your only Mikado. Also get a good traditional production, so you can see what Gilbert intended (more or less) in terms of staging. That said, I'll see it twice while I watch any traditional bit once. In general, this is an excellent offer, a vocal and visual delight, with a delicious performance. It's a DVD to treasure, with maids like dervishes, dance buttons and everything. Watch for buttons with signs.
