I just saw this again on channel 4 of the BBC. It is not Jane Austen's best novel, but the film is a reasonable interpretation. I suspect that the assembly halls in Bath would have been more crowded than shown; Maybe they could not afford the extras. Also, why is everyone shut up so that the dance partner can have an audible conversation? I've never heard anything that someone told me when I danced and I suspect it would have been the same in the 18/19 century in Bath. <br /> <br /> I can not believe the US UU / Revisions of Canada; They completely miss the ironic element that is in the film throughout. The "gothic" scenes are very well presented, but you must read them correctly. I'm sure Jane A would enjoy those reviews a little. A proposal of nothing, does anyone else think that Peter Firth can be more like Colin Baker (a former Doctor Who) or vice versa as they get older?
