If the legendary masterpiece of the road movie of Mount Hellman, "Two-Lane Blacktop", had become more like a piece of raw, naked, fiercely tense and melancholy and hardened embellished by that clearly means "nothing" clean, hard An Australian sexist mentality very raw and torn and topped with a generous dew of punk nihilism, desperate, without any hope that is the end of the road, no doubt would be very similar to this Nordic and somber knockout. br /> <br /> The factory worker of a nice guy Mike (a Serious Terry with disheveled and attractive looks) gets mad at the champion of the fascist automobile race Fox (a Richard Fant, who is very hateful) when he steals to Fox's model girlfriend, Julie (the lovely Deborah Conway) away from him. Mike and Fox begin to compete in increasingly lethal races, in which the stakes are getting higher with each successive bout, which eventually culminates in an all-or-nothing race especially beating with a single true winner allowed. Mike, assisted by his worried, but loyal Italian mechanic friend, Tony (a splendidly soft twist of Vangelis Mourikis) and tutored by a blind, supremely hip modern rebel oiler (wonderfully rehearsed with the utmost coldness of Max Cullen), puts his life on The line wins good for the sake of its reputation, the affection of its old woman, the money and, most importantly, for the possibility of knocking down the haughty Fox from his overwhelming and fulminating gaze. Directed with the utmost gravity and intensity by John Clark, written to perfection laconically by Barry Tomblim, with a score of Peter Crosbie's synthesizer and unadorned, unadorned, by David Gribble, this authentically gnarly item from the 80s presents the concept of racing cars is not only an alternative and funky lifestyle, but also an obsession and a reason to live devouring (this is the only thing that most movie characters love) with a remarkably clever and unblinking eye . Complete with a devastating and heartbreaking ending and a relentless central message about the bitter price one pays for being the best dog, this fascinating description of the existence rates of a dead end as an extraordinary cinematic achievement.
