As is often the case when Manga translates into live action, there is quite a loss in translation. However, this is still a very entertaining movie. The premise is unusual and is presented in the quiet and discreet style that prevails in Japanese movies (ha!). The special effects are a small camp from the 70s, but it adds to the comic sensation of the film. I would not recommend this movie to everyone, but if you are familiar (and enjoyed) with other Japanese horror movies like "Evil Dead's Trap", you will like this movie.
