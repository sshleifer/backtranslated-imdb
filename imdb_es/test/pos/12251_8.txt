This is a love story set against television news. The three main stars, William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks create a love triangle while working in the Washington Bureau of a television network. <br /> <br /> Tom Grunick (Hurt) is the handsome reporter who is being prepared for be a star.Jane (Hunter) is the producer who recognizes that Tom lacks the intellectual gravitas to be a true journalist, but he fall in love with him anyway. Aaron Altman (Brooks) is the man who shares his beliefs in journalistic standards. who really loves her <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, but lost to Cher (Moonstruck!). They robbed him! This is Hunter's movie. His character Jane is intelligent, ruthless and totally motivated. She is also hilariously neurotic. Its performance is perfect. Just look at your face when you see the recording of Tom's interview about a rape victim. The scales literally fall from their eyes. The performance of Wiliam Hurt is less striking. He plays a man who is well aware that he is a himbo and a fraud, but he is smart enough to know that his rise is facilitated by people like Jane. It gives little hints of a man who is extremely calculating. <br /> <br /> The film comments on celebrity, journalism, integrity and commercial pressures on the news in an environment that focuses on the bottom line. He predicted that the news would be reduced, that standards would be reduced slowly due to commercial pressures. <br /> <br /> Think about this: this film premiered before the end of the Cold War and before the emergence of reality television. However, he predicted the obstruction of the news. The release of the Paris prison was treated as important news! To see how prophetic this movie is, just look at its news of the night and look at the set, the graphics and the presenters. Tom Grunick and his clones are well and truly alive!
