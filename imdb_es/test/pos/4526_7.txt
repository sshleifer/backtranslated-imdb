"Murder Over New York" is an entertaining entry in the Charlie Chan movie series, but if you pay attention, many holes of the plot are revealed before the observer eye. While traveling to New York City for an annual police convention, Chan (Sidney Toler) meets with former Scotland Yard researcher Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock) on the same flight. Now employed by military intelligence, Drake traces Paul Narvo and his Indian servant, suspected of acts of sabotage around the world. Drake believes that by contacting Narvo's elusive wife, he can find out the whereabouts of the criminal. <br /> <br /> When Drake ends up dead in the library of George Kirby, president of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation. Charlie theorizes that he was killed by a recently discovered poisonous gas called "tetrogene", administered through a glass ball that releases the poison when it breaks. By summoning Kirby to gather all the guests of his dinner, Chan and Police Inspector Vance (Donald MacBride) question the assistants, since one of them can be the murderer. Among them are Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), a fellow of Drake's Oxford, the actress June Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown by Drake but who asked to attend, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), the chief designer of the company of Kirby aircraft, and Keith Jeffrey (John Sutton), the Kirby stockbroker. Kirby Butler Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also a suspect, especially after number # 2 Son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) catches him by opening a cablegram, whose content is related to Boggs himself. <br /> <br /> There are some other characters skillfully planted in the procedure as well. Ms. Narvo appears as Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver), and contrary to Drake's suspicion that she could take him to Narvo, she actually runs away from her ex-husband and from a disastrous marriage. She is involved with David Elliott (Robert Lowery), director of a chemical research company, and therefore a suspect in the angle of the tetrogene. <br /> <br /> As with many Chan films, racial comments should be taken calmly in the process. This one offers two dazzling ones. When they bring Kirby's black servant to interrogate him, he says he knows nothing about Drake's murder, that he is completely "in the dark". Chan's response: "The condition seems contagious." <br /> <br /> Later, following Inspector Vance's order to gather all the Hindus of New York, Jimmy Chan comments on his arrival with "Everyone is starting to look like me." Actually, the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the film, as Shemp Howard poses as a Hindu mystic "The Great Rashid", but is actually discovered by the police as the swindler Shorty McCoy. <br /> <br /> Before the film ends, two more victims fall into the clever Narvo: his confidante Ramullah and the aircraft tycoon Kirby himself. To discover the killer, Chan, in concert with Elliott, organizes a test flight aboard a newly developed TR4 Bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the previous day. Before he can release his deadly poison, Briton Fenton catches the capsule that falls into the air, revealing that he knew about the plant. Arrested and taken for questioning, Chan claims that Fenton is not Narvo. The real Narvo is revealed when he offers a cup of poisoned water to the nervous Fenton, eager to keep Narvo's secret. But Chan was smart enough to be wary of such an attempt, and reveals the real killer: Narvo now disguised as stockbroker Jeffrey, who underwent reconstructive surgery after a car accident. <br /> <br /> Now for the plot holes When investigating for the first time the murder of Hugh Drake, the police maintained that the fingerprints found in the library did not match those of any of the dinner guests. However, Jeffrey / Narvo was present at dinner. It had already been established that Drake had a visitor who was not part of the library, chemist Elliott. If the fingerprints did not really belong to Narvo, then making them a problem made no sense. <br /> <br /> Also, at the end of the movie, when Narvo offers Fenton the poisoned water, how did he think he would escape? With that with everyone as witnesses? But even better than that, how does a saboteur who travels the world like Narvo have the time and the means to establish himself as a stockbroker in New York City? It just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> For the trivia fans, some more points are worth mentioning. In the movie, Number # 2 Son Jimmy is a college student who studies chemistry when he attends "Pop's" to solve the case. In Chan's previous film, "Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum," Jimmy was a law student. <br /> <br /> The poisonous gas formula would be reworked in a later film by Chan, this time by Monogram with Roland Winters in The Role of Chan in "Docks of New Orleans". In that story, poisonous gas is released from similarly destroyed radio tubes to claim its victims.
