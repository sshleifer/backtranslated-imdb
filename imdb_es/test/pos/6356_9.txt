This movie is an excellent example of what an independent film can be. The director does an excellent job on the line between emotional and physical violence. But in the end, remember what so many indie movies forget: tell a good story. Seeing this movie, I remembered how timid and mundane Hollywood movies have become big-budget. <br /> <br /> Especially remarkable is an exceptionally strong performance by the protagonist of the film, Jorge CÃ³rdova. Like an evil villain (on his way to the top of the crime heap), Cordova plays a cunning, brutal, presumptuous, torturous and sordid, but it's so nice that it keeps you entertained all the time. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that these guys were part of the New Wave of Latino Filmmakers in Los Angeles, called La Nueva Obra, or something like that. Either way, this movie makes you expect to see more of your work. <br /> <br />
