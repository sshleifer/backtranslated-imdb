Most of the criticisms of "Attack of Show" come from people who are unfairly comparing it to an old TV show called "The Screen Savers". People are upset because G4 decided to cancel the "Screen Savers" and replace them with the "Attack of the show" based on pop culture. Comparing the two shows is like comparing apples with oranges! <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Show" is a unique one-hour program that covers the current culture of the X / Y Generation. It presents segments in films / television, discussion panels, video games, new DVD releases , advice on sex, new devices (MP3 players, cell phones, etc.), comics / graphic novels, magazines and Internet fashions. <br /> <br /> It's a fun show, definitely worth checking out, you're between 20 and 30 years old. I give it an 8 out of 10.
