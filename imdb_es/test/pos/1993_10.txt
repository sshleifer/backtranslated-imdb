Who should see this movie? Anyone who has taken acid, read Philip K. Dick, thought that the premise of Matrix was better than special effects, was interested in philosophy or liked to have the sense of reality tangled. I laughed out loud in this movie, just because it was so scandalous and so successful. This movie is great. This movie is great. It's better than Matrix, as much as I did not fall asleep in Existenz, because the action / special effects movies bored me with stupidity, and despite a plausible philosophical gloss, that's exactly what the Matrix is). Existenz is disgusting, it's disturbing, and it's fun. David Cronenberg has done some shonky things (Rabid) and some genius works as well (Videodrome is another one worth taking a look at, like Stephen King's adaptation of The Dead Zone). But this is one of my favorites of all time. I do not remember the ending, which is good, because it means that I can see it again. Or maybe I never saw this movie at all. Maybe it's an implanted memory. Or maybe 'really' happened to me. I do not know. In any case, now it is perfectly integrated into my general illusion of reality, and I am glad.
