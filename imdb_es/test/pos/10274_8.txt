So here is a bit of background on how I got to see this movie. As you probably know, this is the original French film, which was then reconstructed (by surprise) by Hollywood as Wicker Park. Well, I avoided that movie like the plague when it was released for the first time, simply because, a) I knew it had absolutely nothing to do with Wicker Park, and living in Chicago, I did not see why it was called like this: it was filmed in fricking Canada to get started! - b) I have a hard time bothering with useless remakes, done simply because Hollywood thinks we are too inactive to read some subtitles (by the way, I fear the remake of Infernal Affairs) and c) I can not stop Josh Hartnett, 'nuff said there. <br /> <br /> However, I found WP on TV the other day, probably about half an hour, and I have to say that initially, it did not make any sense, until about half an hour from the end, when it started to join In the end, I was really surprised to find myself in that, and then the end seemed so good: a perfect combination of history, passion and possibly one of the best musical choices I've seen (did I hear?). <br /> <br /> Since then I've heard a lot about the argument of L'Appartement vs. Wicker Park and looking at WP, I still say that everything has to do with Chicago, but there seemed to be something about I liked it, so when it turned on again, I saw it again; unfortunately, I still lack the first piece (I have not seen it yet), and I still found it quite good. Heck, even Josh Hartnett looked good! But I was curious about L'Appartement and I wanted to see what all this fuss was about. So I waited and waited to catch l'Appartement somewhere in some way. Netflix disappointed me, so I ended up getting a copy of some website in Ireland. And I just saw it. <br /> <br /> It's really a bit weird, but a good weird one. A classic French film. Great performance, Romane Bohringer is an authentic gem. I'm sorry, but she plays Monica Bellucci off the screen in every scene. Vincent Cassel was a rare choice for the lead, but in the end he works. And I've seen Jean-Philippe Ecoffey in many movies and I just love him, the scene in which Alice leaves him in the restaurant and it seems that someone told him that he had been run over by his puppy was unbearable! But, I can honestly say, having seen WP and almost expecting it to have been a scene for the scene copy (since about 75% of the rest of the movie had been, maybe in a different order, but come on, the scene with coffee in the glasses? Word for word !!), you can imagine my surprise when I saw the end of L'Appartement !! I can literally say that I was impressed - hmm, a bit like poor Lucien, it was really through the coffee window! So, get ready, if you've seen Wicker Park and you want to take a look at the original as I did, do not make the mistake of waiting for an identical film, either you will be disappointed or get excited for a part of History of the French film: an excellent example of how you can watch a movie, think you're going to see a happy and concise ending, and get a whiplash of the total turn in the opposite direction right at the end. It definitely captures this movie. Oh, and while you're there, maybe not too close to the same time, but on the way, check out Wicker Park, it will also surprise you.
