I loved the show today! It was a variety and not just for cooking (which would also have been great). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what comes next. She is as realistic and personal as you, as one of us who made the show even more enjoyable. Special guests, who are also friends, also for a pleasant surprise. I loved the theme "first" and the audience was also invited to participate. I must admit that I was surprised to see her enter her time limits in some things, but she did and, unfortunately, I will write those recipes. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with the family. Those who have not yet tuned in, discover what channel and when, I assure you they will not be disappointed.
