Do not expect a classic military comedy, which pretends to make fun of the military while only improving the militarist perspective. Instead, it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine. Type of version of "Soldiers of Buffalo" in East Germany. <br /> <br /> "NVA" works on a meta-level that sympathizes with the attempts of its heroes to escape military exercise in any way they can. It is not about loud laughter but about lasting smiles. Utopian, of course (in a scene you will be shown the harsh reality), but very reflective. <br /> <br /> Just to complete the 10 required lines: do not enter that movie if you were an army officer and I liked your work.
