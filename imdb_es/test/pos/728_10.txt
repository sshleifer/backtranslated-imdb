I saw the movie when I was in a class a few years ago in high school. I thought it was a movie that made you think it made you want to see the power behind the enigmas. I think the kind of people who would not like this movie would be those who do not like to solve things, or those who feel frustrated when they can not solve the riddles. It's a good movie, based on a true story that happened in my hometown of Toronto, Ontario. so if you want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there, watch this movie. And for those who only watch movies to point out the holes in the plot and the defects of the characters, they realize that in real life, the same thing happens. But that's all I want to say about that. The riddles are good, some are difficult, some are not. But the movie also leaves you wanting more, more enigmas, more explanation, simply, more. Something else I want to add is that the ideas within this movie, the world of underground riddles, exist, but there is much more than that. You can not find it to find it. Never look for it, it would not be a way to find it. Leave your mark, and it will find you.
