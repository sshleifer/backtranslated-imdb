I barely know where to start writing about this gem, except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the peak of his powers and that certainly must be in the half dozen of the best short comedies that have been made. THE GOAT are twenty minutes of beautifully executed gags, photographed by experts and beautifully executed; two reels of continuous comic inventions driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and, however, lead to a happy ending, which was not always the case in Buster's comedies. (See COPS for a case in which Fatalism finally defeated him, or ONE WEEK for the victory of Defeatism). If I had to describe this film in one word, I would call it "effortless", but if I was allowed two I would call it "apparently effortless", since surely a lot of hard work involves the creation of any comic work that develops with such sublime ease. Still, they did not call it the Great Stone Face for nothing: Buster never let the public see him sweat. <br /> <br /> A sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set "along the Row of Millionaires" "that is, on a bread line in a gloomy urban environment, where Buster waits patiently at the back of the line and, as a result, he does not feed himself, but it must be emphasized that he does not play for pathos for a moment, Buster has our sympathy, but he never asks for it. of accidents, coincidences and absurd misunderstandings, it is believed that Buster is an escaped assassin named Dead Shot Dan and that he is being persecuted by all the policemen around, and yet, although he is clearly dismayed by this turn of events, there is never a sign of self-pity or even surprise, we have the feeling that he always knew that this is what life would have for him, and that he does not have time to feel sorry for himself, he has to discover new ways of dodging to those cops and escape the last trap. . <br /> <br /> Just as Buster refrains from playing for sympathy, he never seems to make an effort to laugh, which is especially impressive because THE GOAT must be one of the shortest laughter-filled comedies that exist. This is the film that presents Buster's iconic photo on a cow-catching train up to the camera lens, which is not exactly a joke, but that causes laughter in its own strange way. Meanwhile, there are gags that involve weapons, dogs, policemen, an incredibly hairy mustache and a clay statue of a horse that melts under the weight of Buster (a real surrealist vision), but some of the larger boffos are saved to the end when Buster is trying to elude his main nemesis, Big Joe Roberts, a resounding cop who is also the father of the protagonist Virginia Fox. Trapped in Big Joe's dining room, Buster jumped frogs on him and navigates through a crossbar, turns a telephone booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear, and eventually uses the elevator to get rid of its pursuer and win the girl in time. for one last fading joke. <br /> <br /> Saying more would be detrimental to first-time viewers. I just wish I could see this movie in a theater full of people who had never seen it before, and float in laughter. The live musical accompaniment would also be good; and incidentally, the musical score provided by Kino for its domestic video / DVD version of THE GOAT is top-notch and serves as the icing on a cake that is already tasty.
