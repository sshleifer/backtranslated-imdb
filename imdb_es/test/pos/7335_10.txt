Wow, what can I say that it was a good movie, very different from all the boring remakes we see lately? The only thing I would have liked to see a bit more of an ending, like when Jane left her husband. I guess I was going to go to Serena because he fell in love with her, not only about her, but about everything that she is, so I want the producers to really show that kind of ending instead of leaving it in their imagination. The kind of ending I really hate when they do it. The aerial acts seemed fun, but I suppose you should be light and muscular, I would like to see more movies like this, maybe I could make a kind of sequel to Jane and Serena. If I were in Jane's shoes, I would have gone for the girl was also attractive.
