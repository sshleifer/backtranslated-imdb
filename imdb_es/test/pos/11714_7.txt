"The Sharky Machine" is clearly a Burt Reynolds vehicle designed to allow the star room to display its talents and paint the machine, the plot of the film, with colors from other movies and other styles, offering a variety of moods within a nutritious story. . <br /> <br /> Made in 1981 at 119 minutes (for a prolonged period of time), the film performed well, with gross box office receipts at $ 37,800,000. He had a lot in his favor: the actor and director of Burt Reynolds, a solid double blow; an adaptation of the novel by William Diel, and the southern area of ​​Atlanta Georgia, at this time, a land of opportunities for the production of films outside of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Tom Sharky of Reynolds falls in love with Dominoe, Rachel Ward's prostitute -with-a-heart-of-gold echoes here as she did in "Hustle" when she played with Catherine Deneuve, and that movie also had a corrupt politician at its core, but with a negative rhythm that did not end with the happiness of Hollywood in "Sharky's Machine". <br /> <br /> The story is purely Detective procedure / activist. Sharky, a narcotics detective, mishandles the bust of a drug trafficker, causing the death of some innocent bystanders, and is degraded, literally transferred to vice, to deal with perverts and other misdemeanors that the "outstanding" policemen consider a service of latrines His new excavations offer him the opportunity to meet many equally outstanding officers who are doing the dirty jobs that nobody else wants. When attention is given to a certain pimp, Sharky reviews some evidence and discovers that a particular prostitute, Dominoe (Rachel Ward): Dominoe is protected by police and political forces, and Sharky establishes a 24-hour surveillance force to monitor her. . During the time he watches, he learns that the current governor elect Hotchkins (Earl Holliman) is visiting Dominoe, as well as a skilled Italian gangster Victor (Vittorio Gassman). Before the police can build a case with evidence, Billy, Victor's brother, an armed man who inhales cocaine (Henry Silva) shoots through the door of Dominoe's apartment, apparently killing the beautiful Dominoe, but when Sharky discovers that the murdered victim was actually a roommate Tiffany (Aarika Wells) Sharky confronts Victor and tells him that he will be arrested. Sharky is captured by some murderous ninjas led by Smiley (Darryl Hickman) and is tortured for the information to lead Dominoe, but Sharky overpowers them and arrests the Governor and in a heated chase kills Billy after he killed Victor. <br /> <Brn> Reynolds wants to showcase the inner workings of a hardened policeman by falling in love, but the storyline of the police, flavored with the black element, and Reynolds' ability in film development tend to slide over the dynamics of relationships. <br /> <br /> We come to learn something about some of the men and this brings us to the reason why they are working to get their pensions instead of fighting real crime. This element of the film seems incomplete under the direction of Reynolds. and performance. <br /> <br /> There is always uniqueness in a Reynolds movie. He likes to hire stars, whether characters or other actors, and then he allows them to improvise, sometimes with different results. <br /> <br /> With his team in "The Sharky Machine" he gets some good moments and, sometimes, a great success. but always a sense of whole and of good character. With Reynolds as author, it works. <br /> <br /> Reynolds, the actor / author always seems to smile at himself and the viewer as if to say that everything is fake, but fun. <br /> <br /> Great line: in the scene with Victor when Sharky throws the glove "You're walking on all the people you have, and you want to know the worst part? You're from out of state." This seems to be the biggest insult the officer can throw against a criminal. <br /> <br /> Reynolds made the movie in Atlanta at his career point shoot himself reading the phone book and would surely have been objective and demographic. <Br /> <br /> The film marked the appearance of Rachel Ward, who was nominated as New Year's Star of the Year in 1981 for the Golden Globe. <br /> <br /> Reynolds has always had a stellar presence and power and has chosen to make films near home, Georgia. <br /> <br /> I got my half.com DVD for $ 7.99 and, unfortunately, it does not contain any comments or manufacturing features, which is a shame. Maybe the next generation will have them. <br /> <br /> The film is still very funny and both Reynolds and Ward are excellent looking actors at their best.
