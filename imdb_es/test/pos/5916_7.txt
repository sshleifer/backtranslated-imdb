From the director Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot), I can see that it is an underestimated and underestimated film, that must be seen. This is the biographical story of Charles Augustus 'Slim' Lindbergh (James Stewart), who in 1927 wanted to be the first man to cross a solo flight from New York, crossing the Atlantic Ocean, to get to Paris, in a small cabin. The first half hour or whatever is to see Lindbergh get permission to do so, and the construction of the plane, called "The Spirit of St. Louis," and make all the necessary preparations. Then, of course, the rest see their dangerous journey crossing the journey, overcoming the fatigue, the almost loss of fuel and the moments of loss of sense of direction, but it was successful. Also starring Murray Hamilton as Bud Gurney, Patricia Smith as Mirror Girl, Bartlett Robinson as Benjamin Frank Mahoney, Robert Cornthwaite as Harry Knight, Sheila Bond as model / dancer, Marc Connelly as Father Hussman, Arthur Space as Donald Hall, Harlan Warde as Boedecker and Dabbs Greer as Goldsborough. Apparently, Lindbergh was a little younger, so Stewart was a little too old to play it, but, again, you can not think of anyone else who can do it better. It is an ingenious and emotional drama, with Stewart (as always) being fantastic, the great music of Frank Waxman and the good direction of Wilder, a little known gem. He was nominated for an Oscar for the best special effects (the only award that was nominated). James Stewart was number 12 in The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, was number 3 in 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and was number 13 in The Greatest Actor in the world. Very well!
