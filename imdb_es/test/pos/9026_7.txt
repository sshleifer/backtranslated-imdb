This movie will not win any awards for its greatness. But if you have an hour and a half free and you fancy a bit of cheerful entertainment, you could do much worse than watching this ... <br /> <br /> The cast is mostly young and pretty, the script has some Genuinely funny moments and the soundtrack is also great. Rupert Penry-Jones as Jake seems to be the most fun, while Laura Fraser as Justine is sweet, friendly and fun. <br /> <br /> I rented it because I like the 'Spooks' series that is currently playing the RPJ. And here is young and amateur and the perfect eye candy for a girls night out. <br /> <br /> Get some wine and some ice cream and have fun.
