I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was browsing a channel during a vacation. It's a great show, I just wish it was not turned on so late at night. It is on at 12:30 AM. As a hard worker it makes it difficult to look all the time. <br /> <br /> I read some comments. I did not agree with the last one about not growing up in the 60s and not believing that this could happen. <br /> <br /> I grew up in the 60s. I am Hispanic and had a "white" boyfriend plus we had black friends in high school. I think people get along well with their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or color. <br /> <br /> I can not wait until the program comes out on DVD to be able to buy it. This way I can see it from the beginning.
