Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security company owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton company is in financial trouble because, unknown to the owner, it has an employee who is selling secrets to the owner of a rival company (Jim Bacchus). It is not Brian, since he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) likes Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her. However, Brian comes with a great security device. It's called CHOMPS, which means canine home safety system. The device, which looks like a dog, is actually a computer-controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to capture thieves. The rival owner sends two malicious spies (one is Red Buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS save Norton's security? This is a fun old school family movie of clean and good entertainment. CHOMPS is, of course, a real dog, played by the adorable and talented Benji. In fact, Benji has a role of mourning, since Brian also has a "real" dog named Rascal. Just seeing this puppy in action is pure joy, as he is able to climb walls, "pull" trucks and operate the buttons of the machine to capture the bad guys. The human cast is also quite pleasant, as they all provide optimistic performances that are contagious. Costumes, scenery and production values ​​are also good. Although you may have trouble locating the movie, it would be worth the effort to ensure a view of your closest loved ones. CHOMPS is a wonderful and healthy diversion from the world's ills.
