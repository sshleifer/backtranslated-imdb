In this concert, they perform their best songs since its heyday (1970-1978), which include "NIB", "War Pigs" and "Paranoid". <br /> <br /> Also included is an invaluable backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives in his days as the best hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward are as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous performances on stage. <br /> <br /> A must see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans.
