The crew of an American submarine discovers that it is HELL BELOW while fighting in the Adriatic in 1918. <br /> <br /> Although it is almost forgotten, this excellent war movie offers a solid entertainment, thanks to a literate script, superior performances and very credible. Action scenes <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery and Walter Huston play submarine officers under the stress of war who quickly face each other, with dramatic and tragic results. Since Montgomery is in love with Huston's daughter, Madge Evans in a well-played role, the situation is further complicated, both on the coast and under the waves. The viewer is divided between the two strong characters, one of whom is governed by his heart and the other by rules. <br /> <br /> Robert Young makes an effective appearance as a friend of Montgomery. Sterling Holloway creates a short and vivid portrait of a convicted sailor. <br /> <br /> Eugene Pallette, the master of the torpedo, and Jimmy Durante, the submarine cook, make a very funny comedy team and provide the story with lots of laughs. . A lot of nerves appear in the nose of Durante and his obsession with amateur dentistry leads to some chaotic encounters with British tars. <br /> <br /> The movie's experts will recognize Babe London as an obese Italian lady; Maude Eburne as the wife of a British admiral and Paul Porcasi as an Italian admiral, all uncredited. <br /> <br /> MGM has given the film first-class production values, with specially produced underwater sequences. Both the ship's claustrophobic complacency and the inevitable tension associated with submarine warfare are described with precision. Other moments of unexpected drama (Montgomery and Miss Evans caught in a Ferris wheel stuck during an air raid) and hilarity (during the boxing of a kangaroo) are included in the plot of the film to provide a totally satisfying viewing experience.
