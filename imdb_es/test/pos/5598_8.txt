In this peculiar film, the themes of the end of days and Satan against Jesus are treated in a new way. Jesus does not want to open the last two seals, and Satan is frustrated in his attempt to take another soul to hell ... Armageddon, Armageddon and Jehosaphat become a company, and the book of life is a bit difficult to open . <br /> <br /> The memorable thing about this movie is the tilted image, the out of focus shots and the light effects, which are effective, but sometimes irritating. And, of course, Donovan is great as a disillusioned Jesus who tries to come to terms with what the world and its people have become. Then, see if you have the opportunity!
