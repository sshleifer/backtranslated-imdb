Well, I'll come out clean and admit that I was forced as part of my history career to watch this movie, and then write a short movie review as part of my rating. <br /> <br /> However, although I have seen the film alone, at my own discretion, I found it extremely boring and absurd. The style is dated beyond their years, and the acting is ridiculous. Instead of using dialogue, they exchange looks of amazement with each other, or sometimes in the air. For me, such excessive performance does not convey any greater emotion, and after looking closely at Ivan's face for the hundredth time, he prayed for the film to end. <br /> <br /> Although the most disappointing is that the character of Ivan is wrong. This man was unpleasant, the murderous thugs of his bodyguard and his cowardly character. For me, the film was just a piece of Stalin's propaganda, inaccurate and boring.
