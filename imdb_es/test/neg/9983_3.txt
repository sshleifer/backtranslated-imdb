210-minute version (extremely hardcore, or what I hear) or the R-rated version released in theaters? Both are terribly horrible, of course. Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell have stated that they wish they had never done this film (the last of the two men reported this in an IMDb interview), and I can see why. Nothing more than a senseless disaster of soft pornography and a half-hearted attempt at a plot. <br /> <br /> Here there is not much of anything, except cheap tricks and stupid scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the film: "It was like a moment I was staring, admiring my mule or something, and the next scene would be two lesbians who were going to it." <br /> <br /> How true. <br /> <br /> What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
