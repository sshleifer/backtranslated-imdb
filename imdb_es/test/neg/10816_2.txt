"The Cave" was released more or less simultaneously with the English film "The Descent", directed by Neil Marshall. Both films share a similar premise; only "The Cave" is terribly unoriginal, uninteresting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure "The Descent". It feels as if Neil Marshall had realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added witty ideas, depth and a personalized style, while the director of "The Cave", Bruce Hunt, simply went for the most rudimentary elaboration of the script that was launched on his desk. . The result is an incredibly mediocre movie that presents all the cliches of terror that occur to you and in which the majority of violence occurs off the screen. And we all hate that, right? The story presents a gang of unbearable divers who get trapped in a completely unknown Romanian underground ecosystem. The horrible winged creatures, which are also parasites, soon attack them and the escape seems impossible due to a landslide. The first half hour is still a little entertaining if you keep busy watching all the clich√©s and listening to the dialogues of the corny textbook, but everything becomes too serious. None of the events is even a bit plausible and it seems that the entire cast is competing with each other to offer the performance of WORST. I have already seen better special effects in the anonymous B movies, the filming locations are not used to the maximum and the ending is simply disgusting! A lot NOT recommended!
