It has gone the wonderful charm of the original. In its place there is a grade C action that is not easy, but that is not all bad, but pales in comparison to the original. All the sex and senseless violence are gone, and they have been replaced with shitty jokes and inexplicable plot points. Watch it, but do not wait for the first one's emotions.
