This is perhaps the most ridiculous shit I've ever seen. Three unconnected stories about completely stupid and random things are interrupted occasionally by a boring bus and monologue about relationships by a stupid man. Christ knows why so many people got involved in this. Highlights: Green fridge that reads Jean-Paul Sartre, the dinner guest of the slugs and their products for horse manure, an irrationally unreasonable woman in third place, who suspected a man of dirty play just for being interested in its generic activities. Blowers <br /> <br /> Apparently I need a few more lines, so I can also mention some more stupid things about the movie. The first film involves a man who drives a talking car and obeys his irrational demands for no apparent reason. The only way you would see this movie is if you were blind and had other debilitating defects in your personality and brain. It's funny in an ironic way, but also extremely tired, like being forced to chew a stained carpet for a long time.
