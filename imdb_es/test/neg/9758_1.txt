While watching this movie, I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing around my head. The acting was horribly suffocating, and it was bad acting. The brightest piece of the performance in the whole movie was the guy who had to play in a coffin. I felt nothing but relief when it finally ended. I expected this movie to be a real tragedy, with a bit of deep psychological intrigue as a consequence. Everything around him was stupid, without beginning, without climax, without end, just rambling on and on, and the plastic bag got worse. Let's face it here. This is a horrible movie.
