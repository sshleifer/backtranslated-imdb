I bought the DVD from a large container for $ 4.99, thinking that I had been lucky with some documentary pearl that would really show a lot of images of the Karakoram mountains, and K2 in particular. Advancing rapidly through the film, I arrived at the climactic scene in which climbers first saw ---- Mount Waddington, rising to 13,260 feet, in the Canadian Coast Range. At least one of the several bozos prepared to climb K2 clearly has no idea what the mountain really looks like: his friend and climbing partner must assure him that this fellow would not have taken him to an ugly one. Montana. Given that one of the premises of the film is that 27 or more people have lost their lives in K2, one might think that the imbecile in question could have taken a minute or two to come up with some basic facts, but the clown seems to think that the preparations on this scale, although they are good enough for the likes of Reinhold Messner, are below him. To be honest, I have not seen the whole thing. What I have seen makes me tremble. They say you get what you pay for. At $ 4.99, they cheated me.
