This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen, if not the worst. After seeing this piece of shit, I felt I should write to Madonna and demand compensation for my time, but now I feel like I should write to Madonna and demand a great album from the 80s (considering that she can not record a good album to save her life more) in exchange for this disaster. <br /> <br /> To the film itself, which can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> It consists of Madonna jumping acting as a spoiled teenager who got lost in her way. She is trying to impress this absolute imbecile of an actor who plays "the lawyer" in the movie. But, the best was the end. I was staring with my mouth open at the television while the credits accumulated thinking about me, "Is that? That's the end? What a piece of shit!" If Madonna were not a pop icon at the time of this movie, this movie would have destroyed her career on its own. And the funniest thing about the whole situation was that I just saw the damn movie to see where they put the song "Who's That Girl." Well, guess where they put it? ............................ .......in the end!
