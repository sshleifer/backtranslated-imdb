I did not like this movie. I rented it with the hope that it was something like the Tenth Kingdom. I was disappointed when I discovered that it was not. I also found it, simply, with nervousness. The acting was bad, the characters were incredible and the time jumps were crazy. I only recommend this movie if you're in the mood to see a crazy guy running, but I'm sure there are better movies with the same thing. I can not believe I wasted my time on this.
