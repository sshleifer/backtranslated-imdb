I have never seen the first three, but I know that everyone is better than this ... garbage. It is a boy who makes a party. Wow. It sounds incredible (sarcasm). It is? NOOO! It begins with a child lying on the bed and his mother wakes him up. Then, the child pretends to be sick so he does not have to go to school. He goes to his uncle's house, rounds up some people and organizes a party. I did not laugh at all while looking at this garbage. I can not imagine someone sitting and writing this dialogue thinking "Man, this! @ # $ It's very big, me!" I wonder if they even had a script for this movie. I saw this knowing it would be bad, but generally watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of. This just displeased me. TWO THUMBS DOWN!
