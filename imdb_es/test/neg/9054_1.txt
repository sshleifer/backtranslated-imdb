An IMDb critic says that Eaten Alive is a passable film for the "cannibalist". Are there such people? I did not know But if you're one of them, hey, have a ball. The rest of you may find this gut a bit difficult to swallow (pun), even if, like me, you consider yourself an expert in horror movies. I've been an avid horror fan for about 15 years, though I never reached the cannibal subgenre until a few weeks ago, and I think I owe my brief interest in these whining inducing films, oddly enough, to China. total disregard for copyright laws. You see, I bought a two-disc DVD collection of all the Wesley Snipes movies for 20 yuan (about $ 2.75), which turned out to include Last Cannibal World, Mountain of the Cannibal God, Eaten Alive, Cannibal Holocaust, Next, with Nicholas Cage, and something called Voodoo Lagoon, along with Blade 1-3, in Chinese. Nice. <br /> <br /> Being a second sequel, I immediately had a sinking feeling when the movie started with a cannibal in street clothes wandering through major US cities, shooting at Americans confident with poisoned darts and then getting away from all speed . Having run out of means to scare the cannibals from the movies, it seems that now they have made their way to the continent. Later, you may be surprised to learn that this guy is doing a "training exercise." Lock up your daughters! <br /> <br /> In a short time, the film is set in the old routine of the missing sister, when a young blonde named Sheila begins her own investigation of the disappearance of her sister, who does not look anything like her , but is willing to do it. spend most of the movie naked, so I guess that does not matter. It seems that, after shooting one of his victims, the unfortunate cannibal we met at the beginning of the film, who was not used to the life of the big city, ran into the road and was killed by a moving truck. <br /> <br /> The brilliant police force finds a mysterious film about him showing Sheila's sister involved in a strange ritual behavior, but apart from the movie, the guy is a complete mystery. As the grumpy police chief laments, "we do not know anything about him, except he's dead!" Poor guy, you must have a headache for all this. I recommend a nap. Fortunately, Sheila is the kind of girl who can throw tens of thousands of dollars as if she were nothing in search of her sister. Perfect to hire a guide of brave cartoons, since the police clearly will not be of any help. <br /> <br /> Obviously, nothing new is added to this tiny subgenre. On the contrary, cannibalism almost seems to be the background of a completely different kind of bad film, about the rescue of a missing person from the dangerous elements. The thickening of the fabric of that clothesline is not difficult, all you have to do is add a cult to the jungle of people who follow a guy called Jonas, who believes in using pain as a way to gather man with nature, a process called "purification". Personally, I prefer to just pee out from time to time. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Sheila is caught by one of the cult members: an overweight guy who looks like he took a three-day weekend. From the office to appear in this movie. As he takes out his trusted medical kit to give him an injection, he warns him: "If you do not believe in Jonas and purification (through pain), God will help you." Then he gives her a shot and, when she gets up from the little pinch, he apologizes politely to her. I feel a true believer in this guy! <br /> <br /> As for gore, there are a lot of unpleasant sound effects in random shots of animals being slaughtered and more than enough filthy material from cut women and live foods, so I guess right there the movie does honor to his name. The performance is surprisingly bad, as can be expected, and what is quite interesting, the editing is also spectacularly flawed but still strangely effective. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think you have to be able to relate to people who believe in totally crazy cults to be able to relate to anyone in the movie. There are many extravagant religious ceremonies that take place, which makes it increasingly difficult to understand why Sheila's sister decided to turn her back on normal society. I am in favor of individualism and doing their thing, but let's go. <br /> <br /> After a while, the film descends further into your basic movie, run of the mill escape, just before we witness the most totally inappropriate interpretation of Glory, Glory Hallelujah in the story of the movie theater. WOW. <br /> <br /> Note: in this movie, a woman is raped with a snake cut off. If you need more reasons not to see it, seek professional help. Avoid this mess at all costs.
