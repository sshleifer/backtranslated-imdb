You get a good deal of Steven Seagal's environmental anxieties and some breathless mountain views along with cow-boy scenes (or, alternatively, you use parts of any rest of the HISOR THAT DOES SAME). Then, add a large amount of virus OUTBREAK or similar (attention, must be more lethal and at least level 4 of biological risk) wrapped around a leader of a group of militias. You add a teaspoon of martial arts, and a zipper of explosions and shots for the taste. Add the classic Indian red herbs for extra flavor. Serve immediately. <br /> <br /> What is the name of the movie you get ?: The Patriot. Maybe Steven Seagal's worst movie. I'm sure Seagal tried to say something in this movie, except the usual I-am-a-cook (but also ex-seal), but his recipe was confusing and the taste was horrible.
