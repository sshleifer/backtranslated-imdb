I've always had this morbid curiosity when it comes to notoriously bad and unpopular movies. I've also always enjoyed such bad movies that are good, you're looking at someone who really liked children's movies full of cheese like Catwoman and Thunderbirds (2004). <br /> <br /> So I saw this, and it turned out that all the critics are right about this. It is a great failure, but unlike many failures, it is not pleasant at any level, not even to mock. It's just one boring party after another until the end. <br /> <br /> I had been warned. I do not listen. I'm a fool. <br /> <br /> Do not be silly, do not waste time and money on this pile of garbage.
