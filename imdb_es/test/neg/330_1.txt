Man, these movies stunk. It seemed to have about seven different plots at once and all had little or no meaning. The special effects, the costumes, and all those things were more than horrible. The performance was particularly bad. Everything seemed so forced, especially the lines of the woman with the huge eyes and the little boy (his "Noooooo" when he is buried is so unenthusiastic that it is ridiculous). A good part of this movie is pretty funny anyway. The death of the only woman in which she pushes a knife in a toaster, is electrocuted, and magically becomes the craziest skeleton mannequin in the world. My friends and I laughed for about ten minutes. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: If you like to watch really horrible movies, look for this one. If not, run for your life.
