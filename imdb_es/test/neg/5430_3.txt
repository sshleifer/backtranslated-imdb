I just saw Congo on DVD. In most cases, I love this kind of movies, but this one is different. He had me write my first comment for a movie on IMDb. I was surprised how a team of experienced filmmakers could create this film as a result. You can see that there was a lot of money for this production, but you can not make a good movie if you do not have a good script. And as a producer, Frank Marshall gave us many great movies to watch; He should never have tried to become another Spielberg. This shows how difficult it is to make a good movie, maybe you have all the ingredients, but if you can not cook, stay out of the kitchen. If I can make a suggestion, do not waste your money on this. If you want to see it, watch it first on TV and decide for yourself.
