I was a 22 year old hippie in 1965, I have seen the play 5 times, I have 2 versions of the music and I have read the script many times. Maybe taken as a separate thing, the film is fine, but as an adoption of the play, it is terrible. <br /> <br /> First the good. The songs are well sung and the production values ​​are quite good. The homosexual implications in Black Boys, White Boys are nice. The Claude / Berger switch was interesting. Hair is a fluid production, and constant changes in it are inherent as long as its basic spirit is maintained. <br /> <br /> But the basic spirit was very distorted. It seemed that all the producer wanted was to sing certain songs, and adapt them to the story line, independently of what would affect the original intention of the work. <br /> <br /> They introduced Claude, Sheila and Hud as selfish little brats who could not care about anyone outside their tribe. Claude destroyed the party of Sheila's parents (it's hard to believe he smiled while his parents were being hurt), and he repeatedly stole cars. Sheila stole the soldier's clothes and car. Then he left it in the middle of the desert, where it would surely burn with the sun, probably would be eliminated from range and probably could die on that lonely road in Nevada. Good fun. And Hud thought it was good to break his son's heart while screaming at his ex. This is not what the hippies were, it is not what the work describes, and it is directly opposed to a generation of love. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a hippie beg for money. The goal was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system, not to beg. <br /> <br /> After Berger is sent to jail for ruining Sheila's party and Claude offers the possibility of rescuing some, Berger insists that, instead, be released Without a better plan to rescue the rest than hitting Sheila's parents and then her own mom. <br /> <br /> "Be In" has always been a very spiritual point, but here it is wasted on nonsense brides floating around Even if this is part of your trip, it ruins a beautiful song. I know they are contrasting "Floating in space" with the Army. But, again, it completely ruins a beautiful song. <br /> <br /> While Sheila and Claude are sinking, Berger steals the clothes and laughs "he was a funny man", even after he could see that they were both very upset. Then, a little later, Berger does one thing that no hippie does. He hits Claude. Terrible. <br /> <br /> Then they have the perfect opportunity to sing "Starshine" at night in a beautiful SF place with the stars blinking, maybe working on an inventive duo. Instead, the whole tribe sings under the scorching sun that runs along the road in a convertible (stolen, of course). <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with the movie in 1979, and now I like it a lot less. I think it would have been possible to make a reasonably close adoption of the show, but it's not like that.
