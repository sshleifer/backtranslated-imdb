The first two films of this series were highlighted by their images of the natural world and ordinary people trapped in the middle of society. This movie does not have any of those natural images, which I understand is part of the point, but it really makes the whole video component of the film look like randomly pasted images, ones and flying zeros, human computer models. skeletons, and so on. Occasionally, archival material is put into practice (the nationalism / finance segment around 35:00), but it generally makes the video appear to lack meaningful content, and requires that it accept the context of the archive photographers instead. of the context of photography. director. It is not better than the video that is shown on a karaoke machine. Three stars added for the soundtrack of Philip Glass.
