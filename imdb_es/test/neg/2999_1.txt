Usually, I am the one who criticizes the twenty-somethings of Neanderthals for not being able to appreciate a movie unless it has plastic evidence, shootings and car chases. However, in this case, the movie could have been improved with some of those additions. At least I would not have been bored after an hour and I would have switched channels. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the surreal, and I certainly do not mind having to pay attention to find subtlety or hidden meaning, but there should be some point to the whole thing. I did not have the feeling that neither the writer nor the director really had a broad vision of anything, but instead, they felt so absorbed in their own pretentious visions that they deliberately dispersed. Or maybe they just confused themselves. Either way, I do not care. I got bored for just one hour without saving grace. <br /> <br /> Although a full package of other viewers has filled this site with enthusiastic ravings about the supposed symbolism and masterful cinematography, I must respectfully disagree. Maybe I did not do too many film classes to appreciate some inspired techniques that do not they are visible to mere mortals ... <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie was crap. <br /> <br /> I give it a "1" and present it next to "Ishtar".
