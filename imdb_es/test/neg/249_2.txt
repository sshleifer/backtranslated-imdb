I'm a big fan of the bad horrors, the cheap horrors, the movies and the 100 movies below, and I do not deny that those are the worst things to get on the big screen, not even the video of your house. Some of them, for example. The infamous Hands The Hands of Destiny are truly bad, and seeing them, especially without help and without beer, is a torture for a good cinematic taste. <br /> <br /> However, The Aztec Mummy Against The Human Roboto was not so bad. Well, of course it is BAD: it is silly, outdated, cheesy, cheap, etc., there is an Aztec mummy, a tin robot, a masked fat villain, a mad scientist, Mexican mobsters, etc. The assembly is poor, the lines, well, let's say that the lines are not theatrical, FX and SFX are the best that the low budget Mexican production could have offered, etc. However, the movie is FUNNY. It's so bad that it makes you laugh happily for an hour. Of course it depends on the sense of humor, however, I'm pretty sure that The Mummy should teach newcomers to this type of cinema to enjoy it. Keep in mind: the movie lasts about an hour, and I think it's enough time for nonsense to digest them easily. <br /> <br /> There is also another thing: watching The Mummy can give you an idea of ​​what the whole concept of the SF / Horror genre was in the 1950s, when you compare it to the current era of Matrix film entertainment. I think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved, due to the fact that watches like The Mummy still attract the theaters in their theaters for some special shows (films like this one are very good) and very often they get a big ovation. .
