Arthur Miller has always been known as one of the great playwrights of the United States for works like "The Death of a Seller" and "The Crucible". "Focus" is one of his lesser known works that were taken to the silver screen. However, knowing that he is a great playwright, Arthur Miller, I doubt that his original work was much like the movie. The film is presented as empty and formulaic, with William H. Macy as a non-Jew mistaken for a Jew by anti-Semitic neighbors in the Second World War in Brooklyn. Do not get me wrong: the acting is fine, and I guess the people behind this movie probably tried to do something about racism, but the movie just does not work. Macy, Laura Dern and David Paymer simply can not create an effective story with the material here.
