With the dialogue in the folded version of this film, I do not think Shakespeare is in any great danger. This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy that has been deprived of its rights. His things have been taken and this really angers him. It seems he knows who is doing this even though it is a spinning and delirious entity. I loved the two boring men who tell the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature. There are all these scenes in this ridiculous cemetery, full of cheap crosses and other garbage. There is a mausoleum where the mummy is kept. I can not begin to reproduce the idiocy of this, including a pit of snakes where the good doctor is thrown (there is a door next to him so he can get out) towards the robot, a mass of metal cans with a guy inside. The dialogue is horrible. There are long pauses between speeches, as if someone off stage were feeding their lines. I love the scene where the two children accuse their mother of going out at night (she goes into this zombie state or something). However, if you are looking for a movie that you can laugh at and never take yourself seriously, look at this. Take a couple of beers first. As a direct line from the tomb of the mummy, "Look at this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink." What more can I say?
