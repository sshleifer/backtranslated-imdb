I accept that most of the horror of the 50s are not frightening by today's standards, but what the hell is this? When you see a title like this, you expect to see blood and a bloodthirsty beast. Instead, we do not get blood and a beast that wants to dominate the world or live in peace on Earth ... yes, that's what people wanted. <br /> <br /> The general story is fine with The astronaut comes back to life and is one with the beast ... but the title really kills the movie. Night of the Beast would have made the fans happier because there really is nothing to talk about. <br /> <br /> I like how the films of the 50s had endings that left space for a sequel but wisely never made one. . This movie is not the worst I've seen in my life but it's almost up there. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
