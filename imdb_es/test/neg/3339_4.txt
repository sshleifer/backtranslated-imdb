Pretentious trap, updating Herman Melville (!), On the vaguely incestuous relationship of a young man with his aristocratic mother who was transferred to his lost sister a long time ago that was raised by gypsies. Or something like that ?? it's not that anyone really cares to unravel their multi-layered plot with pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic images (the brothers who swim in a river of blood) and other strange touches (a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers-by in the street is anonymously beaten to death, the deafening music of a rock group used in the demolition of old buildings). Taking into account the material of origin and the presence of Catherine Deneuve (who at least bathes naked), I expected much more of this; apparently, is there an even longer version of POLA X out there?
