The strange thing about Galaxina is not that it is extremely bad, even if it is. The strange thing is that, despite being extremely bad, it's not funny. Extremely bad movies have their own particular brand of involuntary humor, the secret of their success, one might say. But Galaxina is quite different: it is the worst nightmare of MST3K, a bad movie in which the intentional * and * unintentional humor fall badly. <br /> <br /> It's easy enough to understand why intentional jokes fail - and the reasons are quite varied. Sometimes it is a question of time; sometimes it's a badly crafted idea (the human restaurant * could * have been funny, but it was not); sometimes it feels as if there is some confusion in the court room, with the finishing line ending in the ground; And sometimes jokes are just bad jokes. Bad films get their laughs from such involuntary nonsense. It's harder to understand why Galaxina does not laugh at that. Something is subtly wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie, just as something is wrong (not entirely subtle) with intentional humor. It is an extremely bad movie whose evil is not the redeeming quality that it is usually. It is absolutely unique in my experience.
