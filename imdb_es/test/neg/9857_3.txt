Kasparov vs. Deep Blue is undoubtedly a fascinating story, but I do not think you know it when you watch this movie. I think he focuses too much on the conspiracy theory that IBM cheated ... and on what does this theory depend? The idea that at one point the computer made a movement that "seemed human". I am not a great chess teacher or a computer scientist. And although I do not doubt that the movement looks human, for me it does not seem to be beyond the possibility that the most powerful chess computer ever created can make a surprising movement ... or that that machine can beat Even a genius like Kasparov . The film gets too much mileage from this theory, and not enough from the personalities of the people involved ... who could have made it a much more interesting story. The direction is also based too much on the concepts of a uselessly whispered narrative, and on the images of an eighteenth-century chess machine that looks like one of those animatronic Gypsy fortune tellers you see at carnival. In addition, the story was slowed down by many empty shots of Kasparov that reviewed "the scene of the crime". I have no doubt that Kasparov and the chess community find IBM's behavior annoying, but I do not think it's any different from what you might find in any other large corporation. At the end of the movie, you're left with the feeling that Kasparov is a big crybaby and that Deep Blue's programmers are victims or cheaters. I think if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe the theory of the conspiracy (which he almost certainly did), he should have presented a lot more evidence. In fact, more evidence would have been a good idea in the first place. Everything left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.
