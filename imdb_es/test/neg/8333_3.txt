I went to see this because I had never seen Tel-Aviv, where the story is set. I was disappointed, as it does not offer many views of Israel's largest metropolis. It is also pretentious: one of those movies that lets you guess its meaning until you finally give up with a shrug. <br /> <br /> The main character is Batya, a woman in her twenties who works. As a waitress at weddings attended. Obviously, her parents do not care much about her, and when a little girl comes out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her, Batya feels compelled to take care of her. The girl does not speak, and Batya can not deliver her to social services because it is a weekend and the agency is closed. So she takes her back to her apartment with the roof that drips, and when it's time to work at night, she has to take the girl with her. The boss is very unhappy with this and other deficiencies in Batya's work performance. <br /> <br /> Another main character is Keren, who is getting married. At her wedding party (where Batya is working, of course), her leg breaks out of a cubicle in a women's room whose door does not open, so she and her new husband can not take vacations in the Caribbean who have planned. They end up in a dirty hotel on the waterfront without a view. It smells bad, there is traffic noise and Keren complains all the time. Does your husband know a strangely attractive older woman? a writer ?? Who also stays at the hotel, and Keren worries that she has slept with this stranger. <br /> <br /> The third main character is a Filipino woman named Joy who cares for older people. The old woman she is hired to take care of is very bad-tempered and does not speak English, only German and Hebrew. Joy speaks English but not Hebrew or German. Joy is very concerned about how her son is doing in the Philippines, and wants to buy him a toy boat, as he has asked. She finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it. The daughter of the old woman, who hired Joy, is an actress who appears in a post-modern adaptation of Hamlet's "physical theater" and does not get along with her mother. <br /> <br /> The way to These three stories, which intersect momentarily, are supposed to solve themselves, they mean something profound. I did not understand. There is a fantasy element in Batya's relationship with the girl, and maybe Batya's non-existent relationship with her parents is somehow reversed in this relationship. When Joy sees the toy boat in the shop window, there is a strange effect in which the small candles are stirred as if blown by the wind, and they do so as if they were on the scale of a real ship. Keren draws the outline of a bottle around a boat that is on the cover of a brochure in the hotel room, and a narrative of the poetry of the strange woman mentions a boat in a bottle. But what does all this mean? I thought about it for a while and realized that I was not going to lose any sleep in the process. If someone has a clear idea of ​​what it is about, maybe they can inform me.
