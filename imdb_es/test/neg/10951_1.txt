First of all, I'm a big fan of fucking movies. B grade is always good for a laugh. Unfortunately this movie is just bad. I dressed like a zombie for a party and my makeup looked better than the ones in this movie. Especially the big boy at the beginning, it only seemed that a child had put on his face with crayons. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that I do not need to comment on why. The effect is also extremely amateur, with obvious blood tubes that shoot a stream of blood at the back of the zombies' heads when they are shot. <br /> <br /> It also seems that many people who comment on this movie are trying to increase the rating. Nobody without his finger on the cake would rate this movie above 5/10. Frankly, it is shameful that the people who worked on this film raise their own ratings. <br /> <br /> I suggest everyone avoid this movie, it's not worth wasting the 90 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> Absolutely horrible.
