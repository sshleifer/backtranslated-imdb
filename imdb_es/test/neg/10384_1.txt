While watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I found scenes and dialogues so incredibly bad that I was convinced that it was supposed to be a comedy. A few pieces of dialogue worthy of a laugh laugh: "I ate a rabbit." "I told you I was possessed!" "Are you telling me that the devil is in my daughter ?!" <br /> <br /> There are many, many more, but you must discover them for yourself, if you dare. <br /> <br /> The story goes to all kinds of directions and things happen that probably should not and they all seem to be a pervert or psychopath of some kind (even the Priest). And I have not even arrived at the bad performance. Most notable in this area is the partner who plays his father. The principal must have told you to act as if you had a problem with your $ $$ because that is the general impression you have. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to take anyone away from BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM because there's entertainment value that you can have ... for all the wrong reasons, but if you're looking for a horror movie that makes sense and is really terrifying ... well, run, do not walk.
