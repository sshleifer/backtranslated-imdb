I was really surprised to see that someone would take so much time to evaluate such a bad movie. The beginning (of the movie) had some truth in it. The Partisan "AF" was started in 1943 when two communist pilots of the Croatian Ustashi AF deserted, together with their observers, in Breguet 19 and Potez 33, respectively. The plane saw some action in the bombing and manual bombing, but it did not last long. One team died and the other survived, the pilot died later while flying a Spitfire Vc. The royal partisan squadrons were established when the RAF separated two of its (Yugoslav) squadrons from Spitfire Vc and, Hurricane IIc, respectively, manned by former Yugoslav Royal Air Force pilots, and assigned them to Tito's forces on the Island. Vis. Even those who never participated in air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. So the movie was a giant cow dung, to put it mildly, and the lowest point for its director, otherwise nothing bad. By a whim of fate, I was present at the filming of the last sequence of the film, when dozens of German planes were destroyed (Yugoslav trainers 522, also used in flight sequences) at the military airport of Mostar. The pyrotechnics were impressive, and the Scotsman plentifully served by the film crew was even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameless lie, and the contemporary public often joked.
