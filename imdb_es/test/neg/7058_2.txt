When I was 13 years old, I was lucky enough to find this movie. It was part of an endless Danish series of really kitschy things. However, this was the cheese I've had, but I think I sold it, very badly. Well, what to write ... Better than "Hands: the hands of destiny" and worse than "Critters 4". But it is definitely worth an hour and a half, since this was done by people who wanted to do it. The acting is not so terrible compared to the other eighty's trash; In fact, I like the old man even though he did not look like that Indian. But I guess you can not have everything ... Do yourself a favor and look at this ...
