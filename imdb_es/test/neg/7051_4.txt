This is a case of taking a fairy tale too far. The Enchanted Cottage offers Dorothy McGuire as a "terrible" spinster and Robert Young as a disfigured pilot. Long story short: Scarface marries Spinster, after which their love transforms them, miraculously (lighting, cosmetics and the removal of false scars), into beautiful people, a magical change that they attribute to the charm of living in a country house by the sea. It has been the home of generations of newlyweds. <br /> <br /> If the story stopped there, fine; It would be a fable with a proverbial message: beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But it wobbles forward, reaching reality. When Mr. and Mrs. Scarface greet their audience, it is a painful blow that they are still home. See, they only look beautiful to each other? a situation for which the public is well prepared because all the supporting characters have been preaching that disadvantaged people really need to lower their expectations and find other ways to be happy. You know. Taking Spinster hobbies makes woodcuts, for example. Scarface considers collecting driftwood. <br /> <br /> The original playwright (Arthur Wing Pinero) and the filmmakers have no faith in human nature. Your message is: you are ugly or pretty, and no pretty person would love an ugly one. What is even worse, ugly people obviously need to imagine that their lover is beautiful. Reality simply does not work. <br /> <br /> One wonders what Elaine Mason saw every day when she looked at her husband, Stephen Hawking.
