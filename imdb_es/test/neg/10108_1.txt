<br /> <br /> Spoilers <br /> <br /> I'm going to be as kind as I can about this movie (some people, including directors, can be very angry when critics say what they think) ... <br /> <br /> There is a nice car accident and the opening credits look good and ... that's it; Everything else bites the big one. All the acting is frightening, the script is embarrassing, the special effects seem to be made by school kids on cheap computers. In general, this movie has serious tendencies in bowling shoes. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie, it's not very scary and, if the horror movie of a "thinking man" is supposed to have succeeded on some level, I kept thinking that The end of this movie is far away. It may actually be an ironic look at bad horror films and I'm missing the point, but somehow I doubt it. <br /> <br /> This is a complete car store for a movie car and I can not recommend it to anyone. , and it hurts me to say this while I am waiting impatiently for the resurrection of British Horror. <br /> <br /> If you do not agree with this review, it's fine, it's just my opinion, and I'm sure someone will love it (the director's mom, for example).
