Detective Dave Robicheaux is trying to link the murder of a local prostitute with New Orleans mobster Julie Balboni. But during his investigation, Robicheaux is led to a series of surreal encounters with a troop of Confederate soldiers, what a terrible plot and it was worse than he expected! It was very slow and I had a minimal acting ability that I could not see, it was a waste of time. Another FLOP, I would give you less than 1 if you could please people, do not waste your time, it's 1: 42m of lost time. The actor Elrod Sykes and his girlfriend drive under the influence. While Dave takes Elod to the station, the actor tells Dave that he found some skeletal remains in the filming of a movie he is filming.
