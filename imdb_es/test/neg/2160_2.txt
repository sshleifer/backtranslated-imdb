Back in the cold and spooky of the early '90s, a show called "Family Matters" aired and became an instant classic. The trick was to buy a manual on standard family situations and their solutions and insert some attempts at sarcastic comments into it. A charming little theft is wrong, parents have the right to see. So it worked well, so Bickley-Warren had a new ambitious plan: to do exactly the same program again. <br /> <br /> This is the difference: "Family Matters" had Urkel. "Step By Step" has the boy of those "Kickboxers" who did not see. It says things like "dudette" and "the Dane-meister", and somehow the public still should not hate it. I mean seriously, "dudette"? How can you even make that come to your lips? <br /> <br /> The rest of the people were mostly blank versions of the entire Winslow group, combined with some characters more than one or zero dimensions, like the dumb kid (JT, well, Eddie), the smart girl (Laura) and a pretty girl who spends her days looking pretty (in theory). The development of the character was horrible in this show. Grover and The Cookie Monster have more depth than the Lambert family. Everyone simply milked their stereotypes for what they were worth. They were not worth much. <br /> <br /> With the power of a tape of laughter and joy stolen from something funny, this program aired for 7 years, which was humiliating for the competition. I must bear in mind that this is the time when family comedies were almost all great successes, everyone simply ignored their shit because, well, it was 90, a shit show did not hurt me.
