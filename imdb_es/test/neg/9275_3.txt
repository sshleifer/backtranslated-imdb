I rented this version of the TV movie 'Troilus and Cressida' in my library last Thursday, and I just could not believe what I saw. Where should I start? no effort was made to make the work look remotely as if it were the Trojan War, all actors wore an Elizabethan dress. In addition, most of the actors were too old and horribly misplaced. Aeneas (with his white beard) seemed older than Nestor, Troilus was at least 30 years old, Hector looked like a Spanish pirate, Ajax was misunderstood anyway and Thersites was a transvestite. br /> <br /> Similarly, the action is poor, the duel between Ajax and Hector is short and amateur, the angle of the camera focuses more on the face of Nestor, so we can only see what happens in the bottom, which is frustrating in itself. . Nor is the 'battle' at the end given due respect. We do not see Troilo and Diomedes fight, or anyone else, Paris and Menelaus just seem to fight in front of Thersites. Even the death of Patroclus was omitted. All this was a big disappointment, considering that I spent two and a half hours very boring of BBC disguise drama to get to that point. <br /> <br /> However, not everything was bad. I thought the incredible Orlando as Thersites and John Shrapnel as Hector were well played, even if they did not look good. I would say the same about Kenneth Haigh as Achilles, since he did not have a flashy face and was a bit dry at times. SPOILER: The climax at the end, the death of Hector, was perhaps the best part of the film, Achilles' dialogue here is excellent and sums up the attitude of a cold and experienced killer. However, the piety of the scene (when Achilles printed on what was the head of Hector) distinguishes him anyway. <br /> <br /> Charles Gray, like Pandarus, was a delight as a lazy pervert and I thought that the actress who played Cressida was a delight. Ok job However, Troilus, a war warrior, was annoying and I think the play would have been better maybe if Achilles had killed him instead of a pacifist like Hector. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Okay, but it could have been better if I had had a younger cast and costumes that at least tried to look like Ancient Greece, not to mention the lack of action. 5/10
