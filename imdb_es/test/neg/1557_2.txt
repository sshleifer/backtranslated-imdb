This is a completely forgettable image. A friend of mine picked it up in a bin in a rental place for $ .50. I should have demanded a refund. Or at least a discount. <br /> <br /> The plot is something like this: a giant monster threatens the earth and the aliens decide that the most average human being on the planet should be chosen to save the earth. Therefore, a small holographic alien appears before a postal worker and says it is "that." <br /> <br /> The devil is in the details when it's time to rate a movie, and with that Zarkorr counts! The invader fails miserably. The monster Zarkorr only has a few brief moments on the screen, adding perhaps 5 minutes at most (with a generous estimate). The cute alien hologram has even less time on the screen and could be the most interesting character in sight, and only because he wears a "teeny bopper" stereotype suit, complete with a mocking pleated skirt. The final battle with the monster ends before you can say "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, more". In the next moment, you should reflect on whether you have just suffered a train crash or if someone has just drained 3 pints of blood from you. <br /> <br /> Although, undoubtedly, this film offered a line that my friends and I to this day continue repeating and laughing, and it was the only bright spot in this image, otherwise, abysmal. As the cast of "protagonists" is being "interrogated" by the fuzz, one of them responds to the questions with the phrase "What are you, some kind of question?" It is delivered in such an absurd way that if you are sitting with a group of friends (who will not be your friends for a long time if you really convinced your friend to see this), you may experience a howl or two of unbelieving laughter. <br /> <br /> While this is not Manos or Eegah (it's not even bad enough to be classically bad), this film will still bore you with its horrible dialogue, its unimaginative characters and its nonexistent special effects, and still deserves to inhabit the bottom 100. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
