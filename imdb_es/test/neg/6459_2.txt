This film was recommended to me by one of my friends who made films and, therefore, expected something good. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed the first half (ah, a movie about a wench who was taking revenge on his boss hole, how original) and saw the second half in fast forward hoping to find something that would justify the 45-Two minutes had already been wasted. But all I got was the end of the 'shock' ... <br /> <br /> The basic problem is that this is a movie that seems unable to decide what it means and says what it says (hard to understand ). say what is) wrong. The good performance does not keep a bad script full of characters that do not matter to me. <br /> <br /> Now, if I did not do it in the film industry, I would be surprised to discover the politics and the stupid exploitation. going behind the screen, but as my feelings are are summarized above: "Ho Hum." <br /> <br /> 2/10 ... it would have been 1/10 if it was not for the Acting and the cut paper scene.
