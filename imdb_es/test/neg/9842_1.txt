This movie is terrible. Not only the story is amazing, the situations in which the characters are put are so silly, to the point that it is not surprising. It seems sad to me that Daisy Eagan, star of The Secret Garden on Broadway, decided that this would be a step in her career. The idea is interesting, two young girls reach the age of majority very quickly. But sex is not even exciting. The movie is silly, the story is silly, the performances are silly and the whole concept is interesting. I am sure that all the girls of 14 years old get together with the boys after having had their first period and have tried to throw their panties in the toilet. Better luck guys next time.
