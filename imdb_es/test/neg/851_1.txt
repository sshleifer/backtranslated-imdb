Italians are undeniable masters in the questionable "art" of cheating and imitating movies. What they do is take an innovative concept, that generates money and that is foreign, maintain the basic plot and simply add a lot of action, sordidness and political incorrectness. But what to do when the non-Italian original is already a well-known film and difficult enough to overcome in terms of decline and controversy? Well, I guess you just do not take into account everything related to story building or style, and you concentrate completely on doing something that is practically a porn movie! This Italian turkey was inspired by the successful slavery saga of Richard Fleischer "Mandingo", launched a year earlier, but as the manufacturers were too lazy to think of a different title, one should not expect anything that remotely resembles a narrative depth. Character drawings, disturbing environment or statements that reflect on intercultural relations. "MandingA" is purely and simply an effort of sexual exploitation where the plot only develops over the last ten minutes, that is, when you stopped worrying a long time ago. The characters in this film are a meeting of despicable bastards, which, of course, is to be expected when it comes to white people who are wealthy and detestable who run a plantation in South America. The old man and the owner of this place is a widower (who probably also won a couple of awards "Mustache of the Year") that exploits and lashes the slaves who work for him. Her lover, who I understood correctly is also her cousin (?), Is a real bitch of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and escapes from home during the night to copulate with crucified slaves. When the plantation owner's son returns from Europe, after approximately 25 minutes of purely lost runtime, the plot begins to develop slightly at last. The handsome young man has sex with the malicious woman a couple of times (even in front of the slaves, supposedly to "demonstrate" how his masters do it?) But finally he falls in love with the daughter of the cherub preacher. Her romantic preference obviously causes the bitch to become angry with rage, and plans an act of horribly cruel revenge that will change the life of the plantation forever. Hears ?? I just realized that this brief description of the plot makes "Mandinga" sound like an interesting movie! Well, NO, and I apologize if I raise someone's anticipations. It's an incredibly boring and frightening movie to fight for, but if the themes appeal to you, then definitely check out the aforementioned "Mandingo." More than an unhealthy exploitation, that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of the darkest pages in the history of humanity and it was also a properly produced film, with real actors, excellent music and impressive filming locations. "Mandinga" has nothing, absolutely nothing to offer.
