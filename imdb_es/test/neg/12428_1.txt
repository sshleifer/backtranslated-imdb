OMG, another bad movie by Larry Buchanan. That guy did not learn to stop, right? First, it offers us low-budget sci-fi movies and lies about famous dead people, and now the Loch Ness Monster is exploiting as vicious. <br /> <br /> The "plot" is basically about some southerners USA pretending to be Scottish camping at Loch Ness. Unfortunately, in the fishing hole, oops, I mean the lake of Loch Ness, there is an inflatable murderous monster who calls himself Nessie, who strives to kill people for no apparent reason. > I am surprised that the MST3K team has never heard of this movie. Yes, it is so bad too.
