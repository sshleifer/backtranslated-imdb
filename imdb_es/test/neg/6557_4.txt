I have been a big fan of the original crew of the Enterprise since I was eight years old. I saw all the films and I appreciated each of them for what they kept from the previous series and for the subsequent development of the characters (and the Star Trek universe, in general). Even in "The Undiscovered Country", I thought that the aging of the characters was well managed and that the story was worthy of a theatrical premiere. However, having said that, "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" is easily the worst in the series with the original team. I agree with many that the camaraderie of Kirk, Spock and McCoy is well managed, but the general script, the direction of William Shatner and the special effects are worthy of nothing more than a television episode. This is a "movie of friends" and, sometimes, almost unrecognizable as a Star Trek movie. The sequences of action are not sustained and, therefore, generate little or no tension. The dialogue is weak, although it does provide some laughter, both intentional and unintended. The Klingons seem launched as a late occurrence. The whole concept of "Sha-Ka-Ree" is simply silly and Laurence Luckinbill, an excellent actor in everything else in which I've seen him, addresses the absurdity of this film. The scene in which Sybok evokes images of Spock's pain and McCoy's pain breaks the image of the characters as we have known them. Spock would never be part of that stupidity and McCoy, trying to save his father, is filled with insipid and redundant dialogue and completely wastes the acting skills of DeForest Kelley. The whole scene is wasted and does not really show us anything new or anything that we want to see from these characters. I understand that Shatner did not have the luxury of working with ILM for special effects and that the budget for this film was limited, but that does not allow such a bad story. In some respects, I think this story fits in with the previous series, but movies like "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" have a much better quality than this one. It's a pity that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie. The focus on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is nice, but very used. The old team really seems out of place. I liked the old General Klingon and the sensual Romulan at the bar. I liked some of the humor and the idea that Spock has a half brother, but that's it. If this were a television episode, I could accept many of the flaws. As a movie, this is nothing more than a bad creation of uninspired movies. It's also a shame, because I want this movie to be good. Even if it was the level of "Star Trek III" I would be happy, but this movie makes all the other movies in this series look like Shakespeare plays.
