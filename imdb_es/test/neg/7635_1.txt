This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. It's a thriller with a pretty ridiculous ending. I saw this movie hoping for the best and I found something really bad. The movie was starred by two actors that I really like, Rebecca DeMornay and Antonio Banderas. Of course they had a decent chemistry together, but for what? To begin with, the premise of the film was bad and the execution made it even worse. <br /> <br /> Miss DeMornay plays Sarah Taylor, a psychologist who tries to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense depends on multiple personality disorder. That will give you an idea of ​​where the film is going and the killer's identity. At the beginning of the film, she receives an unexpected visit from her father. This was done in the 1990s, when the bad father was the protagonist of Hollywood, it is another clue to the final conclusion. <br /> <br /> Mr. Banderas plays a mysterious man named Tony Ramírez, who enters Sarah's life. The whole first encounter and the first meeting between Tony and Sarah is so badly done and so unconvincing that it makes you wonder how it went off. And there is a sequence in which the two are supposed to know each other, which is so happy that it does not seem to belong here. One thing I must admit is that there was a sex scene that is very hot. Anyway, creepy things start to happen after he arrives, strange packages arrive, things that fall off the wall and could kill Sarah, an incident that says things are no longer normal. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was poorly conceived, the editing sometimes seems unstable and the conclusion was ridiculous. Another thing that bothered me about this movie was all the orchestral music playing in the background. A more subtle musical score would have been better. I have to say this, no matter how bad the ending is, Miss DeMornay was very good in that sequence. It is sad that he has never received first class materials in his career. She is that rare combination of talent and beauty.
