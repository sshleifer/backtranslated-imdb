Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART? It was starring Mel Gibson, who also directed and was guided by Randall Wallace. The movie contains more than 200 errors. Does anyone remember THE GREEN BERETS? That is John Wayne's western where the duke saves a farm called Vietnam from a group of injustices of the communist tribe. If you see WE WERE SOLDIERS, you can not help but remember these two movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, with the Scottish lament that has been played three times in the film, four if they count the final credits? I mean, what is the connection between Scotland and `Nam? Maybe Wallace is using it with the vain hope that because BRAVEHEART was bombed (without deserving it I can add), with several Oscars then, could this movie? Whatever the reason, it is included in the jars. Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I expected him to say something like "They will never take our freedom - Hell they will" and it is impossible not to notice other similarities with THE GREEN BERETS as the plot secondary of a journalist who takes a gun and becomes a warrior and Moore tells the reporter about the guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the Wayne movie. <br /> <br /> When he does not remember him the audience to others The WWS films also do not rely on their own legs, they are based on real events in 1965, but they seem to lack the integrity needed to do justice to history, they never feel like 1965 and they lack sense of time and place, probably because it was filmed in America not in Asia. Hal Moore may have reviewed the French experience in Indochina, but if that is the case, then he was unique because the US military did everything possible not to read about the Indochinese French War, in fact when asked about in the previous conflict , Westmoreland replied that he had nothing to learn from the French "Who did not win a war since the days of Napoleon", so I was confused by the portrait of the NVA in this film, when in 1965 the US high command, Brimming with arrogance to the North Vietnamese and VC in contempt. It is as if history had been rewritten to show that Vietnam's rice growers are superlative warriors. They are, but very few Americans believed this in the mid-1960s. <br /> <br /> Are there a couple of other things that confused me, like the way wives at home receive telegrams telling them that your husbands are dead? No body is shown flying back to the base and no one is seen on the screen referring to who was killed in the La Drang valley. Similarly, there are no reinforcements on the screen, so how do we suddenly see Americans outnumber the NVA? I put this as Wallace address / editing errors that do not strike me as a director, and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle. Take the scene in which the burned American abruptly goes flying screaming "Tell my wife that I love her". This should have an emotional impact similar to ESA's death scene in PLATOON, but here there is no impact. In fact, I found the clich√© and condescending scene, and he is not the only character that says "Tell my wife ..." while he was mutilated or dying, I told that at least two other characters use the phrase. Do the characters really say this in battle? I have no idea, but since Randall Wallace wrote the script, I have reservations <br /> <br /> I was amazed to see APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS made me cry, I laughed at FULL METAL JACKET, I kept looking at my watch with THE DEER HUNTER, and after seeing WE WER SOLDIERS I felt totally sponsored.
