A group of teenagers has their car broken down in the middle of nowhere. They seek refuge in a farmhouse. But three murderous convicts are killing the owner of that farm and his family. One of them accidentally attracts zombies when shooting down a scarecrow. Cue blood, gore, carnage, bad acting. Better than the first but only by default. I still do not want it in my archenemy, Bob. In the end, the filmmaker wants it to be a parable about how we, the Americans, are killing ourselves and our forests (eh? Okay, whatever the friend) Friend, I would rather cut down forests and then lower my brains and my gray matter escape. my ears. In other words, become a simple-minded liberal idiot. <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
