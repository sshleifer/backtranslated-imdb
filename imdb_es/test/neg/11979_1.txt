Being a fan of the game and watching this movie made me throw up physically! <br /> <br /> It was a horrible movie, although the story was similar to the plot of the games. The whole matter of human super-soldiers. Apart from that, Jack Carver, a completely American man in the game, is played by a germ, unless that's a kind of twisted irony, that's what made me move a middle finger on the screen of my TV in the moment when it started. The fact that it can be known that it is filmed in a forest in the middle in what appeared to be the middle of summer, is uncertain because the game takes place in the rainforest, while it seems that the director just looked out the window. in the morning and I went "that's a good forest". <br /> <br /> THIS IS A NOTE FOR ALL DIRECTORS: If you ever plan to make a movie based on a game / book, get it and share it with the fans. It's ... do not play it just for an hour and assume you know it.
