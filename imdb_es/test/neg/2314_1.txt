1 hour and 40 minutes of conversation: boring conversation, more conversation and more. It's hard for me to understand how an actress like Anne Parillaud, who shined magnificently in Femme Fatale, would sign up for a piece of shit! Amazing. If you need a drink, this movie could help, although I would prefer good classical music. unfortunately, I have just discovered that I have to write 10 lines for my comment to appear, that is almost as incredible! therefore, brief and concise comments of one or two sentences that express the central focus of a film are not enough. Geez, people. I realized and do not waste your time with more unnecessary words, like this movie does. Wolfgang
