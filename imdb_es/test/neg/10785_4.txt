I can not believe that some of the scores of this film are on the IMDb website! Have I been given the naff version of Special Edition? Edited by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be located in Battersea. I am sorry for all the references centered in the United Kingdom, but if you are in another place and you do not have nails to cut or you do not have a collection of beer mats to catalog, this movie could be worth 90 minutes of your rest. useful life (as long as you do not have paint to observe the drying). The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing are amazingly fists. What the hell is Irons doing in this movie?
