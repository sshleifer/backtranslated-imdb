Hi guys and girls! Never rent, or God forbid, buy this piece of garbage. I have rarely seen a movie in a genre as bad as this one. The acting is actually worse than what I and my friends did when we were 7 years old and in the 1st grade we had to act in front of all the parents and siblings. In fact, we would have been evaluated for the Oscars, if we were compared with the actors in Darkhunters. The story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, the filming is terrible, the scenery is terrible, the direction is terrible, etc. I really can not find ANYTHING that is worth the money spent to watch this movie ... Maybe except all the cats, which my girlfriend thought were a little cute Please use your money in other things than in this movie. .. I could not even see the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, it was so terrible ... If someone really liked this movie, I REALLY would like to hear from you and try to see if I can get you advice in a psychiatrist's office near you .. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, actually then, if possible ... It's not worth the DVD or the tape is on ..
