As an avid movie fan, I felt that while classifying my favorite movies I felt it was fair to classify my most hated films. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I really do not have anything positive to say about that movie. In fact, it's one of the only two movies I've come out of. To be fair, I went back to watch the movie again to give it another try and sat through it just to wish that I should have walked away. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that the film has a really decent cast and crew. ... but even the brightest stars in Hollywood can not give life to a dead duck from a script. <br /> <br /> Get away ... Save yourself from this truly lamentable "movie" 1/10
