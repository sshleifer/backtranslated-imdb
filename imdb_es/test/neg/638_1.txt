What do you get when you put Lou Diamond Philips, Todd Bridges, Barry Corbin with a bad toupee and an extraterrestrial on a train? You get a very bad movie called "Alien Express" or "Dead Rail" that would be more entertaining in the old Comedy Central series "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Whatever it is, this horrible movie suffered in areas of acting, plot, history and special effects. In fact, the outside passenger train footage seemed like the production staff used a common HO scale model in front of a painted background! The rest of the special effects go downhill from there. <br /> <br /> The plot is very predictable and is similar to two movies from the 1970s called "Horror Express" and a disaster movie called "The Cassandra Crossing". At least "The Cassandra Crossing" had a better cast, an attractive story and scenes of real trains. <br /> <br /> If you want a good laugh and a movie to make fun of a "B movie" party, then look at this. ; otherwise, "Alien Express" was derailed long before leaving the station!
