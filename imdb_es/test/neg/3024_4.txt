Waste is just that, a waste of time. Today, MTV is producing movies for TV at a considerable rate. A friend of mine recommended this to me and I rented it, it goes without saying that I will not follow more recommendations from her in the short term. This movie shows the roller coaster of drug use. The problem is that you really do not care about any of the characters because of the lack of credibility and their self-discipline. This film is in one word, annoying to see, from the terrible angles of the camera to the quality of dialogue and rhythm. The 'digital' format tries realism, but it is distracting. If you want a true scope in the use of drugs, look at Requiem for a Dream.
