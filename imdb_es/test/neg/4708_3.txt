I know ... I know: it is difficult (if not paradoxical) that there is a "credible" fantasy. But, for me, there is also a condition in which MUCH INCREDIBLE TOO interferes with, or distracts from, my general opinion of the movie. The latter was the case for me regarding Goliath Awaits. Not only did I have too many unanswered questions regarding the story, but also some of the performances, I thought, were a bit exaggerated. (Maybe, however, it was the writing: asking them to recite too many trivial, predictable, cliched (over) reactions.) I just wish it had been done, and I think it COULD have been, more convincing. Q. S .: This is a FRESCO comment on this movie: I just saw her a couple of minutes ago, it's not a memory of years ago.
