This has to be one of the best horror films of all time. Charles Band made the best 96 'film in this little gem seen. Highly realistic and incredibly stylized, with a visual style that David Fincher would envy, it's not hard to see why Band went on to make classics like 'Killjoy 2: Deliverance From Evil', 'Regina Pierce Affair', 'Virgins of Sherwood Forest', and 'Timegate: Tales of the Saddle Tramps'. <br /> <br /> With a highly sophisticated story, a tiny body with a big head controls a family of weirdos who perform experiments with naked women, this film may be too much for younger viewers and it's just for the kind of more educated viewer, but for those who see it, Band can convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece. The head is a symbol of lost love and longing for the inner being that we all must face at one time or another, and for this reason I was able to participate in this film on a deeply personal level. Although many previous critics have compared the film of Band with Re-animator and other minor works, this is the head and heels above the rest. It is fatter, but not without meaning. The gore in this movie is well designed and used to improve the plot, instead of simply getting a cheap cry from the audience. Also, the special effects in this movie are absolutely excellent, easily the best work done in a horror movie since ... well ... always! The work in this film makes the effects of Savini look like the work of a blind tramp without limbs. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this film is the large number of frontal nudes, which ultimately were not necessary to achieve the composer's goal: to create a timeless epic that will always go down in history as the best movie of all time. If it were not for this little problem, I would have given this movie a perfect 10.
