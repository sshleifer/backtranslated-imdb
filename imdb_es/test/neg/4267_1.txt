I find that the criticism of many IMDb users is a bit harsh and, in many cases, they find that they criticize the film from a very professional point of view and not that of the street kid who wants to sit down and see something to RECEIVE everything. <br /> <br /> In this case, however, I have to say it was BAD. I'm addicted to SciFi and there was NOTHING in this movie that caught me even for a second. <br /> <br /> There was not an adequate story. I may be an idiot, but I still do not know where the GOVERNMENT was that was so concerned about these pieces. <br /> <br /> The pathetic attempt of the main character to put together these 3 pieces is terrifying. Half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third. A 3-year-old boy could have put them together. <br /> <br /> This movie was BAD. <br /> <br /> Dominic
