While this is not one of the worst films of Miss Davies, it's pretty bad. And it's sad that, in a revisionist way, recent IMDb reviewers have deliberately inflated the scores in some of their films to compensate for the fact that they have been disparaged in the past, or so it seems. For years, conventional wisdom has been that Davies was a terrible actress and only got the papers she got because her boyfriend, William Randolph Hearst, bought his way to Hollywood. This is certainly the image created in the KANE CITIZEN of Orson Welles. It is true that Hearst used his considerable wealth and influence to build Davies' career. With all this money, it is not surprising that he has made some excellent films and it is not surprising that people have become angry because of all the extra attention he received. Sleeping with the man who finances your films is meant to be noticed. However, despite this advantage, he also made a decent number of bad movies and I think we really need a balance when it comes to the scores of his films. After all, no rational person could believe that as of today (1/5/08), PEG O 'MY HEART and two other Davies movies recently shown in Turner Classic Movies (THE FLORODORA GIRL and MARIANNE) deserved the ratings exceptionally high: classifying them higher than in films like HIGH NOON, BEN HUR, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES AND EVERY QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT! In fact, MARIANNE would now rank as the fifth best movie in history according to IMDb with a score of 8.8! Considering that most people out there do not even know who Marion Davies was and most of his films were financial disasters, this is a serious problem! However, she was a much better actress than CITIZEN KANE hinted at and initially broke into movies before starting to sleep with Hearst. THE FLORODORA GIRL were nice little movies, while PEG O 'MY HEART is in some ways just terrible. Much of the reason was Marion's terrible mistreatment. While his French accent on MARIANNE was nice, at PEG his Irish accent just sounded strange, not particularly Irish. Also, and maybe I'm wrong, but his continued use of the word "ye" makes it look like Shakespeare should be doing, not a movie set in Ireland in 1933! In addition, there was an unusual insistence that Marion should be the star with multiple talents consummated, so they not only performed, but also danced and sang. The song actually fit the scripts of some of his films, but here it seemed out of place and played down the film. It seemed that Hearst could almost be heard screaming "look, she is a great actress, watch her and dance". Unfortunately, Marion looked uncomfortable and out of place in many of these scenes. But for me, the biggest problem was the idea that Marion, 36, plays such a youthful role. It was obvious that the character he played at the beginning of the film was supposed to be the one that Mary Pickford played in adolescence and the twenties, complete with pork tails and a brave attitude. Miss Pickford COULD carry out these roles even though she was not a child either. But here, Marion had gained some weight and seemed to be at least 30. Do not be offended, she looked good for her age, but she did not look like a teenager! <br /> <br /> Interestingly, with the millions that Hearts spent on Marion's career, she never realized that the most important thing she needed to spend her money on was a good script and one that fit the talents of Marion. Believe me, I have rated several of your films as very high (especially I love SHOW PEOPLE), but here you could not avoid failure: this movie was a turkey.
