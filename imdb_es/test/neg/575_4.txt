In the first place, Blythe Danner does not look anywhere close to being old enough to play Capshaw's daughter (and, in fact, she is not, only ten years apart). <br /> <br /> I understand that it is supposed to be one. Of those magical, supernatural romances of the Moonstruck type, but this is beyond the pale. Very, very weak in terms of acting, script and direction. <br /> <br /> The only one that really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this film visible, if not really credible to herself, since she is a kind of heterosexual hound. But endearing nonetheless. Actually, DeGeneres and the skin shots of the young people with whom Capshaw dallies meets make this visible. But nobody can really say if Capshaw is really in love with the young man or not; neither the script nor its performance join us and we wonder how it really feels.
