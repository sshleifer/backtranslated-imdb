Unfortunately, this film is typical of the risk of a good movie with numerous sequels. Universal made several movies of monsters in series in the 1940s, which were pale imitations of the original. The intelligent Egyptologist Imhotep has been replaced by a Frankenstein who drags his legs with mummy wrappings, which shows no signs of intelligent life. This movie is entertaining in places, but if you have seen The Mummy (1932), you will be disappointed.
