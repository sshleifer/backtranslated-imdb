Now the television programs (at least in England) are full of home improvements, bargain hunting, house hunting and cooking programs in the afternoons, the possibility that any of the terrestrial broadcasting organizations take out complete darkness as is to occupy a couple. The screen hours on a slow afternoon are scarce, to say the least. But in the eighties, the BBC did just that, and guess what, I saw it. And it's a testament to the extraordinary weirdness of this Hungarian-American co-production that I can still remember large portions of it, more than twenty years later. To start, the hero of the same name appears briefly during the initial titles, only to disappear again for at least half an hour. (Imagine AN American TAIL reissued so that Feivel can not be seen anywhere, and you will appreciate how confusing this is.) There is an extremely strange animation in which one of the characters gets his carefully waxed mustache tight and stretched, complete with an effect of boingy sound that makes it go to the boss's eyes. Probably hilarious if you're drugged, but for a child, quite unsettling. Speaking of which, the infamous scene of 'hippos' is represented in an abstract way (the clouds in vague forms of hippos are struck by lightning) but it is still quite unpleasant. In fact, this film is quite cold and unflattering, a sad situation hardly helped by the strange-looking production design, all the muddy colors, the trembling lines, the swollen shapes and that European singularity that reminds us of Jan Svankmajer, but not so convincing Then, to top it off, we got songs from the Osmonds! This is not so much a horrible movie as a very badly oriented one, it is not as ghostly as a bad trip.
