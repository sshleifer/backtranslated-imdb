Eliza Dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. She manages to be the stable center of "Tru Calling" but that is not enough to rescue her television series from mediocrity. It is a real shame that a woman as attractive and talented as Dushku should go from a substantial supporting role in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" to this clown. <br /> <br /> Unoriginal and desperately trying to be hip, "Tru Calling" does not get excited at any level above the hormonal. The heroine of the same name spends a great part of her time going through what must be a very small city, to avoid the death of the good-looking corpses she already knew in the morgue where she works. In spite of everything that runs, it always arrives as if it had just left a portable dressing room with air conditioning. <br /> <br /> In each episode, Eliza Dushku and the rest of the cast struggle to give life to insipid and characterless scripts, but it is a meaningless exercise. "Tru Calling" is only found on the slab, looking lifeless at the ceiling.
