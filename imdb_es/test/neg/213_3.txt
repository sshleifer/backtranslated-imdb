Okay, I thought the trailer was pretty good, so I had high hopes for this movie, and besides, with the cast line up, I was sure I could not get less than 6 in my books. However, I entertained myself for half an hour in the story ... just where normal movies get good, this movie reached the bottom. <br /> <br /> SPOILER * The guy everyone is trying to help is so attentive to other people getting hurt in the middle of the hustle and bustle that they go to their colleagues to save a vagabond and then lock themselves in one of the armored trucks . Not only that, but constantly trying to draw the attention of other people, so it ends up endangering more people and, in short, the result is that not only is responsible for the death of the homeless, but also that a police officer is shot and kidnapped his younger brother ... ah and his 5 colleagues dying in disgrace. <br /> <br /> But in the end he is HAPPY because he regained his senses halfway, so what if all his colleagues are now dead instead of following the plan and being millionaires? This movie tried to be so politically correct that it makes me sick! It ruined a good story. Real shame.
