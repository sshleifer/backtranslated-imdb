It's just an action movie about a Terminator-type android that is built and trained for the army. When a defect is discovered, it is issued to be deprogrammed. Instead of facing death, he decides to flee to the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him there, leading to a great action party. <br /> <br /> Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance on the android. His movements and gestures seem mechanical enough to do the job. Current scientific realism is abandoned to make a good action hero. And works; The action scenes are not so spectacular, but they are not so bad either. The performance of the other characters is pretty bad, but I did not expect anything too good. The special effects were also decent. <br /> <br /> It's just decent as an action movie, but very forgettable. It lacks the substance that most movies possess. But if you just want to spend a couple of hours without thinking much, this will do the job.
