I rented this DVD because I'm a big fan of science fiction, but this thing (I will not call it a movie, because obviously it was recorded very quickly in the video) it seemed to be invented as they went along. I'm still not sure what it was. There are these guys dressed in some weird S & M costumes, and I suppose they're from another planet, anyway, it does not make much sense in this low, low, low budget movie. If it was their first movie, it would give them a bit of slack, but I think it's like their fifth movie and it's really VERY bad. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting, not a good actor is this movie. This director must have been crazy to work even in a horrible movie like this. Do not waste your time or money on this DVD, please, the people do not. It's not even worth the 0.99 cents I paid to rent the DVD. In fact, I'm going to tell you that the DVD was messy to recover my money. I do not believe in giving a bad review, but I must do it here. My advice to anyone involved in this sinking ship is: look for another profession to enter. How could you make a rotten movie like this? I would give these negative stars if possible, it is that terrible.
