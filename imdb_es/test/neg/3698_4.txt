This is the kind of movie that BEGS will show on TV at 3 or 4 in the morning, if at all. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the filmmakers responsible for the "Attack of the 50-foot woman" thought they made a pertinent statement about women, acts of corruption and the dangers of demon rum, all wrapped up in an allegory of science fiction. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it was a tax reduction. <br /> <br /> Either way, "Attack" is better for the viewer in the following circumstances: a) extreme intoxication, b) seen on a double bill with any of those Jacqueline Suzanne films (maybe "Eleven") is Not Not Enough? ") or just one night when you feel insecure and the world around you is too perfect. Press "Attack" and you'll feel great, guaranteed! <br /> <br /> It's good to laugh at the expense of Hokey's script, the special FX and the four-eyed sheriff. And I think the last line should be engraved on a monument somewhere in Washington D.C. - It's so memorable. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "The attack of the woman of 50 feet"; Buy a copy, mail it to Gloria Steinem, she will love it for that.
