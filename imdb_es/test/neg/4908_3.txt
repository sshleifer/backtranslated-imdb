[The warning contains spoilers] <br /> <br /> I did not feel any sympathy for any of the characters, including the main one, who overcomes the death of his girlfriend, very quickly, (but it's okay while he sleeps with an ex prostitute of the casino where he works). The main character is presented as this wonderful intelligent writer who finds himself involved in a network of deceptions, while in his monologue of the book he is writing. I can not say that I would buy the book, maybe it would have been a much better premise if the voiceover (which bothers to narrate any fragment of the movie that you might not have understood through your book) had 52 different personalities ... to represent each card in the deck, but I'm rambling. In the end there was a turn, for which the main character was configured by someone close to him, but since I did not like his character so much at this point (I did not like anyone in this movie, the characters are all one-dimensional. I really did not care, and I was glad that the movie was over. <br /> <br /> More points: English emergency actress with a bit of a South African accent Less points: an irritating movie
