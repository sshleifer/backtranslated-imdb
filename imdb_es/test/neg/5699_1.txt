I rented this movie because I love Kristanna Loken and I've seen her on many TV shows and, since she's having 15 minutes of fame today with her new movie T3, I wanted to see what other movies she's been on. <Br /> <br /> She's fine in terms of acting. It's not good or bad either. She makes up for everything by being extremely beautiful. YUMMMMM <br /> <br /> Rodney Rowland was quite a surprise as a hero. He provided the only solid good acting in the film. He is a very good actor and probably should be an action star. <br /> <br /> In addition to Kristanna being fine and Rodney being really good, everything else about this film is trash in its purest form. <br /> <br /> A hacker hacks the system of an airplane from the ground and, using a joystick, tries to hit the plane against a nuclear power station ... or something like that. And, of course, there are heroes who stand in their way and ruin their game. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst scripts I've seen in my life and it does not surprise me that it was a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> The surprising thing is that this movie was made in 2001 and it has too many similarities with the tragedies of September 11th. <br /> <br /> Why do they make movies like this in the first place? <br /> <br /> Panic *: a star (a loss of too good actors) (also a waste of time) (also known as Air Panic)
