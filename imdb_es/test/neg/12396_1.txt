This was a pathetic movie. The Alien was decent, but the movie itself gave a new meaning to regrettable. The plot is something that has been done over and over again! However, this does the worst! The performance was c ** p, the scenes were often too dark to understand what was happening. No one developed any concern for the main character. The film was too slow, and the murder scenes that were produced were stupid and ended up looking more interesting than the rest of the movie. There are some movies that "stink" but can still be enjoyed due to their outrage, but this does not even have that! Whoever made this movie thought he could do something good and failed miserably. There is nothing to offer this movie, except a headache. Avoid it!
