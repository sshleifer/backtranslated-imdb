This series takes a classic story and turns it into garbage. Robin is somehow baffled by a moose man in the forest and is involved in all kinds of druidism and completely satanic episodes. The story is more about him avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor. This is barely visible. And first of all ridiculous that kill Robin at the end of the series 2 and replace him with another actor. Some people may like this program as a fantasy program, but it is NOT a Robin Hood program. If you want Robin to fight in the name of King Richards against Prince John and the sheriff and if you want Robin to feed the poor and oppressed, look at the classic series or the newest one on the BBC.
