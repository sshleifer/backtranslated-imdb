Kennan Ivory Wayans was so funny in Low Down Dirty Shame that I had to see him and it was one of the worst he's done and Steven Seagal did not help much. It starts with some religious murders that do not make much sense to Jim Campbell (Keenan). He is surprised to see a new partner who expects him to work by his side to solve the case, but Jack Cole does not seem to be who everyone thinks it is until Jack's ex-wife is killed in one of those ritual murders that they end up committing. The suspect too. It's the same as all his other films: Smoke's past, the CIA's involvement and now trying to be a normal cop. Why did Steven dress like he was from a western movie? And the prayer on top of that makes things a bit confusing.
