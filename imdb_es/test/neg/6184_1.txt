Many people have taken photos in Platoon and Born on July 4, among other people, and call them "left propaganda films." Now it's my turn to take a political picture in a movie. For me, this film is very impressive in certain religious beliefs and in its political views. <br /> <br /> The acting and the writing were a bit cliché for my taste. It seems that Mel Gibson likes to play in these violent unnecessary movies and proves it once again by partnering with his partner Randall Wallace to get another one. Throughout this film there was a prototype of trash "Tell my family that I love them" or "Tell Ronny to pray before he goes to bed". I was so overloaded with these garbage recirculation lines that I felt I had to vomit. What about that scene in which Gibson's wife is going to wash her clothes and this "no colors" applies to what is placed in the washing machine? It was in the mid-sixties when she was trapped under a rock without realizing the racism that surrounded her. Another scene is where Gibson's daughter asks him what the war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter. <br /> <br /> The management showed all this perfectly. The innumerable scenes of Gibson and his family or soldiers praying. I'm fine with showing that once or twice, but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to put something in my head. How many scenes with the American flag at its best were shot with melodramatic music activated. The director also seems to have won some kind of victory in Vietnam. What exactly was his earned. The cinematography was the worst of all, with the slowest scenes, see the American flag in the scenes at a distance. I love America, but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do. <br /> <br /> This may seem like a rant and maybe it is, but I can not stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with whatever their country looks like wrong. This film for me is narrow and limited in many ways. He tells me that if you're not a Christian, you're wrong. If God or Jesus wanted people to kill, I do not believe it. For me this movie was offensive. At first, this movie was fun with the innumerable clichés and exaggerated scenes, but then, when I looked at what this movie was about to say or not, it was really frustrating to see it. I guess it's my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one takes this comment offensively because I am not criticizing religion or patriotism, but some of the narrow-minded people who like them so much and dismiss everyone else. <br /> <br /> If you want a real representation of Vietnam. War Watch Platoon, born on July 4, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or The Killing Fields. Even Full Metal Jacket, which he hated completely, was a better description. I have read a quote that, in context, says that a true patriot does not go with everything the government or the country does, but questions it when it is wrong. A true patriot loves his country too much to see him do bad things.
