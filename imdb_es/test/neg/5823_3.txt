Close but no cigar! - That's my opinion of this movie! TAG PURVIS wrote and directed this script, which should have been rewritten before shooting. Sometimes, laughable because or a cheesy script, the bright star of this film is Dan Mongomery Jr and the Director of Photography. Both talents are the ones that must be taken into account in the future. My recommendation is to wait until you get to your local cable station and use the rental money in a classic!
