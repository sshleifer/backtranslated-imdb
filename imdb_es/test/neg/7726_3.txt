I was on a mission to see Uwe Boll movies to see if they were really as bad as all that. The first one I saw, BloodRayne, was not a complete loss. I liked it more than most people, and I actually rated it with a 4 out of 10. The next one was the first House of the Dead movie. Now that was horribly bad. I could stand to see ten minutes of that, and move forward a little, and that was it. I could see where he was going and did not need to see more to qualify with only 1 of 10. <br /> <br /> But I also had access to the sequel (which however, is not by Uwe Boll, but, mysteriously, is written by the same guys who wrote the first one so incompetently, and since I got a higher rating on IMDb than the original, I thought I'd give it a shot, and actually I managed to see it all. It started with some fun references and cool lines (Like the way the president received his orders from the vice president!), And in terms of acting, it's better than the first light years ... Here we have great girls like the ultra-hot Emmanuelle Vaugier, whose coldness is in harmony with Carrie-Anne Moss, Claudia Black and Evangeline Lilly, man, I hope that some Matrix-style movie will be presented to her at some point, and Victoria Pratt's always delicious, super aerobics, I love athletic women. there was also Nadine Vel√°zquez (Catalina in "My Name Is Earl"), who performed well. <br /> <br /> The story was not much, and the action was not very good either, and the ending was a disappointment, as they were not successful in their mission. Oh well, at least the two principals survived. I guess it's also a small victory. <br /> <br /> Good deal, but a pretty bad movie. The actors make it visible, but there is no real substance there. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
