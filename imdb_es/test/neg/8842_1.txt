I'm seeing all the good reviews about this movie and I start to think to myself ... Am I going crazy ...? Can not I see the beauty of a movie like this ...? Am I foolish enough not to understand the message that this film is trying to point out? I do not know ... maybe one of those lizards came into my head and it also ate my whole brain. The idea of ​​the film was not going anywhere ... I was sure it would have a hazy end, and of course ... it was like that! Nothing exceptional ... Not even the landscapes (I realized that being in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice ... but not). Just a boring story about a mad professor, and of course his crazy students ... now all grown up, each one of them ... with his own fixed ideas. And, boy, some of those ideas were stupid ... like the story of the lizards, for example. At one point I thought I was watching x files ... with the lizard entering the ear and everything. No ... from my point of view, this movie is a waste of time (not to mention money if U pays the ticket). The only part that I liked was the performance of the young "German" blue-eyed boy ... He played very well and convinced for his age ... The rest ... nothing! I read the previous review and I think both the writer and the director were drugged when they came up with those ideas. Well, considering there are many people who enjoyed this movie ... I think to myself again ... Maybe I'm the crazy one. Advice .. Do not waste your time with this!
