Oh, there are many worse Wayne movies. This movie is badly edited but it has a campy element that makes it nice. The villain is an Anglo-Saxon actor who wears ridiculous Mexican clothes and affects an exaggerated Mexican accent that is hilarious. The girl is dressed as an aspiring Jean Harlow, this is 1934 after all. At least the location photos are beautiful and nice. <br /> <br /> Look at it and laugh. Do not expect a serious western, but a light and superficial story with bad acting but occasional flashes of camp humor. Wayne is almost ridiculously young and handsome, and one can see how his acting ability flourished years after this unfortunate adventure.
