I think this program is a load of garbage. All they do is argue and slap each other and call this act ?! These people are paid a lot of money for this and most of them can not even act to save their lives. Also, the story lines are horrible and after watching it for a few minutes, I get bored. I like the way Harry Hill eliminates Mickey in his TV show 'TV Burp', for example. the weak joke "The princess and the pea is not exactly Shakespeare, is it?" I had Sonia and Naomi in points. I do not see how funny it is. I think this is a waste of everyone's money for your TV license, so it can be shown 4/5 days a week. There's nothing better than this?
