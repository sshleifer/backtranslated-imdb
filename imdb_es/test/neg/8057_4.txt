This film is about the painful journey of a young man to discover his sexuality. <br /> <br /> The movie is raw and unpretentious. It is not based on torrid sex scenes to attract viewers. Although the plot may seem incoherent and disconnected at times, and some events are not adequately explained. However, I can understand it because this movie is a collection of memories that are very personal to the director. The secondary argument about his sister and mother probably does not need to exist in the movie, but I can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his life. <br /> <br /> The low budget of the film is clearly noticeable. It's a pity that the sound effects are wrong. The narration and some dialogues (particularly the scene in the classroom with the French teacher) have a lot of resonance, which makes it difficult to distinguish what is said. Ambient noise, noticeable traffic noise, is also captured throughout the film. When one scene cuts to another, the traffic noise level changes. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably not entertaining, but it certainly serves as an insightful diary of a young man's journey to embrace his sexuality.
