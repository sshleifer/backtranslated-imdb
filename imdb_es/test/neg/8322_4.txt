This movie is terrible, and do not blame Jesus Franco, because it's not his fault. <br /> <br /> This film was recorded in silence for many years by Welles when he got the money to gather a team and the actors. to make some shots. The amount of film that Welles actually filmed is not clear, although not all the film or all the sequences are here, since several "key" sequences, like Don Quixote in a movie theater, are in the hands of collectors or sponsors who do not they would. Release them. The movie here is just under two hours and it would be hard to imagine that it has ever really worked. I am of the opinion, based on several comments that Welles made before his death, that he never intended to release the film, but to put it together as a personal toy. <br /> <br /> What exists here is For the most part it is beautifully shot, but dramatically dead. Very little happens during the first hour, apart from Quixote and Sancho, wandering the countryside. Bored would be a kind description of the material. In the second hour, Don Quixote ends in modern Spain and a series of not very good sequences deals with everyday life. This does not mean that there are not a few pleasant moments, the windmill and the chicken sequences are quite good, but it is mostly a waste of film and time. <br /> <br /> "Completed" by Jes√∫s Franco, who was assistant director of Welles in Chimes at Midnight, which is far superior, we have a lot of movie fragments that have been compiled as best as possible. Many people have crucified Franco as the reason why the movie stinks, but, frankly, you can not make a good movie with shitty stuff. One critic has recorded that he had seen a different cut of the film in the 1970s, which meant that Franco invented this version on his own and ruined it. Although it may be true, I have encountered stories of Welles cutting and trimming the film many times over the years, as he was never able to do well. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible, no matter how you do it. Cut it <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I wonder how good the filmmaker Welles was. Apart from Citizen Kane, almost all his films have been affected by lack of budget or have interfered, so we have the excuse that many of his films "would have been better if only ...". As we know? How can we know? Perhaps Welles was a man with less talent than we thought and many of his films on the limit are not so good, and never would have been. While this is not a place to discuss Welles's place in the history of cinema, the surviving material of Don Quixote, assuming that it approximates what Welles intended (I think so), is a good case to rethink how we see the man and his work. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 for good sequences (although 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality)
