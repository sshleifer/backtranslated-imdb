I'm a historian. This movie is so bad it hurts. I tried to see with an open mind, but if you're going to go deep into a movie or something, do at least some homework about the history, the places, the church protocol, etc. Stop playing the silly audience, please. There are some of us who put on our shoes and venture into the theater when something of this nature, worthy of a theatrical premiere, reaches the city. A little research, everything I ask. But, again, the book on which it is based is a joke in itself. Basically, they took a novel with many errors and decided to turn it into a script, invested millions and millions and millions of dollars in it and created a distributed theatrical release incredibly promoted around the world and at no time has anyone taken the time to do a little research on the lot of I know several of my colleagues who would have done it just for the credit or at least they would have given it to a group of students as a task for several weeks to investigate various aspects. or just pay someone with knowledge a couple of dollars just to review it because they trust me, there are many hungry historians who would have seized the opportunity if they had presented themselves.
