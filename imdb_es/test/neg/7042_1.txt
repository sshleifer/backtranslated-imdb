Oh, my God, that has to be one of the most pointless, pointless comedies ever made! What happened to Subhash Ghai, even the money of Apna Sapna The money was worth seeing <br /> <br /> Eww! GOD This movie stinks <br /> <br /> Do not watch it Save your money Bad movie Bad cast Bad jokes Bad acting, even this movie is an example of how you rubbed your face with a shoe cleaner <br /> <br /> Trust me. This movie even makes you smile, vulgar jokes, cheap jokes, a really stupid movie without concepts. <br /> <br /> Rating 0 in 10 <br /> <br /> IMAGINABLE film those are two hours I will never return ... <br /> <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
