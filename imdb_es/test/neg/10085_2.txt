Seeing this from time to time during some seasons, I can think of two things: one: wonder what kind of girl wants to be a "model" and run two to the nearest ice cream shop and have a low-fat ice cream. <Br /> <br /> I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of ​​this reality show contest. No other "famous" model thought of this, and it is very admirable that Tyra Banks does. But as the series continues, I've come to the conclusion that this is a lot of people trying to make a mountain out of a hill. Women should not see this, teenagers should avoid it unless they make book reports on the subject. <br /> <br /> Many women try to participate in the slot machines to compete for "Americas Next Top Model". They live together, they fight together, they cry together, they put themselves to the test with useless modeling sprouts with useless modeling people and fashionatas and they are eliminated and almost everyone says: "You will see me again". Heck, I'm trying to see what happened to those who won, really. <br /> <br /> This is some girls' dream, and good for them. Seeing this, I hope that the other girls see it and run like Hades in another way, like in college. <br /> <br /> It would happen that I observed more of this recent season due to the "stratagem" of the complete figure. Models that join the group. That even made me think more of this as a lot of pitiful people. The "full-figured models" were just average-sized women competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they have chosen, so of course, that would make them look even fatter: a "trick" "fashionable that is worn all the time. Bad, bad, Tyra and her team. <br /> <br /> But to be fair, "Americas Next Top Model" is not about "full figure" models, it is about projecting an imagined image, a beauty that can be commercialized en masse and sold as Last in beauty, and this show just looks for the next piece of fresh meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the unfortunate batch of judges, photographers, associations. Therefore, Tyra and her consistent "this was me" cover all the camera angles you can get. But, again, that is the only thing I like about this program, the former model that gives others who would not have the opportunity, the opportunity to enter through the doors. But after that ... everything else is a status quo for that industry, so there are no surprises or interest week by week in the program.
