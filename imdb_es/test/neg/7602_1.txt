This movie was so bad, so cheap and so cheesy that I thought it was one of the most boring and slow 80s movies I've ever seen. I like most of the cheap horror movies of the 80s, but I would never rent this again. It just did not make any sense. A family that lives in the forest invites their son, wife and daughter to spend time with them during the holidays and during the film, for some reason, the mother-in-law and the mother do not get along. We never understand why until almost the end of the movie, but until then, all we see is the fact that the mother has some kind of ESP and that the daughter-in-law is having nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe of what will happen to the unfortunate victims of this "thing" that we have no idea of ​​how "it" looks, all we see is a bright light that signals its focus and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of the voices of Darth Vadar and a band sound stolen from several horror movies. Then, when we finally discovered what and who is all I did was laugh. This "assassin" turns out to be a kind of Japanese extraterrestrial World War II warrior who has apparently come back to life to claim the mother and her family. And all the mother does is stand in front of the living room trembling with her hands on fire or something like she's going into some kind of seizure. This movie is pathetic! Avoid it, it's not even worth renting.
