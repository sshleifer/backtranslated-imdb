Yes. Those of my generation who grew up watching the old Sunbow cartoons went to waste. Joe's song of the 80s was one of the best cartoons in the history of television. Well-written stories, well-developed characters. Of course, it was nothing more than a glorified toy commercial, but it definitely helped bring that line of toys. Let's move forward almost twenty years later and enter Valor vs. Venom The animation was average at the most. The movement of the characters seemed uneven and puppet. The film felt more like a sequel to Small Soldiers than a story about a special military force. Then we have character development or lack of it. Dusty likes to be all Dusty? Does Slice and Dice like to do things together? What? Did the writers take a writing course on how to develop characters with the depth equivalent to Jar Jar Binks? As for the story. I like a bit of science fiction. But the whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army has taken to death in Joe's universe. Mega Monsters or Toxo-zombies to someone? But I give credit to the creators for trying to make fans happy by having martial arts action every 10 minutes. I'm not a big fan of SE and SS but I liked the fight scenes between the two. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is, you will enjoy it. I admit I can not appreciate VvV as I should. Again, everything compares to the ways it was done in the 80s, and honestly, nothing compares to the glory days of GI Joe. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is, you will enjoy it.
