I did not see this program much when I was little. And I think I only saw one episode that was about Railroads, I think, because I liked trains and I still do. Even then I thought it was a baby show. Mostly I looked at Arthur. The songs are pretty weird too. And I do not think it's that educational either. They just sang some childhood nonsense. This is a stupid show, all adults who like it are crazy! If you want some good children's shows, look something like Arthur, Mister Rogers Neighborhood or even better Pee-wee's Playhouse. I thought Sesame Street was boring when I was little, but even that is better than Barney. Trust me, this program is pretty silly, there are other children's programs that are better than this one. I can see many of the reviews here that many people do not like this show. Now there are some mature people. I hope you get this show out of the air soon.
