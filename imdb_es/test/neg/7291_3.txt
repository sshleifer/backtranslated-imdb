What the hell is wrong with Disney in recent years? Have you run out of good ideas? Where is the magic? Where are the good animators, the good composers, the good directors, the good ones ... All right, I know, Walt himself and the famous "nine old" can not come back. But is this a reason to unleash innumerable of those cheap sequels and destroy the Walt Disney ideals slowly but surely? However, I never rented or bought a Disney sequel to what movie. Because I had read enough about his (lack of) quality. But "Atlantis: The return of Milo" was broadcast today on television in Germany, so I see it. Confirmed my doubts about the sequels. It was absolutely boring. Animation of faults, rotation of primitive colors, simple characters, some unsuccessful attempts to simulate the famous multiplane camera with CGI, mediocre music and a mosaic of different and simple stories. It does not look quite like Disney! Not like Disney I know! It seems one of the countless, cheap and simple animation series like "DragonballZ", "Beyblade", etc. that were broadcast every day on children's television. <br /> <br /> My first reaction after showing this shit was to load "Bambi" on my DVD player, to see the immortal magic, depth, spirit and charm of Disney again, to see Disney in its climax again, to see again the impressive art of handmade animation. "Bambi" was the first (and until today the only) movie that I give 10 out of 10 stars. But "Atlantis: The return of Milo"? No magic, no depth, no charm, no spirit ... He only deserved 3 out of 10!
