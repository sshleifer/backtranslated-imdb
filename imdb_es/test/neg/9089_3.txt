This is strictly for Pryor fans. The fact that he was a great funny guy does not mean that this is more than a B-Movie. The script is horrible, it just snakes around the crime and the prisoners of war constantly ridicule. He balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling down doing justice to neither of them. <br /> <br /> First, are there 30 minutes of uninspiring and uninspiring prisoners of war in Vietnam? The boy is playing basketball at any given moment ... How much more can he please his audience? ... Prison time is boring, unconvincing and can make one sleep easily. <br /> <br /> Back in the United States, the man without any real reason is considered a "war hero". However, the public, of course, quickly forgets it and seems to stumble upon all sorts of extravagant setbacks. Or are they really? Soon we will know. Yawn. There are annoying clich√©s: his sick mother, his little daughter he never knows, a high-level whore who falls in love with the hero, etc. It is very strange that this film constantly changes from tragedy to slapstick in an instant. It does not work at all. <br /> <br /> In general, this is in fact only a bad comedy and harms the prisoners of war. The fact that this guy was a great comedian, played in some good movies and died of EM is no reason not to be upset by this silly, unconvincing and funny little comedy. But if you like Richard Pryor, you'll probably be excited to read the 3 hours of dadaist poetry.
