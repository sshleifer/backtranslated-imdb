The greedy land baron in the small western town of Prairie City wants all ranchers to leave their land, using intimidation tactics and fires to evict them; It seems that the city is swimming on top of the oil, and when a Swedish farmer refuses to leave, he is knocked down by the weapon hired by the baron. The farmer's sailor son soon arrives, realizing what he is up against and tries to gather the rest of the residents to fight. Another story of anarchy in the west, with everyone under the thumb of the villain (who naturally has all the cards). Derived and uncomfortable at times to watch, with a long wait before our stoic hero finally gets his dandruff. The half Swedish accent of Sterling Hayden is a big problem, although it cuts a compassionate and compassionate presence on the screen and almost makes it worthwhile to see the image. Director Joseph H. Lewis presents most of the scenes in a rigid manner, like a television western, and Gerald Fried's score has no help, although Ray Rennahan's rich black-and-white cinematography is excellent. An independent production released through United Artists, the film has a strange beginning (starting with shots of the end, followed by shots from the middle section of the film), but it has a certain puncture power that surely receives the viewer from the side of Hayden ** since ****
