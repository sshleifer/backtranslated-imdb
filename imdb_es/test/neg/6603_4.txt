I took La Bandara because it brought together Jean Gabin and Julien Duvivier, whose Pepe le Moko is a black masterpiece. I'll give you some points because Gabin is in it, but the clumsy plot, the cheap sets and the ridiculous Annabella doing like an Arab princess put the film on my shelf to sell. If you look at it, you will find yourself wondering why the idiots did not build the fort around the well, instead of a few meters away from it. And why use tin roofs in the middle of the desert? But by then the total perversity of the invention that makes up the script should numb it for any other reflection.
