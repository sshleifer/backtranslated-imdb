This year's Eurovision was a big disappointment. I've seen the Eurovision Song Contest every year since 1986 (well, at least it's the earliest I can remember, and I only had 2 at that time). As in any other year, it contained good, bad and horrible songs, nothing new there. However, this year's show was the worst I can remember. Only very few good songs (probably decent) and many songs absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> The winning song of Turkey "Every Way That I Can" sounded like a scam of Turkish singer Tarkan, "Simarik", only that sounds much worse. I did not deserve to win from my point of view. The song of Belgium "Sanomi", in second place, was a song in another language. I wonder what's next? Animals singing? However, the music of the song was quite catchy, which gave it a kind of dreamlike feeling, to which the "letter" seemed appropriate. One of the best songs, but that does not say much. <br /> <br /> After one of the closest races in the history of Eurovision, the Russian duo t.A.T.u. He finished in third place just three points behind Turkey and behind Belgium, with "Ne Ver ', Ne Boisia" ("Do not trust, do not fear"). To my t.A.T.u. It was one of the few highlights of the program, surprising everyone for being one of the most covert girls of all the contestants. They let their song talk and, if we ignore the fact that they could not release a few times in the first chorus, they let the song speak very well. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise when looking at The score was from austria. The bookmakers here in Denmark had the highest odds on that song, a song that was actually more than horrible, but finished in eighth place. Could that vague guy be shaken to the beat of the song? That performance was the one that made me and my family laugh the most, not because it looked good, but because it looked so stupid that it was actually fun. <br /> <br /> Sweden did what it did best; ABBA In 1999 they won with "Take Me To Your Heaven", sounding like ABBA. In 2001, they reached the top 10 with "Listen To Your Heartbeat", they returned to sound like ABBA, and once again this year they did it in the ABBA style, finishing again in the top 10. <br /> <br /> England finally He was punished for making those songs absolutely horrible and unattractive, which they have been in recent years. <br /> <br /> Ireland started the 2000 winner, "Fly On The Wings Of Love". And I could continue talking about how bad the songs were. <br /> <br /> I'm a little sorry for the Australians, who this year finally had the chance to see the Eurovision Song Contest. They deserved better than this. <br /> <br /> However, I was not surprised by the show. The 2000 Eurovision for me stands out as one of the best in recent years. 2001 was pretty good, but not so good. 2002 was fine, but certainly not more. This year was simply disappointing. <br /> <br /> Hopefully it will improve next year. If it's not for us, at least for Australians. <br /> <br /> 4/10. One for t.A.T.u., one for the closed race, one for the rear and one for the rest.
