I'm very disappointed. First of all, German timing is bad. Maybe in the original version (with subtitles) it would have been better, but the whole movie seems as if the director saw Luna Papa and Black Cat White Cat and tried to produce something with this style. But it failed in all aspects. It is an incongruous mixture of a strange incredible story and very childish jokes. There is no environment, there is no life. Extremely primitive sex-humor. I voted 2, because 1 is the worst, and the other point for 'Sybilla', it's really cute. Sorry, I like 'oriental' movies, but this is really superfluous.
