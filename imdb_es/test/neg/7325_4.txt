I tried to love this movie. I really did it. Kevin Bacon plays a cerebral palsy victim who befriends a 10-year-old girl whose fantasies of digging in China, ballooning, etc., are her way of coping with a sad existence. I admit that I made a quick advance through one of the scenes in which the two share friendship and simple pleasures while the moving piano music plays in the background. Okay, three or four of those kind scenes. Maybe nine or ten. Okay, okay, they were fourteen. But I sat and watched most of them.
