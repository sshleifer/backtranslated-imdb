** MAIN SPOILERS ** Can only be seen by the action sequences, not by the story or by acting on it. "Nature Unleashed: Fire" has one of the longest and most unbearable endings in the modern history of cinema. We have the intrepid Ranger Jake, Bryan Genesse, who takes this trio of hysterical motorcyclists to safety at every step of an explosive smoke wafting in the pit of the mine! This during a furious forest fire! It seems that Ranger Jake, with all his knowledge of outdoor life, did not realize that the well of a mine that is dripping with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the forests at his around you are on fire! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT *** This all started some time ago, when Ranger Jake, in an effort to save the Tiny miner, Chris Harz, also known as "The Sherd", left that he would slip through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine shaft, or he did! Even though we kept in suspense about who is preparing the forest fires for the first half of the movie, it was not a surprise to everyone that Tiny was the culprit! As you would expect in films like these, Tiny seemed to be made of hardened steel, since nothing that happened to him, causes explosions and impale, and can stop the crazed miner. <br /> <br /> Before the reappearance of Tiny, or the resurrection, Ranger Jake was involved in rescuing motorcyclists Chris Mel Sharon and Marcus, Josh Cohen Melanie Lewis Anastasia Griffith and Ross McCall, who were trapped in the forest with fires that surrounded them. Having the usual, Marcus, among motorcyclists, things are not going as well as Ranger Jake wanted them to be. Marcus not only lays eggs in the gentle Chris to do something stupid, jumps with his bike on a pile of 10-foot trunks, but causes the boy to break his leg. This makes it almost impossible for Ranger Jake to dispatch Chris before the fires consume him as much as his fellow motorcyclists! <br /> <br /> For the rest of the movie Ranger Jake, who was put in charge, makes boner after boner in his attempt to save himself and those caught and lost in the forest bikers! All this ends with Jake's brilliant idea of ​​hiding in a dangerous mine pit and abandoned with the rescue group a few meters away from rescuing them if they just stayed in an open place and where the rescue team could find them! <br /> <br /> Even though it was supposed to be the life of the party or the movie, Tiny, for all his efforts to be another indestructible super villain, was presented as a man who spent a lot of time in the sun. The make-up work at Tiny was so outrageous that it looked like he had thrown a jar of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of burning it. <br /> <br /> Ranger Jake was quite naive. or retarded in his being so captivated by the dangerous Tiny that he always tries to save the psychopath who has never hidden his feelings about what he had in mind for the game according to the rules of the Forest Ranger. In fact, Ranger Jake actually encouraged Tiny to do both himself and the motorcyclists, showing him how incompetent he was to try to save them. The fact that Ranger Jake was successful was not because he was so smart but because Tiny, despite his indestructibility, was so naive!
