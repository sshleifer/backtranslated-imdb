I love Japanese movies, having seen at least 100-200. So it's obvious that I'm not afraid of Japanese films. However, sometimes there are Japanese concepts for films that simply do not translate well for Westerners. They can be successes at home, but abroad they just do not seem, well, ... normal. It's like the live fish that my wife ate at a business meeting or odd PS2 games like dating simulators or Katamari Damacy, things that are accepted there that confuse non-Japanese people. This is probably the way others see things that Americans take for granted, such as American football, fried Snicker bars and the Paris Hilton. Well, the king of the strange Japanese movies that just do not seem right for Americans could be ATAMA-YAMA. Now the style of the animation is not the problem, it's different but good enough. No, it is the concept of the story itself and the end quite strange. That's what makes this a really unusual movie and it's like that: there was a stingy man who, for no apparent reason, had a tree growing from his head. It was little at first and he simply cut it off, but again and again it grew back, so he simply decided to let it go. And, after a while, people began to live in their head under the shade of the tree. Interestingly, while they were under the tree, they were small, but when they left, they were the same size again. Then, after he finally tired of everything and tore the tree, the man drowned (!?) In the hole in the top of the head where the tree was! The end. <br /> <br /> Look! I told them that this was very, very strange, but not in a good way like TAMPOPO or HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS, just strange. O-D-D .... strange! And unless you have a very high tolerance for this kind of thing, I doubt you feel bad knowing that this Oscar nominated film did not win. Frankly, that makes me happy, since I do not really want this movie to stimulate similar movies. The only reason why he wins a 4 is due to a nice animation, but not spectacular. <br /> <br /> This movie made my brain hurt ... I hope it's not a sign that I have a tree!
