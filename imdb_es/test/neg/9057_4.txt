I did not hate this one. I just could not adapt to the story. I really did not get it. Michael Mann is a very good director, but I have to disagree with his methods on this. I'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. Some of the projects she has been in are garbage, but her performance is brilliant. My favorite Daniel Day Lewis movies are There Will Be Blood and Gangs Of New York. <br /> <br /> There's one thing I loved about this and it was the musical score, it gave the movie a lot of atmosphere. That's all I liked about him though. This movie also has a high vote, which is a bit random. I can see that some people will like this, but not enough to get the overall score of 7.8. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a chance if it were you, but there are many high votes for this. so I guess you should see it and make your own opinions about what you think. I really did not like ............. 4/10 ............. j.d Seaton
