After watching this movie, I decided it was so terrible that I had to join IMDb and write a review to warn others of the danger of renting or buying this movie. To be fair to the movie, there's only one good section in this movie and it's the end of the credits because then you know that this shit is well and truly over. I saw it all the way in the hope that I could get some pleasure from the movie. Only tunnels, more tunnels and an old man speaking alone (if you watch this movie too many times, you will too). As for Val, if he continues to select films like this, he could also say goodbye to his acting career. It does not make sense to even write about what is in the movie, since that has already been done. Keep your money and your sanity and keep it very clear.
