Lance used to get a quality support job from James Cameron. Heck even had his own television show (Millenium) for a couple of seasons. Why are you doing that? Could not you find a better way to pay your bills? <br /> <br /> I love a good low budget movie. Some of them may laugh simply because of their absurd premise, their stereotyped characters from textbooks, or often because the actors are related to the director / producers. But, this movie has no redeeming value. I did not laugh. I did not cry. I just had this feeling of discomfort in my stomach. That feeling was quickly identified as pity. At one time, Lance Henriksen was a top-notch support actor. He has been in Terminator (he was going to be a terminator before Arnold appeared), Aliens, AliensII, the classic movie B Pumpkinhead, among many others! I wanted to send you money after this. Maybe we should start a fund of support Lance or something like that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, to do this ... maybe not.
