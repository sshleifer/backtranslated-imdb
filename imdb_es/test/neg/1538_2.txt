At first, the film seemed to be very good, they had the profiles of the established characters ... the plot seemed to be going in the right direction ... however, as the film progressed, the director seemed to concentrate on the kind of things wrong. ..or only a lot of the movie was edited. The identities of the characters changed for the worse in the movie. Also, there seemed to be a great implicit meaning, in other words, they had things inside the movie that did not seem to fit into the movie itself. And the title ... nowhere in the movie does the title fit the movie ... I guess the title works for the previews ... The actors did well with what they had ... if they had a better director and writer, maybe this would have worked better. But it was not like that. So now there is a terrible new movie this Friday ... My opinion! ... Do not waste time or money.
