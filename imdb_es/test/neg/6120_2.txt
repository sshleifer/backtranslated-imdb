For any fan of the fight, this is the fight that must be forgotten. Without logic for the games, some garbage tricks (doink the clown, and the Giant Gonzalez) this was a forgettable PPV, something rare for the WWE (F). The logic of Hogan winning the world title at the end made no sense, and many people feel that it only helps put the nail on the PPV. From the pointless tricks of the Roman soldiers, to just a bit of real bad fight (doink vs. Crush is the worst game) to just a bad combination of matches (Scott "Razor Ramon vs. Bob Backlund, how can you have one of the best mat fighters? A comeback, and working on his first fight, he faces a powerful fighter who was undefeated at that time), this is a PPV that even the WWE has admitted since then, was way below expectations.
