I love Juan Piquer-Simón! He is my favorite bad film director and, throughout his career, tried to take advantage of all the successful contemporary trends in horror and fantasy genres. After the great success that was "Superman", JP created his own fun "Supersonic Man", got involved in the violent madness of the slasher movie with the crazy "Pieces" and really surpassed himself with "The Return of ET ", the unofficial and downright ridiculous sequel to the Spielberg blockbuster. "The Rift" is obviously inspired by the profitable underwater monster movie series like "The Abyss" and "Deepstar Six." From the beginning to the end, you can have fun discovering all the stolen ideas and the brazen scams of these (and other) classics. When a completely new and elegant type of submarine vanishes near the deep breach of Dannekin, a second mission is sent with the submarine designer Wick Hayes on board to investigate what really happened with Siren One. In the dark depths of the ocean, the rescue mission discovers an underwater cavern where the government secretly experiments with mutant sea creatures. The monsters are quite aggressive, but there is also the danger that there is an enemy of the government among the members of the crew ... "The Rift" is a forgettable film, but, nevertheless, it has something ingenious. although very doubtful ?? monster models. Fans of blood and blood will not complain, either, since bestial attacks are pretty gruesome and ruthless. The performance is very wooden, although many of the cast names can definitely do better. It is recommended that you simply enjoy the clichés and the bloody effects in "The Rift" because, if you begin to contemplate the script, you will discover that it does not make any sense.
