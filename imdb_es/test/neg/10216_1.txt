I really should give this stinker more credit than 1 star, because the movie has so many lines that it's almost worth the rental price. <br /> <br /> If you want to call it that, the acting is so talented and so artificial that it makes Ed Wood's actors look like life. "Sammy", the lonely black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in his other films, but he has no capacity to act. His lines are priceless because of his absurd delivery, although I suspect that the intention was to create a sympathetic character. His old man fixes himself in his other turkey ("Pushed To The Limit") has no budget, is of high school quality, with cotton eyebrows and hair painted with white spray. <br /> <br /> I can not really understand anyone buying this video, unless people like to organize their own Mystery Science Theater parties and need a copy of something like this at hand. It really is Beyond Fear, it's really Beyond Funny.
