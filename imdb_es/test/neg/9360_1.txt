I no longer have respect for the IMDb ratings. I think a group of Mormons flooded the website and voted for this. This is not an artistic film, it is Mormon propaganda. There is nothing wrong with that, but the scheme of the plot and the way it is described is totally misleading. If you are a Christian of the Bible or a Mormon, watch this movie, you will love it and you will think it is really amazing. For any other person, do not get upset, the story is so artificial, random things happen that do not really follow consistently. This guy tries to commit suicide because he sleeps with his neighbor. Are you kidding? What the fuck! Anyway, this is a horrible movie.
