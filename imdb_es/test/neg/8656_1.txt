Neal N Nikki is voted in the worst movies of the year by Planetbollywood. It is hard to believe that the famous Chopra have produced this lousy movie. It was presented as a movie for the family, but it turns out to be a ridiculous sexual comedy. It does not make you laugh either, but it cries of boredom and does not have sexy girls to make the movie look sexy. The title song is the most annoying song of the decade, I'm the Neil, I'm the man, the rock star superstar. Uday Chopra is one of the worst Bollywood actors without acting talent. After doing many Super Flops, and not receiving any film from a producer instead of his Family. He gives a total performance of shit, which bores you to death. Tanisha, who is and always will be known to be Kajol's sister, gives a terrible performance. Both actors have the most annoying chemistry, and are very immature for their age. It has a special look for the very pretty Richa Pollad, in a pathetic role. The ending was so stupid and stupid, I can not believe I paid money to rent this crap.
