The best thing about this movie for me was that Bryan Dick played Rafe and made me feel sweet. Rafe and all its beauty made it worthwhile to watch the movie, even though I wanted to get up and scream. I've never seen a hotter man. <br /> <br /> -Ahem- But that is not the point. <br /> <br /> The title? That is precisely what it is. They took the beautiful story written by Annette Curtis Klause and dismissed it. In all my anal-retentive splendor, I will point out what was missing, what has changed and everything that is wrong with the film. <br /> <br /> Sit, and here it goes: <br /> <br /> - Apparently, RAFE is the son of ASTRID and GABRIEL, and apparently, ULF is no longer the son of ASTRID, as in the book. And, as a memory of the book, RAFE and ASTRID were LOVERS. <br /> <br /> -ASTRID is apparently BLUE, unlike the RED HAIR in particular described in the book. I think the book says that it looked more like a FOX than a LOB. And the movie also shows that ASTRID is VIVIAN's aunt. <br /> <br /> - WHERE HAS AXEL GOED? <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN is 19. In the book I was 16. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN and AIDEN are in THE SECONDARY SCHOOL that both attend in the book. VIVIAN goes to see AIDEN for his poem "Cambio de lobo". But, according to the film, AIDEN hit his father, escaped and now lives in Romania and draws graphic novels. This made me say 'What the F ** K'. <br /> <br /> -There is no 'Kelly' in the movie. WHERE KELLY WAS ON THE MOVIE. The KELLY in the book, however, hated VIVIAN. And she also went out with AIDEN after they parted. Vivian even got drunk on the book and trashed her room. <br /> <br /> -GABRIEL looks a lot like a Colombian drug lord in the movie. And he also sounds like one. His performance was very good, but his appearance threw me out. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN did not have parents in the movie. His father and mother and 2 other brothers died in the movie. However, in the book, when he arrives home one night, his MOTHER, ESME, is sitting on the couch, after struggling with ASTRID by GABRIEL. And VIVIAN does not have brothers. Only his father died in the book. <br /> <br /> -AIDEN accepts VIVAN for what she is. This really got me. He kills RAFE in the spooky church, confronts VIVIAN, and she saves him from the other wolves, except that AIDEN shoots him, so they leave in search of medicine and then try to leave the city together. WTF ?! In the book, AIDEN gets scared when she becomes a wolf, and cries like a girl, throws things at her, and then panics and jumps out the window. Then he invents a story that tried to break up with her, and she threw a chair out the window. That does not sound like an acceptance to me. <br /> <br /> -AIDEN wants her to run away with him. In the book, he does not want to have anything to do with Vivan after she turns to him. Nor does he hold his face with love and says that she can control it. He cries like a woman because he is afraid of her. <br /> <br /> And the final indignation ... the one that almost gave my three best friends and I, the heart attacks in our seats: <br /> <br /> -In the film, AIDEN and VIVIAN escape together, and VIVAN has killed GABRIEL. As in her, he shoots her. GABRIEL dies. In the * BOOK * not only VIVIAN does not kill GABRIEL, but I think they END TOGETHER. As in, she does not end with AIDEN, ends with GABRIEL. WHAT HELL <br /> <br /> Little things were also noticed: Ulf's red hair she receives from Astrid has changed to brown in the film, and Vivian works in a chocolate shop. <br /> <br /> A horrible shock; I am ashamed. The book really was not hard to follow. If Disney can use a random H school, why could not the manager find a random H school? <br /> <br /> * sigh * I really wanted to see this movie, I loved the book, it's sad that I did not follow it a bit. I give it a 2, just because (as indicated at the top of this review) Rafe (played by Bryan Dick) was extremely sexy, and Agnes Bruckner did a wonderful job. And, they kept the Steppenwolf poem <br /> <br /> With love, <br /> <br /> Caitlin
