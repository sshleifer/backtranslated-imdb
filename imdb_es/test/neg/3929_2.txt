Yes, Pigeon and Coburn are great, and it's interesting to see them, although Coburn seems quite sober and boring here. It's nice to see Seattle, Victoria and Salt Lake City in the 1970s, and cars and vintage clothing. That's all the good in this boring movie. The dialogue is incredibly bad, like most actors. The motivations of Ray and Sandy seem forced and unlikely. I have seen this routine of "training to be a pickpocket" several times before. There is a long accumulation, leading to nothing. Better to capture an episode of "Streets of San Francisco", or one of the many great crime / caper movies. To name a few, there's Bedtime Story, remade as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, The Lavender Hill Mob, The Grifters, Paper Moon, The Sting and, best of all, House of Games.
