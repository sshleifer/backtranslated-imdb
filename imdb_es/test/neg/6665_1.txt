There are so many logical mistakes in this show that it's hardly worth saying. 1) Mystic Gohan is non-existent 2) Uub is as powerful as MAJIN BUU but plays no role in the program, somehow is outdone by all the bad guys 3) The whole idea of ​​Super Saiyan 4 is delayed and it is horrible to lose to Super 17 (which is the worst idea for a villain of DB EVER) 4) Super Saiyan 4 Goku is no match for Super 17, but Goku not transformed with a move he learned in a movie that should not happen, kills him easily 5 ) Vegeta is completely useless 6) No character other than Goku has any impact on the outcome of the battles 7) The series ends with a spiritual bomb ... come on 8) Goku invincible? absorbs the dragon balls? I catch 9) Gotenks? ... better yet Goten ??? Swimsuit??? both suck 10) Super Saiyan 4 implies a magical transformation in an adult 11) Goku is a child 12) Goku is a child 13) There is no super saiyan level 2 (characterized by electricity) 14) There is no imagination with the animation of Gogeta 15) Gogeta completely useless 16) Big Bang Kamehameha is the biggest disappointment in the history of anime (it's not really logical, but I'm going on a tangent) 17) The shortest character fights in history <br /> < I could continue for longer if I had not suppressed most of the memories associated with this show. When I earn enough money, I will finance the renovation of this series.
