.... You get this stupid excuse for a children's game scam! Man, what were you thinking? First they get into a Rumpelstiltskin horror movie and then they do a shit like this. Fariy Tale enemies! Well, to be honest, I've seen this as a child, and it scared me a little, just because I was underage assuming that Pinocchio would not do that, wah wah wah. But I've grown up and I've come to think of this as child's play, fairy-tale nonsense and a lame Tales From The Crypt episode, or trying to be at least one, with a lame ending that was stupid, and had many holes in the plot, and I still can not understand how it came to life. Was the work of a bad Geppetto? So, what, after some bad actions, becomes a real child who becomes the most wanted in the United States? Personally, I think the concept of a bad Geppetto sounds better, he builds an army of wooden assassins and starts a crime wave, funny. But this is horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible! HORRIBLE! Stinky as a shoe, and horrible! He sucked it sucked! If you want killer puppets, conform to the killer doll, specifically the Children's Game, instead, without conditions. Or if you want a fairy tale character to turn upside down, see Leprechaun, or if you want Pinocchio, watch the animated version of Disnet or the live version with Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Martin Landau. >>>>> -10/10 (negative 10)
