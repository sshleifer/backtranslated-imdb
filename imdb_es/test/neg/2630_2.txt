This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in many years. I started watching the movie without expecting much and that's exactly what was delivered ... not much! In fact, he ended up delivering even less than he expected. My first reaction when I saw the initial parts of the movie was that I would probably end up qualifying it with a "4". I thought he seemed to have a reasonably good picture and a disturbing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> However, as the film progressed, the score kept going down and down in my mind mainly due to the performance of pedestrians and a plot that ranged from being simply silly and insipid at first, being silly and disgusting almost at the end. By the time the movie was over, I was willing to rate it as a "1". <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money on this.
