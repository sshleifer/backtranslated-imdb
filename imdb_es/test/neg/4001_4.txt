In general, I love these thrillers "Stranger Within". Some good examples are "Fatal Attraction", "Single White Woman" and "Hearing". If they are done well, they can be very fun, and they are worth an hour or two of startles and shocks. Of course, the opposite may be true: badly done, they can be tedious and stupid. "The hand that rocks the cradle" is one of the last. <br /> <br /> Bartels, Claire (Annabella Sciorra) and Michael (Matt McCoy) welcome another member to their family. But the busy Claire is persuaded by Michael to hire a nanny. One day, a woman named Peyton Flanders (Rebecca DeMornay) appears, and as it seems perfect, the Bartels hire her. Of course, once it appears, your idyllic life is slowly crumbling ... <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of problems, but the biggest one is the villain's handling. Peyton is never credible. Part of this has to do with how it is written and how it has acted. The things she does that are supposed to make us nervous are so good that they are laughable. De Mornay does not help much. She plays Peyton as two different people. While it is true that she is supposed to be the perfect nanny while hiding her psychotic tendencies, De Mornay's performance creates a division between the two facets of her character. <br /> <br /> However, the other actors are good. Annabella Sciorrra is great as Claire asthmatic. Sciorra is very natural on paper, but unfortunately, the script disappoints her. Matt McCoy is almost invisible. However, Julianne Moore is charming as Claire's friend, Marlene. Moore is a firecracker, but unfortunately he is only on the screen for a total of five minutes. <br /> <br /> Curtis Hanson is a good director, but you would not know when he saw this problem. The movie has some decent punches, but it's slow-paced, and the climax, while generating some tension, is really laughable. That said, he's working with a script that, at best, could be called charitably pathetic. <br /> <br /> Trust me, when it comes to babysitters, stay with Fran Drescher. This should have gone to the direct video tray.
