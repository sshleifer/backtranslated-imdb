I think I saw a very edited version because it was not as graphic as I expected, according to the other reviews I've heard. <br /> <br /> Apart from 1. having been written by the same person who wrote the original "Emmanuelle" (1974), Emmanuelle Arsan, 2. the main character is a sexually free spirit, and 3. is located in The exotic place of Asia, "Laure" does not have the same style as its predecessor. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this film is too complicated with philosophical subjects that really do not interest me, that is, the open and voyeuristic relationship between Laure and Nick: "I'm happy with whatever it is that gives her pleasure. "... something in that sense. I can not relate to this mentality and the movie / the characters do not really shine any light. <br /> <br /> The second part about finding the Mara tribe looked like it was a completely separate movie. One that I did not care about. By that time, I just hoped it would become pornography to at least keep my interest. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just did not understand it. <br /> <br /> I'll leave it like this.
