Although I think the critics who hated this movie have summed up exactly what they do wrong (everything!), I had to add my two cents. If you want a long version of how terrible this movie is, read the coinlightning review. <br /> <br /> Here's the short version: blatant use of the NAMES of the actors to drive the plot instead of using their talent (nobody brought their "A game" to this), their blatant commercialism (I guess Pepsi can afford to paste an ad, or 40, into a movie now), and a plot (???) that was so complicated with "rock star" says it was totally ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Let me explain it to you this way. . . I was thinking about 'Wayne's World' the whole time I was watching this movie, but I was not laughing! Every time you try to throw Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) to help you plot your movie, you have SERIOUS problems. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, warn your friends and family: this movie stinks.
