It's okay my question Who is the idiot who wrote this movie, giving it the same name as Dean Koontz's impressive book? It's terrible, there's nothing like the book ... you have the dog and the observer, but that's where the similarities end ... it could be good, if you have not read the book ... but it disappointed me, really. <br /> <br /> should make a new one, and let koontz write it ... now it would be a good movie ... I'll say it again, this movie disgusted me ... absolutely disgusted me. It was terrible, it did not look like the book at all. I would never see him again.
