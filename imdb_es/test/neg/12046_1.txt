I went to see this movie at the theater and I paid money thinking that it would be at least something entertaining. The only thing I enjoyed this was when Robin Williams crashed into the car at the foot of the hill, and in the end, when it seems that he was killed. Glenn Close was unpleasant, and obviously she did not seem old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garp's would have been taken from her children by the Department of Children and Families. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams and his donut glaze appearance of benign goodness is too sweet and elegant for me. He has two roles he can play: funny person or sad, tragic and good-hearted victim. See the Fisher King, Good morning to Vietnam and all your so-called "dramatic" roles. It is always the same performance. Put them all together in a long mini-series. Glenn Close is always a cold fish. Do you remember the fatal attraction? Would you have an affair with her even on your worst day and if you were single? Did you feel any spark between her and Michael Douglas? Have you ever seen Glenn Close heat up a screen? John Lithgow had the only interesting role. This was on the day he used to play serial killers and bad guys, so to see him as a transsexual was at least fun. Garp is made for all those people who love watching movies about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people and then they say it is beautiful and deep.
