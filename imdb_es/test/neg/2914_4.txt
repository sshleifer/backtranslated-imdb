I would have little to add to the Bull's Eye comment here. But as the first Brazilian (born, raised and living in Rio de Janeiro, in a neighborhood a few miles from the favela of Vigário Geral, represented in the film) to comment on the "Favela Rising" funded by the United States here at IMDb, I have mixed feelings: on the one hand, it is good that the serious situation of the Brazilian favelas is receiving more attention from filmmakers and the media, both in Brazil and abroad, since local governments seem to have surrendered a long time ago. On the other hand, it is incredibly frustrating that "Favela Rising" turns out to be a missed opportunity to enlighten non-Brazilian audiences on the subject, because novice directors Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (who are from the United States and, understandably, neophytes to respect) convert the biography of AfroReggae group leader, Anderson Sá, into a glamorous canonization in this superficial, unilateral, little researched and deceptive documentary. Good intentions, confusing results. "Favela Rising" looks like a television ad, is shallow like a television interview in prime time and is skewed like a promotional video. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" feels uncomfortably false for a Brazilian viewer, and not only because of its exaggerated visual treatment of a grim reality, and its happy ending, of feeling bad, out of place. "City of God" is an obvious reference here, as COG actors Leandro Firmino and Jonathan Haagensen appear for no apparent reason other than "hype". "Favela Rising" is, supposedly, a documentary about the group AfroReggae and its leader Anderson Sá, but be careful: when you see the scenes filmed in favelas overlooking the beautiful coastline of Rio, it could be noticed that Vigário Geral (the home of AfroReggae and Anderson is located in a river area away from ANY beach.The strange choice of location, to say the least. <br /> <br /> "Favela Rising" is probably confusing for non-Brazilians, who they will not know many of the interviewees (and the movie will not tell them either) and will have to wait for the final credits to discover that many of the songs in the soundtrack are NOT from the AfroReggae band (although they will suspect when they start listening to Pink Martini , of all people!) Nor will they know that important issues were simply not mentioned: why does the film promote the idea that AfroReggae is a one-man project? Why not recognize the many partners that provide it with important financial and logistical support, such as the City of Rio, Brazilian private corporations, multinational recording companies and international NGOs, without which AfroReggae could not even survive? Why not say clearly that Vigário Geral is still plagued by violent drug wars, and that its inhabitants still live in constant fear of attacks by traffickers and police? Why not clearly state that many of the videos that show the violence and corruption of the police did NOT take place in Vigário Geral? HOW and WHY did the boy Richard Murilo finally join AfroReggae? Why in the damn land was not interviewed once again at the end of the movie? <br /> <br /> Regarding Anderson himself, the film leaves many loose ends for the viewer: what is the story of Anderson's story? two "mothers" Is the baby holding his son in his arms? Why is he inspired by Shiva? Is he a Buddhist? Why does a Candomblé woman appear on the beach when the films mention the "miraculous" recovery of Anderson of the accident? Is he a follower of Candomblé? Why does he not allow him to explain the contradiction of starting a group that fights against drugs and at the same time praises Bob Marley? If AfroReggae is also a movement of pride for the blacks of favelas, why are AfroReggae girls limited to booty routines? No, you will not get answers to these questions either. <br /> <br /> Instead, the filmmakers are interested in converting Anderson It is a mixture of pop star, Malcolm X, Gandhi and Christ (see that last image of the Christ the Redeemer statue on the top of Corcovado Hill, immediately after showing Anderson "miraculously" walking after his surgeon). And that's the WORST thing that filmmakers could do with Anderson and his cause: turn it into a CHOSEN special (for when they show their surgical scar, they're ready to believe it's a mark of God). <br /> <br /> Because the amazing thing about Anderson, which is the most common type he could meet, is that he helped change his environment NOT by being "special" but by copying and adapting winning projects (such as the Olodum movement in Bahia, among others) to its own community, with strong support from friends, artists, intellectuals, politicians, businessmen and the media. If you do not speak Portuguese fluently, you probably will not realize that Anderson is not particularly bright or articulate (unlike his clever partner José Junior), no matter how talented he is as a singer, lyricist or musician. However, their "normality" could have been the true "inspiring" core of the film: to show that ANYONE with idealism, perseverance and constant support can, in fact, contribute significantly to their community, it is not necessary that Jesus be incarnate. Because what really matters is the movement, AfroReggae, not the boy, see? Have not we had enough personality cult? <br /> <br /> At the end of "Favela Rising", you probably do not know much more about Rio's favelas than when you first entered, you've simply SEEN how some of them look.
