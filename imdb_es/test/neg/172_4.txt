As noted in other comments here, the camera work is ridiculously bad. I'm tempted to say that the director of photography is a 7-year-old boy, but that would be bad for 7-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Okay, but what about the topic? I was looking for information on the state of the wine industry around the world, you know, Mondovino. What the film is about is a very narrow vision of an intrigue in that world: the fight between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries that they would like to buy. There is no enlightening narrative that puts the whole matter in context, so we are left with the selective process of the director and the interviews with the various characters in this little psychodrama. There is no shortage of despicable characters, not even contemptible dogs. However, there is a lack of impartiality. <br /> <br /> Is the director a Marxist? I wondered as I tried to keep some focus as the camera went down, turned, zoomed in a blooming chaos. Small producer in France: good. Great producer in the USA: very, very bad. Forget the hundreds of small wineries in North America, Australia and South America. There is a dead horse to overcome here for more than two hours. <br /> <br /> To learn more about the intrigue, it is better to read it somewhere else. And you can taste your favorite wine without feeling sick while doing it. <br /> <br /> I suggest a new award in Cannes for the Best Diatribe that hits America.
