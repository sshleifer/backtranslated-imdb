Don Wilson plays a cop who occasionally enjoys the games of fighting virtual reality, however, things go wrong when the people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level by making real people of the video game perform the cybersex models. as a prototype, but the main villain of the game wakes up and starts killing people and now the only man who can beat the boy is Don Wilson, who meanwhile falls in love with the cybersex model. Actually, with all things considered, my biggest confusion was trying to understand if the people brought from the virtual reality were robots, humans, cyborgs or just some kind of unidentified computer program. It does not matter, since all this is just an excuse to see one of the worst actors in the butcher's dialogue as if he were running a delicatessen. The complete lack of charisma of Don Wilson is the biggest flaw in the film, since one does not like the boy, is too good, his voice is too sharp and does not seem very impressive in the action sequences. What saves this boredom from my lowest rating is Athenia Massey, who looks super sexy in high-cut suits and who occasionally gets naked. Also on board are Loren Avedon (a good martial artist), Stella Stevens and Michael Dorn as the main voice of the bad man, but their efforts are in vain, since they are all hidden by the very bad performance of Wilson. Another flaw that is the biggest mistake of the movie is the lack of action, since we are asked to see how the story unfolds, but apart from Massey's nudity and maybe some unintentional diversions due to the ridiculously little acting convincing, there really is nothing of interest. This also extends to the action sequences in which they are choreographed in a flat, misdirected, and completely exhausted manner of all possible emotion. Making this virtually unquestionable. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
