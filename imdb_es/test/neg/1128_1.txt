This has to be the worst piece of shit I've ever seen. Randy Quaid is funny as a supporting actor in the original, but not as a protagonist. Too much Eddie. The original is a classic. Like the original, the supporting actor took the show. Ed Asner was very funny. He is the Eddie of Christmas Vaction 2! How is it that the Snots continue to look the same after all those years and all the others in the original aspect are 14 years older? After 15 minutes of watching this movie, I think I still had not laughed. The island thing just did not work. If it were not for the beautiful female guide of the South Pacific of the island, the film would have been a total loss. I sat in this review for a week and yes, I still think that the movie should never have been made. Hopefully there is not a THIRD! <br /> <br /> Shawn Gearin
