This movie tries hard but fails. Perhaps for non-Australian audiences it can be attractive as a travel diary, but for the natives it is simply tedious. <br /> <br /> Anyone who lives here knows that Broken Hill is an isolated and difficult mining town. If a pair of citified fruits appear in the resistance, well, everything is very predictable. Where have I found that theme so worn out before? Oh yes, Mouse of the city and Mouse of the country. Save yourself <br /> <br /> I expected it to get better, but after the scene in Broken Hill I could see where it was going, so I turned off the TV and went to bed.
