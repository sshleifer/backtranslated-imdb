Stupid horror movie about five and a half (3 boys and 2 girls) going to this place in the middle of nowhere. What they do not know is that Dr. Chopper and his female aides attack and kill anyone who ventures into their forests. They use the parts of their body for some experiments ... or something like that. Also five university girls and two lesbians are thrown to be killed and show some cleavage. <br /> <br /> Pretty desperate. The story is confused and boring; the blood is ridiculously false; Dr. Chopper and his assistants exaggerate TERRIBLY; There is a gruesome "black humor" here and people are standing still while their friends are attacked or they just stay there and let people kill them. <br /> <br /> This was pretty insulting. There are some advantages. One turn of an hour was quite good and the five young actors are really good! Chase Hoyt is great like Reese; Butch Hansen is fine as Jimmy; Ashley McCarthy is also good as Tamara and Robert Adamson has his moments as Nicholas. Best of all, Chesley Crisp as Jessica, she was excellent! Some of the dramatic scenes among these five were well interpreted and interesting. Unfortunately the dialogue was not really there for them. I give him a 4 for his performances, but here it's not worth mentioning anything else. Hopefully these actors get roles worthy of them.
