This program would be useful for training hardened criminals with basic human emotions. Beyond this purpose, the program has no other value than filling the bandwidth that would otherwise not be used in the electromagnetic spectrum. I have a greater sense of suspense and anticipation when listening to a computerized voice chip that incessantly exploits the products of a random number generator. Fortunately, useful and frequent music tracks will tell viewers how they should feel, in case they can not completely internalize the predictable and superficial plot line. I found Amy a superficially positive character, as she is a role model for young women who can serve in traditionally male fields. Unfortunately, her totally subjective approach to the law is guided solely by the whimsical personal guidelines that Amy chooses to employ, which makes Amy's judgments more like appeals to the personal mercy of a tribal despot than to a true administration of Justice. This show is unpleasant in any amount, although this is mitigated to some extent after two episodes by the filtering processes given by the brain of the brain, so the program will fortunately leave the same imprint in the memory of the viewer as a tuned television in a dead channel in maximum volume.
