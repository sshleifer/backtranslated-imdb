Los Angeles doctor Tom Reed (Vincent Ventresca) survives a tragic car accident, but ends up going to prison in the California desert. When his time is up, he lands in a small city swept by the wind called Purgatory Flats. His first stop is at a bar, where he quickly closes a beer and is hired as a bartender. Both for ex-convicts who have difficulty finding work. This is the first of a long list of absurdities that make up the plot of the foolish attempt of the writer / director Harris Done in a modern cinema, set in the desert. <br /> <br /> His first night at work Tom meets a fatal sexy woman named Sunny (Alexandra Holden), who meets with a family of bad guys: the Mecklins, which consists of Uncle Dean ( Gregg Henry) and his two nephews, the drug addict Owen (Kevin Alejandro), who is Sunny's husband. and AWOL soldier Randy ("90210" Brian Austin Greer). After his turn ends, there is a shooting and Dr. Tom is nearby. Accept treat one of the injured and, most importantly, do not tell the police. I'm not sure it's a good move for a boy just out of the pen, but this script (co-written by Diane Fine) has very little to do with logic. <br /> <br /> Tom makes a series of bad decisions that keep him more and more entangled with the Mecklin Boys, who are inclined to the law, including stealing medical supplies and jumping into the stock market with Sunny. Everyone in the theater shouts, "Do not do it! Go," but Tom does it anyway. <br /> <br /> In a classic movie like "Body Heat" or "Double Indemnity" we encourage and sympathize with William Hurt and Fred McMurray while absorbing into the network of deadly, bright and sexy women like Kathleen Turner and Barbara Stanwyck . It is not your fault. We are probably also tempted by all that money or by that particular lady. But Dr. Tom's weakness seems to come from stupidity rather than circumstances. Sunny is sexy, but she's not a very convincing character, and there's no money to tempt him. You're left wondering if he attended the same medical school as Dr. Nick Riveria from "The Simpsons." <br /> <br /> The silly script would make you believe that a peasant's cottage has almost everything you need to treat a shot in the stomach, and the injured person could easily jump to attention and participate effectively in a fight of fists. It gives us an unlikely car chase with one of those "The Club" things attached to the steering wheel. Oh, that tanker that just exploded, nobody noticed. <br /> <br /> I wonder how such a ridiculous script has turned green. Maybe Brian Austin Greer has more juice than I gave him credit for. It is obvious that he took on the relatively small role of Randy, a murderer at the head, to show the producers that he had more range of performance than the one he showed in "90210". <br /> <br /> It is also a sad thing to see Nicol√°s Turturro playing a stereotyped Hispanic drug dealer. He deserves something better than this. <br /> <br /> If you have an IQ higher than 50, "Purgatory Flats" will make you shake your head in disbelief. I will give you 3 stars for the involuntary laughter and scenes with the sexy Miss Holden running in her red panties.
