Where do I start? The story was so bad it must have been written in a high school movie club! The performance was so hard that I felt sorry for the actors! An actor even reminded me of how a deer should look when he sees the headlights of a car! Another actor has this constant aspect of being constipated! But it was the dialogue that took the cake! <br /> <br /> Our hero tells his captors, all with machine guns, if you put a finger on a prisoner, you will be dead. Moments later, the strongest guard, built like a truck, and the only prisoners go for that. When our intrepid leader, who has this annoying and rough gangster voice, realizes this transgression, he walks calmly towards the guard, while the machine guns are trained in him, and in a split second he breaks the neck of this giant guy like if I was breaking a selection of teeth! Then he returns to the line while all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing, but essentially shout at him! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on! This movie is a camping gem; And if you have a sense of humor, it is guaranteed to make you laugh so hard that your eyes will tear!
