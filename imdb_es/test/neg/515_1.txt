This is really a terrible movie by any of the usual criteria. Argument, plot, action, effects, direction, could follow. Suffice it to say that he is poor. However, it has a certain appeal. Many sex scenes appear totally out of context, it's fun to look for Batman references. Umm - that's it. Poor really, do not bother.
