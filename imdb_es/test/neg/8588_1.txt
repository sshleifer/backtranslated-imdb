Another unconvincing attempt to make a film "gritty" and "thought provoking", whatever that means. They have Al Pacino saying many words like: "Television killed football." Yeah, whatever. This is another movie that shows Delusions of Greatness by Oliver Stone. If Stone is trying to show us that soccer will be our ruin or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his camera movements and Kid Rock songs? He even throws Cameron Diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons. It's a shame that Diaz and Pacino are in a movie that is so bad. <br /> <br /> From "Scent of Woman", writers and directors have used Pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines. His characters are no more than speakers, their voices cover what would normally be redundant and trite. He needs to reinvent himself, showing how he can act without shouting. You have to stop feeling sorry for the hokey scripts with cheesy lessons like "Organized football is tangled" and represent a good story.
