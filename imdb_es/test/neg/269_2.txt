Comparing Oceans Twelve with Oceans Eleven of 2001, did anyone else notice all the things that followed the same? <br /> <br /> - All the stars returned to Twelve, and Zeta-Jones was added; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same director; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same producers; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same production designer; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same musical director; <br /> <br /> - Twelve had the same movie editor. <br /> <br /> Did anyone notice the things that changed once the "Oceans" franchise was established? <br /> <br /> - Twelve's budget was $ 25 million (30%) higher; <br /> <br /> - Once they got rave reviews, but Twelve were largely criticized; <br /> <br /> - Eleven won $ 450 million, but Twelve was reduced to $ 362 million; <br /> <br /> - The national ticket office for Twelve fell 32%; <br /> <br /> - Soderbergh teamed up with a different screenwriter. <br /> <br /> Films are The medium of a director, of course. I almost forget it.
