Decent action scenes, but the film is loaded with a slow and complicated plot, an almost non-existent dialogue that leads to a minimal development of the character and a really horrible plot ... <br /> <br /> Did I mention that the plot does not make sense? But, in his defense, the action scenes were impressive enough, even if they leave you scratching your head about what happened. <br /> <br /> There's not much more to say about the movie. It's an ingenious and meaningless action adventure that does not make any sense. It's like watching a worse version of Matrix and skipping the whole plot and dialogue.
