Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance are legendary actors, and director Kostas Karagiannis was the man behind the successful Greek thriller Giallo-esquire Death Kiss in 1974; and yet, when you combine the three talents, all you get is this full load of nonsense! God only knows what prompted people like Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance to star in this cheap movie of devil worship, but I really hope they have been well paid, since none deserves something as amateurish as this in their curriculum. The story centers on a group of devil worshipers who kidnap some children and lead another group to pursue them. The rhythm of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the movie is very boring. The plot is also far from original and anyone with a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something like that, and certainly will have done much better. The obvious lack of budget is felt at all times and the film fails to overcome this at any time. This is really a depressing and miserable watch, and not even a slightly decent ending manages to raise the bet enough to get this movie out of the bottom of the canyon. Extremely poor things and definitely not recommended!
