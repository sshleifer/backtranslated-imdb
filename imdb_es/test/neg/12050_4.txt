I was touched by the recent synopsis of this movie (with the intention of making a play on words) and I expected to see it. The first shots introduce some of the characters, as well as the main location where the stories take place; The gardening plots. The movie looks fantastic. Colorful but simple Magical but genuine. Unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to find out where the movie will go. We quickly realize that this will be a manipulative and joyful story that illustrates a group of jaded people who confront refugees "victimized victims" and that will have a happy ending where jaded people realize the error of their ways and they accept them people. <br /> <br /> The characters, particularly the prejudiced ones, are very funny in their nature. The story focuses mainly on two refugee families. One of them is directed by a single mother played atrociously by Diveen Henry. It saddens me to say that whatever emotion he might have felt towards his struggles was deactivated by what was a memorably bad performance. <br /> <br /> The other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children. All are marked by their trip to this country through containers, where the wife and mother died, but it is the husband who suffers the most. Benedict Wong gives an amazing performance here. At first, her emotions are very dim, but as the story unfolds, she subtly makes us aware of her character's inner struggles. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is extremely boring. There were so many possibilities with this movie. There are several characters to be aware of, many of whom may have potential, but none have been made. What's worse, although this movie is not very Hollywood, some of the main threads of the plot are solved at a low price in a Hollywood way. Example: <br /> <br /> Character A likes character B Character B rejects its advances No problem! Let character C declare his love for character A so that we can all have a happy ending. Yawn. <br /> <br /> I really liked the plot of the Asian family. That was well done. Unfortunately, the entire adjudication business, the community aspect, the dynamics involving a large cast are all under exploitation. <br /> <br /> What you have left is a movie that has very little value.
