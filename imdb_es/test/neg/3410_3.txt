Being a fan of the science fiction of my early childhood (for a long time) I have always hated the implausible arguments. It's a pity that most children's sci-fi storybook authors do not show this kind of respect for their audience. I always suspected that they thought: "children are stupid to realize, so we do not have to make an effort". The writer of "Science Fiction (2002)" is no exception. The story is about a boy who is instigated by his new friends to spy on his parents, because they think that the parents are foreigners. As I was intrigued by the idea, I was so bored by its realization. It seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this idea and tried to extend it during the ninety minutes by submerging it in a dark, elegant and laboriously slow environment. The only thing that kept me in my seat was the question "how do you manage to get out of this unlikely garbage"? And then, bang, they did not even try. So, if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents, go and see "Klatret√∏sen (2002)".
