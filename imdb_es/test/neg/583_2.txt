OUR GANG had an opportunity in a movie in its 22 year history, and this was the best that could be done? It is boring, forced and meaningless, and I must respectfully disagree with the other poster of this film; The 1994 LITTLE RASCALS remake was better than this. Almost anything is. Children are subordinated to the procedures of the Civil War; It does not feel like an OUR GANG movie at all, but rather like a second-class, humorless Shirley Temple clone.
