The chilling and bloody tale of a couple who inherited a 150-room Italian castle while still suffering the loss of their young son. The couple's marriage seems to be on the rocks due to the car accident that took the life of his son and left his daughter blind. By making an inventory of the castle for a future sale, a horrible, tortured and deformed creature breaks from the bowels of the 12th century castle. Pretty bloody with great atmosphere of horror and sexual nuances. Starring Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Jessica Dollarhide and Elisabeth Kaza.
