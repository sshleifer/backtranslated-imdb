I'm sorry to say that, but this is one of the worst documentaries I've seen. <br /> <br /> Due to its name "Darwin's Nightmare", I expected a documentary about problems related to the Nile perch. Lake Victoria. <br /> <br /> What I really saw in this "documentary" is a loose accumulation of individual stories, most of which have no relation to the fish or the lake. And, for the most part, you can hardly call them stories: it's more like some accumulated scenes that lack a meaningful connection ... <br /> <br /> Why does this movie waste time in: - Showing us information not relevant in the families of the Russian pilots (several minutes are lost, for example, in their private photos of wives and daughters) - Mourning the death of an African child who was bitten by a crocodile (as if that had not happened without the Nile hanger) - Show us about 100 times how to land and start planes at the airport - Show us strange religious events for several minutes - Discuss in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport - Talk with children about their mothers, fathers - what they work and / or how they died (well, guess what: some died of HIV: who would have guessed it?) These are just some examples, I could continue several pages ... <br /> <br /> This movie and He is absolutely out of focus and does not know at all what he wants to say in plain sight. If you've never heard of Africa and you have no idea that this continent has social / health / HIV / violence / war issues, then this movie might be right for you. If you have not had your eyes closed for the past few decades, 90% of what this movie shows will not be new to you, and the way it is presented here will do everything possible to make you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Maybe my expectations in this movie were very high, but I really did not like it although this is a topic that I generally find interesting. If this movie wants to show how poverty relates to the Nile perch, maybe I should have spent some time discussing that issue ...
