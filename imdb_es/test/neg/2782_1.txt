I knew very well when I rented this DVD that it could be one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. But to say that it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life would be to put it lightly. I wonder if there is not any legal action that can be taken against the individuals that allowed this film to be produced. I mean, the funding had to come from somewhere, someone had to put money to make this happen !! but this movie violated all production standards in the universe. I could not make it through the whole movie, since I started getting dizzy from the horrific shooting techniques. Nor can I tell you how many scenes I had just finished during the zoning because of the inexplicably horrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> I feel like I have been permanently marked for life. If you saw this movie before receiving this warning, you should think about starting a support group with me for the poor people who saw this monstrosity.
