This film gives a new meaning to the term "unequal", which gives us some interesting characterizations compensated for by an uncomfortable plot that is based on a few well placed stings to deliver most emotions. <br /> <br /> The plot refers to a group of men who hide a secret that has caused a curse that is visited in the form of a ghostly female appearance that causes death. She can also be seducing her children. <br /> <br /> It's quite a show to have all the notable veteran actors together in a movie, but unfortunately they are not very convincing, particularly the scene in which Melvyn Douglas leaves. The deep end begging others to listen to it. No wonder that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible, especially the smiling Ricky. They present the worst scene of "gee-don't-we-we-all-drunk" that I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The movie has some saving graces, namely, the great ghost makeups of Dick Smith (however, they are misplaced). are in this film), and the fascinating performance of Alice Krige as Alma / Eva. I have never read the novel from which this movie was taken, but I intend to do so after reading some of the other reviews on this page. However, you do not have to read the book to realize that this is just a shadow of the original story. Here is a good story, but it seems to be lost somewhere, in the middle of an exhibition that shows men who have nightmares over and over again and make subtle references to the secret that everyone shares. <br /> <br /> In its current state, it seems as if there is a half hour of images removed from this impression, especially near the climax. After all ... how is it that Fred Astaire manages to mount a pond excavation so fast? What did Gregory Bate and the boy have to do with Eva? And while we're at that ... what the hell was she, anyway? Why when letting her out of the car the disappearance of the apparition? If it were an apparition, how could I have sex with two men and make them not know it? <br /> <br /> These and other questions will never be answered, at least not by this movie. Unless some restored images are discovered somewhere, it will probably remain a curiosity forever with some exuberant makeup, strange and naked sex scenes, and some attractive performances.
