I was a big fan of the original Robocop. <br /> <br /> But to say that I was disappointed with this first sequel would be an understatement. <br /> <br /> The problems are many. <br /> <br /> Although the film seems bright, there are many detonators on the screen for all to see, cables, cameras, etc., something that I find totally unacceptable on the part of Irvin Kreshner's pedigree. <br /> <br /> Robocop has become a robot. There is not a spark of humanity that is found in the character here. A real disappointment when it is considered that his "soul" had returned at the end of the first film. Here his attitude does not show a human side and makes it difficult to sympathize with him. <br /> <br /> Caine is a poor villain. Well, I know Boddiker from the first movie was better than average, mainly thanks to the performance of Kurtwood Smith, but the solid Tom Noonan usually creates a character who would not mind one way or another. <br /> <br /> What has happened to the Elder ????. I appreciate that he did not get where he is because he is "good", but the change in his character here is nothing short of amazing. In the first film it is clear that he despises the tactics and the attitude of Dick Jone and, nevertheless, here is not better than Jones. Has no sense. <br /> <br /> Dr. Faxx is a poor substitute for the charismatic OCP resident genius of Bob Morton, although he is unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The action sequences, keep the sequence where Murphy is stuck next to Caine's truck, are hard and unpleasant and repel instead of entertaining. <br /> <br /> And finally. What about the musical score? Do not tell me that Poledouris could not have done it simply because he was working on Total Recall at that time. A soundtrack of series (TV or movies) is part of his personality. Part of his character. When you eliminate that, it damages the familiarity of the characters we are seeing. So it's bad enough, but it's a shame for Leonard Rosenman. Your score here is spooky, worthy of camping and frankly. <br /> <br /> History has its moments to be fair. There is a lot of originality here. But try too many new things to assimilate with a movie. Hob is a well-made villain and the only really unpleasant "villain" on the move. I congratulate Gabriel Damon. <br /> <br /> The final showdown between Robocop and Robocop 2 is also fun. <Br /> <br /> But for the vast majority of its long run time, this is a big disappointment.
