I got this little piece of scuzz on the DVD label "Tales of Voodoo" from VideoAsia. Enough where voodoo is supposed to fit, I have no idea. In fact, it would not usually connect voodoo with Indonesia anyway (let alone with WIP). <br /> <br /> I know and love WIP movies. I have seen most of them. Therefore, I could not resist this little gem known for the description given on the cover. <br /> <br /> It is APPEALABLE. You can not have a WIP movie if the women keep their clothes on (even in the shower!). Although it gives a nod to the genre of exploitation, WIP without nudity is like a Big Mac without the flesh. <br /> <br /> As my gym teacher said, in general, I would rather be in the club ....
