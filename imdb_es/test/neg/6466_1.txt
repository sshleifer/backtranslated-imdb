Ladies and gentlemen, we present to you the worst of the Disney remakes. Although the name of this movie is "That Darn Cat", it should have been "That Darn Teen" or "FBI Agent". The cat did not get any really good scenes, Ricci's character was more annoying than fun, Doug E. Doug did not have a good phrase, even the Dean Jones cameo could not save this movie! The only really good characters were the only two mechanics in the city, but their scenes were brief. In general, I'd say if you're considering watching this movie, get something smarter like a Barney video.
