This was a well-publicized film before its release, but it turned out to be a failure. I never spoke with a person who liked this movie. I agree: I did not like it either. Perhaps an important reason why it was not a blockbuster was that it had only unattractive characters in the story. <br /> <br /> For a while there, I do not know if this is still true, I had not. t any film in which Laura Linney or Dylan Walsh has played anything BUT annoying characters. <br /> <br /> That, and a stupid story, make this film a big disappointment, especially considering that great accumulation. Did the filmmakers, with such a silly dialogue, really think that it was going to be a success?
