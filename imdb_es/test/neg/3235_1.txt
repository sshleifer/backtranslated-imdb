I still find it hard to believe that a fine, if excessive, of Dean Koontz has been transformed into this absolute excrement. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad it's disgusting. Boos to all who participated. What a shame! <br /> <br /> P.S. The fact that sequels have appeared simply shows how little taste and discretion remains in Silver Screen Land.
