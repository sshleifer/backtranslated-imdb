They said it would be a bigger movie than Turks Fruit. How dare <br /> <br />? It is not even 10% of this classic. Bad performance The only character I felt sympathy for was the one played by Angela Schijf. His performance was the best in the whole movie. The story could have been interesting, but it was not. Some scenes were very beautiful filmed (lights and camera), (the opening scene <br /> <br /> for example), but the bad performance made the magic disappear <br /> <br />. <br /> Br /> I really do not understand why so many people voted this movie so <br /> <br /> well.
