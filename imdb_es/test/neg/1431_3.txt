What starts pretty well (and quite unsettling) quickly sinks into an annoying mess. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider (of Twisted Sister's infamy) apparently wrote the script for his own idea, and although the idea of ​​a cyber - Pierce Freak's lurking has potential, they really make it burst here in rhythm Irregular, bad dialogue and one of the best non-end you will ever see. Despite some lifeless performances, the director manages a genuinely spooky first reel. It really looks like it's going to be a good low budget effort. <br /> <br /> Without so much luck. The plot runs all over the map, and the character of Snider spits tirelessly tedious psychotic fortune cookie lines that are supposed to go through meaningful dialogue. Worse yet, the cast of support is barely registered, and the only half-believable dialogue is that of a girl who helps a detective navigate the Internet. <br /> <br /> What a waste of a great idea. Oh, and there's a new song by Sister Twisted, if you care.
