I really wanted to like this movie for all kinds of reasons: the subject is intrinsically interesting and is probably the main problem facing the world today and has thrown fascinating works (for example, When I lived in the modern times of Linda Grant) , usually from the Israeli side of the fence. Also, a guy that I like told me that he thought it was the best movie I had seen all year, so with that recommendation ... <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, I actually came across the head in the points! It is true that I was tired and the cinema seats are comfortable, but I had a hard time trying to identify with the characters. Once I understood the idea that it was a series of vignettes, I went with it, but this made it disappointing as a sketching show instead of a movie. I liked the concept of a restricted, almost silent staging, in contrast to these utopian moments: the sexy girl, the red balloon and the Muslim ninja fighter. But personally I think the movie has been exaggerated. I'm not saying that the narrative and the plot is everything (it definitely is not) but even a little more dialogue would have helped.
