BLOOD CORRIDORS <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.66: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and white) <br /> <br /> London, 1840: when trying to formulate an anesthetic solution, a dedicated surgeon (Boris Karloff) becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local bodysnatchers. <br /> <br /> Riding the tails of a Gothic renaissance caused by the recent success of Hammer's THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1957), Robert Day's CORRIDORS OF BLOOD is a strange mixture of historical drama and theater of Grand Guignol. Producer Richard Gordon pulled Karloff away from Hollywood, where his film career had been stuck in a routine of B movies (VOODOO ISLAND, FRANKENSTEIN 1970, etc.) for a couple of scandals in which good men are frustrated by circumstances out of your control. . In GRIP OF THE STRANGLER (1958), he played a novelist who stumbles upon an awful secret while investigating a series of murders in recent history, while in CORRIDORS OF BLOOD, he is a drug addict surgeon who falls prey to a gang of criminals. By the owner of the East End pub, Francis de Wolff. Less a horror movie than a melodrama with macabre details, the film covers its commercial bets by including a series of bloody emotions (a cut leg, a face destroyed by acid, etc.), but the narrative is motivated mainly by the persecution altruistic Karloff. of an anesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during surgery. <br /> <br /> Produced under the title 'The Doctor from Seven Dials', the finished film was not published until 1962 due to the indifference of the MGM distributors, by moment in which the co-star Christopher Lee had won a important credit on the screen, despite playing a small but significant role as 'Resurrection Joe', a sinister Cockney thug who murders selected customers of the Wolff pub and sells the remains to local doctors. . Lee filmed this glorified cameo before THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN catapulted him to international stardom, which explains his limited screen time, although his intense acting is one of the highlights of the film. Adrienne Corri (VAMPIRE CIRCUS) distinguishes herself as the partner in Wolff's crime, and there is a party of familiar faces in supporting roles, including Francis Matthews (DRACULA: PRINCE OF DARKNESS), Betta St. John (THE CITY) OF THE DEAD), Finlay Currie and Nigel Green. Magnificent art direction (by Anthony Masters) and cinematography (Geoffrey Faithful).
