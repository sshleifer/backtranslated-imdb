I would like to be able to tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it advocates. But I can not. Another species could have come and mutated while waiting for some action. For such a controversial man, Darwin lived the more conventional life. If you did not know about the crazy theories, you could almost confuse it with a stamp collector. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have considered Darwin a dullard who does him no favors. Even when he loses his mind briefly due to his tireless theory, it was not interesting to observe. Maybe the great thinkers are boring people? I do not know what I expected: an eccentric who hits his forehead with hair and wild eyes that defend his love for all simian things, the flash of madness that filters from a frowning forehead? A long-haired hermit who babbled at the animals? A lunatic with eyes lit like real beacons? All the above would have been great. These are the movies for the sake of Scorsese. <br /> <br /> But there was none of that. Without lightning, without thunder, without wonders, without fear. Only Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly fresh out of the Sutile as Breath School of Method Acting. I imagine that someone with Darwin's ideas had a brain like a train at high speed, so why is this movie just moving forward - chug chug chug - like a slow winter? The disappointment is immeasurable.
