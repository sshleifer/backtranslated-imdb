Family Guy is easily one of the worst shows I've ever forced myself to watch (although not on THE bottom, I've seen The Jersey Shore). A popular success among high school and college students who confuse immaturity with nervousness, this show is not original and is obsolete. <br /> <br /> As it has been called a comedy show, let's take a look at its "humor". 1. Random flashbacks / celebrity cuts, movies, politics or anything that can be cut to laugh. He got old after 5 repetitions per episode. Simple solution: every time you hear "This is worse than / like time ...", connect your ears. <br /> <br /> 2. Inappropriate for its own sake. This show is famous for inserting inappropriate gags that have little to do with the general plot. Solution: Look South Park. They did well. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that Family Guy is not worth your time, and does not hold a candle for The Simpsons.
