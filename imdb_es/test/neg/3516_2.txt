By no means this oversimplified script, with basically one character, should be interpreted as an entertainment function. In fact, he has enough material for a short eighteen minutes, and even that would seriously gravitate his attention span. Zero characters develop beyond Noble Willingham. The endless close-ups of lips and phones induce sleep, and the script is so underdeveloped that a chimp could have written it. In fact, all this sad thing should not have been filmed. A tape recording would have been more than enough to put you to sleep. Definitely not recommended. - MERK
