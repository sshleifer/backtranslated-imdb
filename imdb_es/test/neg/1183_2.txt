*** May contain spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I had many expectations for this movie, based on the trailer. I knew a little about the real Ed Gein, so I thought this was a Hollywood version of real middle-budget events. The man was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the writing apparently came from an eight-grade student who barely knew anything about Ed's story and extended the script in about 20 minutes. The film completely ignores the most interesting facets of Ed and his relationship with his mother (not to mention what the royal police found in his house) and decides to focus mainly on the young deputy who seems to have just entered the set. In the same way, all male characters seem to be improvising their dialogue throughout the entire film. I'm not exaggerating. <br /> <br /> Do not make me start with historical mistakes in this movie. Seriously, who the hell directed this? This film is supposed to take place around 1957, but the cops carry modern side-handle batons, some of the things in the hardware store seem to come from Lowes, and when the police arrive at a pay phone, dial 9-1-1 ( it did not exist then). Also, Ed was a small, scary guy like Anthony Perkins' character in Psycho (which was supposedly based on Ed in real life), not this big guy who ended up looking too much like the bad guy in Men In Black. <Br /> <br /> Another thing that really bothered me was the appearance that the creators of this movie filmed everything in a set of 3 abandoned buildings. Due to the "intelligent" camera angles, you never see a real city, and the interior of the sets looked like old, abandoned shacks. Open a cash register in a saw-horse and bam! - instant hardware store. <br /> <br /> I usually forgive low-budget horror movies, but this one just asks for it. All I had to do was include most of the real events (even beautify them!), Pay five good actors instead of 15 shit, and for Pete's sake, take 5 minutes and think about the time period occasionally. My advice: Google Ed Gein, you will be much more entertained.
