I was extra in this movie, in the part filmed at the airport in the first 15 minutes or so; I was one of the refugees from Bangladesh who fled (mostly Mexicans) and ran on the tracks of Ryan Field in Tucson. At one point, standing around our turbans while we waited for another shot, one of my fellow extras turned to me and asked what the move was about. I told him it was going to be a remake of Lost Horizons, just like a musical. There was a long pause, then he replied: "Man, this movie is going to suck." Pretty perceptive of him, I thought. I had a good time and I earned some money, but even with some interesting personal memories that are attached to this movie, I can not ignore the whole thing. <br /> <br /> If you ever saw the movie "The Swarm", you can get an idea. You can see many famous and talented people wasted in an idea that at first sight is BAD. The idea seemed to be that if you invest enough money in a movie and hire great names, then you do not need a good story and good writing. Just turn the big crank, and the product comes out. It just is not worth seeing.
