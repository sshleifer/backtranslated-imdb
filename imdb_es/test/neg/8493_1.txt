I can imagine how this movie came to be: <br /> <br /> "So, how else can we ruin our careers?" <br /> <br /> "I know, let's take a film that was tremendously successful and make a sequel to it! <br /> <br />" Perfect! We will get grade B actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We will save millions and get a massive profit, no matter the fact that nobody wants to see a second part with any of the original actors that made it popular in the first place! We as executives still honestly believe that a movie was popular based on the name and the story, not the actors who made it in the first place! "<br /> <br />" Brilliant! Let's put a huge budget and get the cheapest actors we can find! "<br /> <br /> And really, that's what Son Of The Mask can be described as: Just a simple B-movie that tries to suck life Out of its original classic. <br /> <br /> However, if the film did not contain the words the mask, or anything to do with the mask, it would be a good movie for children, horrible acting, this will really attract the children, it's a good-natured movie that really wants to scream " like me! ", but only those of 8 years and younger will really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Jamie Kennedy is the only one worth mentioning in this movie It is clear that he is trying to make the material work , playing the father desperate, but the script is very poor, the only thing that says it's worth it was my drink after seeing this.Loki's character also deserves a mention, since he was the nicest character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this movie It's a shame the character. If you get lost in this movie, I would have liked to see the character take on the true mask. Instead, we are reduced to jokes and toilet humor near the end. <br /> <br /> The plot is so much for the books that I will not bother mentioning it here. Everything is so obvious that even a Disney executive would be green with envy. <br /> <br /> Save your money, this is being directed to a DVD in three months from the point of view. Shame in the studios, for once again staining a decent movie with a horrible sequel. Did not they teach you anything stupid and silly?
