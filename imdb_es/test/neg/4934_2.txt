It cost me to sit through this. Each turn and turn is predictable. You're sitting there just waiting for him ... waiting for him ... and yes, there he is! As you predicted at the beginning of the movie. Or 10 minutes outside. Etc. <br /> <br /> Intelligent writing? No. <br /> <br /> Porn torture? No, there is no nudity. Other reviews that call this torture pornography are probably written by people who use heavy drugs. Unfortunately, there is no torture or nudity (yes, no nudity). <br /> <br /> There is no suspense at all in this "thriller". The only good part of this movie is the ending, but I'm not going to spoil that. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2/10. A 1/10 would be a horrible B movie. This movie had a better performance.
