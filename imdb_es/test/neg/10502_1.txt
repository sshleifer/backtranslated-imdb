If you come here, it's because you've already seen this movie and you were curious about what others had to say about it. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for you, I * really * do it. And I apologize profusely as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this film has had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. I heard that there is no cure for retinal bleeding reported in every dozen cases. <br /> <br /> Like everyone else, I rented this movie believing it was a stupid deception by Blade in a movie movie. I thought, "Sure I could laugh at a stupid movie." I will give the creators of this film a positive comment on their 'creation': Thank you for removing the REC XX / XX / XX from the lower right corner of the screen. I can see that that would have been a distraction to see this movie. <br /> <br /> And for the record, * I saw * the movie, but I did not see it. The dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, I swear to God. <br /> <br /> You know what? I'm not writing about this anymore. It is too painful.
