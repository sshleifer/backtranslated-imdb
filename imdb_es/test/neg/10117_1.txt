This is truly one of the most horrible movies of all time. It is boring, heavy, badly acted and with teeth dragged and pretentious. <br /> <br /> I watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to develop, before I realized that there was none. Shooting in the budget of a shoe chain was particularly painful. These have to be the worst days for night shots from Plan Nine from outer space. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature is the ridiculous 'demon' who roams the countryside with a plastic basket for cats. What fear does that give? And I liked the moggys used as extras, I guess they are less expensive. Although it seemed a bit obvious that they had been attracted to the camera by the careful placement of a tuna. <br /> <br /> This movie is so terrible, I should have a public health warning. There was a queue at my local video store when I recovered it, from people claiming their money. It is not a joke!
