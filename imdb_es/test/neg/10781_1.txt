Sometimes there is a movie so bad that you just stare in amazement. This is one of those movies. Of course I can not help being partial. I'm from Chicago, so I watched the scenes closely to check the accuracy and I find nothing funny about Billy Crystal. And I can not stand all that English style photography (Tony Scott, etc.) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the lighting soft and vigorous. I guess we're supposed to believe that Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because he's wearing a Cubs shirt. Oh and the plot. If you really think about it, these guys should be locked up, not the bad ones, because they are more dangerous. And, of course, there is the clich√© of the police officers about to retire. But the funniest scene is the climax where the good guys and the bad guys machine gun at others at the Thompson Center (a state building!) Of course it's a great building, but it's the equivalent of doing a big drug business in the White House.
