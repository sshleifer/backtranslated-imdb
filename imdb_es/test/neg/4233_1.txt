I saw this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival, and I would not recommend it. It lasts two and a half hours, during which nothing happens to the rhythm of the papillae. <br /> <br /> The main characters lack gums and lack charisma or personality. No one smiles at all during the movie (nor would she if she had their lives), and although Domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite, she does not seem to enjoy sex at all. <br /> <br /> The whole experience is depressing and heavy, the director lingered in each scene in a way that drove me crazy instead of surprising me with the beauty of his technique. <br /> <br /> Too many questions remained in my mind: why? Does he smell the head of the Algerian man? Why levitate? What is looking over the allocation fence? Why do you kiss Jos√©? Why did we go to see this garbage instead of ordering another bottle of wine in Bouzy Rouge?
