An expedition party formed by idiots who fight constantly and are disgusting, goes into the dangerous African jungle in search of a fortune with diamonds and a young missing woman named Diana (the luxurious brunette Katja Biernet, dressed only with a loincloth that shows a large part of his hot well formed body) that is worshiped as a goddess by a primitive deadly tribe called Mabutos. The director / screenwriter Jess Franco fails to inject any style or vigor into the generally blah and meandering proceedings, allowing the slow rhythm to drift to an often agonizing pace and organize the infrequent action scenes with a singular lack of skill and of garbo. The terrible dubbing, the excessive amount of grainy material "National Geographic", such as the archival material, the marvelous, the score of the waiting room, the terrible performance, the uncomplicated narrative, the soft-core sex scenes and the Static photography does not help either. . Fortunately, there are plenty of tasty naked nudes in sight to relieve boredom to a reasonable degree: in addition to the delicious Biernert, both Aline Mess and fierce, the evil high priestess Noba as Mari Carmen Nieto as the connoting and treacherous Lita are also very easy to understand the eyes The beautiful landscape of the jungle is also very beautiful. But, in general, this image has a barely visible size and, therefore, is immediately forgotten.
