These days, writers, directors and producers rely more and more on the "surprise" ending. The old art of bringing a film to close, taking all the information we have learned throughout the film and bringing it to a beautiful and complete ending, has been lost. Now what we have is a film that, no matter how complex, detailed or frivolous it may be, can be finished in 5 minutes. It was all in his head. That explanation is the director's safety net. If all else fails, or if the writing was not so good, or if we run out of money to complete the film, we can always say "everything was in your head" and finish the movie that way. The audience will buy it because, well, none of us is a psychologist, and none of us suffer from schizophrenia (not that we know), so we take the story and believe it. After all, the mind is a powerful thing. Some movies have done it. But those movies are the reason why we're getting more and more of these fucking ends. All the directors / writers now think they can do it because, well, Fight Club did it and it made a lot of money. So we get movies like The Machinist, Secret Window, Identity and this movie (just to name a few).
