This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. At first I thought it would be good because I was interested in the triangle of shorts, but instead it was terrible. All he did was offer a lot of unconvincing explosions that made no sense (if time moves differently, that's why the woman did not age and her son aged quickly) and had a horrible end. The next time the guys who did this go to Bermuda, they should take all the copies of this movie. Please, everyone vote for this movie so you can get into the worst movie list.
