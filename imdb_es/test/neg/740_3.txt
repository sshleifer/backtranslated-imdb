(This could have a spoiler) <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, I thought it was fine. The music was good and that sequence of bizarre dreams that I was willing to forgive, but the lack of looks in the main character and in all the other characters, that's why I was not interested in seeing the rest of this movie. (I know, totally vain). The music at the beginning was animated and appropriate, I thought of a fake gothic novel. But we go! Saxophone music for a movie of the early nineteenth century? It did not fit totally. This movie was totally boring and if you're looking to watch a good vintage movie or Austen do not rent the Northanger Abbey! I give you 30% 30% = a failing grade!
