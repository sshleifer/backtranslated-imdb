I have always been a fan of Chuck Norris for what he has accomplished and his films. For a while I had wanted to see this movie, but for some reason I had no chance. Apparently I did not miss much. This has to be one of Chuck's worst movies. Then this truck driver, Billy Dawes (Augenstein) is given the opportunity to make his delivery, but in the way he is diverted and forced to enter a jerkwater city where a local silly judge Trimmings (Murdock) who runs all the city, they arrested him and false accusations about him. He denies the accusations and escapes. The local police beat him and he disappeared. But now his brother JD John Dawes (Norris) another truck driver goes to look for him. He soon realizes that the town is directed to buy the losing judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found. Not long after he starts hitting almost everyone in the city. Meanwhile, the woman in the movie calls the local truck drivers on a CB radio, and they all come running to the city to demolish it. LOL with large platforms. Finally, Norris finds his brother and hits more thugs. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty bad. Actually, it starts OK and you feel good when Norris starts crushing some of these local corrupt cops, because there are such losers. But there is practically no history, the performance is bad and the end ... well, it does not really have one. The judge has ruined his house with a large platform and you never know what happens. He lives? Norris does not even destroy it. Meanwhile, Norris confronts an evil cop at the end. Who cares? Norris also manages to face everyone in the city, breaks his hand, shoots him in the side and continues to fight. Come on! Apparently, this movie was made to take advantage of the CB fashion of the time, why there was one that surpasses me. They barley even use the CB's in the movie. In addition to this, the film near the end seems to lengthen and one wonders why it is not over yet. This movie is bad, but if you're bored and you need something to watch, time will pass. As for Norris, he came to make films much better than this. 3 out of 10
