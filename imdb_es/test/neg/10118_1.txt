Hm Where do I start? Usually, I do not know what rating IMDb has when searching for a movie because I think I would like it anyway or whatever, and at least I should give it a try, but this time I wish I had paid attention. <br /> <br /> I know some people liked it, and I'm not trying to say they should not. It was semi-fun in some places. But if you're like me and you do not like to see cats roaming the underbrush for 20 minutes, random fast moving clouds scenes, dogs barking in cages for another 20 minutes with "exciting" music and close-ups of faces while people is talking, then you may want to avoid this movie. The actors were positively wooden or very much above, and the quality of the film was horrible, fuzzy, grainy and bland, and not in an artistic way. And I know we were supposed to think that Carol was not just crazy crazy with a gun that shot innocent people with this strange religious psychosis, but ... well, she really does not convince me otherwise. In fact, I ended up really disgusted by his crazy character. And what about the souls in space? I understand that this is a fantasy movie, but let's go. <br /> <br /> I will say that the angel at the end was becoming creepy. It was the most spooky thing in the whole movie, much more spooky than the lava-lava demon of Darth Maul. I give them accessories for that scene, it was good. But not enough to see the movie. And the opening credits were great, but do not be fooled! I would prefer that they use the money that was invested in those credits to improve the film. <br /> <br /> Bah. I wish I had not bought this even for the $ 2 I paid, I could have bought a chocolate bar. : /
