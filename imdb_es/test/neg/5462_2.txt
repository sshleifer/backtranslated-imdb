I have to agree with what many of the other reviewers concluded. A theme that could have been stimulating and shed light on an inverted double standard failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Rape is a crime of violence and forced abusive control, the scenes here were for the most part pathetic. It would have been a better idea to cover brief visions of what was happening and let the audience imagine the event. And the victim's laughter with the police, when he aborted his police report, seemed as genuine as the police's. It is not uncomfortable, there is no doubt about simply joining. I do not know if it was a bad performance or a bad address, but someone did not understand the point. As for his supposed half-search for his attackers, pathetic. They should have skipped most of the sex scenes, another monumental failure in themselves, and have him meet Colin Friels when he went to the police for the first time. The story could have been crafted with a good dialogue and an occasional flashback, and saved by the performance and superior presence, Colin Friels, the only reason I saw this movie, brings to any project he does. <br /> <br /> The only concrete revelation of this movie is that it was bullshit.
