I agree with the comment of other users. It's hard to believe that this movie came out in 1994 because it screams in the mid-80s. I think it's bent because the sound and the image do not always coincide. If someone can really say that this is a good movie, they should be locked up. It's so sad how money has so much power over people who will do anything to get it. I feel like I lost my intelligence seeing this. I used to have a little bit of respect for Chuck Norris before I saw this, but now I feel bad. I bought this as part of a 3-film package for $ 9.99 and I can honestly say it would have been better to literally throw away the money. Forgive me Jesus.
