The Godfather: The Latin godfather, although it seems to be a DVD / video type movie directly, my full frame copy obviously seemed cut out, so maybe this movie had a limited theatrical career. And the character in the title looks more like a Gringo than a moi (I'm half Honduran). Rise and fall quite typical of a narcotics trafficking film with list A actors list B: Robert Wagner (lawyer), Kathleen Quinlan (judge of the crusade), Tiny Lister (executor of the mafia), Gary Busey (child rapist ), Brad Dourif (White power jailbird), Stacey Keach (afflicted governor), Joann Pacula (afflicted Milf), Faye Dunaway (advocate of the crusade) and Galo Make Canote as an uncredited guest at the party. This movie is pretty boring. the game of Skins, the only thing that saved him was Jennifer Tilly as a crazy Latina murderer who is dedicated to the sale of drugs. She was exaggerated and sexy so it was fun to watch her scenes. It is not worth renting or looking for. D +
