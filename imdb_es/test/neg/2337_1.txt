Some directors take 2 and a half hours to tell a story, David Lynch takes 2 and a half hours to put together scenes with "clues" and its characteristic rarity, but there is never a story. There is no plot. There is no progression of the characters (unless you find delirium revealed a "progression"). It surprises me how someone can call "art" Lynch's trash, but if beauty rests in the eye of the beholder, so be it. The movie and Lynch's television work in the 1980s became "avant-garde" and "alternative", good. 20 years later, work as "Mulholland Drive" comes out as a 2.5 hour David Lynch masturbation piece. It's embarrassing. I have finally seen the movie that takes my first place as the worst of all. At least the people who produced "Godzilla" and "Rodan" did not pass them off as "art".
