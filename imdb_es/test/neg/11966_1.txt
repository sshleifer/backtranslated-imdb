Initiation to the local sports team involves taking the novices to the cornfields and guess what? There is a scarecrow that murders people there. Only one of the rookies survives but falls into a coma due to diabetes. Meanwhile, the scarecrow begins to kill all the people involved, one by one. What is the secret of the scarecrows? Will they find out before the scarecrow takes them all? This is a low budget movie and it shows. The sound is fine, but the image is really corny. The plot / script really sucks and is quite pathetic and not logical. The acting is really bad and sometimes simply laughable. I really can not say much about the special effects because there are not many, but the few that there are are bad or good (for a low budget). There is some nudity and that is probably the only thing that is worth seeing in the movie (that is, if your teenager is hot, if not, he skips the movie altogether). Another complete waste of time and money, so I do not see it. It goes for hack'n'slash fans too.
