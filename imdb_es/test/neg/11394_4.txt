The recent documentary "The Adventures of Errol Flynn" is a deep look at the last hero of Hollywood. Bogart, Cagney, Wayne and the like were basically blue-collar men in their screen images, but Flynn was an aristocrat in style and style, the youngest son to sculpt his own feud for a sword, thunder and romantic analogy that ironically found . caught. If he had not been under contract with Warner Bros., he would have been perfect in the role of Cary Grant in Suspicion: the handsome handsome whose 1000 watt smile blinds him to the fact that he is a predator. And he could have starred his best sister, Sister Joan Fontaine. That was Flynn's problem: he was the hero of the final screen until his own habits and the bad moment reached him. Grant and Flynn are somewhat similar, but Flynn was the most macho of the two; it is possible to see Grant as Captain Blood, but Flynn in The Philadelphia Story, Mr. Blanding builds his Dream House, or Monkey Business, or Operation Petticoat 'I have put those papers in his collective ears because he is very sure of himself and the sexual tension that would have brought naturally would have made the story lines wobble. But this wobbly biography is just a plasticized vision of Flynn and his time. There are times when I almost expected a laughing song or audience to say "Ahhh" at some point. Do not go into the life of Flynn only in the view of the screen magazine. Nor does he delve into his struggle to be considered more than a doer. Like the improved biographies of Lon Chaney (the father, not the werewolf, or Lenny "Of mice and men") and Buster Keaton, made in the 50s, this is just a moment of death.
