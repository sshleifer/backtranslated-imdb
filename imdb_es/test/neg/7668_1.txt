This movie is an absolute disgrace! I really enjoyed the original Airport, and I can not believe how the same people could produce this Twaddle nine years later. First, the acting is bad. The original had actors who had made quality films (without disasters) before, but this one already uses actors who have already done the disaster film circuit (Blakely, Kennedy, Wagner). In addition, the character of George Kennedy, Patroni, seems to be promoted very quickly. Now he is the protagonist of the film, but his character is not strong enough to carry it out: he has lost the charm and mood of Airport (1970), and now the character is simply bored. Did I mention the plot? Is it believable that someone sends a missile after the Concorde? DO NOT!!! There are too many loose ends; Scenes that have no relevance to the plot. The scene in which the hot air balloon lands on the runway, the pursuit of the thief at the Charles De Gaulle airport are two of those scenes. Both would be interesting, if only they had something to do with the real story. There are also many unanswered questions: Why does Patroni open the window and fire a flare at the other plane? Why does the character of Robert Wagner commit suicide? (It must have another stupid and expensive way of Why is there no question after the missile almost blows up the Concorde?) Why are the return projections so bad? (It seems that a cartoon missile is following the Concorde although it works well when the plane lands in Paris) Why does Patroni think he is in a flight simulator (when he flips the Concorde) Why does he receive a hero's welcome in the cockpit of the plane after having terrified the passengers? final so poor, if you can say it is an end.Due to its one-dimensional character, nobody seems to realize this.The blessing given to the young couple on the plane by the coach of the girl is shmaltzy, the The man who plays the saxophone is annoying, and the woman with the bladder problem is just dumb.The scenes in which Susan Blakely lies on the roof of her winter garden, and when she tells Wagner that she still loves him, are pretty horrible s This movie should have been the climax of the previous one. Ous three films from the airport: instead, it is a waste of time, money, energy, celluloid and diabolic, sub-moronic, complete and absolute "talent". Remember when Patroni asks the French driver if "he has ever landed on his belly?" This movie certainly makes the belly flop, and lands flat on its pointy nose ...
