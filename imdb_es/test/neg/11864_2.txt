This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I could barely stay awake. The acting and the plot were horrible. I like serial movies, but this movie has nothing that can make me laugh or think. Okay, at the beginning there were two or three fun times, so I have to give this movie 2 out of 10. If you really want to see it, look at the first 10 minutes. After that, you will feel increasingly disappointed while the movie is running.
