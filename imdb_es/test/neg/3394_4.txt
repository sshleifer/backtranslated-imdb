A friend invited me to see this in theaters. <br /> <br /> After half an hour we go out, and enter the next multiplex (yes, we broke the rules) in time to discover the beginning of Against All odds. <br /> <br /> I remember too many monkeys dancing around saying, "Oog, oog." Very little about the characters or the introduction to the story captured one of us or it was memorable. It just crawled to the point of being painfully boring (and believe me, any excuse was good enough to spend time with this particular friend). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​were excellent, good photography and lighting, but this was an important studio release, and we came to see a movie, not an art gallery. It seemed that Ralph Richardson and Andie McDowell would be wasted in a badly written film. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you go to the second hour, there is something worth seeing. I do not have so much patience with my time. 4 out of 10
