Max Cash, a ship captain who works on the Caribbean island of San Sebastian, is hired by Sarah, who is looking for the legendary ship, El Diablo and its stolen treasure that sank on the reef in the seventeenth century. But something seems to be protecting the whereabouts of the ship, since the people who knew something about it are being killed. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with those who had the impression that this was going to be a characteristic horror. Instead, we ended up with an offshore adventure film from 1977 "The Deep", low-key and late 80's, but with a disconcerting supernatural origin and an injection of mystery. History is a domesticated mess (so many inconsistent angles do not have a sense of meaning and encourage a stained rhythm) and the technical aspect is awkward. Good exotic location and underwater photography. While the carefree performances were not so bad either. A gruff Wayne Crawford is cleverly fun and June Chadwick is right next to him. Sheri Able is quite attractive to the eyes. There are some strange developments that entertain and one or two mysterious sequences. However, there is a real lack of cohesion. Most cut-out deaths occur off-screen, except for the bloody and unintelligible deaths made by something invisible. Again just another thing that leaves you high and dry. The music is generic with its noise signals to warn us of an approaching danger and the POV shots do a good exercise. Tatty, but observable.
