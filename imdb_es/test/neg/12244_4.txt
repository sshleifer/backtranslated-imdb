With so many horrible parody movies, this is sadly a breath of fresh air for the genre. Compared to the classic ones like Airplane or Naked Gun, this is horrible, but compared to the recent fake movies like Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie, it is very intelligent and original. Do not get me wrong, though, this was not a good movie in any way. I laughed a couple of times, and there are some inspired gags, but any reference to pop culture falls flat on your face, as do most of the jokes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Lambeau Fields (David Koechner) was a bad Coach in the past, but now he has come back to teach college football, and this time he will do a good job. His wife (Melora Hardin) feels distant from him and his daughter is dating a great soccer player despite his father. The jokes of several recent movies come into play, as do many visual gags and nonstop nonsense. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the movie are the gags that do not trust the reference to recent movies. Spoofs of Radio, Rocky, Dodgeball, Friday Night Lights, Invincible and many other sports movies are not fun in the least. It is mainly the smaller gags that provoke some laughter, such as a strange scraping scene of the crotch or a joke of chewing tobacco. These little disposable giggles can not carry the movie, and in the end, it's hard to see. The last 20 minutes are exhausting to sit down. <br /> <br /> The characters are surprisingly developed for a sports parody movie, however, I'm sure the characters were based on clich√©s of the genre. However, they are not that bad. David Koechner can take the lead actor out of a movie. Too bad they gave him so much material to work with. Matthew Lawerence has a good comedy time in a role not always as comical as a ballet football player with a father who dresses up. Carl Weathers rounds out the cast, once again playing in a sub-par sports movie (Not the Rocky movies ... Happy Gilmore!) Overall, this is a silly comedy. Sometimes, it's fun, but most of the time, it's very annoying and predictable. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 90 minutes. PG-13 for language, sexual humor and drug humor.
