I rented this pile of sewage waste waiting for some good laughs. With a title like `Zombie Bikers from Detroit 'and the Dead Alive productions stamped on the cover, you'd think this could be a funny / scary movie, but no. This is the worst movie I've seen (and yes, I've seen all the films of the Police Academy). The story (this is a joke within itself) and the dialogue are atrocious. The make-up of the so-called zombies seems to have used one of those two-dollar kits `Make yourself like a zombie 'that you buy in K-Mart. <br /> <br /> I'd rather watch Beverly Hills 90210 while you listen to the Backstreet Boys and get hit by a 400-pound birthday card model that does not let you spend another minute of this pathetic excuse for a DVD. Honestly, I could make a better movie with $ 3, some palette sticks and a little furtive. I feel that 90 minutes of my life were taken from me and taken to the land of Suckdom. I know that labeling in the Dead Alive production does not guarantee a great movie, but you do expect your money to be worth it. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me happy (except, returning the horrible mass of elephant droppings) was that it was not titled 'Biker Zombies from Pittsburgh'. I feel for the people of Detroit who squandered their hard earned money in this case. Unless it has been lobotomized. Do not buy, rent if necessary ?? But ??. You will regret it.
