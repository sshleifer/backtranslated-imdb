While this is definitely a well-made piece of film, it is completely without any entertainment value. <br /> <br /> If you are already depressed, this movie will send you to the limit. <br /> <br /> If you feel depressed, this movie will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter. You will feel that it is simply your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you could get out of this movie unscathed (I did not. 't, BTW), sure your life is much better than Jim's. Then, again, you might consider that you have been deceiving yourself, and that in fact you are in a much worse situation than you had realized. You may feel a little annoyed with Jim for calling your attention to this. You may want to slap him a little with a wet fish. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that, as much as I liked this movie ... I hated it. He took a long and miserable path down the road of oblivion and then, suddenly, for no reason, he looked at himself and then stopped. <br /> <br /> Jim does not have an epiphany, at least not one. Transmitted on screen. Jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options. He does not discover anything with which one can relate and does not achieve any significant progress in his journey of self-discovery. <br /> <br /> Of course, no one alive could write a happy ending to this movie. As others have said that it is not a Hollywood story, it is harsh and it is real. It's well done. Life is a struggle at times. If someone knew "the answer", it suits them to shout from the rooftops. <br /> <br /> Even so, I feel cheated because this movie claims to have something to say. You feel that you are going to say something, that if you suffer a little more, you will have something to say. It will make you stop and think. <br /> <br /> It does not. <br /> <br /> Again, I affirm that this is a well-made movie. And, therefore, it can be of value to a film student with an inclination for, for example, lighting techniques using color palettes. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, it's absolutely impossible.
