This movie has some nice special effects, wrecking the Japanese archipelago to a degree that would humiliate Godzilla. The two protagonists also put on performances above par. Apart from that, everything is a bit strange in this discrete disaster film. The inconsistencies in the rhythm are strange. At one point, Hokkaido sank into the sea and the pyroclastic snow fell on the rest of Japan, while Osaka is buried under a huge tsunami. However, in other parts of the country, people still wander around the tourist attractions and lick the ice cream when another tsunami hits ... Kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any obstacle, or even a fold in his color shirt cream. Other people present with burns, torn clothing and mud lines on the face. <br /> <br /> The Japanese character of the film is poignant and disgusting. The sacrifice of Kusanagi on his last night with Shibasaki is a touch of chivalry that is rarely seen in this genre these days. However, the PM's disadvantaged meditations on the Japanese psyche and the seduction of death, and the fact that Japan is abandoned by all and has no friends in the end, hint at a darker paranoia that infects Japanese concerns. with respect to your state in the country. world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the final sequence is an Armaggedon scam, edited with a cookie cutter. <br /> <br /> Finally, my own bear-insect in particular: the heavy-handed placement of cigarette products. This time, he is an angry scientist (or is it him?) Toyokawa who becomes the boy on the Japan Tobacco cartel. At one point, he manages to illuminate 5000 meters below the surface of the ocean, in a subminiature the size of a telephone box. Give me a break.
