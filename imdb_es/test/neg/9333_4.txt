"Solomon and Sheba" was the kind of movie you had to go see in the late 50's when I was a kid: a spectacular biblical epic with famous artists, unusual costumes, many extras and battle sequences. So I went to see him; but I remember that at that time "Solomon and Sheba" did not impress me at all, which was a strange thing since I had really enjoyed "The Ten Commandments", "Quo Vadis", "Helen of Troy" and others. The point is that when you are a child you ignore the things in pictures that the adults do not (bad acting, for example) and you are easier to please with warriors in their armors, battles, duels of swords and action, so if you are a child . Not impressed, then something is wrong with a product of this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie, although it has some of these characteristics, is definitely standard and average. The wooden performance of Yul Brynner as the Hebrew king does not even light up when he has Gina Lollobrigida voluptuous and half naked dancing provocatively around him. She is better and makes an acceptable performance. George Sanders does not seem interested in what he's doing, and Marisa Pavan (Pier Angeli's twin sister) does not add up at all as a kind of Brynner's conscience. <br /> <br /> The final sword duel between Brynner and Sanders is just for the plot and lacks interest and intensity (he had to film it, that's all). <br /> <br /> It's not a good goodbye to director King Vidor, Solomon and Sheba will probably be remembered as the last powerless Ty Power. image.
