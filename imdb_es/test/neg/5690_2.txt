Let me break down this movie for you ... <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes are a showcase of terrible special effects. I'm not very enthusiastic about special effects, but what you must understand is that if you can not afford good special effects, you should not anchor your movie around special effects. The ships shoot colored spots between them, forming flames in explosions, and passing through past moons with a polygon low enough to count on the fingers. You will have no idea what is happening. It will not make sense. <br /> <br /> The second act involves a woman who walks in the desert. At this point, you will be treated to monotonous landscapes and boring and illogical fighting scenes. Nobody talks. Nothing interesting happens. The protagonist's objectives are not clear and they are not very convincing. This lasts for approximately 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> Then, in a five-minute montage, he sneaks into an enemy base, grabs a rocket, attempts to destroy a doomsday weapon, fails and dies. <br /> <br /> None of this has anything to do with the final direction of the movie. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes, basically the girl's memories are transferred to her daughter, who goes into stasis for a great number of years, learning the secrets of humanity. After this, we see the first and last segment of five minutes of human interaction in the film, then the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to be part of the material that causes the Big Bang or not. You know. Because when the universe is collapsing, you can decide if you want to be part of it. <br /> <br /> She chooses yes. BUT THE MEMORIES OF HUMANITY SURVIVE IN A CAPSULE. Maybe we will not make the same mistakes again, huh? If you like movies with characters, then this is not a good movie for you. The main roles could have been fulfilled very well with any old rope toy capable of staying face up while walking on the sand. The whole story is told through a painfully boring narrative. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to sound profound by putting together a bunch of undeveloped science fiction ideas. There are enough concepts here to feed a series of movies, but as it is, it is inflated with completely irrelevant details. Two thirds of this movie could have been reduced to a 45-second montage. Instead, the narrator completes the story of a novel without giving us a reason to worry about what happens to the characters. <br /> <br /> Here are good ideas, but nobody sees movies to see the ideas that are not explained. People watched movies to entertain themselves. This movie does not entertain.
