Oh, hell, where should I start ... First of all; this show is just another stupid American comedy not funny, which has a pathetic performance and a very poor mood. The American way of laughing at the business makes everything even worse. How can I hear the laughter, but nothing funny happens? Pretty stupid, huh? This program is only for those Americans who have never heard that there are much more fun, better and more witty comedies, not only in Great Brittain, but also in America (The Simpsons, for example). I just can not understand what is so good about "Reba" that has lasted a long time on television. It has nothing new to offer, it underestimates (possible) viewers in many ways and it just is not funny. I could have lived with the fact that there are shows as bad as "Reba", but why the hell did they have to direct him here in Finland? If I see a few seconds of this horrible spectacle, the rest of the day will be ruined for me. Trust my word and believe me: this show stinks even more than this kind of American "comedies". This is just horrible. Do yourself a favor; Never look at this peace of shit. <br /> <br /> Well, I leave a comment to those who now better this language. Thanks for your (possible) interest.
