When A Killer Calls has to be the biggest scam released by Asylum so far. This is a sexy nanny on duty who receives spooky calls from a creepy voice that asks repeatedly: "Have you checked the girl?" Naturally, she has the calls tracked by the cops (after having to perform really unnecessary tasks: hang up when "he" calls, wait ten seconds and dial * 57). Sounds familiar? Yes, that's why I also rented it. <br /> <br /> Well, it should. And I hate to say it, but this could have been more entertaining than the crapfest on the big screen that was launched at the same time if it were not for a fatal mistake: instead of reveling in the glory of the B movie, he tried to do it. something original He tried to make the main character nice, instead of having a clich√©, a country fun with it. Mind you, this could have worked with a talented actress. But she was not. Sure, it looked good, and he cried and cried, but ... . Oh well, whatever. <br /> <br /> Then came the horrible ending. It is not horrible, since it was horrible, horrible, because it was BORING. The rhythm until that moment (about an hour) was campy, cliche and fun. Then he heads in another direction, and moves away from another silly and funny movie with a sexy "teenager" to a Hostel-esquire gore / borefest. <br /> <br /> I guess this falls in the "Oh well, whatever the category". Did the main actress throw herself a line? Oh, well, whatever, I do not feel like solving it. Did we forget to motivate the murderer? Oh well, whatever it is, I do not feel like rewriting it. Does the rhythm completely change by half? Oh well, whatever, I do not feel like shaving fifteen minutes. Continuity errors? Oh, well, whatever. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of movie (silly, cheesy, predictable, campy splatter movie with the sexy cast), then you'll be fine until the end. The ending is stupid, it's not fun, it's not scary, it's not cheesy or cheesy or fast. In fact, there were almost five minutes in which the character did nothing but be tied (and that's not a spoiler because it's on the back of the DVD) and look at things in the room, then scream, and ... . . whatever is.
