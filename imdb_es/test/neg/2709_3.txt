I was actually planning to see this movie when I noticed it in my TV guide, but after about 5 minutes I decided that time is definitely more valuable than "Who's That Girl" could be worth it. Describing what Madonna's bad performance looks like is impossible and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever captured in the movie. This shit is an insult to the cinema and the intellect. Hardly ever! It qualifies a movie that I do not see from beginning to end, but in this case the first one is impossible. 2/10
