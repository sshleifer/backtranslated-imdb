This movie is a total waste of time. I can not understand anyone sitting through this garbage. Oh, I would have loved it when I was seven years old. I think a seven-year-old child could have written and directed it. <br /> <br /> There is no script, it does not act, only garbage. The best performance is that of the fighting cocks. I think I could whip these ninjas and I'm not someone you would consider hard. Totally unconvincing and did not arouse the least interest. I was yawning and laughing at the end of the first ten minutes of the movie. This is one that would alienate people from martial arts movies. Great comedy, bad action movie.
