The movie begins with Reeve (Ekin) and his assistant fighting against the same vampires. This scene is probably the best output of the whole movie. The rest of the movie unfortunately is cheesy, highly unrealistic and a Buffy the Vampire Slayer scam. The ending also stinks big. <br /> <br /> Some moments, like the scene in which Gypsy and Helen (played by the popular Chinese duo Twins: Charlene & Gillian) fight over a stuffed teddy bear, are particularly cringewables. History is also scarce, surely they could have found something more terrifying than a book called "Day for the night". <br /> <br /> Some good parts, however. Jackie Chan and Anthony Wong make the film bearable with their comic roles. However, good bits end there. Charlene and Gillian (of the Twins) have never been able to act well and bother you in pieces. Unfortunately, the role of "the friendly but small vampire" was given to Edison Chen, who is a handsome guy with no talent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 -
