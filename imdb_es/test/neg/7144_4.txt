Finally I rented this video after looking for it for many months. Initially I just wanted to see him because I'm a fan of Neil Pearson (Patrick, Isobel's boyfriend, the protagonist). However, the film holds very well without Neil (although he handles himself very well in this film, it is overshadowed by the three main female characters). It's a creepy and intense movie, the kind that the British do so well: definitely a "movie for girls" in the house and it's isolated, which gives the movie an aura almost of "Borrascosas Heights". The film is full of tension and the end, shocking, but somehow inevitable. I'm glad I saw it, it was worth the wait.
