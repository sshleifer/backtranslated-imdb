Lucille Ball can not sing or act or dance. This makes the quality of his performance in MAME even more terrible. He is not allowed to do the low eyebrow slapstick that made him a hit on television, so he has to rely on building a character. Unfortunately, Ms. Ball never learned that skill since none of the tender moments has warmth. How does she really feel about Patrick or Beau? We never really believe the words she says. That vacant look from Mrs. Ball must convince us that she is getting excited, but there is no chemistry between her and Bruce Davidson, Robert Preston or Bea Arthur. For this reason, each scene in which it is found is flat. <br /> <br /> Also, when Mrs. Ball opens her mouth to sing, we immediately realize the reason why the studios dubbed her voice for every other musical that she had previously starred in her career. It was said that she demanded that her voice be used, so this is a mistake of ego and leadership. It gets worse when he sings in a voiceover and has to "act the moment" without words. Whoever thought it would work forgot who played Mame. <br /> <br /> I understand that Rosalind Russell did the role on stage and in the movie AUNTIE MAME. In addition, I am aware that Angela Lansbury won a Tony for her performance in the original Broadway musical of 1966. None of these women was known for their singing voices, but both could have achieved this better than Lucille Ball. The reason they left with her is the worst in blatant evil. <br /> <br /> The only person left unharmed is Bea Arthur. It is big and wonderful, malicious and common in all the right amounts. Unfortunately, you are still waiting for this movie to take off and invites you to participate in the fun. But the movie never does it and you can not. No one apart from Bea Arthur seems to be having fun. <br /> <br /> An additional bad criticism is for director Gene Saks. Saks is known as an award-winning director of musicals and comedies for theater and screen, including the Broadway musical on which this film is based. None of those skills and experience is helpful here. The poor quality of the edition and the narrative in this film is below a director of his caliber. That obvious mistake in the execution of the film is not Mrs. Ball's fault.
