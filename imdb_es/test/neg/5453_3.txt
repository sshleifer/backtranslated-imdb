I never knew what the attraction of Karen Black was. She always had those small eyes and a strange look around her. She seemed often eccentric or chosen as the "other" woman. In this case, she is the psychic advisor and expert in the occult of a bad-tempered producer of malicious ads as she learns astral projection. He's a bad jerk, even without the new luggage. Apparently, this is the path to immortality, because if you become good at that, you can inhabit the bodies of future generations. I think Star Trek had a plot like this with Jack the Ripper for several centuries. Anyway, this guy is really dangerous. He has a good family and makes them miserable. Start killing friends, just because they have an unpleasant comment for them, or because they do not like it. You can see the end coming from the back row in the left field. It is a very hard movie, without humor. The greater part must be taken as truth. Why are some called but few chosen? I found it long and not very satisfactory.
