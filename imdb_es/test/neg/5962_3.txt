This is a great example of what could have been a great movie and a great idea, but it turned out to be really bad in the process. I was mainly tempted to get this because of the DVD cover, stupid, but I did it anyway and I was impressed, in a negative way. This film is essentially about how the Chupacabra wreaked havoc in Los Angeles and depends on a local animal cop and a writer to save the day, before two corrupt policemen and two evil scientists knock them down. The main reason why I did not enjoy this movie was due to large continuity errors that were hard to miss. Along with a bit of bad acting, good lighting and no fear, this movie did not impact me as much as I probably should have. However, compared to other films from Chupacabra, this undoubtedly tops the lists, barely. <br /> <br /> First of all, the continuity in this film is very far away and I mean the shoulders and the ditch. There were so many points in which the characters said or did something and then, in the next shot, they did not or the change never happened. Case in point: the main character has a weapon, Chupacabra attacks, he takes a touch out of nothing and distracts and the weapon disappears. The girl runs while he defends here with a mysterious touch and she did not have a gun, so the main character runs with the girl and has the gun. Where did the talent come from and what happened to the weapon? The time of day is ruined. One minute the sun goes down and you can still see the sun and then, the next minute, it seems like midnight. There were some holes in the plot, why was the Chupacabra there, what were the scientists doing, what happened to this guy and why did he shoot the animal and still live? These things bothered me a lot and none of the questions was answered. <br /> <br /> Next on the list is acting. Chico was wooden and bad. The main character of Navarro, played by Eric Algeria, seems to be too calm at certain points and too dedicated to discovering what killed some dogs and, when a tragedy occurs, his emotion just was not there. Elina Madison, who played Starlina, did a pretty bad job. She was the author of a very successful book about Chupacabra and she just did not seem in her role or performance. His performance was somewhat laughable and poor. Even for an author, she knows too much about that and knows how to disable a high security defense system in a hidden laboratory. Tony Criss was fine, but he seemed to be a bit quiet for some of the things that were happening. The film reminds me of a bad recreation of murder in some crime solving program, where actors and actresses are not so committed to their work. <br /> <br /> I rarely do not understand this anal when it arrives. For lighting or editing, but for this movie, I could not help being harsh with lighting. He took me out of the movie several times because the lighting was very poorly directed. There were times when they tried to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make it more "comical", but it failed. The worst part is at night when it is dark outside, but the scene is so saturated with light that it seems it is daytime. They keep changing from high intensity light to soft light for random scenes, and the lights seem so bright that the actors squinted. It should not be so bright that there are dark shadows in the night. During the sunset, when the lighting was perfect, that was the only time the light was good, other than that it was terrible. <br /> <br /> There was no fear in this movie. There was only one time I jumped, but other than that, I was not afraid. There were points where it could probably have been scary, but it was so damn light that you could see the Chupacabra approaching the man, but if it was dark, it would have been better. Even the design of the creature for the Chupacabra was poor, it looked good, but it was a short man or a boy in a jump suit. They did not hide their face; They showed him without any sense of mystery or enigmatic appearance. There was a good amount of blood, but it seemed unreal. This movie just was not scary, that's all. <br /> <br /> In general, they made Americanize a great South American legend into a bloodthirsty human devourer, which is not the Chupacabra. In fact, he was afraid of people and only killed goats, sheep, dogs and deer because he was said to hate the smell of humans. But, then, would it be history? I did not enjoy this movie for any reason, but I will give you credit for trying to make a good movie with good intentions. I would not recommend this movie to any horror fan, but if you like indie or B movies, you should take a look. Also, if you feel easily tempted by cult classics, you would enjoy this movie. I did not do it, I will not see it again, but somehow deeply sedated, I enjoy this kind of movies just to see what the other side of Hollywood is doing.
