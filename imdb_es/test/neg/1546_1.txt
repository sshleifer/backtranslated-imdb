I have already commented on this movie (under the name TheLegendaryWD). But I see that there are others who have commented since then. All I can say is: WHAT F ** K!? "I can not believe that a total of 16 people have commented on this movie or even seen this movie." Add to that the fact that a couple gives good reviews (probably the creators of the movie who went to one of those places in a mall that offers Internet services and wrote a good review, since there is no way they can pay their own Internet provider ... just watch your movie Although I still admit that I have a weakness for this movie, I thought that some of the other people who wrote about this could confuse it with another ... until I read the reviews ... especially the person who identified the label on the front of the box: "The latest in frontal lobotomy" (what ** k is supposed to mean that anyway? "Frontal" lobotomy?) ... I totally forgot about that until I read it in the People, we are a select few ... I say we meet once a year to see this movie ... wait, does anyone still have it? If someone has it please contact me ... I'm dying to get drunk
