If you live in the suburbs, are relatively well economically and do not have much contact with the urban life of England, then this is the comedy for you. It's not something a mass audience would go for, but if you're like these characters, show that you'll love it. In general, this is a comedy in which the snobs of the BBC will sit and laugh for their pleasure and only some of the selected audiences. Compared to BBC Comedys, such as Only Fools and Horses, Fawlty Towers, Black Adder and other classics, this series tends to move away from the usual BBC product and offer popular culture.
