Apart from the DA (James Eckhouse), and a woman who appears briefly and convincingly sympathizes with the plight of Ellen Gulden (Renee Zellweger), Ellen is the only convincing character, and a nice character in the film. She is the only one, not her dying mother, who should be and is the only true thing. Not only is it on paper, in Zellweger's performance, but also in the plot itself ... Until, the plot turns against itself, and turns the mother into "the only true thing" in the eyes of her weak and tenacious husband. Who can not do anything right for his wife or daughter. The daughter perceives what the viewer perceives, but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the superficial feeling of the husband who is blank both of the realities of his wife and his daughter. <br /> <br /> To boot, the only powerful scene of this whole movie, when Ellen faces the cruelty of her father, receives the lie at the end. Ellen is just another strong young woman who must be tamed by a weeping father. A very defective movie, so defective as to be called boring and not worth it.
