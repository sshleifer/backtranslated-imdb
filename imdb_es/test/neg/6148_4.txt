My general opinion about this film is that it was a slow, extensive and unstructured walk through some of the truly unfortunate situations in the world with a bit of redemption and an obvious message. The film is mostly made up of rather uninteresting video sequences from the countries it visits with misrepresentations, all at the rhythm of snails and overlaid with depressing music. Certainly, some of the materials and interviews contain some compelling stories, but unlike what the description suggests on the back, it was not so much the story of the victim that was counted as that of the director, Mr. Ripper, and he does not count. Is better. This movie could have included longer and better interviews with the people themselves, allowing them to tell their stories. Instead, Mr. Ripper draws the story with indulgence and turns it into a kind of personal journey, and unfortunately does not end up being one of them. Actually, I never had the feeling of growth while exploring the subject, and he never indicates what attracted him to the subject in the first place. It simply drags us from one place to another, lightly touches the situation and the characters, walks around showing too many images in slow motion without incident of people just walking the streets, and then continues to their next destination. He does it again and again, and again without any real development. I felt that this movie could have been reduced to 45 minutes, but it has lasted about 2 hours terribly slow. We feel morally obligated to worry about the issue, but the self-indulgent, meandering and relentless delivery of your trip by the director makes you numb after a while.
