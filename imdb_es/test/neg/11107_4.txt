First of all let me tell you that this movie is nothing spectacular. The cast is like the saved by the gathering of the bell, the monster is a guy in a bad suit and as always; The army is useless. It would seem that the more training you have and the bigger your weapon is, the more likely it is that you will die if you are in a low budget horror movie. Apparently, people in the movie business have little respect for the seals of the navy, the marines and the ninjas, who have it worse. The plot is thin, a nutcase cryptozoologist by the name of Dr. Pe√±a traps the Chupacabra. Then he smuggled him aboard a cruise ship where two crew members left him alone. You can do your taxes and watch this movie and not miss the rhythm. The most remarkable part that really makes everything worthwhile revolves around the daughter of the captains. Towards the end she goes all martial arts into the monster and kicks him in the butt. Let me clarify this, the monster erases all the unit of marine seals, while they are using ARMOR PIERCING ammunition! OK, it's a movie that can happen, right? But here comes the daughter of the captains who can not be older than 19 years old and kicks the shit out of the chupacabra with frontal and lateral kicks. It was hilarious They must get a medal for coming to that.
