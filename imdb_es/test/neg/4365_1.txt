some would say that this is better mainly because of the performance; but in fact it is much worse for reasons that outweigh the improvement. <br /> <br /> the source from which all problems come; the history. Apart from that one of them fired at close range, with a shotgun, in the chest and surviving for hours without medical attention, there is a bigger problem. Nic, the gangsta with the heart of gold is willing to do anything for the friend he just met that day; and that includes asking for help from an evil spirit. Ce-Ce, who comes out of nowhere with a past in voodoo, is willing to summon Killjoy, as long as Nic can "hook" her. The performance, although improved, is still horrible. These people could not convey the emotion of a paper bag. The script does not help either. Stupid lines, and I can only assume no director's address. this script was read as Shakespeare in high school with a teacher whipping them as they went. <br /> <br /> While this movie (if you can call it that in its 80 minute runtime (fortunately)) is perhaps more fun than the first because of all these things, it is definitely more painful to watch. 1/10.
