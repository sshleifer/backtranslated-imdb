When I voted my "1" for this movie, I noticed that 75 people voted the same out of a total of 146 votes. That means that half of the people who voted for this movie feel that it is really terrible. I saw him recently at a film festival and I was not very impressed by his bad performance. The cinematography can not be seen, the sound is bad, the story is cut and stuck in many other movies and the acting is terrible. This movie is basically a bad scam of three other movies. NO WONDER THAT WAS NEVER LAUNCHED IN THE USA. UU
