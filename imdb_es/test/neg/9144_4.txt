That is the answer. The question is: What is the only reason to see this movie? I loved her in "My name is Julia Ross". That is one of the best noir movies of all time. Noir or whatever it is called, is a very disturbing movie. <br /> <br /> It's also fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time. That would be "The fault of Janet Ames." This has a spooky and promising title. He has a good cast. He has a good director. I expected something dark. Maybe something a little bad taste. Instead, it's a routine and uninspired spy movie. It is almost total boredom. At least it was for me. Mrs. Foch is captivating. And that's it.
