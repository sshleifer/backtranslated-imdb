Sublime love says the title. Another propaganda during the promotions of the film spoke of internal and external beauty. Well, in this case, the beauty, the internal decision or the external one, is in charge of Zeenat Aman, dressed in little clothes (or with little clothes or without clothes), whom director Raj Kapoor called "a volcano of talent" while the movie was made. Of course, one can not accuse him of sarcasm: after all, he was promoting his own movie. <br /> <br /> The paper plot is about a woman with a disfigured face who has a well-proportioned body. a great voice (thanks to Lata Mangeshkar) of whom the hero Shashi Kapoor falls in love. He does not want his face alone his voice. The performance is desperate and even the 4 is due to music with Lata Mangeshkar that gives some good numbers. The rest is of course bunkum. Avoid - save your money. Inner beauty vs outer beauty. !!! You do not have to be an Einstein to find out which one the director was concentrating on
