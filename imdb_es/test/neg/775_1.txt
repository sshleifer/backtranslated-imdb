This is absolutely unquestionable the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so bad that I plan to rent it as soon as I can find it. This movie makes 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' look like an Oscar nominee. Just looking at the actors makes me want to laugh out loud. I can not say enough about this movie. It is horrible that the approach is perfect. <br /> <br /> The plan is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in San Francisco (I think). That's all I can ... I'm laughing too hard. I know it should not be funny, but ..... * LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL * <br /> <br /> MOVE OVER ED WOOD!
