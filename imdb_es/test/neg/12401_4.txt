Of all the films in the history of the movies, I can not imagine someone who feels and says: I want to spend X amounts of dollars (or pounds sterling) to remake that defective classic movie called "Breeders". Many stories have turned into movies about meteors that come to Earth with something sinister on the prowl. Why not invest your money in making a spectacular new 3D version of "It Came from Outer Space"? Why look for a dirty nudist movie that only existed in order to show a set of rubber monsters and some naked monkeys? Was the script of the 1986 version of "Breeders" so inspiring that these producers felt it had to be done again and this time it was done correctly? When you get to that, the only reason why this movie exists is to brag Britcom Cutie Pie Samantha Janus. But if you're going to make a skin movie and exploit Sam Janus in it, you'd better have it more nude than this and strip more often than this if you want to succeed. <br /> <br /> Meteor lands. .. the monster escapes ... the coeds duff their clothes ... the monster eats people ... and another "what if?" Follow the end. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I never thought I would recommend the original "Breeders" about any other movie, but this would be the one that would come second.
