What was the goal here? I started to take a look, but then I realized that I had no objective ... bad acting ... no action and no story ... I ended up listening to it while I was surfing The web reads about the US $ 250 million contract Galaxy dollars for David Beckham football. Do not rent this Do not borrow this DO NOT GO A LOAD DOWN I've seen so many movies that I felt like this was going to be crap from the beginning. <br /> <br /> War movies should be precise and, if possible, have some artistic merit and not really feel like a Christian melodrama ... This movie pales in comparison to anyone I've seen before. I must say that I am really disappointed with this movie ...
