With the large amount of repetitive and derivative situation comedies that stand in the fall, summer, winter and spring alignments, it is good to see a show that is set from the lot in more than one area. <br /> <br /> 'Earl' has an unusual approach. It is not about the "daily reflections of an eccentric family" (zzzz) or the other boring things that are seen everywhere in comedies. The program is about this little white trash thief (Earl) who scrapes a lottery card and gets great scores. Just at that moment, 'Karma' took it off. Over time, he learns that this unusual incident was probably due to all the bad things he has been doing, so he undertakes a mission to correct all the mistakes he made and has all his works on paper. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant premise for a comedy. Fortunately, he landed in the right hands. The execution of the program produces extremely satisfactory results: you get an innovative comedy that is really funny and really moving on many occasions. You can not help but fall in love with Earl's sincerity and firmness, Randy's simple mind, the good heart and the remarks about life, the wild and extravagant personality of Joy and the relaxed and soft attitude of Darnell that really attracts you. very easily. <Br /> <br /> When you combine the program's innovation with its genuine humor, good heart, interesting characters and well written dialogues, you really have a guardian. With programs like this (and the incomparable "The Office"), NBC is obviously something. Did they finally release one or two cubicles to guarantee quality? Hopefully. And let's hope that more quality programs like these occupy the alignments; programs that will make both viewers and NBC executives stop crying during the last days of the golden days of NBC (Frasier, Seinfeld, Friends)
