The Foreigner is a Steven Seagal film directed directly to the video that was originally launched as a theatrical feature film in March 2003, an intention that reversed when the previous Seagal movie (Half Past Dead) sank at the box office. According to some reports, the film had a luxurious budget of $ 20 million, including location shots in Warsaw and Paris, and was completed as part of the studio's obligation for a two-image arrangement that was negotiated after the relative success of Exit Wounds seemed to indicate that Seagal still had many followers. <br /> <br /> Despite the size of your investment, Sony Screen Gems probably made the right move by setting aside this movie. It is almost incomprehensible. What am I saying? It's incomprehensible. I do not think he understood what was happening, except in the broadest terms. <br /> <br /> Seagal is employed by a mysterious type to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious type. Other mysterious boys try to stop him. Other highly mysterious types try to kill the moderately mysterious types who try to stop him. Other really, truly mysterious types do especially mysterious things, all of which, in fact, were too mysterious for me to discover. The recipient's mysterious wife tries to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband. Because he is a self-proclaimed "consummate professional" who was hired to deliver the package only in the hands of the husband, Seagal initially challenges the wife, then becomes involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious types that have no explanation. agendas, as well as her husband. <br /> <br /> Many people have mysterious and cryptic conversations. Many people blow up the other's brain. Some types seem to die more than once, while in other scenes the shootings end without a clear vision of the result, so the audience sees someone die, but is not sure which of the gunmen goes to the hill starter . The allegations change often, adding more mystery. Or should I say confusion? <br /> <br /> I do not know who was on which side, or what someone really wanted, and the resolution was as unsatisfactory as the exposure. At the end of the film, I sat there thinking: "Is that the end? What is ...?" <br /> <br /> I could not even decipher the credits. IMDb says that the Australian actress Kate Fischer (from "Sirens") was in this film, but they will condemn me if I know where. Either they left it on the floor of the cutting room or chose to leave the project. She could have found some more beneficial activities for her career, such as doing unnecessary surgery, tearing out those annoying magazine insertions or taking some community college courses in animal husbandry. <br /> <br /> Seagal used to be a pretty fighter right from hand to hand, but the action scenes did not manage to redeem this movie at all. Seagal is now 50 years old and a very large man, so he is reduced to a minimum level of physical exertion, and even during that period he finds himself in a knee-length coat to hide his budding Brandoesque thickness. You may even run out of breath to remove the wrappers from the chocolate bars, although that is understandable if you calculate how many of those you should eat to maintain your current contour. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal seemed to be making a comeback with Exit Wounds, but if his last movie was dead, it must be pretty close to completing the other half.
