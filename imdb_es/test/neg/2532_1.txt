I just saw Princess Raccoon at the Asian Film Festival in New York. The gentleman who presented the film congratulated the audience for his good taste. "You could be in Herbie: Fully charged," he said with a smirk, "but instead you're here to see the Raccoon Princess of Seijun Suzuki." The audience applauded and applauded. Well, let me tell you that I would rather see Herbie: fully charged twice in a row. Princess Raccoon, a supposedly capricious musical based on Japanese folklore, easily qualifies for one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. It's so unfortunate that his misery really disgusts me from other Seijun Suzuki movies, which is a great feat. <br /> <br /> There is a large spread of things wrong with Princess Raccoon that I almost do not know where to start. Perhaps its most serious faults are both aggressively unintelligible and incredibly monotonous. If the reels were mixed or if half of them were lost in the shipment, the audience would not know the difference. If you do not believe me, I encourage you to steal a trace and have someone run the reels in random order. If you can tell me which one goes on each side, I will give you every penny I have. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film presents a mix of scenes, songs (including an inductive rap number) and images that does not seem to be related in any way. Horribly integrated computer animation is included in the business, adding another brick to the immense wall of incomprehensibility that grows rapidly. I would not be surprised to learn that the writer wrote down any Japanese folklore that occurred to him on a stack of note cards, stacked them, shuffled them, distributed them on a table, and then wrote the script according to his order. <br /> <br /> About thirty-five minutes from the movie, something like a plot comes to the scene. Something about a raccoon princess who changes shape (in human form) and a normal human who falls in love. I expected this to be a portent of the movie that was more than a series of puzzling scenes, but not so much luck. The movie continues in the same absolutely disconcerting way. I wish I had left then, but I was stuck in the middle of a narrow row. In retrospect, it would have been worth the awkward scene. <br /> <br /> I'm exhausted just thinking about the last two reels. I spent every moment waiting and praying for everything to end. Every big movement of the platform, the swell in the music or the scene that seemed remotely seemed to conclude that things renewed my hope that the credits were about to roll. For one agonizing minute, after an agonizing minute he went on and on and on and on and on. Finally, after dozens of false alarms, it was reduced to what I was sure was to be an abstract pattern on which the credits were about to appear. Then, in defiance of all reason, he cut another scene. How could I forget it? The subplot completely unrelated to a ninja that was captured, urinated and boiled in a soup had not yet been wrapped. <br /> <br /> I will never recover those 111 minutes, but you can save. yourself the pain. Unless you want to tarnish your memory or future enjoy great Seijun Suzuki movies as Youth of the Beast and Tokyo Drifter you will not see Princess Raccoon. I would rather have spent my time throwing up.
