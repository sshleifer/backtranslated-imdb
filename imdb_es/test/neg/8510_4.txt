Undoubtedly, Rampling is beautiful, a classic beauty, here is very young. She manages to appear both sophisticated and moving. His two male blades also work well. But seen in 2003, the flic is all <br /> <br /> American who tries to be an artist and not be a Hollywood while filming beautiful photos of the French Riviera-and-three-pretty-young-people-in-his -cute-old-ca r. I enjoyed the view (both actors and nature), but the movie is boring and pretentious to try to be the opposite.
