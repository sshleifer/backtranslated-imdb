Indri, the innocent virginal, is in a house of prostitution run by the ruthless pimp MG. Indri ends up incarcerated in MG's private prison after she refuses to make love to him. Of course, Indri and the world top with Helga join forces and plan to escape. Maman Firmansyah's blast, Piet Burnama's uninspired address and boring script of Talky completely undermine any trashy vitality that this film needs to qualify as a nice piece of bagasy garbage behind behind bars: slow rhythm drags painfully , there is no gratuitous feminine nudity In any case (the girls do not even show the skin during the obligatory scene of the group shower!), the expected torture and degradation are extremely docile and warm, the moderate raw blood does not impress, and even A ridiculous catfight sequence is nothing to get excited about. The pedestrian cinematography of Thomas Susanto, the ridiculously lousy dubbing, the terribly prolonged 102 minute time, the sappy thematic song and the Gatot Sudarto corn ball score add an even more abject insult to an already terrible wound. Just a little decent action from the last reel offers a bit of relief from the otherwise stupidly stupid tedious. A complete error that induces yawning.
