I'm really sad because this is the first bad review I've made for a movie ... NEVER. I could stand watching this movie, and it's the second film of all the movies I've seen, simply. ..to discount. The first is Open Water, which simply DOES NOT have any points. The Next Karate Kid did not mention Daniel (correct me if I'm wrong, please), and that final line was a surprise. It was like, "if you have to fight ... win". then he showed the bird flying and playing the pan flute, and I was like, oh. Well, it will take a while for the next part. AND THEN THE CREDITS HAVE THE SCREEN. <br /> <br /> GEEZ MAN !! Hopefully, I will never have to revise a movie in a bad way, I apologize for those of you who like The Next Karate Kid, I really do ...
