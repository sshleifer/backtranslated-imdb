This movie was so unfocused, rambling and uneven that it was an effort to see everything. (In fact, I thought that some interesting elements of the plot could be developed). This was nothing more than a "coming of age" movie for the thirty-something generation. Total shit and I have no idea what Julianne Moore was doing in this, since that was the only reason I picked it up at the rental store.
