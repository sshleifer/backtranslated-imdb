It's schmaltzy, but then, what else did you expect? The heroine is Cinderella's younger sister with an evil mother, a sister and a brother-in-law; the hero (if you can call him that) is an inefficient putz; and rival love interests are full of melodramatic villains. <br /> <br /> The cast, the stages and the costumes were very attractive, and I thought the actors did an excellent job considering how weak the material was. The film was filmed elegantly and had a soundtrack that was carefully designed so that the viewer could see what emotions should be experienced at all times. Megon McDonough sang sweetly and gave the film some of its best moments. <br /> <br /> If you love Danielle Steel, you will love this movie. If you like archetypal romance, you will love this movie. I did not do it. I could sit through it, but it was close.
