Most critics have written something devastating about Michalkov's film, but he wanted me to see myself. And, unfortunately, they are right. The film had the biggest budget in the history of Russian cinema, two international stars, scenes of colorful masses, apparently shot very close to the Kremlin, but in the end it seems to be a nothing pleasant and sweet. You would not believe that this director has made masterpieces like Urga and Burnt By the Sun. The characters in the story are not convincing, neither Jane nor McCracken nor Andrej. Only General Radlov deserves to be mentioned. It remains on the surface all the time. Politically it is for me a glorification of the army, and especially of the Russian with values ​​such as honor and duty. And, after having lived at least half a year in Siberia: My Russia is much more than the one shown in Michalkov's film. With respect to "Burnt By The Sun" by the same director as a 10-point film with no questions, one of the best I've seen in my entire life, I was totally disappointed. Sorry. However, Michalkov's unique talent in delivering incredibly beautiful images is still there.
