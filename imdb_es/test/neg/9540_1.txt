Move over hands Boogens backs up. You do not need a Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV for the rest of this volume) is now and always will be (unless someone makes a sequel to Zarkorr The Invader) the worst movie of all. The only horror in this is to look at it. I wonder if this was an attempt for someone to know the babies by releasing a movie. If this were the case, the girls are not girls like this is not a movie. It's dreck No, wait. I dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck. Ulli Lommel (of the fame of Boogey Man) would call it "uber dreck" or Schei√üe. It should be used to torture prisoners. If you find it on a shelf in a video store, step away from it in silence and notify the authorities.
