A new fighting show paves the way for the most feared fighter ever imagined, the giant Zeus. The president of the Network, Brell, does everything possible to attract the WWF champion Rip to the square circle to face Zeus for the championship of the "Battle of the tough guys". But Zeus is different from any competitor that Rip has faced. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would give Hogan some room to maneuver as a fighter by moving to a movie role, however, this movie did not ask the Hulkster to give it much importance. a stretch, he simply asked Hogan to play himself, and he failed in miserable 'Tiny' Lister made a good effort like the mighty Zeus, but even his work left the film without something, that is, acting! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, if you wish, with a grain of salt and a sense of humor, otherwise, you probably have to turn it off a little more than ten minutes.
