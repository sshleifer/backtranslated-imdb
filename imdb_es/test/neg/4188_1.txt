My spoiler is in my pants because thinking about this movie angered me so much that I screwed up. <br /> <br /> Once you finish watching it, you watch the television with confusion and horror. Then, there is a gentle touch on his shoulder and a voice hisses: "You will die in seven days". You turn around and one of your best friends is standing there with a look of absolute hatred for the one who suggested this movie when you were in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I will not lie: this is the worst. Film on the face of the earth. I saw him with 5 of my friends, all 18-year-old boys, and these were our reactions: -One person started crying and hitting himself -One person screamed and fainted -One person got up and staggered out the door Main Reappears more than an hour later. A person just fainted (this was me). One person started to babble incoherently, as if he had cerebral palsy and Touretts syndrome. A person entered into a kind of catatonic trance and did not respond. to our voices for more than twenty minutes <br /> <br /> The movie really is so bad. There is a part in which the delayed cameraman actually shoots (while holding the camera), but the producers decided to leave it. Seriously, you can hear him growl and swear when he touches the ground. There is only one special effect, and it is special in the same way that a retarded child trying to solve a Rubix Cube is special: the camera rotates so that the action on the screen (action, n.) Some idiots lost in a corn field during 80 Freaking minutes) makes a barrel roll. <br /> <br /> Under NO circumstances should it be seen, and the film itself even warns you of this. Do you know what the motto is on the back? "Some warnings should not be ignored." Honestly, I think that the release of this film to the public is a sick joke on the part of the producers. However, that does not mean that you should overlook it if you see it in the movie store; then it will be placed on the shelf for other poor people to see. Rather, buy every copy you can get and mail them to the people you hate.
