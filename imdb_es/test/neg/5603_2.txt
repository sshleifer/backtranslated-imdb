Pretty. <br /> <br /> Handsome actresses and actors. Pretty bad script. Quite frequent "let's undress our intimate garments" scenes. Fairly fair F / X. Pretty disturbing location decisions (the college dorm looks like a high-end hotel room, probably because it was filmed in a hotel). Pretty smooth story. A very horrible dialogue. Beautiful places. Pretty annoying editing, unless you like the flash cut style of the music video. <br /> <br /> This is not a guilty pleasure, it's more shameful. If you must see this, choose a good dance / techno album and deactivate the sound of the movie: you'll see beautiful people in their beautiful black clothes, and probably follow the story well. > The cast may be able to act: I doubt that anyone can look skillful given the lines / plot with which he had to deal.
