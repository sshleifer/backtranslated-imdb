So I turned on HBO, which made me think I would have some quality movies and I saw it. Carrot Top is so funny that it's nauseating to see him. I've seen extravagant movies before, but I think this is so impossible to see because Carrot Top seems to think it's hilarious. Watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for 5-year-olds with exaggerated reactions at the top full of ultra-stupid jokes that only a 4-year-old would appreciate. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is how other talented actors joined this project, such as Larry Miller and M Emmet Walsh. If you've ever seen the absolutely horrible commercials of Carrot Top in MCI (or whatever they were), then this is more of the same, but worse. It's a slapstick festival that's a waste of a high budget that could have done something, saved homeless people ... anything but this. I'm not sure I'm in the last place of all time, but for the $ 10 million spent it's a disgrace.
