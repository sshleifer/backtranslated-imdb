Cool. Another foreign film that thinks it's Fellini. Besides that, we have to have more propaganda about the murder of people with disabilities. <br /> <br /> I do not see any reason why we have to flood ourselves with these euthanasia ads with little disguise. Nothing redeeming was found about this movie. What can be redeemed about a man without the courage to continue, despite some adversity. It does not take courage to commit suicide. That is the action of a coward. Sharing this "desire" with his wife simply inflicts the same illness that he has. If this had been a film about the courage of a man to continue, despite his problems, similar to the story of Jill Kinmont, that would have made it into a great movie. <br /> <br /> If you're interested In seeing the true courage, watch the movies about Jill Kinmont, the former skier who became disabled after a skiing accident.
