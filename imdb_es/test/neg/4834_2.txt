It happened that I caught this on television and wanted to see it because I remembered the Spin magazine article on which the film is based. I was very disappointed. First, if James Belushi is the main actor in a movie, it should be a sign that it is not exactly a first-rate production. Gregory Hines was a world-class dancer, but unfortunately he is not a great actor. <br /> <br /> In fact, the entire performance in this film is flat or hammy, which can only be attributed to the director, which is the weakest link in this movie. Charles Carner seemed to be trying to imitate Oliver Stone's "JFK" by portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the "real" child killer (s), but without the benefit of a good script, a cast of the A list or , it must be said, the talent. It just does not work <br /> <br /> It's a pity that such a valuable topic for a movie has not received a better treatment.
