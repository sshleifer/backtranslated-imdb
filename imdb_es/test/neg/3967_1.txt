How many 1984 versions of 101 English students must America endure? "My God, this is a great book, but a little depressing, I know, I'll write an equal one, where everything will be fine, I'll also replace the old and used political knowledge of the 1930s with mine." Insightful and informed views of the decade 1970. Think, think, political vision ... Evil politicians, I'm a genius! And there will be clones that do themselves for some diabolical reason ... I'll take care of that. No, it will not, Bob Sullivan, writer of this story. This really is all that you are guilty of. You could have stopped them early and said: "Guys, with our budget and acting skills, I was thinking more about a romantic comedy, or we could stop taking ourselves seriously and make a silly parody of this tired and familiar movie genre." Did you do that even though bob? No, you did not, and you've had 28 years to think about it. <br /> <br /> I do not want to be so spiteful. I'm sorry I yelled at you, Bob. Obviously, you had to live with this error much longer than me. Some culprits should really go to Ron Smith, who helped you adapt the script. He could have stopped you at any time. You were young and naive, and he took advantage of you. Now he is plotting the frames for video games and you, Bob, who knows what you're doing. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, Bob, but that's the way it is. You were sold up the river by Hollywood hotshots. As if Ron was not enough, Michael Bay also saw your movie, and without even asking for rights or anything, he added some explosions to your concept and turned it into "The Island". I think it's the most unpleasant part of all, that with a bit of candy, your script could have been good enough for a big Hollywood production, that I would have hated as much as this movie and not feel sorry for you. absolutely. <br /> <br /> Sorry, things worked out this way for you, Bob. Ron and Michael walked on you, leaving you the dry shell of a man, whose height in movie writing will be a joke about Mystery Science Theater 3000. Do not focus on that, Bob, because karma works in mysterious ways, and One day , they'll pay for what they did to poor little Bob Sullivan.
