The hairy, friendly but frustrating movie has the same message: if you want to succeed in this world, being imaginative is not enough, you have to be up to your place in society and that means living according to the (heterosexual) rules that govern us The dramatic comedy Drag Queen of Australia is a mostly optimistic journey of three male friends who travel through the Outback on their pink bus, baptized as Priscilla. Although it is not a formula film in itself, there are the obligatory "road movie" sequences (linking by the bonfire, face down from the hops, etc.). Writer and director Stephan Elliott follows every potentially petty moment with a little humor and sympathy, but there are puzzling gaps in his narrative, a secondary argument about a gay man's relationship with his ex-wife and his strange pre-teen son who they feel comfortable, and the child wise, with their lifestyle, and a third act without any energy. It has a bit of wicked transvestite humor and a pretty cast of the game, but a script that seems to have been diluted along the way. ** since ***
