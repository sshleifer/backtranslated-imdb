I suppose it should be fair and point out that I do not believe in ghosts. Having said that, I am very interested in the subject and I enjoy a terrifying story as much as the next guy. I'm a fan of ghost hunters because at least they try to give their research a scientific angle. Even the first episodes of Most Haunted had an entertainment factor in the camp. The paranormal state does not have any of these qualities. The cases themselves have the potential to be interesting, but as with so much "reality television" these days, he suffers from overproduction, poor acting and silly scripts. The creators of the show freely admit that the writers "guide" the stories. I have heard that they will even put on a secondary plot of romance to attract the young demographic woman. The show has many other flaws as well. As others have said, the narrative quickly turns into nails on a blackboard. At the top, visual and audio effects quickly become just as irritating. I'm willing to suspend a little disbelief for entertainment, but all this arc of the story of the "demon with a vendetta" is simply ridiculous. Since the producers of this program are also responsible for brain-dead forages like Laguna Beach and MTV's Newport Harbor, I guess this is no surprise. If you are a fan of Ed & Lorraine Warren or a great addicted to "reality", I think you will find much that you like in Paranormal State. For the rest of us .... I recommend you avoid.
