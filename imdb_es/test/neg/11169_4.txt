These days, Asian horror films are among the best in the world, highlighted by their environment and reflection of contemporary society. This is not one of those movies! In contrast, "The Record" is a mediocre Slasher movie highly derived from American films like "I know what you did last summer" and "Scream". The plot is familiar: 5 teenagers accidentally commit a terrible crime, but they hide themselves swearing to keep the secret. A year later, they are being harassed by a maniac with a knife (with the decidedly flawless disguise of a sterile hospital mask and an orange suit). It does not help that teens are a generally unpleasant group (this is one of those movies in which the motives of the killer seem quite reasonable) and there are numerous configurations of stupid plots to keep the story going. The direction of the film is not very subtle, more influenced by MTV than by current Asian horror films (like "The Ring"). The last third of the film is not so bad, however, it offers some decent suspense scenes, although there is probably a "twist" too much in the end. 4/10
