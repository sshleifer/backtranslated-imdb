This was done in that beloved age known as the 80s and filmed in my hometown of New York City. Actually, this has become one of my favorite science fiction movies. Oh, sure, it really stinks of hell, but there is so much that can be mocked, laughed and enjoyed that it becomes more tolerable after every visualization. <br /> <br /> Like: <br /> <br /> Try to find the similarities between this and ... well, it's okay, there's nothing quite as bad about this. Well, except in the FuManchu Castle. <br /> <br /> Sock puppets can be dangerous to your health <br /> <br /> Create a superase by describing it with a voice instead of showing any image <br /> <br /> Make the Villana leader "Valeria" (beautifully performed by Angelika Jager) delivers some of the most fascinating lines of all time! <br /> <br /> Many post-apocalyptic men and women (also known as leather bikinis, loin cloths and dead animal skins) <br /> <br /> Be horrified by the end! <br /> <br /> I'm going to eat a salad. Toodles!
