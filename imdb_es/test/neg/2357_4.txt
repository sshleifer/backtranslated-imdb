Human trafficking is purely a 'state there, made' experience 'only that this time it is quite lax. <br /> <br /> The main topics explored are paranoia, male impotence and jealousy? but only lightly and poorly. <br /> <br /> Much of the film seems to want to imitate Trainspotting (drug culture / 'clubbing')? but it does not include the low / low times with which Trotspotting deals (for example: problems of death / dependence, etc.). Do you even try to come up with a monologue similar to Ewan McGreggor's classic 'Choose Life'? But `The Milky Bars are on me! Yes!' ?? What is this all about ?! <br /> <br /> Do the characters try to analyze their lifestyle but when their lifestyle is so superficial? his analysis becomes boring and repetitive. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (for a movie that tries to be great) is pathetic. Does it include the likes of Fat Boy Slim and CJ Bolland? Come on people ?? Good dance music IS better than this! <br /> <br /> The characters become irritating and annoying (especially in the middle of the movie) and the lack of care of the characters will soon become apparent. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of funny scenes ?? But they are few and far between. The mother who caught the son in the bedroom was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> But PLEASE? I'm sick of the death of the Star Wars analogy scenes. I thought it was much sharper in a couple of Kevin Smith movies (for example: Clerks and Chasing Amy). According to the characters ?? Yoda is a demon of drugs, is that why he is short and bald? eh ?! <br /> <br /> My score? 4 out of 10 ?? Do yourself a favor and go to Trainspotting or Go instead!
