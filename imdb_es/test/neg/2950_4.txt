1st seen on 02/18/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Leon Leonard): adventure film based on a novel by the author of Moby Dick's fame, Herman Melville. This film is about the captain of a ship that had stolen the eyes (which were extremely rare black pearls) of a sculpture of God from a native tribe and had hidden them in a place that only he knew before leaving the island of Tivi. He got very sick and was on a secret trip to return to the island and retrieve the pearls for himself, while others (like his daughter) thought he would be treated by the local doctor. Others did not know the reason for the trip. A stowaway actually knew the real reason for the trip: to return his eyes to his God. The silly part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue and during all this time the natives ran their tribe without God having eyes (causing all kinds of problems). On the way, we are treated (for some reason) to an underwater nature show with an electric eel that fights against a local octopus (I guess only Herman Melville knows what this is all about). Once they arrive on the island, the Captain dies, but passes the whereabouts of the pearls to his daughter, but she also receives the curse of the disease. One of the bad guys discovers where the God is and convinces the daughter to go there and steal the pearls, but at this point the good guys find out what is happening and a fight takes place. I will not tell you the results of the fight or the end, I'll leave it for you to find out if you want. As I said before, the movie was fine, but some very silly things that I already mentioned diminished its impact. I wonder if those new "Pirates of the Caribbean" got something from their argument from this --- hmm Black pearls, a curse (I wonder ??) Well, it does not matter, those elements did not make a very good movie in this case or in the other. It seems that they would learn that they are a lesson, but with the money accumulated in that new movie, I am sure they will not. Oh good.
