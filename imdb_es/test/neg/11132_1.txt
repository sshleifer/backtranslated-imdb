Great concept, characterizations and perfect voices, but a complete waste of time. A real shame, because if I had aimed higher, it probably would not have been the bomb that was (is); Too dependent on eschatological humor to begin with. I am surprised by the comments of "educated" reviewers who refer to the "good science" behind this piece of childish garbage. Unlike "Finding Nemo," where (with a little suspension of disbelief) the attention to detail was astounding and the science was as good as the context allowed, "Osmosis Jones" was complete nonsense; Do not kid yourself about science. The humor was aimed at eight year olds, but the theme was more suitable for some unsophisticated teenagers.
