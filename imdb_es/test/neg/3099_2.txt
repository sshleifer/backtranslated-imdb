What is the story that is on the screen? At first I have to say do not play this movie, it's for your best moment (stinks). And really, what is the story? At first it seems to be fine, but after ten minutes, everything gets worse. And that's not all, you can barely see what's on the screen because it's too dark all the time. <br /> <br /> Do not touch it.
