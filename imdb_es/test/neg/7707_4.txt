A university professor is working on the creation of zombies and, if you knew it, things go terribly wrong. The next thing you know, the whole campus is invaded. Thank God, there are a couple of super commandos trained for such a situation. Too bad they must be accompanied by a group of imbeciles, led by a rapper (not even bother to try to play a military guy, only responds to his superiors as if rappin 'wit' da homies in da hood). The highlight of this part of the movie is the wardrobe scene. The commands of male and female imbeciles share the same wardrobe, and military regulations apparently require that all females wear black bras and panties. Hey, if you can not make a good movie, at least you can have women in underwear. I take my hat off to the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Then, after much discussion about how well prepared these imbecile commandos are for work (Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq), they are all killed in a fairly short time. Its biggest drawback seems to be that it never occurs to them to turn on the lights. A typical encounter makes them enter a room and see someone at the other end. Human or zombie? I can not say Turn on the lights? No, the imbecile-command protocol requires that you approach the person, making sure to hold your weapon in such a way that it can be easily removed from your hand, and well, you know the exercise. The disappearance of Sergeant Major Sticky Fingaz is especially fun, my favorite scene with a rapper in any movie I've seen. Fortunately (and, again, congratulations to the filmmakers), the hottest baby among imbecile commands manages to survive. Both she and the super-commando women end up in tight-fitting shirts for the rest of the movie. This is how a military operation should be carried out! There's a lot of running around, punctuated by my humorous things like super commando that can not go through a simple ventilation grid (obviously it's a thin piece of aluminum that you can easily put your fist on). This requires a plan to rub the guts of the zombies on themselves, and although we have not seen anything in the movie that indicates that the zombies locate their prey by smell, they are good enough to start sniffing the guts of the zombies. zombies and let our heroes go. . <br /> <br /> Some other funny fragments: Paris Hilton's gag, the "Can you hear me now?" gag, and the fact that, although the zombies immediately bite the secondary characters, the main characters can fight through dozens of them without being bitten. Mr. Fingaz provides another laugh, which seems he can not pronounce the word "turnstile" (toe-no-kit?). <br /> <br /> In general, it's something fun. I could have used some more interesting characters, but for an original Sci-Fi Channel, I was slightly impressed.
