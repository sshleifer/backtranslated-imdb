Extremely formulated with logical holes of cosmic size and a pretense of comedy. Oh, poor lawyer from New York! It's just happening, and when he gets a reduction in payment, he does not go out to look for another job, even though he's one of the most respected lawyers in the area. We see him arguing in court for others to come and congratulate him on his ardent and successful delivery, but he can not face anyone in his signature. At home, problems are ignored until people leave the house. <br /> <br /> The only character you want to encourage is the final maid, who seems to be a real human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world. How laughable that the maid brings the lawyer and his wife a chicken and a wine on New Year's Eve because she feels sorry for them! (The bit is not played for laughs). <br /> <br /> Sorry, it's too amazing and with a ** SPOILER ** pat, everyone turns 180 degrees. How did you get first class stars for this? If I had been in the studio, I would have returned this for a complete rewrite.
