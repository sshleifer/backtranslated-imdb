In the dark days of 1990, it was mistakenly believed that the would-be heir to the Spielberg Throne (after the failure of the supposed child prodigy Phil Joanou) was David Mickey Evans' pretentious spy candidate. Evans managed to strip the studios of more than a million dollars, making baby boomers believe in his script, a combination of nostalgia, references from the 1960s and a disturbing drama about child abuse. <br /> <br /> As Rod Stewart once sang, "look how wrong you can be". <br /> <br /> But the script inspired by the letters "ET" of the rookie convinced enough people that he was the next Chosen, the New Spielberg, so they reached an agreement not only to buy the script for more money than 99 percent of the world's population will ever see in their lives, but also for Evans to direct the film - even though he had never directed anything in his life. <br /> <br /> After all, how hard can it be to be another film genius? <br /> <br /> Two weeks after filming, Columbia discovered it. Their studies were qualified as "totally unusable" by the study, or at least those sensible enough to not have fallen under the E.N.C. (Emperor's new clothes) spell. All his images were discarded and recycled in guitar photos. <br /> <br /> So, what should a study do after sinking 10 or 20 million dollars into something they still believed represented the resurrection of Steven Spielberg? Hire Spielberg himself to save the day? Columbia probably tried. <br /> <br /> Enter the old professional Richard Donner. Hey, I may not be a cinematographic genius, but it does the job. "Superman" was not that bad, after all, and the first "Lethal Weapon" was pretty good. <br /> <br /> So Donner intervenes and takes the reins of the address. Fortunately, he manages to convince Columbia that the worst of the film's insipid fantasy sequences, which would develop as an acid journey from a ten-year-old child, has to disappear. Unfortunately, he retires in Crying Buffalo (ooh, how poetic) and in the pseudo-Spielberg fantasy final ridicule, complete with Clueless Mom, who was content with the rest of his life to get postcards of his missing son while circling the globe in Your red car. Good. <br /> <br /> But Donner managed to get a decent performance from Elijah Wood. And Lorraine Bracco as the idiot mom was not bad either. Maybe Donner should be reevaluated. Maybe it's not a Hollywood hack as fake as everyone has always believed. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this baked bug a rating of 2 is that someone was smart enough to throw the great John Heard (but in the wrong part, of course). Children do it well ... although Tom Hanks' horrifying and overly explanatory narrative almost destroys all the scenes he intrudes on. <br /> <br /> One might think that after David Mickey Evanses and Phil Joanous and Troy Duffys of the World, the studios could finally catch up. One would hope that these weaknesses of making films driven by exaggerations could prevent the Emperor's New Clothes syndrome from raising its ugly head again. <br /> <br /> Doubtful!
