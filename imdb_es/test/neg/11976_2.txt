Completely ignoring all the film adaptation of a video game, this is another terrible movie by Mr. Boll. The fact that I continue to be hired to make films is a constant surprise for me and, obviously, most of the community goes to the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, I will say that this attempt was much better than many of its previous ones. attempts Part of the dialogue was even half decent in Far Cry, although he still misuses some sentences and in some cases does not even use them correctly. <br /> <br /> Now, in addition to the fact that Jack Carver was supposed to be American and not German, Til was still entertained in this role. An exception are the ridiculously lame lines he uses to sleep with the girl. And are we supposed to believe that she is ready to have sex with him so carelessly after so little dialogue? Emile? I'm just there for comic relief, I'm sure and I'm still lame. Jack's character seems old and tired, but he's still capable of the extreme stunts needed to avoid one of the altered super soldiers in the lab. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this for the Far Cry adaptation. But you could lose an hour and a half looking at it if you have nothing better to do.
