What most offends me about the critics who follow this film is the mention of "originality". This film does not contain AN innovative element. Yes, by "originality", you mean pathetic action scenes, overacting, gluttony in violence, direct humor and a script beyond intellectual belief. Then, "originality" is something that the Swedish film can do without. <br /> <br /> How Röse and Karlsson can accept "acting" on this poor excuse for a movie is a mystery to me. And how Eva Röse after the making of this film can be seen at breakfast, the television that promotes it simply disappoints me. <br /> <br /> This movie does not contain a story, the script is illogical, rigid and last but not least, just bad. These two young directors have created a rather unpleasant children's fantasy that contains violence, comic strips and trivialized psychological portraits. I would not be surprised if the scene of DD masturbating in the kitchen during a dinner in micro waves is described to describe the daily life of these two cinematographic nerds posing as directors. <br /> <br /> I would not show this movie to my worst enemy.
