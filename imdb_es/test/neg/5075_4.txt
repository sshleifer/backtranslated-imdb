The bank robbery / the police thriller sounds good, right? <br /> <br /> The chaos looks good: well framed, good production values, high concept action theft ... <br /> <br /> But ... <br /> <br / > The plot has the unique achievement of being intelligent and incredulous, blatantly unlikely in the "how we get money" mode and complicated in the "who did it and why" section at the same time ... <br /> <br / > In addition, Ryan Philippe screams NO, seriously it is neither strong nor frightening ... and especially it is not strong or frightening when it launches a tizzy. Honestly, his big outburst is the only really funny scene in the whole movie. You must make him excited by rejecting the role of Anakin Skywalker and now he is doing this ... <br /> <br /> Normally, Stratham is good as the hard but silent nut with the self-critical humor, but here, the Additional relationship lines are so ridiculously bad that even he feels uncomfortable saying something about the required clich√©. More silent seems better? <br /> <br /> Actually, Snipes is fine in a boxed way, but another nail in the coffin of a talented actor: he needs the role of an actor, not a rehash of an action hero. Maybe the business with your taxes will allow you to break that mold and the public and the critics will leave it in the vote of sympathy. It would be nice if I was not so typecast all the time. <br /> <br /> The lines these guys talk about when they are not doing plot development and detective work can be summed up in one word .... pheeeuuuh <br /> <br /> The film feels out of control and never gels: I found it irritating for the first 45 minutes, and the last part tighter was passable. It should / could have been good, but you just can not trade the horrible lines, the overwhelming score and the general level of irritation with plausibility levels. <br /> <br /> In general I almost did not succeed: incredibly irritating, and Ryan ... please, please, get rid of the Goldilocks ...
