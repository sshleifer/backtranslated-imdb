I must say that I was disappointed in this movie. Although it is well acted and directed, the underlying story simply moves too slowly. <br /> <br /> Of course, in another mood I would have liked it more. I laughed a lot, but I rarely laughed; and in reality there was a sense of suspense to discover who won. But unlike another movie that my wife picked up the same day (one that neither of us had heard before), it went pale in comparison. <br /> <br /> If you watch many movies, then, of course, see this is clearly better than your average rate. But if you (like me) have a limited time and want to see only the best and the most entertaining, save it for later. <br /> <br /> [Rate: 7/10]
