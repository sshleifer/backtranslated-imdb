Thank God I have a fast forward. I think this is a movie about a guy that goes up and down. Whatever: it's a stupid cliché. It does not make any difference. There's a guy, Javier Bardem, who builds buildings or something. No matter. He is handsome, this Javier Bardem. Who cares? I think there's a car accident but I saw it in fast forward, so ... who cares? The car accidents and the beautiful heroes who struggle to get away from them smell like melodrama. Javier likes someone, but instead marries María de Madeiros. It is beautifully, poetically beautiful, with a heart-shaped face. Then Javier has an oral interface with Maribel Verdu, who washes her vulva beforehand for some reason. One would think that Maribel Verdu, with her hand-washed vulva would be sexy. No, she's not. This is a tedious story about a group of people that do not interest me. Javier, Maribel and María have a trio: how boring. This movie is annoying. I think this could be a minor THEME of (some) movies in Spanish: the rise and foreseeable fall of a small man who is successful against the odds. Let me clarify this: this is a first class melodrama or maybe a soap opera. It's not worth your time, except for a laugh.
