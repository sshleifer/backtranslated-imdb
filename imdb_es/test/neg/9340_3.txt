I thought the movie was a bit predictable and boring, but I'm 14 years old. <br /> <br /> I was really upset with my little cousin because she was very hyperactive that day, so I watched a movie on the Disney channel and put it on. and told him to see it. <br /> <br /> She is 6 years old and she loved the movie, some parts did not like the ending, but I also did not understand that Eddie was the star of the video. shoot I thought it was Jordan's video ?! but she enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I noticed the mistakes, like when in the end Jordan was not playing the guitar, but she never was. <br /> <br /> It is definitely a movie if you are very bored or you are 10 years old or less. <br /> <br /> it calmed my cousin well. <br /> <br /> although all of it Then it was sung the rest of the day.
