Sigh. I'm baffled when I see a short film like this get attention and assignments and all that. I saw this movie at a festival before the filmmaker got attention and I forgot about it immediately afterwards. It was a little annoying to see him whip the heart of Grinch Who Stole Christmas along with the narration, the stage design seen many times before, all the weak Tim Burton-ish style and the story that does not lead anywhere. And we got the "joke" about shooting the crows at 45 the first time, okay? <br /> <br /> But I guess what is really unacceptable is that it even passes its basic concept of a 1999 comic book called LENORE, THE DEAD CUTE LITTLE GIRL by Roman Dirge! As any quick internet search will reveal. I mean, what is this? Is this what you base a Hollywood contract on and open doors in Canada for a filmmaker? "Move your head," as Don Cherry would say.
