It's okay, it's visible if you're sick in bed or you have nothing else to do. However, the suspension of disbelief required to overcome this film is significant. First, in today's modern society, do you think that college students are committed to someone in that time period, even if you are a "virtuous" volunteer from Habitat who likes autistic children? And the 2-week romance transforms into a card exchange that leads to John's "conflict" of whether to re-enlist right after 9/11/01 ... REALLY? He asks what to do? All the men we know are NOT going to be seated on the sidelines after those Torres descend (my husband was one of them and I love him and I'm proud of him for his behavior) John's character is very flat. The whole movie is almost expressionless. It looks good, but not in Spec Ops ... it seems insecure, not confident, quiet instead of a hell, no tattoos, gets into a "fight" with the boys in very good taste, that's just a party really push ... walks around without a cap on the head, almost the entire film ... and there are military technical flaws everywhere (coves upside down?). The scenes of war are silly ... John and another boy go on their own ... eh?, Then another man is shot and John drags him 10 feet and begins to help his friends before securing the area or the arrival of a backup or even having your back against the deck ... it's a gunfight for the love of God, do not stop fighting until it ends ... hell, I wanted to shoot John in the back. At home, when the truth is revealed and she spills the wine ... we hate her for taking her shirt off in her presence ... WHAT? Breaking his heart and THEN causing him to commit adultery? She is a trollop head case. The best part of the movie is when he gets away from her ... at least he had some self-esteem and honor there. In general, an incredible story and in general we did not care about these characters or their love. Sad!
