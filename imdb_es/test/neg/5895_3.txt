Am I the only one who thought that the point of this film was graphic violence? I did not know anything about Leigh Scott when I rented it, and I would not have done it if I had known that most of his previous films were horror movies. I'm not interested in that, I was just waiting for an informative docudrama of the September 11 report. <br /> <br /> Instead, I got a violent movie almost incomprehensible. The only good thing about all this for me was that it made me want to read the report, to find out what the hell this movie was about. <br /> <br /> I wrote this because it surprises me that we have become. So immune to violence in movies and on television, it was not even worth commenting on by the bloggers whose reviews I read.
