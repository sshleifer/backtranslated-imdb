I know that my summary sounds very hard, but this movie has very limited appeal. The average Joe would have a hard time keeping up with this movie. The entire film consists of animated loggers who do their work and dance on floating logs. All this is done with very striking and artistic colors, and the film could be great to show clients in an art museum. However, unless you really love this kind of art or are a Canadian who loves movies about your homeland, then this is probably almost impossible to finish. I have a pretty high tolerance for this kind of thing and I even had to force myself to look after a couple of minutes. I can respect the work that was done, but it is not convincing.
