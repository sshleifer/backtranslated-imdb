"Hardbodies 2" is harmless, without course and plot less. I would add "without a brain" to that list, but the trick of the movie inside a movie, although it is not done very well, helps it narrowly escape that label. The stage has changed from the beaches of California to the Greek islands, and the only cast members returning from the first film are Sorrells Pickard (the bearded man) and Roberta Collins (who at one point falls into a mud pit, bringing memories of her). classic cat fight with Pam Grier in "The Big Doll House"). All the other actors are new, but Brad Zutaut is apparently supposed to play the same character (Scotty) as Grant Cramer in "Hardbodies." This sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first movie, and does not come close to equaling it in the "heat" department. Of course, Brenda Bakke and Fabiana Udenio are very nice, but the Teal Roberts team - Cindy Silver - Kristi Somers is unbeatable. "Hardbodies 2" is by no means the worst of its kind, but if you just want to watch one of these movies, the original is the one you should get. (* 1/2)
