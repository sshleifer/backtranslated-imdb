This movie is so bad that there are no words to describe it. If I had a video camera of a monkey dancing for an hour and a half, it would be much more entertaining than this. The plot is so boring and unimaginative that it's not even worth mentioning. The best part of the movie was when the credits came up and I laughed to know that the name of the main actors was James Bond III. Just trust me and stay away from this pile of garbage!
