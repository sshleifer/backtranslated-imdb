I got tired in several attempts to sit down and watch this show "Gilmore Girls". It baffled me because I simply could not know what it was. Was it a young woman who has a young baby in life and never grows up? Was it that the daughter was more responsible than the mother? Was it a rich and rebellious girl and her daughter not rebellious? What the hell is this show? Finally, I just did not care. The cast makes me want to scream. Writing is not "intelligent" or "intelligent", it is honeyed and tedious. <br /> <br /> Then, why did I look? Because I heard SO many good things about this and I'm not someone to express an opinion until I've seen it. The reactions of Knee-Jerk are usually incorrect, so I observed a couple of times. The first time I saw this, I saw the mother running as if she were 12 years old and the daughter acting like she was 40. Maybe that's what did not appeal to me. I never liked any of the "weird Friday" movies, not to say that this is true, but there are some similarities. <br /> <br /> I also have a friend who watches this show every week. So I asked him: "What is this show about?" A very bright young woman, usually articulate, could never give me a direct answer. So I asked other people who commented: they really do not know either. <br /> <br /> Gilmore Girls is becoming a television show that is like an "art house movie". Many of us do not understand it, but those who try desperately to find meaning where there really is not, simply be "modern." Yes, I find Lorelai by Lauren Graham annoying: moan, nasal moan, WHINE. A whole hour of that. Wow. And the rest of the cast is as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. The city is boring, men are weak, grandparents are bored and, unfortunately, I find nothing that redeems any of these characters or cares about anything they do. It's like watching the paint dry on the wall.
