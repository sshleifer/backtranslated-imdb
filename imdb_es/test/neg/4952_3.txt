I do not understand why you would give this movie nothing more than 4 ... Just what brings me to the 80s and the 'good old days of horror comedy', but that genre has not improved since then, it's still like that ' LAME Low budget - low technology - bad performance - bad story - nothing frightening and not funny enough ... in fact, there's nothing good I can say about it. The so-called monsters are horribly bad! I mean, we've stepped back in time when they used to make monsters' play dough and shoot scenes by frame ... I do not really understand why someone invested money to make this script for a movie. but I think it could have been almost good if it had been a bigger budget movie. <br /> <br /> The recommendation would be - please, do not make the mistake of wasting your time on this unless you want to get advice for a bad halloween makeup! Personally I enjoy independent films and anything out of the box, but this did not do it for me in the least.
