It seems incredible to me that so many people (probably Poles) have voted for this film, giving them those qualifications (mostly dozens). Okay, the movie was fine, it was funny, but on the other hand it was nothing special. The only good thing about Kiler are the dialogues, rather they are not exhaustive for non-Poles. The script is primitive, the acting (except for Jerzy Stuhr as Ryba) - horrible. It is too noisy about anything, fortunately it is not included among the 250 best. . The sequel "Kilerow 2-och" ("2 Kilers") is on the way and is the same story.
