I saw this in the independent cinema of my city, it is not surprising, since no conventional theater would want their fingerprints in this train crash. <br /> <br /> The camera work is very distracted. Constant change, refocusing and zooming may induce a sensitive person to have motion sickness. It is more like the project of a film student than a serious film. <br /> <br /> Although they are good, the characters are unpleasant. Josh is cunning, always trying to manipulate situations and people in his favor. Without any context for the relationship between Emily and Josh, she introduces herself as an insipid and whiny child who is desperate to get married. Rhett is an emotional child, unable to understand the complexities of human interaction. Without any redeeming qualities, I did not care what happened to any of them. <br /> <br /> Obviously, some people liked this movie, since the couple sitting behind me laughed hysterically. Of course, they could have made fun of it. I could hardly blame them for that.
