I am angry and horrified by the positive reviews that this film receives. Not only is it silly, manipulative and melodramatic. It is also blatantly offensive. The character of Radio `Gooding Jr. 'is displayed as a cute little animal, like a puppy so cute you just want to take it home.' This mentality is shameless; The radio is never treated as a human being, but as a manipulative device to attract sympathy from its audience. Even more atrocious are the numerous moments of the film, in which Radio receives a blow to the head / stumbles / falls on / etc. These slapstick comedy moments made the audience howl with laughter simply because "it's funny because the radio is delayed" This is brazen, now I do not feel that the word "retarded" is a suitable word to describe the mentally disabled, but it seems Be the posture that the film takes: "The radio is delayed, but it's fine, because it's cute and we like it". Gooding's portrait seems more appropriate for a John Water film than an inspiring family drama. To add insults to injuries, the film is incompetent at all levels, Debra Winger is not inspired by the role of "stereotyped housewives" that the reminder of his atrocious monologues insists on the laughter of those who watch the film. The John Horner Score is pure sap, always superimposed on its rip, something about the tired cinematography. Ed Harris is decent in a role that could have slept, but manages to keep much of the attention of the audience throughout the film. In conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent human being, ignore this parody of a movie, read the book, but, otherwise, omit this terrible film in an interesting character of American history.
