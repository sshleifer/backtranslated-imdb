Jude's law gives Keanu Reeves a run for his money as the most astute actor, the character of Renee Z is directly outside of the Beverly Hillbillies, and the two protagonists have as much chemistry as Darth Vader and Queen Amedala. The "bad guys" are the worst kind of clich√©, and there is not a subtle moment in the movie. Amazing that some critics have liked this movie.
