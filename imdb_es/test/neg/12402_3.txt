I've read reviews of other hacks about this movie, and while it's certainly not the best movie ever made in the science fiction / horror genre, it's not so bad if you accept it for what it is: low budget, b-movie that (lets say ) "borrows" from "Alien" (nasty extraterrestrial monster that catches its victims) "Species" (beautiful and confusing "space girl") and "Incubus" (the breeding of beasts with the angle of captive girls). This is a seriously corny movie, and everything was obviously done with a very small budget, although the alien is not so bad (I've seen much less convincing suits of men with rubber, at least). No part of the performance is Oscar material and the Isle of Man does not really bend to Boston Massachusetts convincingly. The plot is also quite predictable and the premise that an extraterrestrial craft would travel hundreds of kilometers and crash in the middle of a women's university campus, thus providing a rich source of victims of perfect reproduction, is absolutely ridiculous. However, the film has its moments of suspense, there are some aids of nudity and nudity and the film presents one of the few appearances in movies of the beautiful and tragic model / actress Kadamba Simmons (as the "Space Girl") that A The 24-year-old was murdered in London by her jealous boyfriend shortly after making this film.
