I hesitated to see this movie, after having enjoyed the original version, 'Mostly Martha'. What a disappointment. Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actress, but this was not her movie. The original had moving moments, perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack. No reservation felt as if it had never connected. The food, the characters - nothing felt passionate. In most cases, Martha, the food came alive: each scene was filmed in such a way that you could taste it with your eyes: the smells, the textures. The food in 'Without reservations' was in the background - we rarely get a close-up of the preparation; The characters were not real enough to take the movie without her. It was difficult to finish the film, many of the scenes felt uncomfortable. See the original - it's a really nice movie; The incredible soundtrack.
