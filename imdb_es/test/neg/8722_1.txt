What can I say? After reading Herbert's books and loving the film version of Lynch, I felt extremely disappointed. I felt I was watching a rejected version of Buck Rogers. The sets seemed to be remnants of a Star Wars TV special! I felt that the acting was a bit amateur by most. The costumes were flashy and finished, which gave a feeling of pulp to Flash Gordon of the 60s. The worms! They are supposed to be sand worms and yet they looked like "big stalagmites" with a mouth on the blunt end. The effects in general were quite second class. I'm not even going to start with the embarrassing "Browser" effect. <br /> <br /> This so-called "Dune of Frank Herbert" was not even true to his books! It should have been called "Dune of Frank Herbert - For Dummies". The key elements of the plot were omitted, the names were changed and all the "sensation" of the story was "disinfected". I did not even recognize the Harkonnen! In fact, most of the characters had nothing to do with Herbert's descriptions. I'm starting to get angry when I remember how tragic it was. I'm glad I could not stand the second installment ...
