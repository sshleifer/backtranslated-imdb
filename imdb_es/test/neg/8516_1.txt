I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I saw this show when it appeared on A & E a few years ago. The show was strange, at least, but I gave it a try because I liked these actresses. This has to be one of the worst shows I've seen. I would not see it again and I certainly would not spend money buying the video. The story of this TV version is ridiculous and simply stupid! The "kicker" (intentional pun) occurs when Ruth undergoes surgery on the bones of the leg. That kind of nonsense belongs to the films of James Bond and Sci-Fi. If this version is true to the book, then I will not get it out of my local library! The American version came out some years after having seen this original. To my surprise, the Americans got it right this time, since their version with Meryl Streep and Roseanne is played to laugh and is quite funny. When playing for laughs, the story works.
