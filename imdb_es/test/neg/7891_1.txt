This is a film about a black man who buys an airline and turns the company into a plane centered on Africa. They even consider that the owner not only controls the airline, but also controls a part of the air terminal at the airport. One day, this guy makes $ 100 million dollars the next time he sees him, he is walking around the airport acting as the owner of the airport. Everyone calls this movie a parody, but nothing about this movie screams parody! This movie is a failure and will always be in the $ 4.95 container at Wal-Mart. <br /> <br /> I can not even understand why MGM would lose 16 million dollars in this movie. This movie does not even guarantee direct status to the video. Writers (one black and one white) must be excluded from Hollywood forever. Not only do they stereotype blacks, they portray them as ignorant human beings. I would be ashamed to go to a movie that humiliates me constantly. Do not waste your time in the video store, Wal-Mart, Pay-Per-View or on a Sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on TBS.
