All I can do is repeat the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commentators. This is the CITY OF GOD meets happy days. The bipolarity of the ruthless bully (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a commercial of Luv's diapers) is completely unconvincing. You can address it in one of two ways: (1) A realistic and energetic movie that has gone crazy; or (2) a sappy, special after-school ABC with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. Either way it just does not fly, do you? Why then has he received so many compliments? As others have implied, he receives the "vote of conscience" from the west. Show us images of poverty to contrast with our double-width and soft theater seats and 44-oz. Cokes, and we'll applaud you in an instant. But, oh, do not forget to put on a sweet cloak, because it costs us to swallow the bitter pill of reality (tempting as it may be). <br /> <br /> I am terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are many more worthy films out there. All I can say is: beware of any film that receives awards (Hollywood Oscar = thorny sweep, calluses, Cannes Festival = caressing the beard, propaganda without art). To find the real gems, you'll have to work hard at it.
