Everyone I know loves this movie, but I'm afraid not. I hated this movie so much that I had to turn it off in the middle of the movie because of the repulsion. Too much time is spent in crying and emotional commotion, the point at which Bullock's character is being devastated by his divorce is to excessively attack the viewer's head. Enough already! And why do not we hear more about your ex-husband? He is represented as nothing more than a suit that comes from time to time. Something must have made her want to marry him, what was it? What is it that makes her so devastated by her divorce? He could have spent more time on that, instead of one more shot of Bullock lying on the bedroom floor. The dialogue is forced, clich√© and terrible, very similar to one of those cheesy "ABC Afterschool Specials" or something like that. There is no imagination or creativity about anything in this film, everything is very predictable and, therefore, boring. This film also focuses too much on the courtesy factor, very stupid and not as fun as it was supposed to be. This is just another one of those horribly made movies of "I'm a woman, listen to me roar", very similar to "Waiting to Exhale". If you want to see "I'm a woman, listen to me roar" movies that are really entertaining, original and well done, go to "Gas Food Lodging" or "Ruby in Paradise". Skip this shit! I give "Floats of hope" 3/10.
