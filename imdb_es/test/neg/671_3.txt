I'm surprised that so many comments about this film are positive. Having read the book several times (and all the other historical novels of Mika Waltari) there is no way to say much in this movie. If I forget the origins of history, I could consider it a reasonably good epic. Of course, taking a brick from a book to the big screen is a task that should not be envied, but it can be done with class. I can not understand why even the name of Nefernefernefer had to be reduced to just Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov, since Kaptah and Marlon Brando probably would have made a better Sinuhe, but the general attitude is that Hollywood is too much to do justice to the book. Note that Mika Waltari left the premier of this movie in the middle of the exhibition. That's how much he liked it.
