My bad film guru (and the president of the Exposed Film Society) told us about it last week. He could not deny the insane brightness in his eye when he pulled it out of his brown paper bag and announced what he had in store for us: "The most dangerous game", filmed with a budget of approximately $ 2.95. <br /> <Of course, $ 2.95 was way beyond 1962, but still ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, there's certainly a lot that I do not like about this movie. Serious technical errors abound (my favorite was the 'repetitive musket' that was fired twice in two minutes without the benefit of a recharge). The hero is an imbecile who waits while his wounded friend fights the henchman and kill him. <br /> <br /> More? OK - The plot is a chaos with no continuity to talk about. The film wastes five minutes with a "special guest star" who serves as the physical embodiment of the villain's madness and paranoia, but never shows it again. The hero is suffocated by the henchman, but does not mention it when he wakes up and meets his host for the first time. The silent servant is captured, placed on the shelf ... and then the movie (and the hero, who put her in this situation) simply "forgets" her. <br /> <br /> More? Well, sets are cheap and special effects are cheaper (makeup is an exception to this). Much of the plot is carried by the droning, the narrator's monotonous voice-over, which has a less dramatic impact than the menu recital at Denny's. Most of the dialogue is simply ridiculous and forced, as if it were translated from Japanese. ("I demand that our conversation be pleasant!") And color values ​​tend to change wildly from one shot to another, as if cheap film and problematic lighting equipment were the order of the day. (Note: the latter may have been the fault of a bad impression, instead of the camera equipment). <br /> <br /> But there were a couple of good times here and there. The makeup effects were surprisingly good in contrast to the rest of the film, the actors seemed interesting, especially the silent servant and the countess. And in spite of everything, there was a creepy atmosphere defined, very unpleasant and disturbing. <br /> <br /> So, what was the problem with this movie? I thought about it a bit and I realized that the director / writer Pat Boyette basically tried to put a story about the old horror comics "EC" in the movie. That would explain the dialogue on piles, the development of schematic characters (in a comic, physiognomy = character even more than in the movie), the inner logic of the story (the horror stories of "EC" did everything possible to include a unpleasant "the" shock "ended and was not great in psychological realism), the excessive dependence on the narrative voice (which belongs to the subtitles in the panels) and the interesting makeup effects that imitated the creepy images that the old artists of EC did so well. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would be willing to bet that when Boyette saw his protagonist during the casting, he instantly saw that the subject was the closest thing to being the equivalent of the unkempt and sloppy figures and with sunken faces that artists such as Johnny Craig and Jack Davis drew as a real human could be and continue to exist in the real world, using costumes and lighting to emphasize the appearance cartoonish of the visuals and turned them all into characters of live EC comics. (See: the white beauty of the protagonist, the bony and strong features of the Count, the strangely bronze skin and the sharp chin, the platinum in the tall, bony man, black), etc.) <br /> <br /> This would explain the movie. Failures Boyette knew how to "frame" things, but he did not know how to handle three dimensions and bodies in motion. Boyette knew how to tell a spooky story within the confines of a comic page, but the nuances of the film and the live actors escaped him. I would not be the first person with this problem, of course, look what Joel Schumacher did to "Batman". But I did not have a big budget to hide behind. <br /> <br /> In any case, I imagine that Boyette walked away from this train collision and probably spent less time thinking about "Dungeon of Harrow" than people posting on the message boards of this movie. He did, within vague limits, what he set out to do, and you have to respect him for that ... even if you do not care "Harrow".
