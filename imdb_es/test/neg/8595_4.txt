If you can watch a movie without worrying about the plot or the cheesy performance, then Backdraft is definitely the only one. <br /> <br /> However, if, like me, you like watching movies you can believe, then Backdraft has some serious flaws. It does not offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90s action movies that follow identical formulas, although they are not that clumsy. <br /> <br /> After two shootings, I think this has to go away. In another place, I mean, how many big fires are there in a city? Are you sure firefighters do other things, like getting cats out of trees? Well, I was wrong, and the repetition continues again and again, until the end. <br /> <br /> A good aspect of the film is the fire itself, well filmed, and I must say that I felt quite warm as I looked at it suggesting that two hours of watching fire without a story or performance would have been more appropriate for my taste.
