Well, now I'm pretty sure my summary caught his attention and my comment that Zazu Pitts is Satan is not without some basis. Let me explain. At first, the movie seems to be an excellent B movie about an evil organization called "The Crooked Circle" and its revenge vote in the form of murder in a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes. While this is very strange (especially the idea of ​​a club of private citizens solving crimes) and COULD have been interesting, this movie falls apart despite a rather impressive list of family support actors. Why? Well, because Zazu Pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the movie whining like Olive Oyl with a strong toothache. While murders are committed, people are kidnapped or whatever, you can always count on Zazu whining at full volume, almost like the odious 3-year-old boy who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to him! At the same time, she is NOT an integral part of the movie, but she received the best billing. Why she is there, is beyond me, I assume it is only to complain and scream. As a result, it seemed to me that the movie was practically impossible to see and completely ruined. Now you probably know why I have referred to this actress of dubious talent as "Satan"! I'm sure that when the actors in this movie saw the final product, they also felt the same way I did about their horrible exaggerated and amateur acting. <br /> <br /> This movie is public. domain and can be found for free download on the internet. I can see why.
