This movie had very few good points, the special effects and the acting was horrible, without a doubt. But it was a movie made on a low budget, so do not expect much of it, have some laughs (although I doubt they are thought :)). The scene in which the old woman bends down and touches the manure that was on the ground, then puts it to her nose and goes chupacabra. In a really rough and harsh voice, there was no price. In general, if you have nothing more to do and just want to laugh at a really horrible movie trying to capitalize on the success of Blair's Witch Project, then do not bother him.
