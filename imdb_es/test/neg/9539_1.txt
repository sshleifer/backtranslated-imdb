... that's where I'm assuming this movie came from. I mean, I've seen a lot of B movies throughout my youth life so far, and I would not even classify it as a B movie. I remember watching movies in my high school media class that surpassed this one. <br /> <br /> So the premise is ... a lot of dancing numbers and nonsense happen. Women in bikinis, who are not so attractive to begin with, dance at the beginning and sing. They appear boys with furry breasts and girls with fangs that are in the light of the sun. I mean, I can barely put together a cohesive sentence just thinking about this movie. According to most people on this site, Hands, the hands of fate and the people of Pod are the worst movies (MST3K classics :-D) ... used to be one of them. Then I saw this movie. Usually, I do not try to destroy a movie too much, but the people who made it really deserve it. It is THAT bad and THAT unbearable, and I assume that the director or an actor in the movie is the only person who qualified this one with a ten.
