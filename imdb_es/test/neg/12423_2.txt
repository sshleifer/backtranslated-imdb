Oh darling! Oh darling! Oh heavens! <br /> <br /> To think that films like this one were made, and that probably enjoyed thousands of people in the drive-ins really stuns the mind. What innocents we were in those days. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, this movie is crap. The hero is so wet that you can hear his soft and wet footsteps in every scene. My lord, but he is one of the many horrible actors that appear in this turkey. No wonder MST3K has chosen it. The story, as it is, is centered around a stock car driver (who is so incompetent, you really think it's the actor who drives the car) who gives up and "comes in with the wrong people" Oooooh! Scary things. However, the wrong crowd turns out to be the biker equivalent of The Three Stooges and their whore "hand-me round" from a biker girl. As an example of how unconvincing all this is, the writers obviously trashed their brains to invent a scary name for the motorcyclist gang, if four people can be called gangs. The result? The gang is called the angels of satan! I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> This performance and dialogue, together with ridiculous scenes, make a wonderful movie of beer and chips. But otherwise, it's just the worst kind of garbage. <br /> <br /> As I said. Once, this may have been considered good. But today it only makes you laugh (and tremble) with every minute that passes. Avoid it except for a good laugh. And make sure you're more than half drunk too!
