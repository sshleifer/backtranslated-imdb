This is an absolutely horrible excuse for a show. Do people say that he is witty and intelligent? I do not see how? Maybe because the characters use elegant words? Maybe because they are presumptuous, use dry humor and have two-dimensional personalities. I went to an Ivy League school and nobody acted as unpleasantly as these characters. In fact, if he had met someone like them, he probably would have strangled them! Men act as little emotional pre-adolescent girls and all minority characters are based on stereotypes ... The characters are not at all AUTHENTIC. In short, they sound like a family of trailers trying to be rich and sophisticated. This show is just another success that the first-time spectators of brain death eat regularly.
