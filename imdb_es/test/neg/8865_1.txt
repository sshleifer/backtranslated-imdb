Now first let me say that I love the terrible movies of God. Especially the horror films mainly. I watched hundreds of movies in Mystery Science Theater 3000 painlessly. But this is the worst movie on the planet !!! I had to turn it off it was so bad. It was not fun and you just could not see it. Give me 3 consecutive visits of Hands Hands of Fate or Monster A-go-go on this any day. Avoid this movie like the plague! Now excuse me while I take out my eyes to clean them of the dirt I had to see to get a decent judgment for this movie. Only one decent gag in the part I saw was that the assassins are now a pair of extermination for the Hitmen Exterminators. Even that was not a big joke.
