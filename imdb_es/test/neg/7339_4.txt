I love the book It is full of passion, romance, tension ... and the film is prolonged taking with it two brave stars. Kylie Minogue was already an important star in Australia, having starred in Neighbors and releasing her first single. The decision to choose her in The Delinquents was undoubtedly a marketing strategy. For me, it was not worth it. <br /> <br /> Kylie may have been great at Neighbors, but she was too sweet and innocent to play the fighter Lola ... and, she was not Asian. It descended as it was Lola. Charlie Schlatter was an excellent Brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and Kylie. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was boring. He went on, he lacked the passion of the book, he focused heavily on Kylie and, in general, it was completely disappointing.
