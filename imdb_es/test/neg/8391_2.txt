This movie is horrible, I can not even bother writing a review about this garbage! All I'll say is that it's one of the most boring movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> And the acting is very bad. The boy who plays the main character really bothers me, he has the same expression on his face throughout the film. I just want to slap him! Basically, 80% of the film consists of slow-motion shots of skaters, strange music and absolute shit. <br /> <br /> Apparently, I must write at least 10 lines of text to send this comment, so I'm going to use a few more lines by saying that the main character has achieved one of those faces that they just want to give a slap! <br /> <br /> Meh I give up..THIS MOVIE SUCKS !!!!
