Comedy works best when it relates to things that are true. But even as such, it requires a certain effort to make jokes that everyone likes and even the most grumpy spectators can make a smile. When I look at the Daily Show, I see everything "it's funny because it's true", but I do not see the effort and many times I do not do it if they're funny or just try to do something. One point (I notice it mainly in the interview segments). The Daily Show began as a parody of news, by definition, they mock how the media reproduces their own news, posing as inept and mute reporters and news anchors, and tackled tons of topics from science to movies and, sometimes, politics. Stewart came ... and everything went to hell. The first years of Jon Stewart's reign were possibly golden, I thought it was a lot of fun, but then 2004 came and it's where you start to notice a great opportunity in the show from there. The humor of the program is exhausted, Colbert left, Steve Carell left, many of the best anchors of the program were left and now it is mainly about Jon Stewart and the program has gone from a parody to a semi-serious news program , essentially Evening News but with some gags here and there. For those of you who have not seen the program and are having trouble figuring out what to see on the cable, I will give you a brief description of what the program is about (at least until 2009): -Bush, Cheney and all Republicans (unless also they embrace an opinion shared by the democrats) are stupid, evil, corrupt and hypocritical, anyone who defends conservative beliefs is also evil, corrupt and hypocritical; - People who doubt the theory of global warming made by man are evil and stupid; - Democrat vote; There I saved you 25 minutes of your time, go see something else. At first, I thought that the producers hijacked the program for their own personal political agenda, but when I watch the interviews, it is clear what this program is about (what I mentioned earlier), but I will get to that in a moment. Frist off, the humor in The Daily Show according to Jon Stewart is hoping you'll find a randomly shot date for Bush, Cheney or a random Republican comedian because, well, why. Jon establishes the joke, establishes it in the specific context of the writers and expects the random quote to somehow deliver the auction line. Therefore, unless you "get" the context, it is completely useless as reliable humor. Also, the Daily Show expects them to laugh when they show a montage of a politician talking and in another separate video saying something else, again putting in a context that writers expect you to understand, so it's fun, why? Well, because Jon said it. Now imagine that the Daily Show uses that formula countless times for years each week, and you will begin to understand what used to be a festival of laughter that is now 25 minutes of silent glances (yes, even in the Lewis Black segments). At first, a decent amount of effort was devoted to these jokes, but now it is much less obvious. And the interview has the strangest sense of bias I've seen. Jon Stewart calls Bill O'Reilly a stalker, but what does that do to him, when he sucks all the actors and Democrats (John Kerry before, Obama today) who appear on the show and despise respected Republicans and notable journalists? conservatives? Like Bill Kristol himself of Weekly Standard? He puts them in a tribunal of people as if they were being accused of a crime, many times anyone in the program that defends Bush is portrayed as delusional, as if that person was not in touch with reality and assumed he speaks. for most of the United States, that is the de facto treatment for any conservative person, unless they share a similar view with the democrats, if it is so, it is a festival of endless love. But still, it does not matter, in Jon's eyes, you're already wrong before entering the program and you still have mistakes. That is the kind of treatment you receive if you are something remotely right-wing. Now you have to ask yourself what could have something to do with humor. One wonders what will happen if the Democrats win the White House ...
