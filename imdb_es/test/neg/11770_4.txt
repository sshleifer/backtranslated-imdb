I guess my biggest mistake was seeing this new version of "Piranha" from 95 with the original from Joe Dante's 78. I did the same thing last week with "The Omen". Interestingly, seeing the remake right after the original '76, really made me appreciate the 2006 version quite for several reasons. <br /> <br /> But this approach failed in the '95 Piranha version. It improved the fact that it really is a minor image. Basically, the '95 version is more or less exactly the same film, since it tells the same story and follows it practically scene by scene (of it only the character of Barabara Steele and military intervention was written). But the cinematography was not so good. The acting was worse too. Especially Alexandra Paul (playing the character of Heather Menzies) showed me again that she is a horrible actress. Bradford Dillman (from the '78 version) had his way of acting Charlton Heston, which was fun, while in the '95 version, William Katt does a good job to be William Katt. So I did not care, really. But the whole cast is quite inferior and the only event that was worthwhile was seeing James Karen ("The Return of the Living Dead", parts 1 and 2) in a cameo. The makeup effects of John Carl Buechler are not as sharp as those of Rob Bottin. The musical score had some ringing, but Pino Donaggio's score was much more memorable in the original. So all these deficiencies really shone with just having seen the original again as part of this double bill. <br /> <br /> Since Scott P. Levy's remake follows Dante's original, I think he's entertaining enough to stay. , although it lacks the ingenuity that Dante's original had. But what really made me not really like the Levy version is the fact that a lot of footage from the first movie was reused during the piranha attack scenes. I never like it when the filmmakers do this (and I'm not talking about using images for flashbacks or other valid reasons). I mean, if you do not have the budget (or the imagination) to create newly filmed material, then, for Pete's sake, do not do a new version. But Roger Corman produced this (cheaper) remake, so I guess I should not be so surprised by the reuse of the images. <br /> <br /> If you decide to see "Piranha", then make sure it's been a while since you've seen the original. You could enjoy this remake a little more then. And, oh yeah, that cool little stop-motion creature from the original is not in this movie, as you'd expect. But what's worse, there are no female nudes in this either (the original really had quite a few shots of tits, and that blonde girl from the opening scene even accidentally pulled her underwear a bit too much when she took off her jeans!). Figures, since this '95 version was made for TV.
