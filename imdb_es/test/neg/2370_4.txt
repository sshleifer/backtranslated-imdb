This film is derived from a long-running ITV sitcom with the same name. The situation comedy lasted approximately a decade, approximately, and appeared on our screens Rigsby, Phillip, Alan, Mrs Jones and Vienna. <br /> <br /> Then, in 1980, The version of the film came to the cinemas. Now when he did, unfortunately Richard Beckinsale had died and was replaced by Solo when I laughed at actor Chris Strauli. <br /> <br /> I myself felt that this gave the film a different feeling. I preferred not to be filmed, since Richard was a key character. It's like having the porridge movie without Godber or Mackay! <br /> <br /> The film definitely had some classic moments, but it felt a little De-Ja -Vu! Many parts were seen before in the television series. Now, if you saw the film for the first time instead of the series, you would have a different feeling about it, then the fan of the series! <br /> <br /> By saying that Leonard is definitely in top shape and making the film, like on television The movie has recently had a new life on DVD and, usually, in Terrestrial during a quiet weekend . It's a good movie, but for Rigsby fans it's possible that you feel like you've seen it in a similar way before. <br /> <br /> Say that it's worth buying / seeing <br /> <br /> 7.8 / 10
