Gordon Scott, with his well-combed hair, his hourglass figure and his strange English pidgin, has to be the worst of all Tarzanos. As for the other actors in this mess, they are on par with any kind of fourth-grade elementary school drama. I've seen used car dealers in TV ads that can act better. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where does Jane (the bored Eve Brent) get her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? I realize that they were made for children, but Wow! The plot seemed fine, but the director should have required more of his actors. I realize that even Weissmuller's films have some flaws, but this one seemed so "low budget".
