Well, recently I've been collecting many vipco and hardgore titles on DVD and I have to say that this is one of the most disappointing. A more recent movie compared to other titles in the Hardgore catalog was a direct DVD release. I have always been interested in the myth of The Chokeberry since I saw a documentary about him as a teenager. However, this movie is a terrible disappointment in the plot dv the story and the acting are terrible, it took me three times to see this movie until the end. While the cheap horror movies of the 80s and 90s are good because of their cheap budgets and comedy, this movie is not. <br /> <br /> check some other titles in the first hardgore series, Boneyard, for example, is older but much better.
