I saw this movie on the Blockbuster shelf and I thought it looked good. The DVD case touted so many great actors and I asked myself: "Why have I never heard of this movie?" Then I delivered the case and saw the director, Lee Tamahori, and so the answer began to be explained. <br /> <br /> First of all I want to defeat the idea that a great cast is equal to a great movie, but more important, I think I should explain why this movie is so terrible. Okay, the script is horrible and it's full of one-dimensional characters. This is the worst role I've seen playing Chazz Palminteri and I'm surprised he did something so ridiculous. However, underrated but talented actors must earn their money. Palminteri plays a one-dimensional police detective who appears as foolish as a man from the C-movie mafia. He, along with the main detective (the misguided Nolte), the great but simple Michael Madsen, and the late Chris Penn (whose role along with Madsen's was completely discarded) make up an elite squad of LA detectives in charge of get rid of the city of mobsters sometime in the late 30s or 40s. The film presents this squad as policemen who will violate all laws to make sure that those who think they are above the law do not operate in their city . At the beginning of the film, the police mistreat a local restaurant, take a supposed mafioso (William Peterson) and take him to a place they call the Mulholland Falls. They pull him from one of the cliffs on Mullholland Drive and this is supposed to show how serious these guys are to rid the city of crime. Whatever is. This was no more than a cheap excuse to use a shitty title that is designed to make you think of LA and its famous sites. Later, somewhere, they find the corpse of Jennifer Connelly and the plot begins. <br /> <br /> Towards the direction that was nothing short of amateur and WEAK! Apart from the fact that the characters were of B-movie quality, the overactivity of Treat Williams, the guy who plays the police chief and the horrible Daniel Baldwin are just some of the highlights that made this movie look like it was Lee . The first Tamhori movie. There is not a good performance in the movie, apart from maybe Melanie Griffith, which some might argue was the worst in the movie (she won a Razzie for this movie). In the end, it was his character who was not so good and really did not have much to work with. <br /> <br /> As with any bad movie, it all starts with writing, and this script was not a gem. The argument is formulated simply on the basis of setting the next scene and never takes into consideration the motivations of the characters. The way the characters behaved was incredible. The cops who take the law into their own hands are credible in the right circumstances (see THE CONFIDENTIAL), but in this case, it seems that these guys could get away with it, including murder, and never hesitate to clean up anything. I suppose that we, as a public, are supposed to assume that nobody saw anything and that people will not ask questions. Everything about the story is predictable and it feeds so well that we understand everything that is going to happen a good while before the characters do it. However, it does not make us feel smart, but it makes us angry for how stupid the hero is, even though there are no heroes in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, the best component of the film was David Grusin's great score. From the beginning, he invoked a version of CHINATOWN, which quickly faded when I realized how amazing everything was in the movie. I was not surprised to learn that I had added eleven million at the box office. What I'm going to say is that this movie is worth seeing for a few laughs. Nick Nolte's performance is like a domesticated scrap dog without success and I laughed every time I tried to be serious. I also almost fell to the ground in each of the slow motion shots used in the movie (I think there are three with one during a key fight scene). When you have to use slow motion in the heat of a dramatic moment, you clearly have some problems. So, even with my negative criticism, I will recommend this movie with the sole purpose of provoking laughter, that is, if you appreciate good films like LA CONFIDENTIAL.
