Well, I read the other comments. I did not think it sounded good, but I decided to record it anyway. Maybe it's not so smart to read all the negative reviews before watching this movie, because, of course, I would notice all the weird things. The excessive use of attenuation to black, a few strange camera angles and a cross-talk for different conversations with the same people that take place at different times. But noticing everything that I thought to myself: Well, this would probably be very boring if everything were chronologically. The conversations are not so exciting, but rather obligatory. And the constant fading to black after really short scenes really makes it feel as if the story is moving quickly also for the interesting part. Skipping the boring bits. At the end of the movie it also gets a bit exciting. Will they survive? <br /> <br /> So I really liked this movie? No, not really. The director had some interesting ideas on how to keep the audience from getting bored while trying to present the characters. But he is exaggerating it. It becomes annoying, and sometimes confusing. Apparently, this was just the second movie he directed, so maybe he will learn and do really good things in the future. And if you're sitting there (in the future) reading this, you'll wonder if it's worth looking at the second film of now famous directors. Well, if he's good in the future, of course, look at this shit and ask yourself how he came to do a third. Otherwise, this movie is not worth watching unless you're very interested in making movies and want to see a way in which you can cut the obligatory and boring introductory scenes into something visible.
