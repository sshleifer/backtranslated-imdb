Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both beautiful movies, but this final installment of the trilogy is a big disappointment. They were carried away by the archival material and photography, so little content. The executive producer puts his own image in the film ... It's just pretentious. Maybe if they had more than $ 3 million to spend, maybe it would have been something. In fact, I thought that Steven Soderbergh directed it because it was very bad, but Godfrey Reggio, the director of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, directed it. I'll have to assume that they just did not have the budget to make a decent movie. You would think that Francis Ford Coppola would have wanted to be part of this movie and help raise more money.
