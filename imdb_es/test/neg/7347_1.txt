When I first saw this show on Cartoon Network, I found it uninteresting. Then I read many good messages about this program and decided to see it. The show was so boring. Each episode was predictable. More, this show has no logic. Hypersmart girls, who go to school and sometimes do such stupid things, 99% of the episodes start with a Monster that attacks Townswille, then the Mayor (he's a fool, it's NOT fun, it's so stupid, I can not imagine how he became mayor). Professor, yes, he's supposed to be the smartest person in this show, but actually ... He even found no difference between the monster and his brother. The comments of the narrators also make this show boring. Because they also have similar lines at the beginning of each episode and at the end. Also the animation is very strange. Everything except the main heroes is shown in an ugly way. Also, in each epsode this program is giving you some life lessons, and it means that it is aimed at young children, but if you look more closely, you will see that there is a lot of violence and even blood (!!!) during their battles.
