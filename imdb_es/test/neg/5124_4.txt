This movie was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea to sell some albums. Seriously it was not. The idea behind this is that if you made a movie full of pop songs, you could paste the songs into an LP, sell them and earn even more money for the studio. You can also launch some tracks as singles and intersperse the promotional video with clips from the movie, so that when MTV plays a track, get free publicity for the movie.

This is because a double body is used most of the time and, often, the double body is a man. I bet there are some naughty boys who feel guilty not to mention a little disgusted to know that
