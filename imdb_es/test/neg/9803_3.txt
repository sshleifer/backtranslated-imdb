I kept waiting for the movie to move me, inspire me, shock me, make me sad in some way, but it did not excite me. It simply meandered to the end. None of the characters seemed very unique or complex, just like actors reciting their lines. I think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion. The only one who did it and was credible was the veteran and probably committed suicide to get out of the movie as soon as he could. It was a waste of talent, the cinema, its time and mine. If there is a message or meaning or genius in this story, it is certainly well hidden or I am very dense, which I doubt.
