A story formulated with all the tired clich√©s. I was surprised that the horrible script turned into a movie! What a waste! How many ORIGINAL scripts are scattered without being produced? <br /> <br /> At the climax, I was able to predict what will happen in each shot. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I do not even want to start talking about the idiotic sexual tension between the beautiful police. and the paralyzed policeman who can barely move a finger. YEAH SURE. I can buy that. Whats Next? Porn fingers?
