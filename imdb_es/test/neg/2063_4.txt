Some people complain that this is NOT the opera, but then they do not argue with the CABARET movie that was not the original show either. All musical / operas films are and must be "adaptations" or they do not work. CABARET took more liberties with the original program than the PORGY AND BESS film and, nevertheless, maintained its original integrity, reworking the material and is considered an artistic success. The same applies to PORGY AND BESS: it transformed the opera into a song / dialogue script because the audiences at that time loved the musicals but kept away from the few operas filmed by echt. It would have been an economic suicide for Preminger to produce an opera film, it would have lost a fortune for Goldwyn Studios. <br /> <br /> That said, this is an excellent adaptation. The acting is excellent, Andre Previn's Oscar winning score is magnificent, just as the choral singing and the individual vocal achievements are incredible. Robert McFerrin (father of popular musician Bobby McFerrin) nicknamed Porgy and Adele Addison nicknamed Bess. While Sammy Davis Jr. sang his own songs in the film, his recording contract would not allow his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album, so Cab Calloway recorded his numbers (spectacularly) for that release. The bass / baritone of Brock Peters is extraordinary and Pearl Bailey is his own unique self. Diahann Carroll, although a singer of good note, has the small role of Clara, which required a high soprano, so old and reliable that Marni Nixon nicknamed her singing. <br /> <br /> Gershwin Estate hates the film and refuses to grant musical rights, although dramatic rights are in the public domain. This kind of hatred stopped CAROUSEL's video launch for almost fifteen years (although in that case it was the dramatic rights that were in litigation) and currently prevents both PORGY AND BESS and ANNIE GET YOUR GUN from being published on video. <br /> <br /> Of all the theatrical productions given the cinematographic versions, it is these last two that are the only limitations of the video. Only a letter campaign to the Gershwin estate in New York could loosen the reserve.
