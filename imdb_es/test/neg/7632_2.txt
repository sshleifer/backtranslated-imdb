Sorry, I could not be more expressive in my summary, but those two words seemed to perfectly describe the film. This is not only a bad movie, but a bad movie with bad acting and a plot that will not be inconsequential for the majority of the spectators. <br /> <br /> Watch it only for a naked Rebecca De Mornay tied to a wire fence. and moaning with 'ecstasy; supposedly 'erotic', but really hilarious. <br /> <br />
