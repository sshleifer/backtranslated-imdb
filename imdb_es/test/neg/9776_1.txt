*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** A group of Afrikkaner-Hillbilly is in the desert looking for diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area. Spoilers: the dumbest begins to hit the mound with a pick and opens it. Then look at the hole and poke his head and SURPRISE! something eats it. The other two fools do not look alive again. Scott Bairstow looks like a pizza delivery man, but he plays some kind of expert scientist with a medical degree (which means he should be at least 35 years old). Bairstow is supposed to join Camp C and help them find diamonds. The truck that picks up Bairstow to take it to Camp C has a handful of the kind of weirdos that usually populate movies like "PITCH BLACK", "THE THING", etc. The truck goes through the first truck and decides to investigate (Why did not that truck see the other truck when they were driving to pick up Bairstow, since they were traveling the same way? Then they find the bodies eaten, and there are some decent special effects related to the bones with small pieces of meat in them.The main lunatic of the group, Karl, decides that they must find the killer.So the truck moves through the desert following some clues, and eventually it has a short circuit and the crew is trapped in the The most foolish guy in this group had picked up a lot of bones using his jacket to carry them in. When he takes a nap (with the same jacket) the creatures eat him alive, and another man runs and puts his arm in the sticky substance And that mannequin also loses his arm, sounds exciting until now, except that a few minutes later, Dr. Bairstow realizes that the creature is really hundreds of thousands of ants that use the bones to stay together and so can travel to a new hive (because the miners opened) the old hive). Now, the last time I checked, the ants could move on their own, without having to kill people to use the bones for the structure. If everything they needed was difficult, they could have put together a bunch of sticks and used them to create a form. The whole story is really, really silly, and the explanation of the ant is the only one given. The rest of the film is about the group being killed until they find the new nest of ants, and kill the brain of ants (more or less), and the hundreds of thousands of ants leave on their own. The feet A spare anti-brain is found (off-camera) and sent for analysis, thus creating a reason for a sequel.
