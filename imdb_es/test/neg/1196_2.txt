This movie was fine, but like most television series, it would have been better if it was made for television. <br /> <br /> Unlike most British films that are based on TV series, this movie starts and there seems to be a winner, but the rhythm stops suddenly when the three mediocre characters are in the Real world waiting to capture the three comedians. <br /> <br /> The movie is not going anywhere when Hillary enters a room with the captured Steve, Lipp disguised as Steve, and Geoff somehow writing himself in medieval times. What made me think 'wait? Why do not you need a key to enter that world unlike the characters of Royston Vasey? The medieval scene was fine, but Monty Python did it much better and, of course, more fun, with the cameos of Peter Kay and Simon Pegg, both said nothing funny, Kay had a line and Pegg just sat on the wall with boring look. br /> <br /> What also bothered me was that they seem to forget what happened in the previous episodes, as Hillary escaped to the Caribbean on television in series 2, but in the movie he escaped from prison, and also Lipp is a pedophile vampire who was not mentioned at all in the movie, which was also quite disturbing when he was left alone taking care of the children. <br /> <br /> There were many plot holes and unexplained situations, such as Geoff. And did the Dark One escape from medieval times back to Royston Vasey? As in the Series 3, it started well, but as the film progressed, it slowly went downhill and had a very weak predictable ending. <br /> <br /> They would be better off doing what Monty Python did and remaking all the better and better. the classic sketches of the Series 1-3 and the Christmas special, and they turned it into a film that re-presented the characters to a completely new audience, who can not be asked to watch the series or buy the DVDs . <br /> <br /> The best advice is to save money and wait until you're on TV ... Where it belongs.
