Red Sonja is a step race in the wrong direction for Arnold Schwarzenegger. After having made a couple of witchcraft movies with sword and sword (like Conan), he had assumed more serious acting roles in films like The Terminator and Commando, only to make a disconcerting return to the genre of sword and witchcraft for this 1985 disaster. It's hard to understand why he got upset, since he's weaker than Conan's two films in every conceivable department. Apparently, this was Conan's third film, but for one reason or another, the emphasis shifted to the main female character, the titular redhead, leaving poor Arnold to play an incredibly boring supporting role. Dedicate a thought, too, to director Richard Fleischer, who had given the world classics 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Fantastic Voyage, The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place. In this, his penultimate film, Fleischer has also taken a big step backwards in his career. <br /> <br /> The evil Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) wants to rule the world, and needs a talisman of incalculable and powerful value to do so. She and her brutal army assault a population populated by priestesses and steal said talisman, massacring the helpless priestesses as they go. One of the dead priestesses has a sister named Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), a fiery redhead warrior, who upon hearing the death of her sister vows to take revenge on the evil Gedren. Sonja travels the earth in search of Gedren's lair. On the way, she picks up travel companions in the form of a child prince, Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr) and her bodyguard Falkon (Paul Smith). She also meets the muscular warrior Conan - sorry, I mean Kalidor (!) - who offers to join her in her quest. Initially, Sonja does not want the help of Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), but prefers to prove that she can face and defeat her enemies alone, but in the end she is attracted to him and accepts his help. <br /> <br /> Red Sonja is an amazingly poor film, all the more so when one reflects that it was made in 1985 when the genre of the sword and the spell was near its end. It seems so simplistic and amateur that one could easily mistake it for an early example of its kind. The performances are poor in general, from the shameful villain of Bergman OTT to the incredibly irritating brat of Reyes to the wooden hero and unenthusiastic Schwarzenegger. Nielsen is a little better than the heroine, presumably full of enthusiasm at the idea of ​​being in her first leading role, but the stupidity of Clive Exton and George MacDonald Fraser disappoints her. The film is full of nonsense, including a scene in which Schwarzenegger is seen approaching the bad guys, but in a long shot in the same sequence there is no corpse in sight. Technically it is also very inept, with sub-standard special effects and terrifyingly mechanical monsters. There are some compensations, such as the pleasant music of Ennio Morricone (Morricone spent much of the 80s providing good music for dreadful films, for example, La Isla, The Treasure of the Four Crowns and Hundra). Another compensation is the focus of Giuseppe Rotunno's locations. In fact, many times it is much more rewarding to contemplate the beautiful landscape than the actors who are in the foreground. There were very few sword and witch movies after Red Sonja, so it could somehow go down in history as the movie that destroyed its own genre.
