The snakes in a train begin when the Mexican couple Brujo (A.J. Castro) and Alma (Julia Ruiz) cross the border in the United States, then illegally embark on a seventeen-hour train to Los Angeles. However, Alma's family did not approve of the relationship between her and Brujo and placed on her an ancient curse of black magic that turns all her entrails into snakes, is not life a shit? When the snakes come out of Alma's mouth and slip into other parts of the train, they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual illness ... <br /> <br /> Edited and directed by the Mallachi Brothers (although the IMDb claims that it's just a guy who uses a pseudonym, Peter Mervis, one has to say that I thought Snakes on a train was crap, it's actually as simple as that, it seems that the whole movie was prepared and made the cult film Samuel L. Jackson's Snakes on a Plane (2006) by all horror fans, the least favorite production company, Asylum, which specializes in big-budget Hollywood scams, that style of making money and making movies is no more obvious than here with Snakes on a Train, making a movie just because the title rhymes with a more successful movie is not a good starting point.The Eric Forsberg script is nonsense, to start with Snakes on a Plan It was very funny, while Snakes on a Train is much more serious and when you really analyze it and look at it, this should have been much more cheerful. In fact, it probably would have worked better as a scary movie spoof (2000). You know something, I'm struggling to find a positive thing to say about snakes in a train: it's so bad. For starters, the characters are garbage and it is impossible to emote with anyone, the story is downright horrible and it does not make sense (if people vomit all those little snakes, where did the big ones come from? Why did Alma become the giant snake? In the end, why did Bujo kill the train driver, how was he going to stop the train once he arrived in Los Angeles, where did the typhoon end up?), he takes himself too seriously, the first seventy odd minutes is so boring and uneventful I am surprised to have been awake and it is just a very, very bad movie on almost every level. <br /> <br /> Director Mervis has only a few sets of train cars that look a lot like them. The movie becomes very repetitive and boring to watch. There is hardly blood or blood, there are some snakes borrowed under the skin of some people, someone is shot and that is all. The special effects are also garbage, the CGI giant snake at the end is really horrible and the less said, the better. It's not scary, there's no atmosphere and it's a bit boring from start to finish. True living snakes are a problem too, they are so docile and not threatening. If you watch a scene with a real snake and an actor, the snakes never make any movement towards them or act aggressively and, in fact, always seem to want to slide in the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> Shooting in California technically, the film is obviously low budget and shows, basically it seems cheap because it is. The acting is not great, they are not given any kind of material to work with the actors. <br /> <br /> Snakes on a train is silly, I'm sorry, but that's how I feel and I do not know. How else to describe it? I really can not see what anyone would see of Snakes on a train, it really is that bad.
