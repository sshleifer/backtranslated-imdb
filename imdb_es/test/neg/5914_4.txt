by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> I was anxious about this. I enjoy Eddie Murphy and I love it when a star makes a vehicle for himself or when someone who writes decides to make his own directorial debut. But when the head of the star becomes too big for the rest of your body, there is always the danger of a large-budget Hollywood toilet production. <br /> <br /> Will the filmmaker keep it real? Or will you simply waste amounts of money (the study, ours) and time (the study, ours and yours) patting your back for an hour and a half? Unfortunately, it's the last thing here. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really like is when someone breathes new and fresh life in an exhausted and dry genre. None of that here. The films of night clubs in war have been worn so much that even their parodies are dreary and dead. <br /> <br /> Murphy does not do anything. He makes the most cliché: he connects to a gangster image of conventional routine formula and reproduces it as seriously as if he were "The Godfather". It's like a script where the next draft, put in the jokes and new ideas. But it seems that someone with influence simply looked at him and said: "No, this is fine". <br /> <br /> Probably Murphy. All this is attributed to him. In the close-up of beautiful white satin sheets, her name appears in the credits about five times. <br /> <br /> THE PLOT: A young orphan saves Pryor's life and Pryor adopts the little ragamuffin. <br /> <br /> 20 years later, the Pryor landfill has become a first-class place. They are throwing large amounts of money and a gangster wants his action. He even has a dirty cop in his work. But Pryor comes up with a scheme, like "THE STING". <br /> <br /> Murphy's script is reproduced as an unfinished first draft in which nobody had the couple to call him. The actors can not stand out much, if they do. Even the almighty Murphy seems to be on autopilot. <br /> <br /> Pryor shows gentlemanly and class manners like Sugar Ray (it might have been better to name his BROWN Sugar Ray character - additional evidence that he needed a polish), but everyone here is basically on vacation. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nomination that received the film is well deserved (Best Costume Design by Joe I. Tompkins), but production values ​​are the only part that makes the 30s feel authentic. <br /> <br /> Some sets seem a bit fake, but this is supposed to be a kind of comedy. It is rare that a film is nominated for both a Razzie and an Oscar (unless it is one of the new chapters of "Star Wars" by Lucas). <br /> <br /> It's 1938 and everyone talks like it's 1988, especially the comedians. This is a prehistoric formula of the white man. And with all these black comedians and satirists, you expect them to divert the genre or at least give it a new life. No Murphy is quite close to slipping here. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Roger Ebert summed it up perfectly when he commented on his critique: "Murphy approaches his story more like a costume party in which everyone looks great while doing awkwardness through a plot that has not been fresh since at least 1938. " <br /> <br /> Jasmine Guy is a perfect cast and seems to be indulging in her role and Michael Lerner has all the looks, the evil and the manners of the boss of the prototypical mafia. And there are times when Pryor gives you an idea of ​​what a more interesting leader and authority sounds like. Give each scene that has a feeling of dignity. <br /> <br /> Would it have been too much to ask Della Resse to sing? Or at least stop embarrassing yourself with all your "Kiss my ass?" <br /> <br /> And the late Redd Foxx does not leave a great swan song here. He has a little back and forth with Resse, which could have been a great thing. No Murphy loses another opportunity here again. <br /> <br /> Murphy's Quick is charismatic and pleasant. But those moments are few and safe with each other. Murphy has never looked better and has never been more boring. His character made me laugh twice throughout the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Stan Shaw's boxer with a horrible speech impediment is not only painful and embarrassing, it's annoying. There is more to comedy than simply showing something unpleasant. You have to incorporate some kind of light touch and funny situation. Seeing him tense even some of the easier words simply makes us feel bad for him and annoys us with Murphy. <br /> <br /> Can Murphy write a script? All right?? There was "Raw", but that was really a standing material. He wrote the outline for "Boomerang" and "Coming to America" ​​for sure. But she did not have the last word there. Maybe a team of ER-style doctors could have revived this. <br /> <br /> Murphy's address is so slow and silent that you would swear he was asleep at the wheel part of the time. He has too many static shots and he does not seem to know how to build and release suspense. At some level, I think Quick is the real Eddie Murphy. Angry, young, sensible and ambitious. But occasionally charming. Now, if it was just fun at some point. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which Murphy has a female bedtime story that plans to make love to him and kill him. You can probably guess how it works. Like everything else in the movie, this could have been better, but ?? <br /> <br /> "Surprisingly", Murphy has not directed another film since (he won a Razzie nomination). And he does not write the final draft for his films anymore (THE Razzie WON by writing this!) <br /> <br /> It's great to see and the music is beautiful, and there are some really beautiful scenes. But that only falls under the category of "gems among all the garbage." They are not enough. <br /> <br /> It could have been. It should have been. I was not Oh, good. <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
