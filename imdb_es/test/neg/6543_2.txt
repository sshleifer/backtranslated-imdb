Although the film looks pretty elegant for an indie made with a very low budget, it's not for that that I go to the cinema. There was not a single character that seemed sympathetic to me, they all seemed like absolute losers. Everything they try ends badly, it's too desperate for me. The reviews refer to the Puffy Chair as a black comedy ... comedy? Brother Rhett behaves like a fugitive from an institution. When Josh talks to his friend Emily about his brother, he almost insinuates that Rhett does not play with a full deck. However, Josh makes a "wedding" for Rhett and a woman that Rhett met a few hours before. There were some interesting performances of some of the characters found on the road. However, for me the most telling thing was that people were coming out of the movie ... and I saw it in a free projection.
