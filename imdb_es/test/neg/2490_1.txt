I did a screen test and read the script for this turkey in 1988. It was horrible at the time, and what's worse, I discovered it on VHS in the local HollowWood video and said, "Oh, what the heck, for a long time" . Yech. <br /> <br /> They had to shoot most of it in Mexico after they ran out of money, a couple of "stars" threw bitches because they ran out of some kind of exotic fruit drink crap. The plot of the movie is fine, I suppose, but I am certain that the writer intended it to have a spying wire everywhere. <br /> <br /> Dr. O ended up being a cartoon character. He must still be turning in his grave on the Kremlin Wall. <br /> <br /> The technical errors were in the whole movie, not only with children's atomic technology but with uniforms, badges and military jargon. They were too cheap to hire a professional military adviser, of course. Even the august and expert presence of Mr. Newman could not have saved this bird from being stuffed for Thanksgiving.
