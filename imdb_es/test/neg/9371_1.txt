Tru Calling was good, but it could have been great. The concept was intriguing and allowed very strange and terrifying story lines that could have been explored in the future. Unfortunately, the writing and an actor disappointed the audience. <br /> <br /> The writing was not so bad, but there were holes. In episode 13, "Drop Dead Gorgeous", an incredibly toxic poison was supposedly used to kill the victim. This was so toxic and dead so quickly that the victim did not have time to run or even scream for help. However, there was no plausible explanation for how the killer got such a powerful poison. <br /> <br /> In episode 15, "The Getaway", the officer who was not on duty responded unrealistically. In the second scene of the diner, he (meekly) tells the thief to release the gun and when she does not follow the order, and in fact turns the gun in his direction, allows it to turn into a confrontation and then turns into a hostage. situation? the same situation that had warned him. Your answer should (should) have been to shoot the thief when she could not follow your order and when you gave her the gun. There are other flaws in the stories but I leave you with these two examples. Despite the mistakes in the writing, I liked the program. <br /> <br /> The other problem I had was that I simply could not accept Eliza Dushku on this roll. In my opinion, she is too inexperienced and light to carry this part. She never walked anywhere, she went; and all too often he stopped abruptly at his mark. <br /> <br /> It also lacked any really emotional facial expression or intonation. She has a thoughtful look or a pretty smile; rarely are other apparent emotions. When he tries to look dramatic, he begins his line by looking the other way and "then" turns his eyes to his fellow actor. Or alternatively, she starts her line looking at her opposite and then looks away. Both are annoying when they are made as a replacement for true emotion. An example of his lack of intonation is found in episode 20, "Two Weddings and a Funeral," during his second wedding speech lacking emotion (for example, hearts in our hearts). <br /> <br /> I liked everything. The other actors in their respective parts and all were credible. With improved writing and a change of leadership, Tru Calling could have done it.
