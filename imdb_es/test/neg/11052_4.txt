Fortunately, I have not seen this movie in a movie, big screen, only on a small video screen. I doubt that I could have sat through the movie in a movie theater and seen all the violence present in the movie. After seeing the first 30 minutes, I felt disappointed and curious. <br /> <br /> Disappointed by the difficult plot to follow, the screens barely comprehensible, the huge aggression, I still do not know why I had been shown that the Daesu (main character) was pulling out someone else's teeth, his beast was women and that he cut his tongue. And also curious, to see what the film will say as a conclusion, what is the final summary of all this brutality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although the film was not boring, I did not get any response to All this cruelty that I had to watch from the beginning to the end. In my opinion, if you want blood and you want to laugh, there's Kill Bill 1-2, if you want more meaningful blood, you can take any recent war movie, and if you want an Eastern movie, there are much better titles. out there. Then I will take the qualifications of the Cannes film festival with more caution, because although Oldboy received a lot of praise from the jury, he did not have much to say to me and he only had 4/10 on my scale. <br /> <br /> I am hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message.
