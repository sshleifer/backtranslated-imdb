OK I gave this one a three a three! It only deserves a star without questions. <br /> <br /> If you are going to watch the movie seriously and take it as a legitimate B-Horror movie, then you will get a star. But I think it's evident in the first few minutes of the movie what we're dealing with is a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> With this movie, I and the friend I was watching could have turned it off and put on something more "Hollywood", but instead, we decided to start this whole movie from start to finish. We laughed so many times that it was almost like I was watching a comedy. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible ... The effects and the sequences of the death are so bad ... The whole history shit ... ... <br /> <br /> But the fact that they are trying to make a serious horror movie ... No price! <br /> <br /> The most memorable part for me is when two of the characters are walking through a so-called "dark basement" that is clearly illuminated, and pretending not to be able to see the bones hanging from the bahahahaha ceiling, just terrible ... <br /> <br /> So if you want to laugh at How horrible this movie is, along with the fact that it was made in 2004 to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> Wait, Why do I write so much? Nobody knows about this movie ... I doubt anyone even read this hahaha.
