Obviously, this was a production with a fairly low budget, but the cast was pretty decent, the basic premise was promising and something else could have been done, but the script was not so good. The plot is incoherent and seems almost random. times and dialogue is forced and terrible. <br /> <br /> Basically, the father of a girl is beaten by her gang members, and then she becomes a thief, and wants revenge for his death, and then goes into a mafia protection. Racket that involves corrupt politicians. <br /> <br /> Alan Ladd has a good reputation, but he really has a very small role. <br /> <br /> I must say that I found it somewhat entertaining in its archaic B-grade Hokiness but it really is of poor quality and pathetic.
