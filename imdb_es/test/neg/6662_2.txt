I understand the drawing and the appeal of such a different type of film and I am a great admirer of films with little dialogue, but anyway, this one is absolutely terrible. I have been in the highlands of Scotland and I found the lack of Scottish accents in the disappointing characters. This plot was strong enough in theory, but the cheap sets and the lack of a single realistic character prevented this movie from taking off. I feel that the use of silence to create an atmosphere only works when you have actors who can emit some kind of presence without speaking and these actors certainly can not. If you want a silent movie that captures that test presence (Le Dernier Combat). There have been very few movies that I could not even finish and this was one of them. Absolute dribble!
