"Tokyo Eyes" talks about a 17-year-old Japanese girl who falls in love with a man who is hunted by his older brother, who is a policeman. This lame movie is about 50% filler and 50% talk, talk and more talk. You can see less of the stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus, talk and play video games, talk and cut their hair, talk and walk and walk and talk, talk on cell phones, hang out and talk. etc. while you read the subtitles waiting for something to happen. The faint trace of a story is not enough to back a film with low production value, a meager cast, and no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama ... just incessant yadayadayada'ing.
