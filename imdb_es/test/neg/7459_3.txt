Before watching this movie, the 1998 version was my only experience of this Dickens story. I did not like that movie very much, but this 1974 adaptation advances in a particularly tedious way. <br /> <br /> The actors do not shine, the main couple Michael Williams and Sarah Sarah are especially wooden cases. The only character that really interested me was the smart jaggers of anthony quayle. <br /> <br /> The so-called plot is ridiculous, but the story itself is great. It's a real lesson about how your distorted values ​​and obsessive principles can destroy you. Live with an open mind and do not care what others say, you are what you are, if others can not stand it, change them. this was said at the beginning, but he did not listen. <br /> <br /> The girl adopted by the strange old woman reminded me a bit of the old story of kaspar hauser, not on that same horrible level, but in the way she molded the girl to create the executioner of her vendetta Personal against all the opposite sex that she thought had deceived her. PIP's childhood did not seem much better. The ending did not seem to fit with the rest of the story's style. the sets seemed cheap, and coming to imdb I'm not surprised to see that this was really a television movie (of which I had no idea when I borrowed it from the library). <br /> <br /> live and learn. So many good movies, so little time. That's why the comments are here. so YOU ​​do not have to waste your time on these types of movies. <br /> <br /> 3/10
