Although to some extent it hurts me to bother to baptize the panel of comments of this new series, mainly because I would hate to give the false impression that there is actually something similar to the public interest, I feel compelled to participate. My chips in this. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I have never before felt so convinced to encourage the quick and ruthless cancellation of a television program based solely on the merit of its promotional ads. And, in case you're wondering, I'm a guy. <br /> <br /> Listen, Comedy Network: although your existing original programming is already, let's say politely, of a 'questionable' quality (I look at you, "Girls will be girls", you've really outdone yourself in this case). Whoever is in green, could not be further from what is right now. <br /> <br /> The best of luck.
