This morning, I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. I found myself thinking: "Oh, yes, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, right?" This is more surprising because I remember having followed the controversy surrounding this movie (the group of the defense of the visually impaired said that this film was degrading). I even went to see this movie the day it was released, because I'm a fan of both Mr. Magoo and Mr. Nielson, and I thought it would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo. I even remember the initial animated credits, because I thought they were pretty funny. <br /> <br /> After that, everything is blank. I think it's a pretty sad statement about any movie that is so boring, so bland and so completely without merit that you can not remember anything about it. I understand that Leslie Nielson is not always known for appearing in first class comedies, but I saw her in "Spy Hard", in "Scary Movie 4" and "Police Squad 3", and none of these were great movies, but it was at least remembering * something *. Mr. Magoo, however, is completely blank. <br /> <br /> Now I wonder if all the controversy surrounding the film was not really generated by the studio that produced it, in the hope of generating at least a small amount of interest in a film otherwise entirely worthless.
