This is a strange movie. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but it is full of sexual innuendos. The whole premise is quite absurd, not only the idea that some reduced heads of three dead children fight against crime, but the same says that children who face a gang of older types are a little exaggerated, but, of new, parents Most of the time they are absent from the film and lack authority figures to keep children online. <br /> <br /> Although the cast is good, Meg Foster plays a leader very similar to the mafia, with the handsome AJ Damato as the leader of the thugs. Aerky Egan and Rebecca Herbst are chosen as young lovers, although for a comedic actress of her talent, Leigh Allyn Baker is notoriously wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is unusual, but I do not think it is enough to compensate for poor quality and clumsy execution. The landscape is pretty boring and the "special effects" are pretty grim. Sit, unless you're in the mood.
