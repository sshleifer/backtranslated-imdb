This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my life. What were you thinking? Stop preaching to me now! That's why all of us see Walker Texas Ranger and we do not admit it to our friends. Terrible acting and an extremely false plot. As the film unfolds, the story stops and the actors begin to preach to the audience. The director somehow believed that the two were close together. It looked like shit! When I saw the title in my local box office hits, I found it interesting. They should have warned him that he was religious instead of the false announcement of an action / adventure. The first time in a long time I stopped a movie and I could not tolerate finishing it.
