As a true lover of the film, I must advise you to avoid this atrocious effort. God knows how the funding was approved. Seriously, this is a cinematic experience that offers zero dramatic tensions and until nothing happens again and again and again Connectivity is two fears that at least keep you awake Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen and the protagonist's performance female is on the verge of criminal intent. A blessing with modern technology can advance and see it 12 times and it will only last 25 minutes, and nothing of the plot will be lost <br /> <br /> I have no idea how people find this at all Interesting and some are giving high marks!
