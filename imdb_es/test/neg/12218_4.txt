The real problem with this story is that there is not much history in the story. There is almost no plot to talk about. Widower buys an electric grandmother for her children. A child resists the electric grandmother. Then finally he accepts it. Then the children grow up and the grandmother leaves. Really, very little happens. It is much more a premise than a story. <br /> <br /> Also, take it all away, and you have a story that I had done before, and better: The Lonely. The same basic idea: the person initially can not accept the love of a robot, because it is only a machine, then, finally, yields and comes to love the robot. The biggest difference is that The Lonely is much more powerful, since both the protagonist and we, the audience, suddenly surprise us back to reality and we are forced to remember that, in the end, the robot is just a mechanism. <br /> <br /> I also find the story very flawed in the sense that the electric grandmother is * also * perfect. She is not only "human", she is superhuman. She is * wiser * than a real person, has no trace of mechanics at all, and makes the marbles appear out of nowhere. Frankly, it's really irritating to think it's a machine.
