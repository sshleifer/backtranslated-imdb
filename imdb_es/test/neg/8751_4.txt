While guessing through the water, a young psychic named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) encounters something else. She discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries on her aunt's ranch. Instead of the treasure that his aunt waits for, the chest contains the head of Gideon Drew, a devil worshiper who was beheaded by Sir Francis Drake. By telepathically controlling the contracted hand that opened the chest, does Drew's head go in search of the rest of his body? Also buried in the farm of Jessica's aunt. While Jessica is sure she feels the presence of evil, can she stop Drew's plans and arrive on time to prevent her from recovering? <br /> <br /> I thought I was quite familiar with most of Universal's horror production before 1960, but this is a Universal movie of the 50s that certainly receives little mention. While The Thing That Could not Die is not what I would call a "good" movie, it does have some things in its favor. First, the film has some interesting ideas and it's actually quite ambitious. The director Will Cowan, either by luck or by intention, can give the film a pleasant atmosphere from time to time. And, the special effects that involve the head are certainly creepy. But the whole project is undone by the performance. I am surprised to know that any of the supposed "actors" in this case ever appeared in something else. You would think that this was a kind of "unique and made" movie for most of those involved. Kearney is the worst offender. She is horrible. Besides, the thing that could not die may have been too ambitious for its own sake. Given the budget and other limitations, there was no way the film could aspire to its higher ideas. Finally, the film ends abruptly. Just when things start to get interesting, The End. What is that about?
