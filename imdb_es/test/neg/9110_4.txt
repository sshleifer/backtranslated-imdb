A little beyond what is usually direct to the action video, Airborne has enough in the tank to keep it running for the full 90 minutes, although he can not stop thinking about how low of the 80's comedy the golden boy Steve Guttenburg has been inclined to be in such a cheap production (and touching a tough guy too!). The plot is simple, the bad guys have stolen a deadly virus and Guttenburg and the rest of his friends are sent to retrieve it, not bad of its kind but not in the same league (obviously) as the films that are also compared on the cover as AIR FORCE ONE and CON AIR. However, the cast is good, with Sean Bean picking up his character from Brit.-Bad guy, which we've seen at box office events like GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES.
