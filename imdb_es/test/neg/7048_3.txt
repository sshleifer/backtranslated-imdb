My wife and I watched this movie because we plan to visit Sicily and Stromboli soon. Fortunately (or unfortunately) the marine and marine landscape (complete with tuna) are the only credible members of this cast. We expected a reasonable movie, well written and well acted, but disappointed. His only redeeming grace is an extensive and remarkable fishing sequence, full of authenticity: hitting tuna, nets, wooden boats with long oars and passionate, although superstitious fishermen. forced, and the performance varies from rigid to completely "over the top". A scene, in which Bergman emphasizes that her male husband, native and naive manipulates his ferret in an "innocent" rabbit (but apparently already deceased) would be perfect for a sketch of Monty Python. <br /> <br /> When the volcano exploded and we were waiting for a merciful end to the suffering (ours and the molds). Unfortunately, the film continues to shake, finally reaching a melodramatic and absurd ending. Unless you're really interested in fishing for the tuna of yesteryear, this great effort passes.
