We rent the movie and it may be the worst movie in history. The box they had in the video store had a cool-looking monster on the cover, but in reality the monster was a creature in the mask of the black lagoon. Horrible, frightening, frightening ... you may have to rent it, it's so bad. It feels like you're watching a homemade bizzare-o movie.
