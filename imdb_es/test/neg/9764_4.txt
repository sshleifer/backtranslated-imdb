Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one must sit and enjoy the landscape. Located on a "remote Greek island", it stars Michael Caine, a very tense teacher who works in a school for children who get involved in mental games with local crazy and mysterious man Anthony Quinn and his girlfriend Daffy Candice Bergen. Quinn, who looks like Pablo Picasso with his white hair and striped sailor shirt, is pretty good, but Caine seems ready to explode. Bergen, although impressive, should never put a British accent. She is not very good at that kind of thing. The direction of Guy Green is fine, but unless you have infinite patience with the circular logic of the movie, you will not enjoy it. A really bitter note is the casting of effervescent Anna Karina in the completely sad role of Caine's girlfriend. After seeing her as A WOMAN IS A WOMAN AND A BAND APART, her presence here is quite disturbing.
