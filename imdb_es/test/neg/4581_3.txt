Living in Edinburgh, and I have a great thirst for history, I felt very discouraged by the "freedoms" taken. Wrong dog breed to start !! The owner of Bobbys, Old Jock, was a single old man, who came to Edinburgh and died as a homeless, not as in the movie. For anyone who comes to Edinburgh and wants to see the sights of the film, you will not find the cemetery in Princes St Gardens! There were a few moments where a handkerchief would have been great. The actors were fantastic in filling out a rather flimsy script. I do not feel that poor Bobby has had enough screen time, possibly because he "lost" at some point. All told, the movie was good and any 8 year old will enjoy it.
