I go to a blockbuster, I choose a movie at random, I got this, and yes. <br /> <br /> This ... it was a good sexual porn ... the quality was a bit sucked, and it gave me a fuck. headache. For me, this movie was good for their sexual things, but not so much for horror and suspense. It was ... magical ... <br /> <br /> The suspense ... is not as good as I would have expected. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat hoping to jump out of fear, but instead I lay on the couch and did not see much. <br /> <br /> The quality ... is not really good at all. I mean, if you pay close attention, when people are in the COLD mountains, they hardly carry anything. It does not make much sense either. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for shit, not really suspense, and a pretty sexual movie, you have this.
