On the positive side, I'll say it's nice enough to be seen. On the negative side, it is insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. Long, querulous and meaningless. And I'm not saying that this is bad, I really wanted to like this movie, it seemed to have everything in its favor, it had the so-called "buzz", and it was also a nuisance to find it. Having put a little more effort on the side of the story, I think this would have been amazing. And I hope that the team behind it will produce a wonderful job in the future, clearly have the ability. But I recommend waiting for your future efforts, let it go.
