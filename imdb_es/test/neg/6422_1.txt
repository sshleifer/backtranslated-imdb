If you see this movie in the TV listings, simply ignore it. If you're looking for something that scares you, you'd better watch the replays of the X-Files. <br /> <br /> The previous comments that refer to the incredibly poor performance of the female lead are dead. She is almost unappealable. The total sum of your rank includes "whiny and scared" and "whiny and not scared". <br /> <br /> I'm the kind of movie buff who enjoys a good "bad" movie. But this is ridiculous. There is no address. The plot is as simplistic as the set of numbers that keep throwing you and like that set of numbers, in the end it has no meaning. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent if you turn off Turn off the TV and give your dog a bath.
