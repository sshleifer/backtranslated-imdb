I do not know any cliche of rock and roll that is not used in this movie. Ouffcourz, rock is inscribed in life is only sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels that try to travel with you. Tell the stupid youth. The filmmakers seemed to have read too many stories of Guns'n'Roses or Motley Crue. I've seen the daily life of the usual rock band up close and there's nothing to do with reality in this movie. If you have enough success, your life is on tour. This means that you are mostly on a bus and trying to sleep. Just sleep. Because you must be cool, sober and clean in the afternoons. After living you have a little time to download your emotion on stage. Then you have a little time to have fun. But it is no luxury or dream. Artistically this movie was zero. Stupid characters and idiotic dialogues. The end of the movie was fun: the main character left the heavy metal band and formed a grunge band. Yes, what moral. Real 90s
