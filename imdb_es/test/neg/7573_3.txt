This movie makes me seriously doubt if Armando de Ossorio was a good filmmaker or not ... His BLIND DEAD films are praised by many fans. I can understand this. But I want to be a trite gothic vampire as MALENKA does not show any sign of a gifted filmmaker. And that also goes for SEA SERPENT. It presents a horrible performance, a stupid argument, stupid events, many other things that you can expect from a bad monster movie and also from veteran actor Ray Milland, who does everything possible to mumble his way through this movie while not having much . clue about what he is doing in it. Apparently, Milland was already very ill while filming SERPIENTE DE MAR (his last theatrical feature film) and when he left with a stinking ridiculous like this, it makes him even sadder. A final appearance with Peter Cushing in a film made for television directed by Roy Ward Baker (also in 1984) does not change much about it. <br /> <br /> But the puppet of sock / sea snake is a real problem. contemplate. Watch him turn a lighthouse and crush it. See him destroy a port with miniature ships. Watch him tear down bridges and chew on enchanting miniature trains. <br /> <br /> Good evil? Yes. 3/10 and 7/10
