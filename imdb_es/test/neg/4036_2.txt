I had the terrible misfortune of having to watch this "movie b" in its entirety. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that --- it saves time and money !! This has to be the worst b-movie of all time, it should not even be called b-movie, more like a f-movie! Because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie: the story is not interesting at all, all the actors are very thin and not at all credible, they have bad direction and the action sequences are so false that it's almost funny. ..... almost. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of shitty phrases that no respectable person could find amusing in the least. <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to be oriented towards men, but all the women in it are SO unattractive, especially that wrinkled thing that comes towards the end. They try to look sexy in those strange and horrible costumes and fail miserably! <br /> <br /> Even some of the most ridiculous b movies will still make you laugh, but this is too painful to watch. !!
