Having endured this movie last night, I turned off the DVD player with the feeling of deserving a medal for having the energy to get to the end. Throughout the movie I felt I was watching the fillings of the story you get in a high budget porn movie. the performance was rigid and tense, the camera work was lousy, and the locations and settings were so poor that it felt as if they had been borrowed from the local high school "Amateur Dramatic's Society". <br /> <br /> The only salvation for this movie was that it had Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris in their credits, other than that it was pure dribble.
