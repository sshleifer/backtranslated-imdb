This is a title in search of a movie. It's a tone that sounded lucrative for some studio executive and the rest, damn it. When this movie was made there were still two things that CGI did not do at all well: people and skin. Hairy people, therefore, were not meant to look good when they were rendered by computer. This is the only example that occurs to me in which the effects of a well-financed sequel took a giant leap behind those of the original film. For the record, the werewolf design does not help a bit. The filmmakers apparently could not decide between quadrupeds and bipeds, tried to do both and ended up with a creature that looks equally clumsy in both senses. The transformations are anatomically meaningless and the final result with a relatively high forehead and a short snout looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But let's go back to the gross part. This is a movie that exists PURE to take advantage of its predecessor. I'm not a fan of Landis' original movie, but does it look good in light of this? If you thought that some of Landis's humor was forced, try some of the unbearable attempts here. The chewing gum scene, the humor of the corpse, the dog that ... you know, you'll just have to take care of yourself a little. Thomas Everett Scott is on holiday in Europe with friends and decides to take a break from acting like "Ugly American" and jumping in bungee from the Eifel Tower in the middle of the night. This brings him to rescue a young woman (Delpy - Julie is not worth it just to become a star in the US Ask Rutger Hauer to jump to his death.) It turns out to be part of a cult of werewolves that are conspiring for ... I'm not sure, something bad ... Frightful French stereotypes, huge holes in the plot, a confused end ... It did not matter, the studio only cared that the title could fool millions of fans of the "American werewolf in London" so they give their money in. For the most part, I'm glad to say they were wrong.
