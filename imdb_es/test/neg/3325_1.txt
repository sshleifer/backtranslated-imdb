This movie was basically prepared for failure by the studio. One, Anne Rice (author of the book) offered to write the screen game, but the studio rejected it. Two, they tried to put 2 novels in depth in a 2 hour movie. <br /> <br /> I keep the only way that these two books, Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, work on a live action form Being through a miniseries. First, the Vampire Lestat only takes place from 1700 to 1980 and has a lot of characters vital to the understanding of the plot of the main character, Lestat. The complete book Vampire Lestat organizes the events of the second part Queen of the Damned. Without that total understanding, the premise of a movie is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Lestat was not cruel and cruel to everyone, he did not want to follow Akasha's plans, Marius did not do to Lestat, Lestat did not love Jesse or did it, Lestat could not stay without suffering damage by light, Marius did not look for David or the other way around, all the characters were completely misrepresented, basically the same story of the same names. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. Even if you wanted to inspire yourself in these novels, fine. But do not go back into the cinemas of the success of the great novels and characters of Rice to destroy what his faithful readers have come to love. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the books, you will not. Really understand the movie, if you have read the books, you will be insulted. That said, I'm a big fan that I had to watch the movie knowing full well that this was going to be the case and still. Catch 22, you have to see it, you will hate it.
