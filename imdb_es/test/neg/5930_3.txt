This movie was good, in terms of movies. It could have been done as a cross in secular films. However, it had little to do with the Left Behind books on which it was supposedly based. The premises of the main story were removed and new premises of the main story were added. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me the most was how they portrayed Nicolae. He was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have at the moment in the books. The antichrist is not Satan, he is not omniscient or omnipotent. <br /> <br /> Faith and beliefs were represented in strange and surreal ways that seemed to make the movie silly. <br /> <br /> Non-believers who see this will have more ammunition to mock Christian beliefs.
