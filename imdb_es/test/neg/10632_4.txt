I would say that this is a movie in the background. Play in the background while tending to take care of work (laundry, email control, etc.). I thought this was a movie that was made before Amy Adams succeeded after Enchanted. Incorrect! It was made in 2009! The script / script is pretty horrible. I love the musicals, but the singing is quite normal and the plot does not advance. Ughh It almost seems like it's a film for television based on cinematography. I'm watching a TV show? <br /> <br /> Even the secretary starts singing. What f @ # $ is happening ?! Actually she seemed to have the best voice. Amy Adams was so great in Enchanted. The main actor is the average. Disappointed insurance. This movie would have been good for a lifetime, but that's it. :(
