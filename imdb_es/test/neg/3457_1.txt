The representation of the character of Ichabod Crane was terribly unpleasant, my wife and I expected the rider (or some other character) not only to cut off Crane's head, but to do it slowly and painfully. <br /> <br /> That is to say, this type of Brent Carver played it at the top, as if he were on Broadway. And he was such an implacable imbecile that we had no sympathy for him at all. <br /> <br /> I could continue with specific criticisms of how this movie failed, but I prefer not to devote the energy. <br /> <br /> Just skip it and go to the Johnny Depp version. Or that, or rent the enchanted pumpkin from Sleepy Hollow (animated). It's pretty good: entertaining for children and adults. <br /> <br /> Better yet, read the original story of Washington Irving.
