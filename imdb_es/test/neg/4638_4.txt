The First World War gets a bright and sepia-colored makeover in the implacable capricious "A very long commitment" of Jean-Pierre Jeunet. The characteristic style of Jeunet consists of a mechanical narrative construction, almost like a clock, adorned with luxurious values ​​of production of chocolate boxes and seasoned with a false humor. It's an approach that worked quite well with her earlier image, the romantic fantasy "Amelie," thanks in large part to the inimitable contribution of Audrey Tatou in the lead role. Applied to a much darker material, Jeunet's method fails a lot. <br /> <br /> Tatou reappears here in a variation of the same type of character sweetly out of place that Amelie. She is Mathilde, an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting, determined to trace what became her childhood love Manech (Gaspard Ulliel), several years after her disappearance in the War. Manech was one of five soldiers in a court martial by self-mutilation in 1917 in 'Bingo Crepuscule', and was sent to no man's land as punishment. He is presumed dead by all, except Mathilde, who appreciates the hope of finding him. The film follows Mathilde's persevering search to find out what really happened and, as she goes deeper, discovers a sad and even shocking story of corruption and high-level inhumanity. Mathilde must filter the facts of the fictions that arise from several conflicting, overlapping or incomplete accounts of what appear to be Manech's final hours. <br /> <br /> All this must be touching and moving, but often it is simply confusing thanks to the visual and verbal disorder with which Jeunet strikes his audience. It just happens too much at a given moment, including an intrusive narrative that adds nothing to our appreciation of the story and the characters. Without a moment of rest from the information overload, I felt that I was denied the space to reflect on the search for Mathilde or the room to engage with him on my own terms. Jeunet's tirelessly occupied camera spirals, rotates and rotates, caressing all the contours of the surface of his exquisitely designed production, but fails to penetrate the soul beneath the skin of history. The result is deeply involuntary and, what is worse, grotesque. The First World War was a particularly dark hour in the history of mankind. Imagine it recreated as one of those picturesque commercials for a well-known Belgian beer, and you have the measure of this film.
