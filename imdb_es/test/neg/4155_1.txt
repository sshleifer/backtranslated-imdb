If I guess your "word", will you let me pass? - asks William Geld, a Tim Robbins who continues to act as if he were told a fantastic joke and is trying not to laugh. <br /> <br /> He is trying to reach a forbidden area. The woman who stops him continues talking: -Your "word" is Carrefour. <br /> <br /> -How did you know? - asks the lady, surprised. He responds, in the name of Wisdom: -I was listening when you were not talking. : / <br /> <br /> Yes, this defines the movie. This is precisely It does not matter if Carrefour is a "combination of roads" in French, or if the future is coolly bureaucratic and mixes languages. Or if Samantha Morton has nothing, nothing of Spanish (with María González as it is called in the film) with her Irish or Scottish tone. <br /> <br /> It's boring and boring. If you fall into the belief that there are multiple symbolisms, you will buy the most extravagant and sickly love relationship in history, set in a future that could be in seven seconds. I can guess the word of this movie: it will be "painful".
