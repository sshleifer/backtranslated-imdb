I tried to watch this movie, but I did not spend the first 15 minutes. It's a terrible disappointment, considering the cast, but I can not see beyond the fact that the dialogue is in English and that some of the actors who pretend to be Indians are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering that only India has 1/6 of the world's population and one of the largest film industries, I do not think the filmmakers have had difficulty finding an excellent Indian actress to play the role. And I do not say this because of blind patriotism, but because it is absolute and totally absurd that a non-Indian plays the role of an Indian / Pakistani. Now, some people say 'as long as she convinces who cares' but my point is exactly that she is NOT convincing and can never be, not because of her acting skills, but because of her ethnicity. For example, no matter how good actor Tom Hanks is, he can never play an Australian aborigine! <br /> <br /> But that's even less for the biggest misstep the filmmakers did: have the dialogue in English. It totally destroys the mood, as well as any appearance of authenticity. If the same film had been made in native languages ​​(Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi) with English subtitles, this could have been an excellent movie. Unfortunately, as things stand, I would not recommend anyone to see it, other than film students who want to study "What not to do" in movies.
