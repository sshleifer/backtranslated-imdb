I hate, despise and hate this movie with a passion that makes the burning doors of hell seem cold in comparison. It is nothing more than a campy trip, terrifying and completely badly done by the path of memory to that unpleasant moment, the 70's, a decade, I'm glad I'm not part of this. Everything that was on offer! <br /> <br /> the animation is dated in a sickly way, among other things, it is sticky, it lacks frames and characters with huge and bulbous heads; This movie is a sore. From the knowledge, nodded to the parents with the monstrous gay seahorse, and their hand movements in the camp and the voice of Kenneth Williams-esque, to the openly addictive anthem, High Cockalorum, is a movie that I regret to say They imposed me as a child and I never fully recovered from the terror that caused me ... <br /> <br /> This frightful deployment of complete terror should carry an R qualification certificate, so it is disturbing. content!
