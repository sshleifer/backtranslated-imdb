So I rented this movie with the hope of learning about the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the beginning of its independence from the Belgian government. I was excited to get acquainted with the figures involved in his story, mainly Lumumba and Mobutu. I wanted to see how the new Congolese government tried to bring together the various groups that opposed the colonial government, the political motives behind each, the reasons behind Belgium's decision to grant independence to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and also how they were the United States and the former USSR. involved. Unfortunately, all my questions were largely unanswered. I think this movie was made by people who, through a passing familiarity with the history of the freedom struggle of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, saw a story full of drama and emotion, and decided to exploit it. Then they proceeded to try to put all the dramatic points in a story, filled them briefly with the dialogue, went to the set and filmed it. It could be wrong, but if so, it is all the saddest, because then the creators simply must have tied themselves too much to achieve everything, and ended up hiding all the details in an effort to create a global story. Whatever the reason, the fact is that the film could be a timeline of statements and facts printed in the sentence. The film goes through every important event and tells the viewer the main idea of ​​what is happening, completely softening the real details in favor of communicating the important things. For example, there is a scene in which Lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by Mobutu. In the situation, the soldiers have three possible points of view: one that sympathizes with Lumumba, one that vilifies Lumumba and another that is in the middle, sympathizing and obeying orders. Correspondingly, there are three soldiers who speak at the scene, pronouncing lines that show their views without frills. Then, to avoid dealing with the real tensions generated by these opposing points of view, the writers simply inserted some shots at random, more army types appear and end up hitting everyone. This is the scope of the reflectivity of the film. Most of the time, each character simply declares their basic motives, the others respond with theirs, and that's it. There is little to say through actions; Even the things they say are direct to pain. It is hard to believe that the people represented behaved that way. In addition, in the tendency of this openness, things like the political tension between factions are reduced to a simple recognition of the fact: we never learn what these factions are, why they fight, their power, basically anything, except that they exist. The characters are also one-dimensional and flat; unfortunately, I do not know if Lumumba was really a freedom fighter passionately dedicated to the ideals of Congolese unity, but after about an hour of the film, I certainly did not trust him to tell me. The DRC, like many developing countries, has a complicated and important history, especially in the period before and after independence. But the telling of these stories will not be useful unless the complexity of the situations is recognized. Lumumba does not pay due attention to these details and ends up saying little to the viewer, except the most general of the schemes.
