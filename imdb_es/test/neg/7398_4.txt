This is an incredibly standard western, which presents a bit of bad acting, a boring plot and a silly action. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem may be how incredibly formulated this movie is. It presents all the usual clich√©s, yes, even a bar fight and the movie really has no surprises. This makes it a boring and weak western to see, and not in the least because it is a bad one. <br /> <br /> It's obviously a small production and the film looks like it was shot in 30 days. The direction and the editing can be called bad and all the action sequences presented in the film are incredibly silly. It may almost become a bit funny to watch, for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> His story is not so interesting either. It is a very friendly western (and also bloodless), in which, for some strange reason, everyone seems to be against the Younger brothers, who in this film are being presented as good and very friendly guys. The story gets stupider as it heads towards its end. The younger brothers really existed and were part of the James-Younger gang, which also included the famous brothers Frank and Jesse James. Of course, they were not as kind in real life as the ones portrayed in this movie. It was customary that in the early years of the 1940s they had nice male characters. It was not really until the Spagethi-Western era that the main characters became real criminals in themselves. Oddly enough, the approach has always worked better than the first westerns in which the main character is on the good side of the law. colour. This was quite unique to a western from the 40s and still gives the movie something extra. However, you may wonder why they filmed this full-color western. The film is still made in the style of a western western black and white after all and I really believe that this film would have been a bit more credible had it been done in black and white instead. <br /> <br /> You could easily dispense with this western. <br /> <br /> 4/10
