This movie is like porn with all the good parts removed. It is like all the porn stars who did not want to fulfill their obligations grouped around this horrible, trite and useless piece of abstinence of gargoyles. <br /> <br /> This is a useful movie if you're in the mood. torturing a loved one (or no longer loved) It is important that, if you choose to use this movie as a method of torture, put earplugs and blindfold to keep you from going crazy. <br /> <br /> If I had a choice between this film and The 700 Club ... I would choose Girls Gone Wild. <br /> <br /> In general, better if you have been drinking. But only because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions.
