This movie was, unfortunately, terrible. <br /> <br /> Clich√©, threshing, dialogue and acting make it almost impossible to see. <br /> <br /> The end of feeling good is ridiculously lame. <br /> <br /> There is a reason why Judge Reinhold's career has disappeared. <br /> <br /> If you do not live in New York and you are not Jewish, several of the jokes will be inscrutable. <br /> <br /> It also seemed very insulting to me the need for the unrecognized lesbian daughter to be direct. <br /> <br /> I just can not understand how this movie was so popular at film festivals. <br /> <br /> It is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.
