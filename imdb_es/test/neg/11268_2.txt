If you're in the mood for a really bad porn without good porn combined with a really bad horror movie, this movie is perfect for you. However, if you breathe air, be sure to spend your time watching all this, except this. The acting is shit. The "plot" is crap. They try too hard, and all the time I was waiting for the only good scene that could make it worth watching the movie. No Stay with the cable scrambled.
