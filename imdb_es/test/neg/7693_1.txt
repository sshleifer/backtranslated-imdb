This film as the first KSA movie must be active for its people and show it the good. Otherwise, we see in this that the cast of Rotana wants to show people of religion in Saudi Arabia as terrorists and stupid, in fact they are not very peaceful and intelligent. About the director is not even less good. The grandfather in the film is very young that the father, everyone notices it. And, by the way, girls who are not Saudi show our girls as pitchers looking for men to meet their needs. Hasham was just another part of the furniture in the act, he did nothing to imagine only when he told his lover I love you and he shouted to his friend not to talk to strange girls >>>>>>> really funny or really stupid <br /> <br /> The Father did not move, he just set up his scenes and he saw this movie as non-cast and the only word that said "A5zo Al Shai6an". The strange thing in this movie is when the girls settled in the restaurant by the family, a voice behind the young man talks to his girlfriends "kiss me" many times >>>>> Did that happen in Saudi Arabia when the girls and Children grow well and Muslim no bitches and adulterer. Any Saudi has a patriot in his heart that will not allow to see this stupid movie.
