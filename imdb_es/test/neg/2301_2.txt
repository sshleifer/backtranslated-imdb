This movie is the last straw in a list of movies I've seen this week that have pushed me to the limit and forced me to join IMDb and broadcast a warning to the public. It was absolutely horrible. The film was drawn and painfully boring. The sound, the effects and even the quality of the image seemed to come from Willow (1988) or even from Conan the Barbarian (1982). The Battle of Bannockburn was absolutely absurd. This "greatest medieval battle reconstruction ever made in the British Isles" made me laugh. There was not even a coherent formation, only a few guys with spears and horses running through them. The scenes of Douglas, especially in the last battle, were simply horrible, as was most of the acting in the film.
