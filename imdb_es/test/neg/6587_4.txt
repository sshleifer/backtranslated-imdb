The other day I borrowed this on a friend's DVD. I really did not know what to expect. I have not seen many Russian films, and I think I've never seen a Russian war movie. Maybe that made me expect something different, something more like an imagined Russian mentality. But, regardless of expectations, they were embarrassed, as this is a fairly common war movie. <br /> <br /> The whole formula of following some young people from their recruitment, through training, deployment and some Battles, is well known. We have seen it done many years ago, as well as more recently (as with Jarhead). Sure, there is a difference here because the film is about Russian soldiers instead of Americans, as is almost always the case. But overall, this could easily have been a Vietnam movie. I guess that just underscores my feeling that Afghanistan was the Soviet Union Vietnam. A country that should have been a push for a superpower caused the war to go on for years with a terrible loss of life for both soldiers and civilians. <br /> <br /> The positive points of this film seemed to me good photographs are some beautiful environment shots) and decent effects for what I suppose must have been a low budget movie. What disappointed me is mostly the story itself. It just does not stir any emotion in me. Especially since the development of the character is terrible. And to really feel something when people are killed, you have to make people, not just cardboard cutouts without a face. They can not do that in this movie. It's also too long, and that seems to be a trend lately. In my opinion, a film that is more than two hours long should have a lot to offer, and this movie does not cut it. There is also a disturbing music that gets like a wet blanket in every scene. Especially in the action scenes, this is highly disturbing, not that you need action music but something more than a slow keyboard music would be nice. Otherwise, the production values ​​were good enough, that was not the problem. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to watch this movie. As a reminder of the fact that no matter where you are, does the war stink? That the Russian filmmakers have already seen too many American war films to do something original? Regardless of which, this film is rather a cliché, lacks spirit and, although it has acceptable technical qualities, it lacks script and character development. In the end, it only becomes another of all those war movies that does not make you think and does not add anything to the genre. I have seen much worse, but also much better. I rate this 4/10.
