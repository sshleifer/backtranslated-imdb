I'm usually a big fan of Pacino (Scarface, Serpico, defender of the Demons) but since he smells like a woman, he almost plays the same role and screams a lot. This movie had no endearing characters to warm up. Brandon, played by Bongo McConnahey, is the least sympathetic of all. He did not even approach a real human being. Pacino was irremediably unpleasant and, for God's sake, how old is Renee Russo? The only high light of this unfortunate disaster was the hot whore with the perfect lipstick and has about 10 lines in total. Even the generally reliable Jeremy Piven was totally unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Note for movie writers, they usually do not work unless one of the main characters is at least a little bit nice (notorious Scarface exception). When the movie closes and old Brandon is at the airport, my only thought was to let a plane crash at the airport and kill Brandon.
