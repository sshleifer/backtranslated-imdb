I picked up the American premiere of this at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was more than disappointed. From the mood of the public, I was not the only one. <br /> <br /> The film takes a long time to reach the conflict and then refuses to solve it, opting instead to tell us that the story is "Continue". Is it a spoiler to reveal that a movie has no ending? I consider it more a warning. This is, in the best of cases, only half of a movie, and not the good part.
