Last night I sat down to watch this movie on Greek television because of the upcoming Olympic Games organized by my city. Knowing that it is an American movie, I already expected him to focus more on the history of American athletes. ready for that. But what I saw was ... too much! I mean, when a film has that title ("First Olympics: Athens 1896"), even being of American origin, you would not expect it to be so propagandistic and, at the same time, ignorant of the athletes and efforts of other countries. American athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature (strength, intelligence, generosity, kindness, courtesy ...), in contrast to their "sin sinners" in the Games, who seem to be incapable of even ... expressing their thoughts or express feelings. The number of times the American anthem is played during the film should be a historical record in filmography. The best of megalomania! It even uses fictional facts that ridicule the Greek nation, such as the Greek citizens who serve marathon foreign athletes with wine, to help nationals win the race. A lot for the Olympic spirit. <br /> <br /> Think about it. Being a Greek and putting a bad mark on a film whose title is also Greek is something that does not make me happy at all. According to what I have seen, I can not give more than 4 out of 10 (being quite generous actually).
