Yes it's correct. If I asked my friends this question: "What is the worst movie you've seen?" They may respond to something like "Armageddon" (can you drill the hole?!?), "Shriek", "Plan Nine From Outer Space", "The Medallion", "Scooby Doo", etc. offended by this to think he has seen something that could be in the same department of human fertilizer produced naturally in this film is. If the worst movie you can think of is, let's say so badly that it really bothers you; then you do not know anything, friend. <br /> <br /> Six crazy people ... I remember the day when a friend of mine went to the local video store to rent a movie. The two of us had already gone through most of the movies there, and in the "new movies" on the shelf, we see him staring at us. "Wow, there are some good actors here, man, it says something about the mafia, let's just do it and get out of here." This was undoubtedly the worst mistake of the movie in my movie love life. It was also the worst mistake for everyone else: movie lover or not. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as fun as looking at a glass of ice water (or iced tea ...) until room temperature arrives. Watching this movie will make you dream of an eternal dream of death, if death is only a dull light and nothing, and then you realize that you are simply watching your TV monitor. Without looking In reality you are paying so much attention that it is humanly possible. This is not a joke. <br /> <br /> This movie is the perfection of making a bad movie. It's not the kind of evil you can see, point out and laugh, it's the kind of movie that's so bad that you do not really have a chance to get out of your memory. Unless you might use electric shock therapy to cleanse the brain. ... ... (Hey! That could be something like how I remember myself and my friend after seeing him ...) <br /> <br /> Best regards to you, Albert Pyun. <br /> <br /> -Joergen
