I liked the Takashi Miike movies that I had seen so far, but I found this quite disappointing. I bought it, but I will not keep it. <br /> <br /> I saw it on the Adness DVD, which has only two episodes. In the first, a murderer kidnaps women, cuts the top of the skull to expose the brain, plants them in the ground to the chin and plants a flower in the brain. You can say that from the DVD box. In the movie, the top of the head is digitally blurred by static TV. If he had not seen the DVD box, the viewer would not know what the people were looking at until later a young policeman produced a small model of the body. Interestingly, there is also a flash frame later in the woman's head and it is not censored. Apart from this, I'm not quite sure what was going on. Some women receive phone calls, and when an animated and schematic character appears, it appears. An animated character also appears on television screens at times. It is not clear if anyone sees it. <br /> <br /> In the second episode, pregnant women are cut off and their babies disappear. Once again, a police officer produces a model of what corpses are like, which is useful since once again the real body is censored. There is also a natural birth in the film, but curiously, even that baby and the umbilical cord are censored! According to the DVD box, uncensored versions were not saved when it was originally made. Maybe even if they had, if they knew they were going to be censored, maybe they did not bother to show anything ...? I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> If I hear that later episodes are better, I might look for them. As it is, I will not bother.
