Recently released on DVD in the United States; just stay away from this. <br /> <br /> Usually, I give enough space for stupidity in horror movies; I'll settle for almost anything remotely suspenseful, supernatural, spooky, or even just a vaguely interesting concept. This just sucked. I knew there were problems when Sara's "best friend" in college, who had a considerable screen time, did not even appear in the IMDb credits! I was not surprised not to recognize any actor, but that character ("Daysha" or "Day-Glo" or whatever it is called) apparently did not even exist. <br /> <br /> I am so embarrassed that I paid a rental fee for this garbage; deeply ashamed ...
