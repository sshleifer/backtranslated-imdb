Without the slightest doubt, this is and probably will always be the worst movie I've had the misfortune to see all my life. Take 5 wooden actors who were expelled from the acting school because they were so wooden that someone sat on them thinking they were a bank. <br /> <br /> Then add a cheap camcorder. You know the old types of VHS that cost Â£ 20 on eBay. Add a terrible story without effects and yes, you have this movie. How shocking it was. They could not even save him having a fit girl. It was fat and ugly and it was the worst of all. In fact, I saw everything, since I could not believe that this shit had been financed. <br /> <br /> MISSING ALL COSTS
