This is, by far, the most pathetic film that Indian cinema or any other film has created. It's totally a piece of shit. The story does not contain water. It is shameful that such a respectful actor has bent so low to make such a shameful film. The little respect I had is lost forever. He should have retired a long time ago instead of making a fool of himself and losing all self respect. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Also, I suggest that Amitabh should retire now. I wonder how IMDb has given some recommendations for this movie. There are no movies so horrible that recommendations can be made. Watching movies like Devdas in the same line as this movie is a serious injustice for a decent movie. It is in general, I could say cheeky.
