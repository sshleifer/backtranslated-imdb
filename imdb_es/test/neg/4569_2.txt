In general, I'm not a big fan of high school comedies, they depend a lot on humor and bad taste, and rarely get away from plot lines and characters and boring dialogue. However, I have had my share of guilty pleasures, particularly when I was still in high school. Seeing the figures of the masters so recognizable that they kicked their butts always encouraged me and an occasional laugh could also be the case. These movies only work if at least one of the characters is friendly instantly, this was not the case in 'Tricks', especially the protagonist. Of course, it did not help that the actor at play was one of the most irritating, untalented and arrogant children I've seen in a comedy. <br /> <br /> Acting in a comedy is no joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery must be correct or the material is wasted. In this case, there were not many good things to start with and the jokes that were half funny were professionally fucked by the cast. <br /> <br /> This movie lasted 3 hours, the director never knew the rhythm. obviously. Get away from this, there are many other funny comedies for teens like 10 Things I Hate About You, Who's Your Daddy and Superbad.
