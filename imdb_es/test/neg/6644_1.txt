To this day, I've never seen Elizabeth Shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie. Of bad acting, poorly planned and racially Neanderthal, took place in Chicago, where apparently all black people lived in a blues club. . Spoiler ahead. . . . . .. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: His "blues" solo was even more painful to watch than his clueless performance and the introduction to it: "No one leaves without singing the blues", he was as foolish as a post . The children whose character looked after children were unbearable and long before the film was over, I was wishing that something horrible happened to everyone. <br /> <br /> However, I must say that there is one special thing in this movie; A movie costs me a lot to offend me, but this hot piece of gut did what Chopper, The Phantom Menace and Catwoman could not: get sick to my stomach.
