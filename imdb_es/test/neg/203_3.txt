Armored <br /> <br /> The best thing about driving an armored vehicle is that if some vagabond approaches you at a red light to ask for money, you can shoot him in the face. <br /> <br /> And while the armored guards in this thriller are not using their protective power to purge the vagrant population, they are using their position to strip their employer. <br /> <br /> When the newcomer Ty (Columbus Short) gets a job with an armored Trunk Company, he feels he has found his lot in life. Unfortunately, however, when he discovers that his co-workers (Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Laurence Fishburne) are planning to take the $ 42M shipment for themselves, should Ty be strengthened? and the funds ?? inside the armored truck. <br /> <br /> A tedious career with a tedious plot and telephone performances, Armored is a completely forgettable movie. <br /> <br /> Also, if you really want to steal millions, it's much simpler to disguise yourself as an ATM.
