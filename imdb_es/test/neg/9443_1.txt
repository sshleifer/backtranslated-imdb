Maybe James P. Lay knows what to do in the sound department if a director supervises it. <br /> <br /> In 'Dreamland (2007)', however, you can not achieve anything as a writer or as a director. <Br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing in this film, no history, no character formation, no events, no atmosphere, no plot, no turns, no acting that deserves that name. <br /> <br /> In any of those departments, this movie is billions of light years behind any short film that has some thought, even a minute. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with any of David Lynch's works! <br /> <br /> I really believe that it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the West. <br /> <br /> Recommend it to only your worst enemies!
