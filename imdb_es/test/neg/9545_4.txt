Am I the only person who thinks that the entire Forensics and Scenes Of Crime community in the US? UU Should you detest this slap in their faces? A rookie cop is the first at a crime scene where his backup is so slow to respond that he has time to send the child who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. When he returns (there are still no high-ranking cops, SOCO or other assistance for the lovely Jolie, is this New York, right?), It has started to rain and she goes to work to photograph the evidence, only after she was standing. in front of an Amtrak to avoid disturbing the scene. <br /> <br /> I want to know the name of that camera since the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zoom distorted the images! The horror continues: - not in the movie itself (I'm afraid it's quite common) but in the character of Lincoln Rhyme played by Mr. Washington. This man is a highly dedicated crime scene examiner with years of experience who, instead of local highly trained and invisible crime scene examiners, entrusts the job to an untrained police officer, a rookie cop, who Proceed to find the most obvious clues and posts. move them before photographing them, contaminating each element and making the profiling of DNA almost impossible. Now that was a brilliant idea huh? I know that one should be able to suspend disbelief to some degree, but those who say that this movie is smart must have completely disconnected their ability to think to find this credible movie. <br /> <br /> I have given this film 4/10 for the superb performance of Denzel Washington and the lips of Miss Jolie, which are the only items that require my disbelief to be suspended!
