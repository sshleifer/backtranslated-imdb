Well, now I've seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror / suspense movies recently as I worked my way through several collections of 50 packages, and I have to say that the guy had a limited range, but he was good at what toward. did. It was not Karloff, but the PRC was lucky to have it. <br /> <br /> But the poor man was stuck in a kind of horror movie ghetto, and he was not good enough to take them to the next level of interest ... not with the thread - I had the scripts, the direction and budgets with which he worked. That is the case here. <br /> <br /> This movie is, well, slow, heavy and unattractive for the most part. The "heroine" seems to be doomed to be a rented version of Judy Garland, the "hero" is insipid like white rice, and the poor man who plays the monster does not even get a good scene of transformation from the deal. Its makeup effects do not scare at all, it looks like a slightly more hairy version of a farm hand, that's all. <br /> <br /> It's not a total waste. Zucco looks good with the camera, chews the stage as he manages to deliver some terribly affected and artificial set speeches without shuddering or losing the flow. There are some black and white shots in a bad mood here and there that do not suck completely. <br /> <br /> Then, in general ... this movie helped some actors from level "C" to "Z" to pay their rent for another month, and never sinks below a certain level of discarded quality. Watch it once if you like George Zucco, or just feel the need to see all the themed movies of wolves.
