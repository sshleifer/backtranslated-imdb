The only redeeming feature of this movie is Steve Carell. Like John Wayne, I've never seen Steve Carell extend too much as an actor, but it does not matter. He always plays his only role perfectly. <br /> <br /> As Marty Feldman once said, comedy must have internal consistency. You can have 4 men on the stage sitting in trash cans, and that's fine, but if you bring the fifth man to the stage that is not in a garbage can, then you should explain to the audience why he is not also in a trash can. . <br /> <br /> Why does not Evan accept his role as a messenger of God? Why, when you accept it, are you so deeply embarrassed about it? Why is nobody more impressed with the way animals follow Evan (skeptics explain them as "trained animals" possibly from a circus)? There is a terrible flood at the end, and almost everyone we see leaps into the ark and is saved, but surely thousands of people would have been killed by the flood; In the end there is no emotional atmosphere after the disaster. Instead, the majority of the Congress has finally seen the light and is about to prosecute the only congressman incorrigibly bad for "profit". <br /> <br /> I have to admit: I also liked that the fish in the aquarium reacted to the presence of Evan
