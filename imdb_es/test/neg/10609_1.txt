So, it's Friday night and you want to go see a movie ... everything you want is something entertaining, not too artistic, or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions. Then, you pay $ 10 to see the Mod Squad. The trailer of this movie should have warned me, but come on ... they are three of the most beautiful people in Hollywood: sweet eyes. But that's it ... a series of Prada ads on the move. And what did the Hollywood producers forget? A plot Why do these children run through the streets after an unknown enemy? Where are they? But, do not worry, after a while, you'll just stop worrying. I was about to leave this movie, because I thought that sitting in my room and looking at the wall could have been more productive (and free), but by then it was over (90 minutes, it's just a saving grace). So, are you still willing to lose $ 10? Go, get yourself a good hot meal.
