How is it possible to make such a bad movie with such actors? Were they forced to do it? The plot has nothing to do with an idea of ​​how things would develop if a comedian ran for president. They do not even try to give an impression of that. Just when you thought you were watching a famous liberal commentary about DC politics (the first five minutes), the movie goes off the road and gets into the drama of the movie B about 1) a computer voting error , 2) the usual evil corporate demands that he wants to cover with the most unoriginal lines in history, and 3) a neurotic but extremely beautiful programmer who tries to tell the next president about this. Soon she is the victim of the evil master masters of the computer company who, instead of killing her, drug her to make her seem unworthy of trust. But when it comes to DC, she does not tell you. In fact, the film then changes from a B movie drama to a B movie love drama. So far, we are so far from the original starting point of the film, that most people turn it off. I almost did it. If only it could have been an INTELLIGENT love drama, but no! It is not! It's the kind of "Oops, I'm so nervous I'm being stupid all the time, so please, love me for that," a love drama. All with a slow and slow pace, which has nothing to do neither with the political plot of the film, the plot of the X files of the film or the comic plot of the film. All graphics fail at all levels, to which every little annoying dialogue of no meaning reminds you. The part of love must be the result of deciding during a binge drink "hey, there must be a dynamic of love between the presidential candidate and the extremely beautiful programmer, yes, that will work! Follow him there!" <Br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lewis Black is castrated and put into a role where he can not think of a single Lewis Black line. The wrath of Lewis Black is replaced by a hope for it to come to light at some point in the film, which it never does. And Christopher Walken is thrown into a hospital with heart problems to duplicate the dramatic effect of the heart attack on the president's closest aid at Westwing. See Christopher Walken being castrated as Lewis Black in roles that constantly struggles uphill to sound casual and Westwing-ish, but fail like the Titanic every time, it's like watching a great blue whale dying on a beach. Passing the heart <br /> <br /> And then, enter the lowest point of the whole movie: it raises an enormously difficult ethical problem: if Robin Williams were president, knowing that he was chosen by a computer, does he fail? The American Dream And All Good prevails when he rejects the presidency on live television, as Lassie, the dog, would do. With the usual patriotic charm of the Presidency and the atmosphere of history that we are so smart we are doing, Westwing cultivated in an unhealthy abundance for the next million years. <br /> <br /> The director and scriptwriter, Barry Levinson, is now on my personal list of writers and directors that I'm going to stay away from. This film should be seen as a symptom of a flawed production process, in which people (including Barry Levinson) spent production money because of their personal relationships and not their abilities. This is a project made to satisfy the desire of low-skilled people for professional success, and the great actors mentioned above were tricked into participating in it. That is the only explanation there can be. <br /> <br /> PS: The voting error in the computers was due to the double letters in Dobbs, Kellogs and Mills. Of course it was, what else could it be when you write a script and you can not distinguish a computer from a dishwasher?
