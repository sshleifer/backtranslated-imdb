This film has the appearance of many "fresh" directors (close-ups and focus on the emotions experienced by the actors). The point of the film was presented from many angles and was well expressed by the relatively inexperienced cast. The point is "Have faith in Jesus Christ and the Mormana Church" Oh, and if you read or listen to something that is contrary to the teachings of the Prophet, it is simply Haterade. (Fuel for hatred)
