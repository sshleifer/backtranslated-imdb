Swoon focuses on the homosexual relationship of Leopold and Loeb, a facet of the case that has been ignored (and unfairly) since his trial, including by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But, even in your treatment of this Swoon over does it with a lot. What is worse, it twists, combines and alters the details of the case, which will irritate anyone who knows much about it and at the same time confuses those who are not familiar with it. While it's an interesting movie, Swoon stinks. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10: horrible.
