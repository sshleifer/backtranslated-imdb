To describe what is really wrong with this movie, it has to contain some * spoilers *, so if you are going to see it and you will be surprised, do not read this! <br /> <br /> I liked everything about this movie except the plot; And in a thriller like this believable plot is imperative. It's well-acted, albeit a little slow, and the camera work and Portland scenes are exquisite for a low-budget, unassuming image. The dialogue is very good. <br /> <br /> Mason is a seriously retired young man who works in a telemarketing company that sells insurance. His high school classmate, Berkeley, is his employer and looks after him like a brother despite the fact that Mason obviously has a mental illness. Mason has nightmares that make him gasp and look for the inhaler. His visions and nightmares suggest that he has had serious problems with beautiful women in his past, and the film seems to suggest that he may be a serial killer of women. Meet a cheerful and pretty girl named Amber and draw her in her notebook. She likes and poses so that he can paint his portrait. He sees more of her and begins to wake up from his retired state, almost becoming half human. Then something goes wrong. Amber finds drawing notebooks with drawings of other girls and she begins to wonder. She gets scared and walks away. We wonder if his sudden coldness will push him to the limit. His behavior becomes more erratic. <br /> <br /> This is the configuration for the revelation. To explain how this movie goes horribly wrong, I have to explain what happens. * Another spoiler warning! * For this plan to work, we believe that Amber, a very sociable and extroverted young woman, will look for a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who, at least at the beginning of their friendship, has a vacancy and can only speak in monosyllables or not speak at all . It is far above nerdy, appears at the edge of total catatonia. Yes, I know, girls may be attracted to all sorts of weirdos, but they're usually Charles Manson type or punk rockers, guys with some kind of evil maniacal energy. Mason is practically a zombie, he's almost not there. Any happy young man would cross the street to avoid it. It's just not believable that this girl is attracted to him. Also, there is no credible reason for Berkeley to get carried away by the crazy Mason, that is not credible either. <br /> <br /> But wait, there is a revelation. Amber does not show up at Berkeley's house for the Christmas dinner where Mason is waiting for her, and Berkeley, her old friend, has to tell her that Amber and all her other ex-girlfriends, the ones she drew in her many sketchbooks, do not They exist in all! She and everyone else are simply products of her twisted imagination: he dreamed them. <br /> <br /> Well, this explains why Amber, the normal monad, would go for Mason, she's just a figment of her imagination. This could have been the final revelation of the film with the proper preparation and configuration, but unfortunately it is not. At this point, Mason runs back to his apartment and finds Amber there ... he is enraged, he kills her. But now we have to understand that Amber was actually real, not Mason's imaginary girlfriend. <br /> <br /> In the end, after she was given proof that Amber really exists and that Mason killed her, Berkeley has to admit that he was wrong, that he misjudged Mason. This would work if Mason had been half sane from the start, but since the audience always suspects that he was totally deranged and possibly was a murderer of women, it does not surprise us. We suspect what has always been and we can not understand why Berkeley could not see it. But then we ask ourselves again: if she were real, why would Amber be attracted to the catatonic Mason? <br /> <br /> To make the end worse, we are never given to understand if all of Mason's other girlfriends, those of the sketchbooks, were real or was Amber the first true? And if the others were real, did he kill them too? What did he do with the bodies? <br /> <br /> The problem is that the filmmakers simply did not know what to do with the material. Maybe there could be a way to fix it and tell a credible suspense story, but this movie is not that.
