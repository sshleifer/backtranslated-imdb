The premise of this film, of a presenter of comedians who presents himself as president and independent to shake things up, is fun, entertaining, brilliant and even a little inspiring. (I thought of the debate in the west wing when Tom Dobbs left his podium, I thought of Steven Colbert announcing his candidacy, good times) The first 15 to 20 minutes of this film are very entertaining, especially the debate. When it is finally chosen, it is a pity that it is due to a computer problem, I would like it to win fairly (although that is not realistic). <br /> <br /> But after that, this movie goes completely downhill. I thought we would get a great movie like 'Dave' (1993) in which we see how it would come out if a comedian ran the country. Instead, the film turns from comedy into a thriller, a romantic comedy and a drama and does nothing good. Computer failure becomes the main story, which really sucks. Boy is this disappointing. I give it 3 stars just for the premise and because I could actually watch this movie from start to finish without stopping it, which is generally good with me.
