This movie was so bad it was funny! For a while there I thought I was watching a parody of a bad movie (to the "For your consideration"). The cliffhanger scene at the end made me laugh until my insides hurt. The script was terrible enough, but coupled with the terrible performance of Sean Young, especially while explaining the complete plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while hanging from a cliff, makes it a really bad and classic movie that is worth Worth seeing! In fact, the false shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can not believe how this thing was done. First, how did a bad script get the green light? How did the star actors come together? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions.
