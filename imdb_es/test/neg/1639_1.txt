This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. However, it is not the worst, Hands of Destiny hands has that honor. <br /> <br /> This movie has many problems. For starters, this whole movie is a cheap scam from Conan's movies. There is the baby in a tiny dress with a hubcap, the silent Asian warrior, the evil cookie cutter, the almost senseless soldiers, etc. There are many continuity errors in this movie. Some of the dumbest mistakes I've seen are in this movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, when I saw this movie, I saw the MST3K version. Joel and the bots make the movie visible, otherwise he probably would have turned it off five minutes after the movie.
