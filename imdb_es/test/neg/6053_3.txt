I had not heard anything about this project until I saw it was going to be turned on, so I saw it with a completely open mind. And, well, the cast is full of strong players. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately. . . it is awful. I do not mean that it is not good; I mean it's extraordinarily bad, sometimes ridiculously, but above all it's just boring. Its strongest appeal comes from having attractive people as naked as the US network television will allow. UU., But it is a mockery and not a substance, and have nymphs as supporting characters can not justify several hours of bad television. <br /> <br /> There are two basic problems that the cast can not overcome. First, the script is * horrible *. Yes, making changes in the myth of Hercules (which is certainly not a single monolithic story in the first place) is traditional, but this version is implacably boring and, all too often, silent (and sometimes downright moving and peculiar), with a terrible rhythm. bits borrowed from here and there (and several parts that seem to belong to different movies), and a really horrible dialogue. Dialogue is often unbearably bad, in fact, to the point where you feel embarrassed by the actors. Sean Astin, apparently now typecast as a second banana, seems especially burdened by one horrible line after another. There is no consistency of tone or atmosphere and little cohesion with the plot. <br /> <br /> Second, most special effects are really bad. Very bad. Once in a while there is a bit of decent CGI, but most of all, once again, you feel really embarrassed on behalf of the cast. I have no idea what the budget was for this project, but it sure looks like shit compared to "Clash of the Titans" or even "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" and does not even compare very favorably with the old Lou Ferrigno and the Italian. 'spaghetti' from the films of Hercules. Just painfully miserable. <br /> <br /> There are many other problems: the story is unnecessarily complex and can not keep up with itself, and Hercules himself does not present himself as a very interesting character. Almost all those who do not have a European accent try to falsify one of some kind, which is not merely amateurish and antiquated, but actually never made sense: the drama does not get better simply because the actors use the British accent, then all of them. But the terrible script and the equally terrible effects make everything go well. <br /> <br /> To be fair, "Hercules" apparently was a four-hour miniseries, but truncated (for this broadcast, anyway) for a three-hour television movie. I do not know what they cut, but it is possible that the editions make things worse. I do not think you can make "Hercules" good by adding it, but that does not mean that continuity, for example, has not suffered the network editions. However, there is no way to see the United States version to see.
