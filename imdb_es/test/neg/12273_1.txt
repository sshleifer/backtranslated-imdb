It looked good on the cover of the film, but after five minutes we were not sure if it was a homosexual documentary of the history of the west side without any female interest. The quality of the film was poor, and there was barely enough gang fighting action to keep even the most drunk person's interest for long enough to see the full movie. May God have mercy on the souls of both the actors and the filmmakers responsible for what I can only describe as my new and only reason why I will never again want to see (or trust) a film made in Australia again. I have to write more, so I'll say again that the actors were so bad that I'm sure I could make a better movie with fifteen dollars and a box of Trojans. Please, do not watch this movie for your own good.
