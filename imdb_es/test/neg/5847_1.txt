Demi and Woody are married, but they are poor. They meet Robert Redford, and he is REALLY rich. He is attracted to Demi, and since he is a gambling player, he makes the couple an "indecent proposal:" a million dollars for one night with the little woman. <br /> <br /> At this point, you do not need to see more. of the movie because you can put the details together in your dream. Of course Demi will accept the offer. If she does not do it, there is no first half of the movie. Of course it will affect the marriage of Demi and Woody. If not, there is no second half of the movie. And, of course, everything will be fine by the time the credits accumulate. If not, there is no happy ending for the good of the box office. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can say about the INDECENT PROPOSAL is that Demi Moore looks good in a black dress. As for the rest ... The script is incompetent, the amateur direction, the despicable interpretations. I suspect that Redford, Moore and Harrelson blush and change the subject every time the movie is mentioned. Make them, and more importantly yourself, a favor. Unless someone offers you a million ... Miss It! <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
