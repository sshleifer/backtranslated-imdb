That this film has been stapled on the wall of a chapel as proof that God is truly dead. Am I the only one who really saw (quite asleep) through this "movie"? This is the only movie I've seen in the cinema that I regret not having left and having asked for my money back, it was so boring. And I even saw "Highlander 2: The Quickening" at the local cinema. From start to finish, Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlike, united by circumstances, which eventually work together as best friends. The action (what little there is) is ridiculous and as boring as the bone of the writer's skull. Thanks to the deity that is eating at us while watching our "movies" that there is no possibility of an "Air America 2".
