I liked the whole assembly with the Palace of Caesar, the Roman guards and the advertisers in togas. This event also marked "the passage of the torch" to where the voice of WWF arrives. Gorilla Monsoon, who had made the game per game for each WWF PPV up to this point, opens up and offers the typical introduction to make it look like he is there to announce another PPV. But then he introduces Jim Ross, who is making his WWF debut and JR continues to make the WWF comment to this day. But outside of that, this event is pure garbage. The good scientific combat has been thrown out the window and entered into the birth of the tricks. This was for me the event that WWF started going to the bathroom and did not recover until the era of the attitude of the late 90s. Here is a review of the event. <br /> <br /> Fight for the IC title: Tatanka (Challenger) against Shawn Michaels (champion): A good first game, but given what Shawn is capable of doing, it was very disappointing. I have no idea why the WWF was bent on putting Tatanka. They should realize that Shawn was the future and Tatanka was just an overactive fighter in an Indian Gimick. The end of the match itself was very boring. Shawn grabs the referee and takes it out, then he is called for a count. While it was fun to see Sherri get a beating, this game was forgettable. Shawn had to lead this game and had trouble doing it. <br /> <br /> The Stenier Brothers vs. The Headshrinkers: The Steiners get the victory through a Franknsteiner. This match had its moments, but the crowd simply did not seem interested. There was no heat behind, I think it was a match just to throw two tag teams. <br /> <br /> Crush vs. Doink the Clown: TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! This match was completely sucked. Two very lame tricks. A clown and a Hawaiian dressed in strange colors. The end surprised everyone by surprise. In the next few months, Crush turned his heel and Doink turned his face, but none of the fans seem to care. Unfortunately, this was not the worst card game. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon vs. Bob Backland: You have a completely new heel that goes very much against a fighter who was forgotten about 10 years ago. Fans laugh and laugh when Backlund comes out. And just like Hogan / Rock in WM18 and HHH / Owen in WM14, the heel fighter gets stronger in the face. Fortunately, this match was short. He won the right player, but I wish Razor would have totally beaten the crap and crushed Backlund instead of winning with a small package out of nothing. <br /> <br /> Fight with the Tag Team Champion: Ted Dibiase and IRS (Champions) vs. Hulk Hogan & Brutus Beefcake with Jimmy Hart I would still like to know the full story about what happened to Hogan's eyes. Oh good. The crowd was really interested in this game, but it did not have any flow. Hogan and Beefcake clearly suffered the oxidation of the ring, since both fighters had been on the platform for at least a year. Dibiase, being the great technical fighter that he was, helped to lead the party to be a complete waste. The ending was a surprise with Dibiase and IRS getting the victory through DQ. But to please the crowd, Hogan and Beefcake made their usual game before the crowd at the end as if they had won the game. <br /> <br /> Lex Luger vs. Mr. Perfect: The best part of this game was the four hot girls who accompanied Lex Luger to the ring. Apart from that, this was completely forgettable. Mr. Perfect's trick was born for a high-heeled paper and just lacked heat like a face. And Luger is just a waste of time, no matter what trick he is in. Luger wins through a setback even though Perfect's feet were against the ropes. Then, Perfect passes the post game that is kicked in the ass. First Luger hits him with the elbow running. Then, when Perfect regains consciousness, he returns to the locker room to find Luger only to be defeated by Shawn Michaels, creating an HBK / Perfect enmity that had the potential to be a classic, but the WWF was misused. <Br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales: ABSOLUTE CRAP !! What did the WWF think of bringing a fighter as horrible as Giant Gonzales? Of course he was size, but I'd rather see the Brooklyn Brawler in a game than him. This is not even worth commenting on. <br /> <br /> WWF CHAMPIONSHIP PARTY: Bret Hart (champion) against Yokozuna (challenger) You have one of the best technical fighters of all time going against a guy who only has an advantage. It's a giant butt of butter. Bret was able to lead the game, but a fairly predictable ending with Mr. Fuji throwing salt in Bret's face. <br /> <br /> POST MATCH: Yokozuna against Hulk Hogan pure shit here. Hogan arrives in the ring for no apparent reason and Mr. Fuji challenges him to a match after Yoko has just won the title. Even die-hard Hulkamaniacs find this to be total BS.
