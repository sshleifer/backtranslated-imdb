Normally I like Casper in his films, a real credit for STARSHIP TROOPERS. But the lid of the box in this video SSOOOOO mi-sleigh tenants. In my local video, people rent it waiting for a (PERHAPS) Borg as a vampire, and instead get a bad version of Lon Chaney. He had great potential, and he fell very flat. I really think I could have written a better story and a screen game. Why in EVERY science fiction movie, do they (the cast) constantly refer to a solar system as a galaxy? None of these writers or authors stayed awake in science class? It is one of my pets, but a solar system is a star with planets, a galaxy is a COMPLETE group of solar systems. It's like referring to a can of coca as a six-pack gross. Makes it sound even dumber.
