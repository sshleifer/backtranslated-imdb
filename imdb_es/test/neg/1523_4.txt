The first time I heard of Guest House Paridiso was in the ... "bathroom" after having seen Fight Club. A small round black circle was placed in each urinal. When the circle came into contact with the humidity (to put it delicately), a color image was formed, with photographs of the two stars and the label "Te reir√°s". When you finished washing your hands, the circle had dried and turned black again, waiting for the surprise to come in the next "victim". <br /> <br /> Well, maybe the auction was not terribly sophisticated, but you have to admit that it was innovative. In fact, I think I can honestly say that I've never seen anything like it before in my life, and in these days of more than a century of cinema and marketing, that's a real feat. Too bad that the movie that accompanied it has not fulfilled the promise. <br /> <br /> I hate making bread at Guest House Paridiso and I am indebted to Rik Mayall (Richard Twat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba)) for many years of laughter through their engaging TV series, be it the invention of The Young Ones (1982-1984), Bottom's living room (1991-1995), or even solo work, like Rik in New Statesman (1988-1993). In fact, this would have made a fun 45-minute TV. Unfortunately, it's an 89-minute movie. <br /> <br /> There is definitely some merit, and I laughed continuously throughout the long ending, which tricked the Exorcist and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, and involved ... well, you'll have to see that bit for you same. However, often the pace is high and a sterile atmosphere is present. The two stars (Edmondson taking his usual backseat, this time due to the fact that he directs properly) never get in the first gear, Mayall only shows sporadically the badly spoken mania that makes us love him on the small screen. In fact, the presumption of the writers that we are already familiar with the characters leads to not being delivered to the audience. The slight indications of depth seen in the series (effeminate Richie, failures in social escalation, for example) are not present here, and instead we have parodies of parodies. <br /> <br /> The accusation of Fawlty Towers passes the water, complete with the drunken cook and the hidden waiter, called "Pasquele", who rarely rhymes with Manuel. Some of the ideas, like a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a children's swing hanging over a cliff wall, are very, very funny, but ultimately, the frantic pace is stolen, the two constantly seek an audience of study that is not. there, and all the "dead laugh" areas patched with incidental "comedy" music that would have been dated in a Carry On movie two decades ago. <br /> <br /> The childish, sadistic and perverse humor brand of Paridiso IS fun, and I'm sure it will make you laugh ... but not as often as you should.
