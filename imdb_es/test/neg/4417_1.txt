For me it is a case that you will never understand if you did not live it ... so read this to know why I have so much unlimited anger ... <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot about (Bruce Lee) .. my father I loved him .. my mother who hates any minor shot of violence loved him! and how he talks so far about his "The Big Boss", also known as "Fists of Fury", and the experience of seeing him in the Egyptian films of 1973 with all the gigantic success ... beyond that, I saw a good movie about him (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story - 1993) .. then I found myself crying: where are your movies Bruce? !! <br /> <br /> I went to the video store ... and it was a silly move .. (you'll know why!) .. and waw ... I found many Bruce Lee movies ... I selected one named (Bruce Lee in New Guinea) <br /> <br /> I did it for myself and I saw it. Oh God, please forgive your servant. I hurt myself, but without an intentional decision. I would not do it. If I knew that it is bad harmful !! It's my mythical level of horror !! <br /> <br /> After that, I did not understand at all what is the big problem of Bruce Lee as a great immortal star. Why would anyone care if he is here or there? This hero (whom I've seen!) Is not he so talented and not so genius and, of course, not so sexy? <br /> <br /> Until my father saw THIS star and asked me to pause in any of its close-ups and after examining his face a bit ... he told me in a very definitive way "this is not Bruce Lee "! so I got too confused to ask: who is this dumb guy anyway? !! <br /> <br /> It was 2001 ... 2 years after my first entry into the IMDb database ... therefore, I immediately tried to find out who the hell that man is ... and I discovered the truth ... he is not Bruce Lee ... No, my dear friends ... He is Bruce Li! <br /> <br /> And how huge ... so huge difference !! I just want to know who can love that bad clone? Or God forbid ... I love his repulsive films ... I saw 2 of them and I could not bear to finish the third one! <br /> <br /> After that, I ignored all our video stores because it is clever and cheap (I write on the posters that THIS IS Bruce Lee! ??) ... and I have the original ... The only one Bruce Lee, who is really a big star, and Oh BOY, certainly had the right to immortality ... and nothing less.
