Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen, and a great influence in my life. <br /> <br /> This movie is loose and horrible, and your memory does not give you credit. The script is messy and keeps too many lines of the book intact (the jokes on the leg here are incomprehensible). The performances of the actors are uniformly ineffective, a great wasted cast, and the protagonist, Sean Hughes, frees the belligerent hostilities of Milligan in a plaintive lament, which loses the point altogether. all right. The farce must accelerate toward the end. The Goon Shows often did, the novel "Puckoon" definitely did, but this movie, if anything, slows down just when you want the various elements to collapse in a final climax. Audio recording of "Puckoon" in 1980, with TP McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now, that's funny. Ten minutes of that is more fun than this whole movie. I think the LP was transferred to a CD, but I do not know if it's still printed. <br /> <br /> There is a film of "Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It's also a terrible disaster, but it's more fun than this. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Milligan's spirit is too cunning for the screen. The other reviewers here are surrendering to courtesy and illusion. This movie takes advantage of almost every opportunity and never loses the opportunity to disappoint.
