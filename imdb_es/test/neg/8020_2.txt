This is a weak point of almost everything: refugees, relations between Croatia and Slovenia, globalization, sexual orientation. Queen of the family, and her future, which is symbolized by listening to music in clubs and being a lesbian and never having children. <br /> <br /> It is reproduced in a fairly recent Slovenian legend that involves a virgin and a "forest". King "assuming the shape of a goat (the images of Zlatorog Beer are also based on that legend), but unfortunately, the treatment is very incoherent." Weiss seems to think that the end justifies the means: he can use all kinds of "dreamy" sequences ", and then choose and choose which ones are true and which are imaginary How can the jeep trip with the" king of the forest "be real for the three girls, but the scene outside the tent can be real only in Simona's imaginary? The end is prolonged again and again (I can not believe that the film's execution time is only 98 minutes, have I been watching a director's cut without knowing it?), With the three girls that they have to look at the camera for 10 seconds while they look frightened and happy at the same time (so obvious). <br /> <br /> I never thought I could see a bad performance in a movie whose language I do not understand, but I did not take long to see that "Simona" is acting in excess most of the time, as if he were acting in a silent movie. <br /> <br /> It was not so bad since I thought the director was just starting and wanted to capture what she thought her generation was focusing on the film making a medium experimental film, until I realized that the director was 37 years old when he made the film and that his work is probably "serious".
