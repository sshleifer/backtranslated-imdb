This movie made me want to bang my head against the wall. It's hard to compare something as bad as this, but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding under your nails. And that comment comes from the cousin of the writer. This movie was so bad that it made "Hulk" (The second worst movie in history) look like "The Departed" (One of the best movies in film history). If you like boring family movies with predictable story lines, then you will love this movie. If you have a brain, then you definitely will not. When I rented this movie, I actually fell asleep while watching it. The next day, I finished it where I left it, and it was the worst decision of my life.
