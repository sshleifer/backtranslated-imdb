For this film, based on a television program and a serious ending. I thought it was a bad way to end a serious one. 'M * A * S * H ​​Goodbye, goodbye and Amen' was pretty good, but it is not. Unless you really love the series (like myself) omitting this movie. <br /> <br /> I was a loyal Even Stevens fan, but the plot was too twisted, and Dave Coulier, man, that guy does not have 'I have not done anything good ... well, never. They should not have used Tim Meadows, he's a great actor, but he was too good for the script. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pure cheese. I would give it a 4.5 / 10
