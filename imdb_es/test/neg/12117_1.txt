Any night with Jonathan Ross now means to me his first wit, being upset and upset with the carefully chosen words on the phone of a 78 year old man and then suggesting that he and Russell Brand should leave the house and masturbate while sleeping to sleep . For making obscene calls to him. Curly! And illegal For a big laugh, maybe next time you should try it with someone you know well, like your boss. Or a follower of Abu Hamza? Would he have fun if someone did it with one of his daughters? <br /> <br /> Over the years, I may have seen less than 30 minutes of the BBC Star Man Ross chat program because I find it so disgusting, some Although the guests I saw were fine, probably the Most of those who appeared were fine for what I know. As a chat program seems pretty poor though? Why is he so talkative when asking Conservative leader David Cameron on this television show if he ever masturbated with Margaret Thatcher's photographs? He chatted with Gwyneth Paltrow simply asking if he wanted to fuck him. However, the Ross Ross mentality was finally fully exposed with the previous revelations, and I thought I would take the opportunity to warn the few decent people around the world that they might not know how vile this man is and get away from him and from him. your companions. - unless you think that all comedy should be "nervous", that is, obscene / empty. We are still not all the same, although the BBC and Channel 4 rejected all the standards. <br /> <br /> In October 2008, Ross, with his compatriot Russell Brand, made a series of premeditated sex phone calls to Andrew Sachs. The answer phone (Manuel, of Fawlty Towers), transmitted it as planned on the national BBC radio against Sachs's request and then tried to have the Sachs granddaughter burn the evidence in case they were processed. A large number of people here (probably the majority of those who do not pay the license of the BBC) considered that it was very funny and / or that the national scandal had been exaggerated, but apparently many people still knew that they were wrong and finally 42,851 they complained to the BBC about the incident. Many imbeciles of the evil media and others made fun of these 42,851 who never listened to the radio program (and never wanted to). Using their argument, they probably also consider an event like the Holocaust justified because at the time relatively few people complained to the media, and none of us here should now be horrified because we were not there. The 2 producers of the BBC that participated initially in passing it by transmission thought that it was a comedy "very funny and brilliant" and only 2 people complained about the radio program of Brand at that moment, which I fear that only indicated the moral level that his 400,000 weekly listeners had lost. a with the help of the experience of the BBC. The highly moral BBC tried and did not use it to mitigate it in the later investigation of the OFCOM. Roll over Aristotle, tell Lord Reith the news! The Sachs agent complained to the BBC, but was ignored by them until a national Tory newspaper got the news. The penalty for any ordinary pervert doing this would normally be dismissal and prosecution, maybe even imprisonment, but while Brand and the Head of BBC Radio 2 finally received the order to resign, billionaire Ross received a 12-week holiday by the BBC (I guess he first asked Ross for permission if he could lower Ross's pay by £ 1,500,000, to avoid being sued, to return to this program again in 2009 before his contract is over. to think of more foolish and / or more insults for his 4,000,000 spectators to admire, but at least he could still go to the bank as usual to keep his spirits up. Some people think that his position will be untenable and that he He can not continue, I think his skin is so thick because the bets are so high that he will return without arching and revitalized with accumulated vitriol. (Update 23.01.09: I just saw what s first 5 minutes of his new series, the "big fuss", to use his reference phrase), continues to allow this unrepentant thief of the law to take money from the public. Well, who knows? Maybe in the future, after the industries of the British film and television industry have consoled him for the moral position adopted by the 42,851 and have awarded him prizes, he will become a gentleman for his services. a Perversion on the part of the perverts in Government. At least I hope that this pair of nervous deviants will enroll in other perverted commercial radio and television stations and stay there, so I will not pay for the breach of the law and the spread of illegal obscenities in the future. In 2009, OFCOM fined the payers of the British television license with £ 150,000 for this "unfortunate" affair. Thanks Ross for volunteering to pay! No. <br /> <br /> To apologists: Get a life / sense of humor / sense of proportion! It is not the end of the world to have a couple of perverts without talent like your heroes and there are much more important things to worry about in this world, like the price of real cheese! To summarize, the Dross family man: a comedy genius for seemingly millions of people (especially himself), simply an obnoxious and obscene caller who receives an obscene salary package from an obscene multimedia company for others. So much for our society of Political Correction and Respect! As you should have guessed, it does not apply to the rich and famous and never will, but only to the poor. To summarize BBC: Stumbling blindly from Huttongate, Campbellgate, Dykegate, Springergate, Crowngate, Phonegate now Rossgate. I hope your next crisis is Abolitiongate. I also hope that anyone who thinks that comedy should always be a challenge and overstep the limits, that is, the offensive will not be challenged or offended by my opinion of this pervert in particular, its perverted programs and its current perverted employers.
