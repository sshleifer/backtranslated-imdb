I did not expect much from this movie, but I was still disappointed. It's supposed to be a comedy, but there are only four or five scenes that I really laughed at, and I think that's pretty bad. Nor is there a real plot, I always had the feeling that most of the scenes could have been placed anywhere in the film because there is no connection between them. But the worst was the "performance" of Kim Franke. He has A facial expression throughout the movie, as if he was supposed to play a retarded guy, but I think that's not the case. In general, I rate it with four out of ten, I've seen worse movies than this, but I would not spend money on this again.
