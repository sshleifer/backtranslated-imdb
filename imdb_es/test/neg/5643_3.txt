I could not believe the original rating I found when I searched for this movie, 9.5? Unfortunately, it seems that I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> The movie is really slow and boring, one of the sad things is that if the movie received a realistic rating of around 5 or 6, then the expectation would not have been so high. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was not the case, so when I watch the movie and see the bad story and act, I'm left with a score of 3/10. <br /> <br /> Vinnie Jones is excellent in the stock of Lock, and also in Snatch, and he is a great hard man, however, he must stick to this role. It's a bit like when Stallone and Schwarzenegger have made comedy movies, they just do not work. <br /> <br /> Neither can you play the main actor, play better as support or otherwise. When you play as a leader, your acting talents are too 'in view' and are shown as not very good. Mean Machine is another good example of this.
