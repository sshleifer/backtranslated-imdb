I think many friends of the people who acted in this must have come and evaluated because I tell them, it's just horrible. The acting is worse than the bad soapopera, the effects are like something that would be seen in an episode of Doctor Who in 1970, the story is that, well, there is no story. And they keep using the same 2 minute song over and over again. And the werewolf? It's like the muppets they used in Wing Commander, the giant cats, remember how bad they looked? The werewolf is so bad. Seriously, the guy who ran this thing is terrible and should never redirect anything else, except maybe his son's schoolwork, but even then, he should pay the audience to see it. Ghostwolf is just a bad joke.
