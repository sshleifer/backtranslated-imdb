=========== BIG SPOILER ================================================= Terrible movie without nice characters. So many clichés and scenes without meaning. You need a good editor, but then there may not be any movies left. Please save your two hours. The only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refused to prevent his brother from committing suicide. The description said "moments of dark comedy". Maybe I missed those when I blinked. The horrible characters begin right at the funeral. Do funeral attendees laugh and complain about the food at the funeral of a young man who has committed suicide? So the father digs the only remaining child? At the funeral? How is it that the neighbor next door whose husband cheated on her with the character of Sigourney Weaver is the bad guy by telling the husband? The father does not even know that his son can play the piano, although everyone around him seems to know that he is a great pianist. The film tries to include every possible dramatic cliché in a movie: the father managed his athletic son to succeed, the dysfunctional family lost a son chosen to commit suicide, the son felt lost and alone, drugs, marital affairs, the son conceived through an adventure but raised as the husband's son, incest, homosexual tendencies, stalkers, possible terminal illnesses, etc., etc., DOES NOT WAKE UP 2 HOURS.
