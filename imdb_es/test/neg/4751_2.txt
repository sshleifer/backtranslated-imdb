There was a time when the Alien series was a success even with the third installment, Alien 3, which was promising under the guild of a new and young David Fincher. The first Predator was a blockbuster, mainly due to its history, "at the peak" of the star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan (Die Hard). The Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator movies were very successful and created massive following among movie fans in general and science fiction fans alike. It could be said that Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have marked the end for both franchises, but the studios were not intimidated and saw the opportunity to capture the rumors among the fans and combine the two. Enter Paul W. Anderson, Alien Vs Predator, and now the Strauss Brothers (graduates of visual effects, not even directors or writers). The problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the science fiction genre to fall into the hands of a mediocre director and now the director of Newbie has been nothing but blasphemy, personified by incompetence. When witnessing the death of Alien Vs Predator Requiem (AVPR), the fanatics will feel sick to their stomachs because this series could have gotten worse. <br /> <br /> An example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is found in the opening scene. and is likely to cause nausea among fans. The film begins with an Alien making its way into the Predator ship, sprouting from the chest of predators, growing into an adult Predalien and knocking down the Predator ship (which now seems to have many Predators less than at the end). from Alien Vs Predator) and all this happens with the ship still in Earth's atmosphere. Once the ship has crashed, AVPR quickly resorts to cheap plotting methods and basic narrative conventions; it does not dare to use any of the twists or subversions presented in the two original films. The tedious plot progresses with tedious step, punctuated only by the Alien and Predator conflicts that are coming, and when that runs the risk of boredom, we are offered a seductive blonde in bikini or fast shots. AVPR is plagued by an endless series of continuity errors and gaps in the plot with little or no narrative clarification, that is, members of the public who defend an elite military unit or the Predator who do not adhere to the laws established in editions previous This is a film that completely ignores its predecessors, breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and, in doing so, has the feeling that it is trying to configure itself as an independent function. Independently, the film has no heart, no conviction, no soul, and with reference to the other films it lacks even the most basic continuity. This is exemplified in the arched narrative of the film, as it undermines the basic premise of the first Alien. Because if the species had been found before, those of the first Alien movie would have been more competent and not so badly prepared when they were found. <br /> <br /> On a cinematic note, the film is close to being terrible, At some points I felt the need to light a torch on the screen, the lighting was so bad. Through the use of such dark and dark effects, the audience can feel as if they are being deceived by the action. which is ironically its purpose and also indicates that movies lack budget. As with all science fiction, a scene usually appears as the most memorable, in this case it is probably the scene of hospital impregnation, since it is based tenuously on the themes of the original Alien by literalizing it. The direction is poor, the performance is weak and the script is rotten. AVPR is the product of a filming conveyor system in which ideas and techniques are assembled by inefficient people and then the finished product is distributed among the cinemas. This is personified by the absence of bloody death scenes and blood battles because certification will not allow it. A lower certification achieving a wider audience. AVPR was purely a business and nothing more.
