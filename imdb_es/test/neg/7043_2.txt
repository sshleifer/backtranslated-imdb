If you have a lot of time to kill and your friend gave you the DVD for free, but still it can take a lot of courage to see this movie that does not have a good script or humor for that matter. <br /> <br /> On the acting front, Imran is frozen in time / acting, Tushar Kapoor was slightly better than Imran in this movie. Paresh Rawal was good at comedy. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a university campus where Imran is a bad boy. Tushar is the good, pretend to be the opposite of the respective nature and, therefore, the story continues ... <br /> <br /> Watch it only if you have nothing to do and the movie is running on your TV by local cable.
