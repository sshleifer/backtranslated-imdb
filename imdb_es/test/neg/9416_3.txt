Mario Van Peebles tries to go to the route of Jean-Claude Van Damme and play a renegade robotic soldier who is absent without permission to preserve himself, however, the government will not take it lying, so, among the simplistic plot, Van Peebles protect the villagers of the rebel forces and defeat an improved version of himself in this disappointing film. This flagrant theft of Universal Soldier (which is much more fun than this) simply does not go anywhere. The main problem is that the movie is incredibly inert. Van Peebles just waits and there are not enough kicks to justify a visit. On the other hand, the film resembles a competent version of R.O.T.O.R, although like that bad abysmal film was hilarious, it only produces occasional laughs in its ridiculously unconvincing action sequences. Also, as R.O.T.O.R does not make sense in his narrative and basically the movie is incredibly boring. In addition, the villains are disappointingly weak and basically the film needs a real action scenario to work, because the material is too boring. In all respects, Solo is a very weak movie. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4 (Poor)
