There are some pretty landscapes to see here, if you can keep your eyes open enough to see some of that. I'm a big fan of the movies of life, but these people are simply bland. Although there is nothing political Here, the whole film can be seen as a political statement, in the sense that it shows how communism destroys the individual, making everyone the same insipid animal that spends his life sleeping, eating and occasionally doing the love.
