This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. If I was not seeing it for free, I would never have finished it. The creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. It seems that this is supposed to be a movie in the line of Scary Movie and Date Movie (a terrible movie, but 10 times better than this one), but it failed miserably. The only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick. A boy falls, someone is hit by a bus, etc. None of the ideas is intelligent, basically it is the worst premise of a movie. The plot (or lack of it) is completely delayed. The plot seems to focus on the coach and his family, however, there are many other things in the movie that are completely ridiculous. Terrible, terrible movie.
