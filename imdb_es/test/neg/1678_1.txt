Okay, I can sit down on almost any movie, and I tend to really enjoy Sci Fi Originals, but there was a major flaw in this movie that made me have to turn it off after half an hour. <Br /> <br /> Having served in the US Army. UU., There are certain expectations in a movie that includes the military. At least some attention to the proper military rank, uniform and terminology is necessary if you expect the viewer to really enjoy the experience. "Bats: Human Harvest" had characters with rank that was oriented in the wrong direction on the lapel and, later in the movie, the time was listed as 11:00 am, but it was completely dark outside. Even if the script was perfectly done, and the dialogue was spectacular, and the actor was worthy of an Oscar, if the people who make the film do not care enough about the film to bother looking for the right way to show the time military, why should anyone bother to try to see it?
