Special effects similar to cartoons, acting and horrible dialogue, and dry plot! This movie has it all! My friend and I went to a blockbuster to find a horrible movie that we could make fun of, but this was too much. The film begins with a woman and her son on vacation on an island in the region of the Bahamas. The women, who happens to be a doctor / virologist, are in the area when a man collapses. He has a strange wound on his arm, and she immediately knows that it is a contagious virus. The story continues to show a surprisingly fast romance between the two teenage tracks (this is justified by the girl who says "I know it's fast, but it feels good." Anyway, the whole island gets infected with this virus and the CDC We are told that within three months, if the virus is not treated and contains, it will spread to the United States and kill millions of people.This information does not prevent the CDC from leaving the island to save themselves. Fortunately, the cure for this horrible virus is just in time and the whole island is saved.To celebrate the death of their loved ones, the people of the island organize a party in which everyone dance, have fun and forget the horrible epidemic that just happened.
