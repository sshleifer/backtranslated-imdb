Three entrepreneurs are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men. The three businessmen take revenge, which translates into one murder after another. Supposedly, the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people. <br /> <br /> The plot has too many holes. The details were ignored to advance the story. The performance was uneven. The color balance was horrible even though I saw this movie on DVD. The small budget and the tight schedule were obvious. The whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final fight, and the ending was simply incredible.
