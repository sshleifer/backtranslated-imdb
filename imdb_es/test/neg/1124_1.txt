** WARNING ** MISERABLE MOVIE ** WARNING ** The day before Christmas Eve, some crazy people decided that he would entertain us by sending this movie as "entertainment" on television. In the name of God, what was he thinking? <br /> <br /> This movie is full of a horrible humor, a despicable performance, jokes and a disaster of a plot. Randy Quaid plays the idiot role as cousin Eddie Johnson. Eddie is a person with brain death, who is unable to perform the simplest tasks. He was fired because he was stupid like a brick, but the company he worked for regretted it, so they sent him and his family on vacation. But being as stupid as he was, he made the holidays a disaster. <br /> <br /> In general, it's the worst movie I've seen, and I still have nightmares about the miserable performance and even more miserable jokes in this movie. It's so sad that you ALMOST have to see it ... But do not do it. The nightmares I have are much worse than any other nightmare you may have. Trust me ... I hate this movie so badly for its performance, humor, "jokes" and history. The only good thing was the beautiful landscape. <br /> <br /> Well, it's my opinion, and I'm sure I hope everyone agrees with me ...
