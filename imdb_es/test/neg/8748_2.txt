If you ever visited Shenandoah Acres as a child and wondered, could there be a worse vacation spot in the world? Well, you could have seen this movie and have your answer. Flavia (a.k.a. Fistula) Macintyre's ranch is often frequented by business casual Gordon, at least since the resident water witch, Jessica, was 13 years old. buried "tray-shure", lost jewelry, corpses, even a talisman that will prevent her from dressing like a whore and picking up drinks with a fake touch and an imitation of Suzanne Pleshette while being hypnotized by a disembodied head. Evil, evil evil.
