The previous review is quite focused, which Altman was NOT with this movie. I have not seen it since its original release, but I rarely spent two hours in a theater feeling as miserable and disappointed as I was with this movie. If some pretentious community theater tried a science fiction version of an Ingmar Bergman film, it could turn out that way. I can not force myself to give anything. Altman has made a "1", but this is probably the lowest point of a career that has had some notable highs and lows. I would have left, but as a paid film critic I could not. (Think about that the next time you envy movie critics.)
