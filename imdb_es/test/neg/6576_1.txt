It seems almost touching that Star Trek fans like this movie desperately despite its incredible number of failures. <br /> <br /> To begin with, none of the known characters really has the character, so to speak. Scotty is represented as a clumsy whirlwind instead of the competent engineer who was in the original series. Uhura ... Gods, I can not even think about what they did to their character. All his dialogue was painful to listen to. McCoy looked like a neurotic stepfather to Kirk instead of his trusted friend. Spock ... well, let's say that Leonard Nimoy was terribly lost. He was given a bad dialogue ("I do not think he understood the seriousness of his situation, Captain." Gravity, understand it? Understood?) And he almost became a buffoon. Kirk ... oh man, do not make me start. To begin with, William Shatner is a hammy actor, so to allow him to lead really is to invite disaster, which is what we got. <br /> <br /> The plot is more than ridiculous. Giving Spock a brother is a story line rather desperately and unnecessarily a soap opera. But hey, let's go with that. The search for God Again, a weak plot. Do not you think? OK, let's go with that too. Then, assuming that the two elements of the plot mentioned above are solid, what's wrong with the script? Well, to begin with, recycle too much. The company, for example, once again, is not working properly. Should we assume that Starfleet would send a malfunctioning ship with a skeletal crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to handle the situation? If that is the case, then why not put it on a better ship as a consultant? On top of that ... the crew is extremely incompetent. Scotty has the ship in pieces (and apparently is clumsy enough to hit his head and is left unconscious while there are hostile on board!), It seems that no one notices that the Klingon ship is crumbling in a moment crucial (although the sensors are clearly showing the ship in range of weapons) and the crew seems too familiar to each other. In other words, there is no sense of discipline. If this is the flagship of Starfleet, then it's a wonder that the Klingons have not overthrown the Federation. <br /> <br /> As for the personal struggles with pain, it was crap. Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor, but even he could not save this turkey. In summary no one could. Of all the people involved, I imagine that Leonard Nimoy is the most embarrassed about it. I hope it is, anyway. <br /> <br /> Thank God, the original cast did not retire in this cloddish opus.
