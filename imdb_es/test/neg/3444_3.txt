This show bothers me. It occupies slots in Nick at Nite that could be reserved for the Cool Prince or George Lopez. Even the full house and Roseanne. All are better than home improvements. First of all, mother Jill bothers me so much. She is a querulous baby and scorn. Brad is a fat frog, and he is also annoying. And the younger brother, I do not even know his name! I do not notice it at all! Although it is probably not the fault of the actor, it is likely that it is the writers. Tim is just a stupid ass. Although Jill is DEFINITELY my least favorite, I do not like any of them. The only reason I gave this stupid three-star show is that a star goes to Randy. As the middle child, he is still an annoying little brother, but an older brother, and I like his funny character. the other star goes to al. As the chubby friend, his character is nice. Apart from Randy and Al, this show sucks.
