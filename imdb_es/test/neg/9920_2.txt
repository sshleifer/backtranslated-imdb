"The James Dean Story" is presented as "A different type of film", explaining, "The presence of the main character in this film has been possible thanks to the use of existing film image material, recordings of his voice and by means of a new technique - the dynamic exploration of photography ". The only "recordings of his voice" worthy of mention is a short recording that Mr. Dean makes while visiting his family in Indiana; I wanted to record all the family memories of his great-grandfather Cal Dean, intrigued because he played a similar "Cal" in "East of Eden." Dean asks if Cal Dean was interested in art, and learns that a relative was an auctioneer. James Dean was interested in art and had a warm relationship with his family, obviously. That is the only 100% accurate revelation in this documentary. James Dean was interested in art and had a warm relationship with his family. <br /> <br /> An incredible "screen test" / "uptake" of "East of Eden" appears near the end of the movie. It's a black-and-white scene between Dean (as Cal Trask) and co-star Richard Davalos (as Aron Trask). Dean is at his best fascinating moment. If this scene appeared only here, and the film "East of Eden" was not completed, this documentary would be an essential and highly rated film. But the scene, a perfect "10" in isolation, should be considered an extra "East of Eden". It's also worth watching Dean's "Traffic Safety Movie". <br /> <br /> Interviews with family and friends are expected. My favorites were the guy (Lew Bracker) who was checking out a box of things Dean left with him and Dean's family. There was not enough of Aunt Ortense and Dean's letter to his cousin was very nice. More reading of Dean's letters would have been welcome. The unidentified writer friend of Dean seemed to have a better thesis for the film; the filmmakers might have considered developing it as a main focus. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman's address from Martin Gabel's reading of Stewart Stern's script is terrible. What were you thinking? Maybe, the filmmakers can be forgiven because of the closeness of Dean's death. Do not expect "The James Dean Story" at all. This movie is more about the effect of Dean on people (both fans and filmmakers) than man. It is clearly one of the first pieces of the "legend" myth creation of James Dean. Tommy Sands sings "Let me be loved". The narrative refers to Dean as "He" with a divine air. The shots of Dean's family that seem to "know" at the time of his death are really miserable. <br /> <br /> ** The Story of James Dean (8/13/57) Robert Altman ~ James Dean, Martin Gabel, Richard Davalos
