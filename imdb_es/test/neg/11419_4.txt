Apart from that, he gathered the characters from the first film and gave them more background story. Essentially, Lucian the Lycan (werewolf) fell in love with Sonia the Vampire, a stage of Romeo and Juliet that you know will end badly if you've seen the first movie. So without any kind of suspense, we launched with two hours of tireless CGI and actors with little or no presence on the screen. All filmed in that monotonous color that had the first film because nothing was filmed in the light of day. <br /> <br /> It's worth your time ... probably not. In fact, the quality has dropped, even the CGI seems to be done cheaply, you do not buy for a minute that these are real werewolves.
