I was surprised that the creators of this movie came out and said that this movie was a true story. Most of the scenes seemed false to me. For example, when the only girl was eating her sandwich and there was a cockroach on it. While she was eating the sandwich, the camera on the opposite side of this one showed that there was a cockroach on it. It's funny how the camera was just filming in the sandwich when the girl was eating it. Another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat went flying or I should say that it was thrown to give effect. This movie was not realistic at all. It is very doubtful that the events that happened were true that night when the "St. Francisville Experiment" took place. I think the house may be delighted, but not on the night that this movie was filmed! The ending was fun when Tim and another girl were chained in a kind of basement. Paul and Madison found them and rescued them! I'd rather see the Blair Witch Project again than have to go through the St Francisville Experiment film again. As I said, if the creators of the film did not declare that this was a true story with real events, I may have liked it more. The best thing is to get more entertainment from the Blair Witch Project (although this is not a true story either) !!!
