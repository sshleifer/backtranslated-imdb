Pretty bad of the People's Republic of China, which I rarely bother to look at again, and it's no wonder, it's slow, squeaky and dull like a butter knife. Crazy doctor George Zucco is in that again, turning a silly farm man with monkeys (Glenn Strange) into a werewolf. Unfortunately, makeup is virtually non-existent, and consists of only one beard and dimestore fangs for the most part. If it were not for the presence of Zucco and Strange, together with the pretty Anne Nagel, this would be completely impossible to see. Strange, who would go to play Frankenstein's monster for Unuiversal in two years, makes an impression of Lenny's "From Mice and Men", it seems. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of four)
