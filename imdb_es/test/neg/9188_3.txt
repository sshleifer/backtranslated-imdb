After September 11 in New York, this drama about American firefighters was conceived as a salute and a tribute to their professionalism. The story is told with a series of flashbacks, where firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) crashed on the floor of a burning building and only communicated with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) through the radio. The flashbacks basically show how Jack grows from being a recruit, seeing Kennedy as a father figure, to being a firefighter legend. Of course, on this day, Jack's fellow firefighters are trying to get to him, but they arrive too late, and in the end, he allows them to leave, and goes to his funeral, where he is praised as one of the top. The firemen who have known. Also starring Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison, Robert Patrick from Terminator 2 as Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke as Dennis Gauquin, Balthazar Getty as Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee as Tony Corrigan. The flames of the film are, ultimately, all I could pay attention to and enjoy watching the characters approach them, the rest is a bit too talkative for my taste. Suitable!
