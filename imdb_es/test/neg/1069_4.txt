I am sure that some people will enjoy it and find it powerful, or have some kind of personal connection with the characters and the story, but from an impartial point of view, it is not very well done. The film revolves around atypical and anguished adolescents, each with a different stereotype that makes us believe that this is how being a teenager. We can see a bit of the lifestyle of each teenager, but the whole project came off so pretentious, either because of the constant low-angle shots of the branches of the trees in the wind, or the "interviews" in black and white with the students. There was nothing new or original exhibited in this movie, and nothing I needed to see. Yes, it is a solid material, and the dramatic scenes are reproduced and act well, but the whole project seems unnecessary, especially when it seems almost an exact replica of Van Sant's "Elephant" (one that deals with suicide, the other with a shooting at school). As I said, some people will probably enjoy this, and the director / writer clearly had some kind of inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a nearby one, so it's good that the movie was made with a certain heart, but I feel it's incredibly inefficient, and when it comes to material that can be clich√© so easily to do something original with it. I would not recommend this movie.
