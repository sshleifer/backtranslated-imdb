WHAT WAS THINKING?!?!?! How sad is an actor so tremendously talented as Michael Rapaport, who stole our hearts in "Mighty Aphrodite" and fascinated us in "Ill Town", has sunk into this pathetic level. The writing in this comedy is the bark that remains in the bottom of the barrel after being scraped. Shame on everyone involved. There is a tendency: the main actors of films that are no longer popular products are turning to television, often with disastrous results (refer to the stinkaroos on CBS and NBC, however, ABC is successful with "Boston Legal": writing modern and a great nostalgic use of Bill Shatner). Losing Michael Rapaport in this scam "Everything in the family" is an insult to the viewers and, for the most part, to Michael himself.
