This movie is an abomination of everything that is worth making film. The main actor surprises his audience by not acting at all. We have to watch almost two hours of his face desalmado and disheveled. All the jokes are boring. I never laughed Once it was Saturday, there were 5 of us who had a beer to laugh at, and then we put this on and you could feel all the heat and color draining from the room. The movie ended and the atmosphere was ruined, so we went our separate ways, ruined the night! OK so pros and cons. Pros beautiful setting in Hawaii, it looks good in bluray. Cons worst acting never; It can be said that all those interested are thinking about the day of payment. Predictable poor plot. Development of the character zero. Jokes forced that fall flat. Many men's penis shots to be fair act better than him and have more charisma. Let all the creators of this film hang their heads in shame and offer their masculine flaccidity.
