This is the sad story of a matter of self-absorption between two unpleasant people, one of whom is married to another person. It ranks first on my list of the most boring movies in history, and I'm a big fan. My husband retired after the first hour of his three, at which time little had happened. The desert landscape is spectacular, with the infinite sand and sun in Katharine's golden hair. However, cinematography does not make a brilliant movie, unless it is a National Geographic travel notebook. The magnificent Saharan landscape in this ill-conceived tale is like putting perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a dying and burned pilot named Conde Laszlo de Almasy, who is left in the care of a Canadian. Army nurse, Hana, during World War II, Italy. He seems to remember little of his life, but through a book in his possession, his story is revealed VERY SLOWLY, with the help of a man from his past named Caravaggio, who mysteriously appears on his deathbed. Almasy was a Hungarian cartographer employed by the Royal Geographical Society to trace the Sahara desert. He entered into an affair with his wife, Katherine, of a fellow explorer who proved to be a British spy. Meanwhile, in the present, Laszlo's nurse has her own adventure with a Sikh nicknamed Kip, who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming the mines. <br /> <br /> My fights with this movie are many, long and tedious for beginners. I do not blame the performance in particular, it's just not a good story. Caravaggio seems unnecessary, his connection with Almasy is superficial. It provides a scene of torture, but it does not seem to have an essential purpose in the film. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the two parties to this affair, Almasy and Katharine, are unfortunately unfriendly, shallow and boring characters. They just are not very nice, therefore, there is no one to encourage. Almasy is cold, aloof, haughty and, in the long run, disgustingly possessive of another man's wife. Katharine is also detached and unpleasant, not to mention that she has a deplorable lack of guilt or feeling for her imperfect but loving husband ... besides controlling a tiny tear in the corner of her eye when she dies. <br /> <br /> This is a story of lust instead of love, with pearls like "I can still taste you". Almasy ridiculously vocalizes to a colleague his erotic obsession with the slit in the neck of his beloved, surely more indicative of a focus on Katharine's body. The victim of this unrepentant adultery is the hapless husband, Geoffrey, who is treated as little more than an unpleasant annoyance. Everything is pretty sordid and disgusting, the farce of Katharine to feel weak so that these lovers can enjoy their unbridled and so vaunted passion, all this while singing in the background Silent Night. I'm not sure if the intention was to contrast the purity of the carol with his selfish lust, but I was definitely not impressed by the sacrilegious tone. We have a frontal nudity with Katharine, but her sex scenes are cold, selfish, lustful and, sometimes, openly hateful ... not warm, loving, generous, not even truly passionate. If either of these two feels some emotion for the other, it is totally selfish and definitely NOT love, as the word defines it. <br /> <br /> The return of Almasy to the Cave of the Swimmers to recover the body of His beloved is presented as devised instead of moving. Katharine must have expired only a few moments before, since she shows excellent color and barely seems to doze, not at all like a corpse. Of course, all this has a dramatic effect, since the romantics who see this story (normally I would be one of them) would not appreciate a decaying rotten corpse. In order to recover the body of his adulterous lover, he has betrayed his companions and allies by giving his maps to the Nazis, and the English were chosen as the villains of the piece. Regardless of whether or not he keeps his final promise to Katharine, his treacherous act is not something he admires much. <br /> <br /> Kip seems to be a nice guy and Hana is usually nice, but his romance is not at all attractive, it's just a brief war adventure with the parts that indicate little trauma when departing. Moving back and forth between the two environments (past the Sahara desert and present-day Italy) turned out to be distracting and unpleasant, but in reality, both stories were boring as dishwashing water. The only spark of interest in the whole picture was the tense unarmed scene of the Kip mine. <br /> <br /> Not being totally heartless, I felt some sympathy for the severely burned and dying state of present-day Almasy. However, perhaps my main complaint with this film is euthanasia at the end, when Hana forces her patient by giving her an overdose of morphine. We are supposed to feel that this is justified and morally acceptable because she obviously feels affection for Almasy, cries while preparing the deadly syringe, and reads aloud the book of Herodotus, supposedly passionate, to comfort him while he is dying. <br /> <br /> The incredible masterpieces of director David Lean should not be insulted compared to this pathetic and immoral story. Yes, Lawrence of Arabia also has a desert, but in the Lean films (Doctor Zhivago, Brief Encounter), those who are involved in the issues are sympathetic characters who exhibit admirable restraint, guilt and some consideration for the betrayed spouse, rather than total self-absorption of this couple. In Ryan's daughter, the cuckold husband shows moving loyalty and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This movie is a supposedly intellectual bit, hugely overrated and boring and unpleasant that unfortunately poses as a great love story. His Best Film Oscar does not speak well for the Academy. For those who wonder why people are so tough in this movie, the answer is simple. It is awful.
