The film successfully offers a graphic representation of the suffering of forced sex work, but nothing more. The agenda to the left behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves the viewer so embarrassed while watching if he knows that feeling. Then, the women are kidnapped and sent to the former Yugoslav territory to work as sex slaves because (deep breath) the US military institution is corrupt and looks the other way while its private security contractors sell to people abroad. You do not need half a brain to see the relevance of the war in Iraq and the Black Water Company. <br /> <br /> What a load of left droppings! It seems that I have been deceived all my life thinking that this problem and many others were the direct result of the control of communism in this region for 45 years. But no, it was the US war against Iraq, which is also responsible for the earthquakes, tropical storms and constipation that I had last week. <br /> <br /> The film ignores the fact that 95% of the sex trade is Women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry to the Western bloc. You also see scenes that are so stupid that you want to pull your hair. We have someone chasing a woman on the streets of London in broad daylight, we hit her and then, somehow, drag her unconscious body half a mile towards the apartment where she rapes her. Nobody sees this or calls the police, and the woman who runs does not mind screaming during the chase. Even better, later we see 4-5 women lined up in central London on a day again to be sold, one of them has a shattered face and people are buying in the background as if nothing were happening. You can not make up for this stupidity. <br /> <br /> I used to think that trash was Hollywood-only, but apparently I was wrong.
