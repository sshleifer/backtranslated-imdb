This movie was obscenely obvious and predictable. The scenes were poorly written and acted even worse. Following the horrible scenes was the terrible script full of useless and ill-thought lines. I would never suggest this movie to anyone who made sense to watch decent movies. This film not only had the same ideas as the Bachelor and Bachelorette series, but also contained many parts in which I would know what the next move and line would be without having to watch the movie before. The casting was fine, but the actors played the characters horribly with more drama that should have been used then and they said the lines were the ones that wanted to change the channel quickly. As a note please do not watch this movie.
