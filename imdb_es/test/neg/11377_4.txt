I was hoping that I would like this movie, to accommodate a night of silly fun. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the premise seemed to have gotten up enough to entertain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found myself dozing again and again. Judy Davis had a good performance, but she had very little to work with. Juliette Lewis was fabulous as expected, but she had very little to do. The plot was full of "twists" that were simply stupid, and as often happens in films of this type, nobody acted in the way that a real human being would act. And, personally, I thought that Marcia Gay Harden was totally unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The film also seemed to change midway from a black comedy with touches of farce to a total farce with touches of black comedy. A critic here points out that other critics seem to want this film to be something different and, therefore, condemned it. All I can say is that I would have been satisfied if the movie was * something * and I would stay with it. He feels that the director had some great ideas, but he was not able to get them all out. I give it a 4 out of 10.
