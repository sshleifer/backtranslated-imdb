Many compliments have been lavished on Farscape, but I do not think it's that good. It certainly has a distinctive aspect, but it lacks everything else: history, purpose, direction, emotion; Whatever it is I'm a big fan of science fiction, and I want to see all the science fiction programs that I can. I have almost finished the four seasons of Farscape, and at this point I am not very satisfied. The program has some good things, especially Claudia Black (who unfortunately is missing in the first episodes of the fourth season), but they are very few and far away. In general, the program is disfigured by a lot of very silly things (like fantasy elements instead of the SF ditto), and many many episodes, especially. In the fourth season, they are indescribably messy and very poorly structured. And you feel that you are not going anywhere. It is mainly about non-directional adventures with thin lines and long-lasting lines that are developed with great care. Well, sometimes it's a bit stricter, but it only lasts a few episodes at a time. <br /> <br /> As for the effects, there are some impressive things here and there (especially in space, occasionally), but the program seems to be stuck in the same style of effects, which frankly ages rapidly. The extravagant and unconvincing alien puppets are closely related to the show, and I have come to prefer (by far) the episodes in which regular characters with a human aspect focus. <br /> <br /> I think the peacemakers are by far the most elegant and intriguing and interesting figures in the show; they manage to be a compelling alien culture, despite their completely human appearance. There are some really great episodes with them, esp. in the first season (IIRC), where Crichton disguises himself as Captain of the Peacekeepers and invades and eventually destroys one of his secret bases. Such episodes can reach a rating of 8 out of 10, but I can not grant the show together more than one "4" rating. <br /> <br /> Apart from the totalitarian and militarist pacifiers to be really nuanced), the program simply does not offer anything important or significant that you should know or want to see. OTOH, it contains some good ideas and it is not a total loss. <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion, of course, but as a science fiction fan, I think it counts for something, and it can be helpful for others. There are not many good science fiction programs out there; but Star Trek (any series) and especially the new Battlestar Galactica are definitely better than Farscape. But if you're a big fan of mediocre sci-fi shows, you might also like Farscape. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4 out of 10.
