This movie had a pretty interesting plot about the clones and the use of organs, but it fails, since the main actor is so annoying and weepy that you want him dead. It's not that anyone else is very good at that, but when you hate the character that is supposed to be generating your sympathy, the movie just does not work. Funny enough, it seems that in the near future a movie that has a plot that reflects this with more action and a better cast, although I can not think of anything else, but this movie if They went to see it. This movie has a super foolish clone who is somehow smart enough to realize that something is wrong in his camp, where people ride a bike at a mile per hour and fight for no reason. The counselors tell them that when they are ready they go to America, but our "hero" has his doubts, so he spies and learns the terrible truth that sends him to flee from the bad guys who shoot and hit the subject repeatedly. He goes in search of the man who was cloned. Peter Graves is in it and so is Dick Seargent, but they do not add anything to this movie that looks like something that was made for television. On the positive side, however, when "The Island" comes to light, the creators of this film can proudly say "we thought about it first".
