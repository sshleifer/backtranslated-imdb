The first few minutes that showed the cold and crunchy character of Willis's character were very nice, especially with Jean Smart, but after that he really collapsed. This is simply a great man and small irritating things for children for a long time without any innovation. I know that the casting probably chose this child to show that Willis was just as irritating in his younger state, but I found this child ESPECIALLY irritating and loud.
