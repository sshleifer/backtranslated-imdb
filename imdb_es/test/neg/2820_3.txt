I'm a big fan of sleazy and horror movies, when you put them together, that's my perfect point: horrible sordidness. However, you will not get it in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is certainly sordidness, in the form of girls being kidnapped and tortured, tied to various things. However, the sordidness is not very bad. It did not register very high on my sleaze meter, mainly because none of the girls was the most attractive, nor did they try to act as if they were threatened. They seemed to be thinking more about what it was for lunch, or maybe when they could score some crack. <br /> <br /> Forget about the effects, they were very depressed. The evil was contributed by the bad performance; the effects are harder to believe when even the actors and actresses are not buying them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was pretty bad, they could have hired a couple of cameramen from a porn movie and done it better. In fact, that could have raised the sleaze factor enough to make it pleasant. As it is, there are a lot of dark shots where you can not see very clearly, and what you can see does not look very good. <br /> <br /> The horror factor is null. Null. Zero. Nothing Zipper. Zilch. I have seen movies for children that were more terrifying. There is no camp here either. It's just a movie that tries to be surprisingly sordid, but that does not even come close.
