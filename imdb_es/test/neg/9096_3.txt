Gordon goes over the top in the typical way of the full moon, but that is to be expected. Combs is surprisingly unobtrusive, maintaining its performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing. The usual black humor of Stuart Gordon's tongue has also gone. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite effective in showing the collapse of Combs and his last heroic act to save his wife and daughter. Actually, you feel sympathy for his character, despite his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was more surprised by the nude and borderline sex scene of pornography, than graphic violence and gore. /> <br /> It's not the classic Gordon, but certainly something you could enjoy if you've seen your most famous movies.
