This movie sucks. The acting is worse than in the movies we did when we were 10 years old with a camcorder, the effects look like a computer game of about 80 and the plot is worse than terrible. Even Van Damme's worst movies make this look horrible. The accent and rhythm of "bad" speech is so bad that it's fun ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend seeing this unless you're a big fan of one of the actors. 1 out of 10
