This film begins with a configuration for pedestrians before getting into the standard type of suspense action in which an office worker keeps hitting trained men of the secret service, etc. <br /> <br /> I could not say that the performance was bad. good "surprised" faces from Hamilton and Sheen, but then I really would not have to. <br /> <br /> The end of Risible at least gave me a good laugh for my pains. Even so, if my life was shining before my eyes, I think it would advance these 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I have to write two more lines of text just to publish this. Yes, very strong suit that shines brightness. I made a special promise not to see such a bad movie again.
