After his romantic acting career ended in the late 1960s, Rock Hudson starred in many different projects, including television shows and films of lesser quality. However, I think "Embryo" is his only turn as a mad scientist, and that's probably a good thing. I guess I needed the job. <br /> <br /> Driving along a dark and stormy night, the brilliant Dr. Paul Holliston (Hudson) hits and wounds a Doberman, who takes him back to his laboratory (which looks a bit like a wet basement of the Midwest). Then he manages to raise the unborn puppy of the dog outside the womb, so naturally, he decides to do the same with a human being. Raise Victoria (the beautiful Barbara Carrera) of a fetus in the same way. Victoria grows at an amazing rate and soon becomes a beautiful young woman. <br /> <br /> As expected, things are going very badly. After an incredible start, Holliston's sister-in-law, Martha (Diane Ladd) begins to wonder where the girl came from, and Victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence. The final sequence is a long chase in the car of "Smokey and the Bandit", after which Victoria, who has surprisingly aged in just a few minutes, is attacked by a frantic Holliston, who tries in vain to destroy his malformed creation. together with your unborn child. All this is accompanied by squeaky tires, roaring engines, a car fire and many sirens. The unstable end - a group of paramedics working frantically in Victoria as Holliston writhes and laments - is more laborious than creepy. <br /> <br /> Although it was only made in 1976, this film is very old-fashioned. The only difference between this and the many films of scientists of the 1940s is that Hudson plays the lead role instead of Boris Karloff. The sets are quite cheap and very outdated for today's audience, to the extent that the Hudson reel-to-reel tape recorder is the size of a refrigerator. Much of the action takes place in a poorly lit laboratory. Hudson walks asleep through his sordid paper, giving the impression that he is really a ramshackle movie star, while Ladd and Carrera are much more credible. Surprisingly, Roddy McDowall appears briefly as a chess player. <br /> <br /> The transfer of Passport Video is very poor, as it seems that it was made from a poor VHS copy with domestic equipment. If you feel nostalgic for 1976, look at this once just to say that you did it. Otherwise, watch a football game or a soap opera.
