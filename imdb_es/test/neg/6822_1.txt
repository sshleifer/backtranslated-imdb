I'm sitting here watching the movie, Tango and Cash. It led to a discussion about other great films of the late 80's. The ridiculous Tunrer and Hooch, came the K9 connection. <br /> <br /> Of course, I have never seen K9PI and if I still value my life, I never will. Joshua cites this as his movie of the year. Wow. Wow. I am absolutely amazed that this movie exists. But much more than that, the fact that Joshua likes this movement disturbs me to the core. I think Joshua is an interesting kid. <br /> <br /> K9 <br /> <br /> K9
