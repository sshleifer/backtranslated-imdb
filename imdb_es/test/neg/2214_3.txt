This is one of the dumbest things I've seen in my life. She may not be the worst fighter in history, but if you have not seen so many bad ones, this could easily make your Top Ten Worst List. When you consider what was achieved in 1933 with the original "King Kong", you must ask why someone would lean so low as to produce this debacle. Then, taking a step further and realizing that the quantum leap to "Star Wars" the following year reached a new level in science fiction entertainment, this offer will make you laugh and cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Now let me ask you, what would the Professor (Peter Cushing) have to carry an umbrella as a main piece of underground research equipment for the trip to the core of the earth? OK, so it was useful to defend against the parrot / tyrannosaur (parrotosaurus?) At first, but let's go. Somehow, I do not think this is what Edgar Rice Burrough had in mind when he wrote his Pellucidar stories. Probably did not have Caroline Munro in mind as the Princess Day, probably the only redeeming factor of this whole adventure. <br /> <br /> At least there was a bit of pseudoscientific explanation that kicked me out. of; I'm always looking for one in movies like this. That would have to be how the sky in the center of the earth was really the lower part of the earth's crust, explaining that ethereal pinkish glow. But as much as it seems, the story simply could not hook me to find something interesting about Hoojah the Crafty or Jubal the Ugly, let alone those creatures of half man and half pterodactyl. To paraphrase the good teacher: "You can not hypnotize me, I'm paying attention!"
