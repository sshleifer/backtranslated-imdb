I got to the middle of the movie and I was very disappointed. It was simply boring and completely unrealistic. I can go from being unrealistic in many movies, but not when it is supposed to be a criminal drama. The collection of evidence and the interview processes were simply strange. I started to move fast to see how it ended. And then I got bored with that and just turned it off and gave it back. The main character, played by Ellen Barkin, simply was not believable at all. Peta Wilson performed very well in this movie, but his character was out there and there was no one for his talent to act.
