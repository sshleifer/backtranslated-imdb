This movie is boring, boring, boring, boring and boring! It's not the worst movie I've seen, on the contrary, but ... how can I put this ...? IT IS BIRTH! There are some very beautiful landscapes and a bit of dry wit, but that's it. If it were advertised as a travel journal, I would rate it as a 7, but it is supposed to be a movie with an argument, some drama and, for God's sake, a satisfactory point or conclusion. The comments on this board about these movies and I wondered if they saw the same movie as me. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie (yawn) at your own risk ........ one thing for sure- it's really classified correctly = G QUALIFICATION! (That most represents GOD BORING!)
