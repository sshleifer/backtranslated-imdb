I really do not care about the creative ideas interposed in these films, but seriously. There is not a coherent part of the game in this movie. That seems to be the trend, buy the rights and then make a movie that has nothing to do with what fans want. This carnage is almost entertaining because you know you're running away from hiding behind the lack of skill and control of money (not yours) that allows you to do this. Play a game, or hire someone to do it, and please make a real movie, or stay in the boxing ring and receive your butt while you claim it will not happen. <br /> <br /> wow, 9 lines of text and I was done. I had to add blah to bother you, I'm sorry
