There were only two redeeming features about this movie; The beauty of Bucharest and its architecture, and the way they represented the transformation of the human form to the form of a wolf. Forget about the plot or the plot of the book, they are completely absent in this movie. In fact, the only things that are transferred from the book are the names of the main players. Even then you will hardly recognize the characterizations. If the filmmakers had made a good movie, even if it was not related to the book, I would not have been disappointed. Unfortunately, they did not. The plot and the plot are typical of low budget horror films, the performance is wooden and the efforts of the management are mundane. Oh, yes, the way the loup garou bows to its leader is pure joke. I guess a greeting of recognition is due to the animal caretakers. The wolves were beautiful animals and well managed in their roles.
