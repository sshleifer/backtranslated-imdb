Curse of the Wolf begins when the werewolf Dakota (Renee Porada) refuses to escape from his 'herd' and gets into the city where, 6 months later, he works at a veterinarian. The rest of the Dakota herd are disgruntled and they want her back, their leader Michael (Todd Humes) says they will come back with them, but the fat Werewolf Franklin (Brian Heffron) picks up his scent and the herd decides to force the problem and get it back using her affections for her human friends, including her boyfriend Danny (Dennis Carver). Can Dakota save Danny and finally get rid of his werewolf pursuers? I doubt you care ... <br /> <br /> Produced by an executive, written and directed by Len Kabasinski, who also had a fairly important role in the film while Stick I was afraid to see Curse of the Wolf since Kabasinski was the man behind Swamp Zombies (2005), which is surely one of the worst movies ever made. Unfortunately, my worst fears were confirmed and it must be said that Curse of the Wolf is a really horrible movie in every way, both conceptually and technically. Curse of the Wolf is the kind of movie where the low budget dictates what happens and the script instead of the script that dictates the budget. You have the impression that everything was written and conceived to take advantage of the few sets and actors that you have, you can almost imagine the creators saying that we have some actors, some basic equipment and a couple of places, so let's make a horror. movie around him. The story is horrible (Michael finds the location of Dakota looking at a big dog with two women going out for a walk), the character is horrible (a big fat man of a werewolf who pulls a lot), the dialogue is horrible (almost all line in the thing) and there is never any motivation for something to happen (why is the pack so desperate to get Dakota back?), people just do seemingly random things and as the background of director Kabasinski is in the martial arts , insists on inserting a lot Martial arts combat the sequences in the plot. Do not be offended, but it's a horror movie, not martial arts, is not it? In fact, apart from the presence of a few werewolves, it would be very difficult to describe Curse of the Wolf as approaching a horror movie. With almost two hours in duration, it seems to last an eternity and is so slow and uneventful that it is not funny. <br /> <br /> Director Kabasinski was obviously working on a low budget, but making such a bad movie should be a crime. There is no continuity between the shots, the fight scenes look horrible and they are so poorly prepared that it is not true and, sometimes, it is impossible to follow what happens, either by the choppy editing and the deficient camera angles or the fact that sometimes it's so dark I can not see anything. Seriously, there are moments during Curse of the Wolf in which the screen is totally black and you can not see anything, I would hate to have to sit and watch this on a blurry low resolution VHS. The sound is also horrible, you can hear the wind and the breeze against the microphone! There are also many other unpleasant and unwanted environmental sounds in almost every scene. Did the production really have any lighting equipment when doing this? It does not feel that way. The special effects consist mainly of the werewolf mask that looks like the kind of things that stores sell on Halloween for children, basically, they look awful. <br /> <br /> Technically, Curse of the Wolf is as bad as they come, I'm sorry because I know this was on a low budget, but it's really horrible to sit down and try to get some entertainment. This is the quality of high school film students, I'm sorry if that sounds unkind but it's a fact. The acting is, well, you can probably guess, so I'll stop right here before I say something negative, I mean I've done enough of that already and it really does not give me pleasure. <br /> <br /> Curse of the Wolf is terrible, both conceptually and technically this is a real task to sit on. Curse of the Wolf is the kind of film in which, although the time to see it seems to stop, is the kind of film that lasts almost two hours and feels like two years. One of the worst movies that you or I could see, definitely one that we should avoid.
