A previous critic of IMDb has declared that 'Rafter Romance' is a 'scam' (that is the term of the other critic) of a German musical called 'Me By Day, You By Night'. Apparently that critic does not know that * both * of these films have taken their premise of 'Box and Cox', an English play written by John Maddison Morton in 1847. This work deals with two merchants who rent the same room to a landlady without scruples, each man believing himself the only tenant. Because the two men have different work schedules, the ruse is not discovered immediately. This work was once so popular in Britain that 'a Box and Cox it' became a common term for an agreement in which two people voluntarily shared accommodations for a single person. <br /> <br /> The innovation of 'Rafter Romance' (and its predecessor) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman, who inevitably develop a romance. As usual in these cornball movies, the boy and the girl detest each other until they fall into his arms. Hoo boy <br /> <br /> The pattern of this film is played by George Sidney, a character actor who specialized in interpreting Jewish stereotypes that should be comprehensive. George Sidney was never as annoying as the odious Harry Green (the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit), but the depictions of Jewish Sidney characters are still exaggerated and shameful to watch. <br /> <br /> The most notable thing about 'Rafter Romance' is that, as far as I know, this is the first Hollywood movie that makes reference to Hitler and the rise of Nazism. At one point in this movie, owner Eckbaum (Sidney) discovers that his son Julius was involved in swastikas on the walls. Eckbaum and his son are clearly destined to be Jews. It is true that no one in Hollywood in 1933 had a real idea of ​​what Hitler was planning for Jews in Europe ... even so, it is surprising to see a movie that shows a Jewish teenager who thinks swastikas are a joke. His father is, very appropriately, angry at this display of the Nazi symbol. <br /> <br /> A very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the documented fact that all major Hollywood studios continued to do business with the Third Reich. as early as 1939. Hollywood's leading ladies were medically documented as 'arias' so that their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria. For the same reason, Hollywood's leading men were documented as 'Aryans and uncircumcised'. With the exception of Darryl Zanuck in Twentieth Century-Fox, all the executives of the Hollywood studios who participated in this policy were Jews ... but they clearly had no objection to doing business with Hitler. I am surprised that 'Rafter Romance' contains a scene that shows the swastikas as unfavorable, since this sequence would have rendered the film Verboten in Germany and Austria. (Maybe the scene was cut for the premiere in Germany: it's not crucial to the plot of the movie). Apart from this, the film contains nothing remarkable. Robert Benchley makes his usual characterization, dazed and bewildered: I have never understood the attractiveness of this man. I will rate 'Rafter Romance' 4 out of 10.
