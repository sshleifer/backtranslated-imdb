They give you the configuration and then they kill you with a constant chase of the cat and the mouse. The main characters are involved in a constant confrontation in which they threaten each other, every five minutes or less. And I would like to see the police force that would allow one of its policemen to take out the A. Garc√≠a bit. It's as if a local policeman pulled Charlie Manson out of prison to go have a cup of coffee. Be realistic!
