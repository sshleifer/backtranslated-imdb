Well, I would probably agree with all the negative comments about this movie because, honestly, I thought it was crap, I mean the actors had done a terrible acting job and the script was terrible. Although the special effects were not a little bad, but I think they should have thought a lot more than that. I mean how Clara Bryant was successfully put on this movie. I mean I would do much better if I looked a little more and that goes the same with Kristen, I mean that her character dies and does not bother trying. defend, I mean, it has to be a total joke. At least he should do much better than what he would like to do, become a soldier or more than a heroine or something like bravery. But the point is that the actors did a lousy job without a soul, like the director and the writer who made this movie. They should have gone to film school to think of better ideas and I hope everyone agrees with my methods because they are probably thinking the same thing.
