Since 1988, Touch Of Death is probably the most frustrating film of Fulci that I've seen to date, which prompted me to join the chorus of horror fans who generalize that their films get worse as they advance in their careers. Considering the synopsis of the plot, I expected some evil and bloody fun with it, but despite its extravagant buds, it feels tedious even at a run time of only 80 minutes, and suffers from dexterity production values and the art of making films. (or lack thereof). <br /> <br /> The Story: a widowed gamer addicted to rich (and strange) women's wines and dinners found in the columns of lonely hearts before offending them in a horrible way, sometimes by eating or feeding them. animals - and stealing your money to keep your debtors at bay. Of course, it is unlikely that only one man is the host of a pathology so fucked at the same time (addict, psycho / sociopath, cannibal), but this is Fulci! <br /> <br /> Actually, the touch is the cheapest and the most scarce-looking Fulci movie I've seen. There is hardly anyone in it, even in the background of street shots, for example. A newsreader who continues to appear on the movie's televisions to warn the nonexistent cast about the maniac's latest actions operates from the most pathetic television studio on the planet. He does not even look at the camera because he has to read all the holders of misaligned sheets of paper. <br /> <br /> Some scenes follow and the protagonist continues to mutter to himself what he has done or what he has done. about to do it, but the performance is not good enough to sustain this kind of thing, so the main result is boredom of the viewer. The movie also looks insipid and ugly in general. I read that it was intended to be an Italian telemovie (was it screened in that place? With the amount of blood involved, it seems unlikely), and it stinks of the old shitty telemovie production values. <br /> <br /> This is also Fulci's first foray into absolute black humor, but it is too dull a director to make it work. Sometimes, visibly happy or "crazy" music is used to play in an awful scene, for example, while the hero / villain is carving a dead body in his basement. The effect is not really creepy, neither funny nor ironic, but it is an imbecile. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, some gore redeeming moments (which you can expect while trying to stay awake), including the eventual murder by oven (!) of a woman who simply will not give up on life, even after that his face has been totally shattered with a big bloody club, and a homeless man who makes a car run from one side to another five times. The most outrageous element of Touch, however, is all the physical deformation in the widows courted by the madman. Beards, hairy polka dots, disordered harelips: it's not as if you're looking for women with these characteristics, it's the way all widows of lonely hearts are, it seems. There are many pictures of Mr. Crazy making faces secretly while he is kissing these women. The black humor of such a garish misogyny could have some power or resonance if the film was not so badly executed in general. In the end, Touch Of Death just seems like a really lazy and inarticulate mess.
