Normally, Jane Austen's BBC productions are pretty good, but Northanger Abbey is strange. What were you thinking? This film has little of Austen's charm and ironically mimics the gothic novels that Austen mocked so wonderfully. Not only that, the "gothic" sequences are sticky, exaggerated and downright silly. The actress who plays Miss Morland is badly chosen and has no obvious appeal to attract the attention of an eligible bachelor, and although I quite liked the eerie Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, it does not look anything like the novel, even when offers a direct dialogue of the book. Robert Hardy, like General Tilney, presented one of his few and terrible performances of "ham". This movie was so strange and strange that I actually saw it again just to savor how incredibly wrong it was.
