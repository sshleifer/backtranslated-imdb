I've seen this movie 3 times. Especially because I kept thinking while I saw it, "have I missed something here?" Is there any reason why this movie was made? Was I trying to say something and I missed it? Well, after 3 presentations, I could not find an answer. <br /> <br /> I suppose the worst thing I can say about a movie is that it bored me and I did not finish it. I admit there are a lot of candy for the eyes, fast editing and modern music to keep my attention at all times, but is that all that a movie should be? <br /> <br /> I am not against extreme violence, it is almost constant, but it seems that there should be some kind of inspiration. Something that stands out for it. The free word comes to mind, but it is worse than somehow. In the first part of the film, we are given an idea of ​​the motivations of the characters. And yes, the 3 principles are very good in their roles. But the roles are completely incredible. So in the first part we know the characters, and in the second part most of them die and use sadistic joy to kill others. That seems to be the whole movie. And the first part has nothing to do with the second. <br /> <br /> For example. How could a good smart guy like Zed agree to join a bunch of addicts and fans to do a job like this? Has no sense. He is presented as intelligent, but move on with this suicidal mission. The fact that he survives is totally inconsistent with the rest of the hyperreal violence and chaos. So, what are we seeing here a Hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super violent and super real bloodbath? I remember that I had the same reaction to two other films in which this director participated: True Romance and Reservoir Dogs.
