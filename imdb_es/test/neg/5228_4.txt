Based on a Stephen King novel, NEEDFUL THINGS provides the intrigue and restlessness to keep you in your seat. A mysterious man (Max von Sydow) arrives in the city and soon becomes the most talked citizen. Could it be that the devil himself has established himself as an antique dealer in a small town in Maine? von Sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen. They also star Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia. Harris is stable and Bedelia deserves your attention. Also in support are J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. It is not the best, nor the worst adaptation of King's horror on the screen.
