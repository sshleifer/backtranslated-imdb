A television version of the Heart of Darkness seemed like a good way to add more information to the book, well, that was the wrong assumption. The movie made it even worse. I was very disappointed by almost everything in the movie. I hoped that the movie would possibly help put together the pieces of the book I did not understand, but it did not. It still left me confused and hung up. It's one of those movies that makes us feel like it's more fun watching the grass grow instead of watching the movie. It's not exactly anyone's cup of tea. In general, it was a terrible, boring and slow movie. <br /> <br /> For starters, Nicolas Roeg must have felt quite desperate when he decided he wanted to take on the task of turning the already boring book into a movie. . It is a guaranteed loss. It's like getting into a fight with knives, but forgetting about the knife on the kitchen counter. The person without knives will lose; and in the case, the person without blades was Roeg. Everything I've heard about the movie are bad things, and the movie deserves those bad things that can be said about it. When I saw the film, I had the impression that the people who made it, simply flipped through the book to get the key points. <br /> <br /> Also, although the film did follow the main story of the book. , omitted some details, and also changed the ending. I'm not a fan of that. Roeg stayed outside when Marlow and his crew crossed the Russian sailor's camp, and in that camp they found the book. It was also not noticed when in the camp they found a sign that said: "Wood for you, hurry up, come cautiously" (Conrad 110). In addition, at the end of the book, Kurtz dies in the boat, not in the inner station. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Nicolas Roeg did something good while he was making his film; He managed to hire some pretty decent actors to play in the movie. For example, he acquired Tim Roth and John Malkovich, who would later continue to have successful careers. In doing so, he added a little something to the horrible movie. Also, although I am breaking his book into pieces, I have some respect for him, because it takes a lot of courage to try to face The Heart of Darkness. It's not exactly the easiest novel to portray in a movie. However, make a brave effort! In conclusion, if for some reason someone really wants to see this movie, I suggest reading Heart of Darkness first. In this way, you will get all the scenes that were left out of the movie and you will not lose completely when you see it. But I really suggest that you do not read the book and that you really do not see the movie; Both will be a complete waste of your time. Trust me. My English teacher forced me to do both, and now I wish the book and the film did not exist. If you chase the book or the movie, good luck!
