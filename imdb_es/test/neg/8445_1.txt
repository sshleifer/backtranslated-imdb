WARNING: I advise anyone who has not yet seen the film to not read this comment. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch this movie, DO NOT do it! I warn you ... this movie is TERRIBLEly boring and, basically, horrific, not like in the Horror movie, to see. I confused this Piranha movie with another Piranha movie and when I realized that I made a mistake, I decided to see it anyway. I wish I had not. This movie is so horrible and intolerable in every piece of material that I could not let anyone say that this movie was pretty decent. On the one hand, this movie should be called A boring talk about the desert instead of Piranha. They only show piranhas ONCE! At the same time, the way this movie sounds so poorly listened to, I was sleepy only 20 minutes later. In the end, my mouth was wide open and I looked sadly at the blank TV screen. It's a piece of junk VERY misdirected and poorly filmed that I was afraid I would have a brain dysfunction after seeing it ...
