Do you know those films so indescribably bad that you have to laugh? The mestiza was not one of them. What sounds good, right? But no, it is not. It is not a bad attempt to see a horror movie that is fun to watch because it is scarce, it is not well acted, or it has negative special effects or anything else like that. No, the mestiza is just boring. They do not even try to scare you until the last 20 minutes are. They are just children running through the African jungle and drugged with elephant dung during the first 75% of the movie, and it's not even funny. The last 20 minutes, however, are HILARES. I have no idea what happened, but it was really fun to see how the CGI leopard ripped the throats of all those white guys that I could not differentiate anyway. If you're in the mood for a bad horror movie, do not rent it, because you go to sleep before they get to the fun. If you rent this movie accidentally, I would recommend a quick advance to the end and skip any scene that happens in daylight. You will not lose anything. You will have no idea what character is what or exactly what is happening, even if you look at the whole background story.
