The books of Frederick Forsyth are always so intricately drawn, with twists and turns, and usually a great surprise ending. This adaptation did not have any of that. <br /> <br /> Much of what was great in the book (the story of Monk and the betrayed agents, the plan to influence the outcome of the Russian election) was completely missing in this adaptation. Instead, there is a completely new plot about biological weapons that was already a yawn. <br /> <br /> The protagonists of Forsyth always operated in the shadows, always a little beyond the reach of the antagonists. The joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out his mission. This film was resigned to shootings and car chases from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The Swayze Monk might as well have hung a sign on his neck that said "I AM A SECRET AGENT" for all the attention he called the movie to himself. And with all that attention, the amount of time it took the bad guys to catch up with him was amazing. <br /> <br /> Of course, there was some energy in this movie, so I'm giving it. a "3" instead of a "1". It was also great to see some underutilized professionals like Patrick Bergin, Ben Cross, Michael York and Barry Morse. <br /> <br /> I hope someday, someone will do justice to a film adaptation of Forsyth as "Jackal Day" did.
