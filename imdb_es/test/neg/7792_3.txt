The title is from a passage in the Bible (Deut 28:28). Let's say it takes horribly out of context, but nonetheless, that's where the title of this dying movie originates. The other reviewers cover the details of the plot, so I will not repeat. But the husband, who is a psychiatrist, gives a lecture on "Function inferior" where he analyzes how a person can meet another person and can experience a "cataclysmic crisis" in their lives where they stop being masters of themselves and incapable. of fair judgment. He is saying this on the podium at the exact moment he sets eyes on Leonora Vail in the audience, the woman who will become his mistress. Not too subtle to show that this is really what will happen to this poor man. <br /> <br /> I think the whole premise of the film is unlikely and it just did not work. Here is a psychiatrist on the hill, and we must believe that this beautiful young woman falls in love with him and stands between the happiness that he and his wife shared. What is even more unlikely is how the betrayed wife responds when she finds out about infidelity. She not only understands, but INSISTS her husband to embark on a vacation of several months with the tramp, "so that we can all feel a little relief from this unbearable stress." GIVE ME A BREAK!! I wanted to get through the screen and control not only the adulterer but also the dumb wife. <br /> <br /> The fact that the whole movie takes place like a flashback after it has already revealed the end of the movie at the beginning. (the fact that the husband had a terrible accident) - leaves no doubt as to the outcome of the sordid affair. I think this was a bad decision, since it leaves absolutely no turn in the plot to wait, since the whole movie is completely predictable. You know the wife's resignation to the affair at the beginning of the film, since she summons the mistress to the bedside of the dying man and expresses no ill will toward her. <br /> <br /> Not only is the script faulty, but Noel Coward is horribly grumpy (although it's HIS script). He and Leonora have absolutely no chemistry on the screen at all. It's interesting that Michael Redgrave was originally chosen for that role, but he was replaced during filming. I wonder what it was about? In the end, neither the husband nor the wife make him feel sympathy for any of them. I think Margaret Leighton played the part of the whore pretty well. But she could not overcome all the negative aspects of this movie. In addition, as is the case with many British productions of this era, dialogue is difficult to understand due to the fast and clipped pattern of the actors' speech. I saw it on TV and I could not even trust the subtitles to fill in the blanks for me. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this.
