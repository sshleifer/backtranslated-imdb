The hockey game I play and watch has something called "speed" that the real hockey scenes in this lame film do not even come close to capturing. Add to that a story that is clich√©d, predictable and more stupid than stupid with some of the most deaf music of the 80s that numbs your senses in every scene and has "Youngblood". Oh, Keanu as a French Canadian, yes, whatever. Give me Dunlop, Braden and the Hansons at any time ... ONE OF TEN.
