This movie can best be described as a very long episode of a very bad comedy. How many vaguely humorous misunderstandings can get into a single movie? The notes are misplaced, the bags are changed, the conversations are heard badly, people get confused, situations are misinterpreted and at some point people are supposed to laugh at something. The writers are really struggling to keep everything going, which makes the dialogues really feel forced. If someone in this film acted like a real person, all this would be resolved in about two minutes or so and everyone could return to their lives, but they have to keep up the misunderstandings. Sometimes, this movie also tries to go for some youthful laughter, but all it does is remind you about how funny "American Pie" was. The scene with the nerd telling the prostitute (who he thinks is an exchange student) to "eat his sausage" continues forever, not a second of that is fun. However, I have to give some credit to this movie: due to the secondary plot about the stolen money, it is not as boring as it could have been. He also laughs here and there, but then, unfortunately, returns to another character who misinterprets. In general, this movie is too loose.
