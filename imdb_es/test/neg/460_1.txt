Alien was excellent. Many writers tried to copy it. Everyone did a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the worst alien copy. Due to the bad actors, the bad special effects, the BAD scene and other bad things (it would take approximately 3 pages to tell all that is bad in this movie) The film was not very long and this is a very good thing (the only one You can not laugh because it's too serious ... that's a bad thing because, in almost all of the B-series sci-fi movies, you can laugh all the time, sometimes it can be great, but instead of seeing this stupidity , just watch Alien or Event Horizon ... they are much better! I give it 1 out of 5.
