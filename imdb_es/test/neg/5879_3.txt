I picked up this movie because it caught my attention like a movie with a Jewish comedy focus, something I had not seen before. <br /> <br /> I approached this movie with an open mind and I was interested in the way it started. The opening is well organized, and the first half of the movie gave me many reasons to laugh, and this is good. <br /> <br /> However, the mood soon became repetitive, the plot became confused and tense, and I realized that I was no longer enjoying the movie. I tried to avoid saying this, but the movie became rather "cheap": it is not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor is maintained, but it was not like that. I confess that I may have lost some humor, not being Jewish and having little experience with Jewish culture. However, considering how much most of the humor was telegraphed in this movie, it is unlikely that I missed much. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, and maybe if you thought a bit more about the movie it would have been observable all the time. I wish I could give the movie a higher rating, but strictly speaking, it would have been better as a television series or a series of parodies. There just was not enough fresh material for a long-running movie. <br /> <br /> One thing to say about the casting: the main role seemed to have been designed with Ben Stiller in mind, but no I do not think the film would have been worth it if it had been in it.
