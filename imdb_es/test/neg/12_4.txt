Blake Edwards tried to change the image of Julie Andrews in this movie. He tried to make her sexy without realizing that he already was. I think they were both a little upset that Julie had not been chosen to film her Camelot Broadway success and that she was not sexy enough. Unfortunately, they chose this vehicle to try to mitigate this belief. It gets to the point where it's almost fun to see Rock Hudson, who we all know was now gay, kissing Julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie. It seems that now they were not only trying to make you believe that Julie was a fatal woman, but that Rock was heterosexual. Unfortunately, they do not have any kind of chemistry together and the endless kissing scenes begin to entangle one. The other mistake they made with this image was not knowing what kind of movie they were making. It's almost three separate movies. There's Julie's drama as the German spy trying to get military secrets from Rock. There is an air war movie with many images of old World War I aircraft and the stupid attempts at humor that Blake Edwards seems to think he has to insert into each of his images, whether appropriate or not. , was not. The only truly redeeming qualities of this film are to look at the always lovely Dame Julie and hear her sing in that clear bell soprano. Of course, if you love her, you can ignore the weaknesses of this movie just for her. You can always tell yourself, later, that it was much better than sitting through STAR!
