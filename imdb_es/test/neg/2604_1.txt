I must admit that I enjoyed the previous episodes, but probably because I was younger and stupid at the time. I was a little excited about the return of the family boy until I saw the "new" crap they were throwing. No wonder, it was exactly like the old shit. All the lame jokes were there, including the flash backs, except this time they added a joke about an old and chilling pedophile that seems to be in EVERY EPISODE. This is just one of the annoying gags that the family type lives, and for some reason people keep watching. It's not fun anymore, it's just annoying. let him die. <br /> <br /> Maybe the family type was fun at any given time, and the cheap jokes and laughs were original and fresh, but now it's not fun anymore. If you really find the kid in the family fun, then you must be delayed or in the limit.
