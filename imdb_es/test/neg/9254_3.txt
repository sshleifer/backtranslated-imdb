I saw this movie simply because of the fact that it was on the DPP Video Nasty list, and although I'm glad I saw it because it's now 'another Nasty Video Down' - on its own merits, Andy Milligan's movie really is not. It's worth bothering with. There are, of course, much worse movies on the infamous list; but that does not make the pain of seeing this easier. The film was obviously filmed with an extremely low budget, and that has been translated into the script; As Blood Rites works on an idea that is often seen in horror movies, and does nothing new with it. Basically, the plot focuses on three couples who are in a house waiting for the results of a will. It's not long before they start being eliminated ... blah blah blah. For most of the movie, nothing happens; and then, when we finally get to the scenes that justify banning the film, they are so amateurish and foolish that they are impossible to take seriously at any level. It is very good that this film does not have a very long execution time, since otherwise it could have been used as a particularly unpleasant method of torture. Everything comes down to a suitably tedious ending, which also manages to be an event without epic proportions. Apparently, this movie is still banned here in the UK; but somehow I doubt it's because of its shock value. Basically, the blood rites are not worth seeing and personally I do not see any reason to recommend them. Unless, of course, you have made your business see everything on Nasty Video's list ...
