There's nothing spoiling here, but this could be a SPOILER, so be careful. <br /> <br /> Special effects were at the level of a video game, about five years ago, or perhaps the original Star Trek. The performance was simply pathetic: a cheesy blonde who walked through the desert while a background voice sounded. And in. And in. This was half the walk and the drone that I really managed. Progress is interrupted by some fights. The ships explode each other without any real reason that is apparently episodic. Again, it is not that there is a real fight that would be expected from a movie, more like a cheap video game. Boi-ing! Boi-ing! The ship explodes. Next ship. Apparently, some of the boats are looking for the blonde. Here, in the distant future, ships must be myopic and astigmatic because many of them pass directly over the futuristic baby dressed in black, but never see it. <br /> <br /> Then there are a couple of choreographed fights that look like something the kids in high school put on. Again, the raw mentality of video games is prominent. The combatants change to "Fight mode" by flipping something on their wrists, and a strong computerized voice echoes and blinks in "Fight mode". That should be an elegant design if you try to sneak up on someone. Then, go to a large power station that looks like a current day power line tower and plug it in to recharge it. LOL, I'm not kidding, you can not do this, it's like watching a 2000 video game, only that the acting is better in the game. <br /> <br /> More trekking. Then she appears in "The City". (Lame sound trek becomes even more relaxed here.) He gets into a fight with a robot mech of the future who can not hit her with his big gun, although he runs right in front of him, about five feet in front of him. Obviously, the robots of the distant future are as useful as roasting ovens in a fight. She throws sand in his eyes and beats her to death by throwing rocks at him. rofl, I was at approximately 95% tolerance at that point, my nausea was illuminated in red. <br /> <br /> In the next scene she ends up tied to a rocket with a rope. I'm not kidding you, tied just outside a rocket. It is assumed that this is an advanced form of transportation. At that moment I ran away. <br /> <br /> This movie is a total shame for a movie made in the present moment. Only one damn misfortune. There was a trickle story, but the movie was distracted from it, someone who talked about "mother" constantly. <br /> <br /> I gave him a two because there were some scenes that showed some rather pretty illustrations of a science fiction nature as background. Unfortunately, the plot, the acting, the action, the cinematography and the narrative were distracted from this work of art and degraded it. Seriously.
