Only three words are required for this revision: A piece of shit. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed watching the caricature of a child, you will find that this movie is a complete waste of time and money. The best of your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet stuck to the floor. <br /> <br /> Yes, they use all the names and phrases of help. The name for the dog "Shoeshine" (in reference to the dog is "shoe cleaner" in the cartoon). They name the love interest Polly, but she is not Miss Sweet Polly Purebred. <br /> <br /> My wife and son drugged me to see this. They should have drugged me to see it. <br /> <br /> The original Underdog was voiced by Wally Cox, the best nerd. This is expressed by someone with an attitude of "intelligent, intelligent adolescent who knows more than all adults". <br /> <br /> As an independent film, it's horrible. As a tribute to Underdog, it's even worse. It is not a tribute. It is not a retelling of the story. It is not an update of the story. It is simply an attempt to capitalize on a known title and create a commercialization. The next time I go to the store, I'm afraid I'll see Underdog toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothes, etc. McDonalds and Burger King probably fought over children's food rights for this. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie, however, is the soundtrack. THEY MAKE THE SONG TO TAKE A LOST TO RAPP (read that with a silent "C" at the beginning). Great, now that we're going to destroy something, let's go to the end. <br /> <br /> I knew it would probably be bad before I left. My fears were confirmed when I arrived at my local complex 12 and discovered that they opened it on the first day and showed themselves for the first time in their smallest auditorium (and one of only four without seats in the stadium). Even theater people knew it was going to be garbage! Save money on tickets and invest it better by buying the original series on DVD. It will be more entertaining and will have better production values.
