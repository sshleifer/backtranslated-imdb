Spoiler warning !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably my least favorite movie of Cary Grant. I spent most of my time thinking: ignore it, abandon it, etc. Are you trying to kill her? Should we assume that after the end, when he convinces her to return home with him, that he will kill her after all? Seeing in a couple of books, I see that this is a reading that some viewers / critics have taken. Ending early is, after all, a more reasonable way of filming a book, than changing the ending, and this is a more unreasonable change of completion than, say, in Altman's The Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's previous example of making the killer not the killer because a star has been cast (when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, the murderous habits of Ivor Novello are not mentioned) the end of the book is not definitively ruled out . <br /> <br /> In Robin Wood's Hitchcock's Films Revisited, he writes: "As one 'changes' mentally from end to end, the meaning of each scene changes, the apparent solidity of the narrative dissolves, the The illusion of the "reality" of fiction becomes a "modernist" text in which the narrative process is at the forefront ". I enjoy playing games of intellectual interpretation as much as any other person, but unless the film stops in a direct reading, then it fails. This fails Even after considering the fatal milk vessels that are repeated in some Hitchcock films. <br /> <br /> An annoying complaint. The year is 1941. Nothing in the movie says that it is set in the past. Beaky (Nigel Bruce) keeps his money in a bank in Paris and will do financial business. Do not you know there's a war? In fact, were there still flights from Croydon Airport? Is he on good terms with the Nazis? How is it possible that it is never suggested that the Germans shot him as a spy or something? <br /> <br /> A curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina have dinner with Isobel, the mysterious writer, and his brother, the pathologist, there is a fifth person present, who never explains or introduces himself: a woman in a tuxedo. The credits say that she is Nondas Metcalf playing Phyllis Swinghurst. Is not this an example of how lesbians were encoded in the films of the 1940s? Are we going to take her as Isobel's lover? The books that deal with open gays and lesbians hidden in Hitchcock (for example, Robin Wood again) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.
