Maybe, we are too attached to the big shows when we learn about the antiquity brought to the screen. Maybe, we expect too much from these movies. However, if we, as spectators, are offered very little, what happens then? <br /> <br /> That's what I thought after seeing IMPERIUM - NERONE by Paul Marcus, a part of the production series about the Roman Empire. AUGUSTO by Roger Young, the first IMPERIUM film, included at least Peter O'Toole, but what does this film include? <br /> <br /> Almost nothing accurate. The historical errors are so serious that the film changes the facts and constitutes rather a distorted image of the Roman Empire than the true story. Throughout the film, we see Nero young: young during the supposedly long reign of Caligula, young during the reign of Claudius and finally during his own reign (historically 14 years). And ... it dies the same. According to the film, Nero, born during the reign of Tiberius, has lived for more than 40 years, but seems to be in his last twenty years when he dies ... The continuity combined with the invented story is the biggest problem of the film, that makes it not logical, not to say reliable. Nero loses his father, he is raised by slaves. At that time, his mother, Agripina, is exiled by Caligula. Later, however, she suddenly marries the Emperor Claudius, who already has large children with Messalina newly married to him. In these moments of the film, we see Acte (Rike Schmid), Nero's mistress. Okay, it's historically "exact"; however, no source demonstrates that he played such a decisive role in the rise of Christianity in Rome. In the film, she is not only a Christian devotee, but also a witness to the miracle of Saint Paul (he brings a young Marzia back to life). In addition, historically, nothing was seen like Nero in the court of Caligula, since Nero was born in the reign of 4 years of Caligula (A.D. 37-41). I understand that movies can change something, but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable! And many, many other content-related deficiencies that are hard to list, but after 30 minutes of watching this movie, I doubted whether I was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy. <br /> <br /> As for their artistic features that provide us with entertainment, they are just as bad as the story here. The performances are artificial, the cast simply has beautiful faces but weak acting skills. Maybe, I'm too attached to Peter Ustinov or Charles Laughton in the lead, but Hans Matheson does not fit like Nero at all. I could have some of the good times as an actor, but never as the infamous Roman emperor. Is he an artist who burns Rome for a song? Is he a cynic who disguises the love of his family? Is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for "supposed justice"? None of those. He is just a young man who does not know how to govern and, in the long run, he begins to release the fire that burns inside himself ... John Simm is out of place in this film as Caligula and absolutely inferior to other representations of the character . Elisa Tovati is as sexy as Poppaea; however, she could have been much better. The costumes are inaccurate and the sets are not surprising. The low budget results in low effects and, consequently, low entertainment. <br /> <br /> But what angered me most in this movie and, as a result, I give it 1/10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable: <br /> <br /> - the death of Poppea and the Paul's conversation with Nero on his body, <br /> <br /> - Claudio's mention of Britannia's current conquest of the party and his death soon (he conquered Britannia while Messalina was his wife long before his death). death), <br /> <br /> - Tigellinus killing Agrippina (Laura Morante), the mother of Nero, <br /> <br /> - Nero's arguments in the speech before senators, <br /> < br /> - finally, the death of Nero - a quiet day on the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral of Acte: "Let's forgive him" <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a waste of time and is absolutely unnecessary as another production more about the Roman Empire. It is better to make a good film in 30 years than ten children in 5 years. 1/10 - it should not have been done at all.
