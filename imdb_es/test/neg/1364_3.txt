Being a big fan of horror movies and I always find something good about an image, but this movie just did not capture my interest or attention. This story revolves around a father and his daughter and a girlfriend, since his wife died a few years ago. These people find themselves in a horrible situation in a city they stop and visit, and all the elderly people in this city unite against these people and almost kill them. This movie reminded me of a movie called "Children of Corn" because it really involves children who are being introduced to Satan and are their instruments of terror. There are a lot of chants, mambo jumble and a toy tank that completely destroys the whole family in his truck, as well as dolls that kill a husband and wife.
