Oh!! What a mess we have here. It is not so much a mess as an excuse for exploitation painfully boring, half-heartedly. Presented by the only one, J. G. "Pat" Patterson, yes, the same as Moonshine Mountain. Dr. Gore, formerly known as The Body Shop, I think it's something inspired by Frankenstein, and God knows what else. The late Mr. Patterson also stars in this joke, as an afflicted scientist / plastic surgeon, who recently lost his wife in a car accident, and goes mad with pain, to the point that it becomes clear that the next step is massacre at innumerable females, then maybe steal some tombs by body parts, to "put together" the perfect couple. It will not be easy, but thank God, your friend Gregg, the hunchback is available to lend a hand and offer moral support. <br /> <br /> If ever evidence was needed that the goals of some villages are not meant to be Met, here it is, gang. This patter of Patterson, obviously, never had any business directing anything, much less, following in the footsteps of Good Ol'HG as a gore teacher. I've never seen a bloody film that simply refuses to give the viewer a single reason to keep watching. Even blood is boring. Almost remotely humorous at times, but impossible to tell if it is intentional or not. I chose "no". <br /> <br /> filmed in Charolotte, North Carolina (headquarters of the California ax massacre), probably, with a 3-digit budget, by a man, without talent as he may have been, who I probably appreciated the garbage, so maybe we should give JG a good rest, I mean, he tried (I guess) it's more than you can say for most, and this movie is better than any of the trash superheroes of big budget that theaters launch these days, although, I realize that does not say much. In addition, Doctor Gore is much better than Patterson's previous failure, The Electic Chair, so it is unlikely that he would have improved his trade on time, if he had not died, so it may not be so terrible, especially in comparison with the other movie on the DVD, How to make a doll, and what the heck, take a look. 4/10
