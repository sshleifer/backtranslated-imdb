Try not to see this. I thought it was going to be good because I'm a big fan of the cheesy movies of the 80s and I've enjoyed a little of Linnea Quigley's work. I was wrong. I should have said "no" and seen Gigli in his place, which is probably a much better movie. I guess my biggest problem with this movie was his attempt at humor. None of that was funny or even funny. The acting is bad, even for the movies of the queen of the eighties. There is no story, only random clips. I guess I should not hate it so much because it was only made as a fun and silly piece, but I did not have fun and did not entertain myself once. I even had to move quickly to the end to overcome all the crap. I'm sorry, but I do not find funny zombies doing aerobics.
