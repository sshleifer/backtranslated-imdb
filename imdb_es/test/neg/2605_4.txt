This could have been great. The voice-overs are exactly correct and fit the characters to a T. However, there is a small problem; The appearance of the characters, mostly secondary characters or guests, looks exactly the same. The same bored appearance on all faces only with minor changes, such as air lines or weight size. It seems a bit strange to see the voice of a great guest star coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here. If I'm not mistaken, Kathy Griffin did a voiceover for this show and it seemed too weird to be fun. <br /> <br /> There are some other problems, one of them is the family plot. The Simpsons did it much better, where you can actually buy most of the situations the characters got into. Here we have too many annoying distractions, like someone who has a strange fantasy and then we're supposed to find it funny, but for some reason, the delivery is a little out of place. As you can probably tell, it's hard for me to point out exactly what is wrong with this program because basically it's just a clone of the Simpsons or even more "Married with children". <br /> <br /> If I have to point out with my finger what is totally wrong with this, it is probably its repetitiveness. Peter Griffin is not really a brilliant character, but neither is any of the others. Lois should have been named Lois Lame because she is a kind of one-dimensional. Seth Green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this program and that is the most stereotyped part of the program. <br /> <br /> So, what else can I say? There is not exactly anything wrong with this program, but in the long run you must admit that a lot of work is needed to do what the Simpsons have done for almost two decades.
