The problem with this movie is that it is trying to compile a movie of more than 6 hours in 2 hours. The result is clear. It seems too forced, unclear and too simple. <br /> <br /> The only positive side is the beginning. Explain why and how Hercules was born. The rest of the movie was ... just a mumbo jumbo that came together. It has the potential to be a great movie like LOTR if it just does not force in 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The performance is not very convincing either. Ok not everything is bad But most of them are. The special effects are stupid and it seems that they are made ten years before (although the first monster is pretty good) In general, I give it 4 out of ten for the reasons I described above.
