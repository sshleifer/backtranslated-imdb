I totally agree that recreations kill what might otherwise be a great show. I admit that last season I had seen 1 or 2 episodes and it was not clear at all that everything had been recreated. But when I recently caught an episode, it suddenly jumped at me BIG TIME and I lost interest immediately. Then I noticed the disclaimer at the beginning before an episode that followed. Has anyone followed the program close enough to tell me, in fact they made the "acting" and the recreation of parts more artificial on purpose, or did I just not notice it before? Usually, I'm pretty good at feeling this, but the recent episode was so obviously artificial that I almost tripped over it. Now I have no interest in looking and I have completely renounced it. It simply has no real value if it is all scripted and acted. And at least lately, it seems VERY badly written and acted. The previous comment that says who cares if all the recreations are, I do it. Without visual truth, this is just a lot of "you know what happened, once this guy", says here. It is better to read the information in a book.
