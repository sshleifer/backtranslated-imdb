Post 1988, after the disaster, the films of GJS Amitabh lost the quality they had previously <br /> <br /> By excluding MAIN AZAAD HOON released in 1989, which was a great break for the cinema, all films were garbage, except HUM (1991) later in 1991 <br /> <br /> This is another one of Amitabh's bad movies that people rejected in the early 90s <br /> <br /> The movie he made as a token of friendship for Shashi Kapoor, who directed the film and did not give him a dime. The film also had Rishi and Dimple (once again they did not pair with each other after RANBHOOMI) <br /> <br /> The film was produced in 1991 when Bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops including INDRAJEET, AKAYLA, AJOOBA <br /> <br /> Ajooba came 2 years after TOOFAN and JAADUGAR, both supernatural movies that were rejected. This is another type of garbage that Bachchan wears a mask and a Krissh type outfit and makes the magic change from 1 person to a donkey. the special effects, but the film is too bad to see it <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor's direction is not good Musi C is bad <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Amitabh had aged too much in 1991 and he looked tired, his performance is fine, but he is not on par with his best Rishi is fine. Dimple is fine, the rest is forgettable.
