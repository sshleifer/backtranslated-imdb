This movie was terrible. John Wayne is a brutal actor sometimes. The female protagonist who played the role of "Maura" did a good job and did everything possible to make the scenes believable despite the inept Wayne, one-dimensional, about the performance. Seriously, did you see him when he was supposed to be talking while he slept? Ridiculous. And his character became such a horrible person in the second half of the movie and then did nothing to atone for his behavior and is still forgiven by everyone, including his archenemy, without even a "sorry". The story was completely implausible. We were supposed to believe that two adult men, both tremendous successes in their respected camps, would sabotage a job and risk the lives of innocent men simply because they did not like others. You can select any scene at random and it will probably leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone paid money to make this movie. It's a shame because the only other Wayne movies I've seen are the shooter and Rio Bravo, which were great movies. Unless they pay you, do not bother looking at this one.
