I enjoyed The Wrecking Crew (1999), which was the last of the three films in this series (the first was Urban Menace (1999), which I have not seen yet). I know it was a baaaaad, but the three tracks did a pretty decent job, considering everything. <br /> <br /> This, however, was really atrocious. Ice-T was terrible, and he is the producer! I can not say I've heard of Silkk The Shocker (who apparently never learned to spell), but his performance was one of the worst I've seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Miss Jones She did quite well in her small role, although later she continued to make some racist and atrocious "jokes" on her radio show after the Asian tsunami (more other times, unfortunately). That's right, girl ... <br /> <br /> No one else comes out with any credit. Interestingly, TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (who are pretty bad here) are much better at The Wrecking Crew, which was created along with Urban Menace, at the same time as Corrupt. How it works, I do not know. <br /> <br /> I'm going to try Ice-T's comment now, to see if he apologizes for the movie or tries to make us think it's a great piece. to make movies.
