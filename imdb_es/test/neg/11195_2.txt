This show started well, but then it became a nightmare. The worst part of it was the contestants. Most of them were rare. They did nonsense to make a living and they also did strange pastimes. In the second season, a guy said he talked with his pants. That is sick and repulsive. Also, nobody cared to make money. All they always wanted to do was make alliances as if it were "Survivor" or something like that. Men always feared that women would unite. The women were also the same. I just could not take it anymore. I had to stop seeing it. It was truly one of the worst shows in history.
