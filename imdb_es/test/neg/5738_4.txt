I entered this film with some expectations, not because I thought the movie sounded particularly good, but because I am a fan of Italian exploitation films and with a cast that sees Franco Nero and Telly Savalas starring alongside Oliver Twist, I imagined it. It had to be interesting at least. Well ... RedNeck has one or two positive things going on, but for the most part; It's a boring movie, lifeless, as ridiculous as useless. The plot simply focuses on two criminals (Nero and Savalas) who kidnap a small child (Oliver). The twist in the story is that the child realizes that he would have more fun if he were accepted into the "gang". Telly Savalas and Franco Nero are two actors who have shown that they can take a movie on their own on numerous occasions, and have some memorable moments in this movie, although really for all the wrong reasons. Savalas, in particular, gives a silly representation of the "bad" criminal. The plot does not flow badly, but since nothing interesting happens, that's not really a positive point and does not prevent the film from being mediocre. In general, I can not recommend this movie; It may attract some for its cult value, but it did nothing for me.
