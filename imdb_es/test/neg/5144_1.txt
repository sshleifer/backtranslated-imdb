Possibly it is the worst movie ever made. At least the plan 9 From outer space was fun. I can not believe that they have convinced someone to make money to do this. Complete waste of celluloid. Before I saw this shit, I had some respect for Kristophersson. I guess someone needed a tax refund. Please, on behalf of everything that does not suck, stop whoever has done this, before he sucks again! This movie should be avoided by all people who are not in LSD, or by my crazy cousin who insists that we are part of the Native American. If you are in the forest and an owl starts talking to you, consult a psychiatrist. It is not necessary to make a film about it.
