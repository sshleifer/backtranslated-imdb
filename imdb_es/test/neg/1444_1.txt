Take this film out of its misery and burn the negatives. What am I saying? The whole movie was negative. Fortunately, only a few people would find this movie appealing. This is what the vast majority of Americans would call too much sex and violence. It will probably appear on some non-premium cable channel some day just for the value of the shock, but after removing the nudity (most of the violence will remain), all that will remain are 45 minutes of really bad acting interspersed with 45 minutes of commercials There are too many hungry actors in Hollywood.
