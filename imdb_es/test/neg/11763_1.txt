35 years after this is done, Castro still reigns. Unfortunately, we were left scratching our heads wondering how the stupid maniac played by Jack Palance who chewed the landscape arrived in 1960. I stumbled over this recently, and had fun noticing the incomparable Sid Haig and "B". Favorite movie Paul (untouchables) Picerni among the rebels. Fleischer was obviously beyond his prime when he led this madness. Some of the lines are classic in a "Did he really say that?" The other thing that I just noticed is that the score and the sound (NOT the dialogue) are really excellent, the only first-class elements of the entire production. So, do not look at this to learn anything about history or acting, but if you feel like seeing this as a joke, bring the beers and have fun.
