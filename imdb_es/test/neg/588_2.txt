I did not like this movie for many reasons - VERY BORING! It was interesting how they thought about how the future would look like in this, but seriously I was very bored to see this. There was almost no action. Although the soundtrack of the classical orchestra was very beautiful. The visuals were very creative. Every time this movie appears on television, I want to change the station instantly. Not because it's a bad movie, just because I know what I do when I see this: total and total boredom. It's a movie I saw when I was young, but I never got into science fiction ... because it just was not real. Like this movie - very unrealistic. I never understood half of the movie anyway.
