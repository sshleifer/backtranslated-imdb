Much of the comment in this forum revolves around debating the validity of some comparisons with R DOGS made on the cover of the DVD. Forget about all that ... This movie ... er-- the home movie is absolutely horrendous. How can someone with a bit of credibility claim to be 10/10? There is no plot, none. I could not believe I spent money to rent this (more on that later) and that I had tricked myself into believing that this (based on the art of the box lid and on some type of publicity of the film festival) had potential. The only thing I really remember is that, incredibly, one of the annoying main characters was supposedly injured with a bullet in the head ... and ends up surviving the wound and reaching the final credits alive. Wow. And look, Killers has a sequel. Double wow. <br /> <br /> Real Story: I was actually so denied that I had wasted my money and my life force on this rent that I kept the videotape for what must have been six months. I kept telling myself that it never really happened. The video on top of the television was an illusion, a mental symbol of my own disgust. After someone pointed out that it was really real and that I needed control, I decided I could not leave it there. I thought: "How many others have I denied the suffering of sitting through the visualization of this masterpiece accumulating murders for myself?" I had to do the right thing and return it to the hell it came out of. <br /> <br /> Then, as I imagine that most of the IMDb people would do it in a similar situation, I gathered a lot of courage and drove to the video store ... at 2AM. After making sure no one was around, I got out of my car (still running, of course), put the film in the box of the download box and booked hell never to return. <br /> <br /> I guess I expected some corporate video Hollywood thugs to come looking for me (the bill must have accumulated something like $ 1,238.67 by that date) so I moved away from the area. However, coincidentally, like the story of the Assassins, nothing ever happened.
