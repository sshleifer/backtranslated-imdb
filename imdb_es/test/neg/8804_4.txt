(Spoiler) It could be the worst movie you see, maybe you like me, I really like it. It's one of those probability movies. <br /> <br /> There is a man who looks like he has had a day in his life. The black rats somehow feel sorry for him (which I think was a good idea). <br /> <br /> The killer rats become friends with the man, two big men come doing that they do not want it, for what the man puts the murderous rat and the floor. on the ground, both bodies covered in large black rats not much blood. <br /> <br /> but think of big black rats all over the body) but start killing people a little but the rats get bored too much until the rats kill their friends, <br /> <br /> In one scene they were sitting on the toilet while the rats entered the pipes leading to the toilet and a rat climbs up through his mouth and out of his mouth (which means that the rats must have eaten everything that was inside my body. It made me laugh for weeks. <br /> <br /> Why did I like this movie? Yes, it's different from the rest, I like ONE when a small creature faces humanity. <br /> <br /> if you've seen any of these movie slugs, slither, them, spiders, snakes, tremors, cujo, crocodile, shark, octopus. <br /> <br /> If you liked them and check out Hood rats, <br / > <br /> it's better than Terror toons than all I can say! 4/10
