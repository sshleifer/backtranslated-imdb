The MORTAL MANTIS will certainly not scare anyone, but as science fiction programmers say, it's better than most. A volcanic eruption at the south pole melts a giant, prehistoric mantis at the north pole. The military disappear. Dr. Ned (William Hopper - son of Hedda Hopper and better known as Paul Drake on PERRY MASON television) is called to i.d. The creature, but at this moment the creature has eaten several Eskimos and is on its way to the Washington Monument. <br /> <br /> Approximately one third or more of the film consists of archive images: old government educational films, military in radar rooms, airplanes, and would you believe that the Eskimos are thrown into the sea? Which explains, of course, why a tribe of Eskimos is attacked in the movie. ("Hey, guys, do you think we can work on this?") Combine some insignificant special effects, a bit of clumsy dialogue and some sexist attitudes and that's it. It is not as original as THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD, but fans of the "big bug" of the 1950s will enjoy it, and children will have fun throwing popcorn to the screen. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
