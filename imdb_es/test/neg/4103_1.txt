My friend recommended this movie to me. I should have known not to see her because my friend is a kind of video game nerd. But the name and the cover made it look good for some reason. I was so wrong I want to say first of all, what about your costumes? And the performance! Looks like they got the people out of Barney. Except for Ben Kingsley. And why was he even in this movie? Did you think it was a comedy? But I have to say that the special effects were pretty good. But that was the only good thing about it. I mean seriously, the movie is worse than Pearl Harbor. And that is actually a euphemism. Everyone must have thought, "They're paying me, so it does not matter if it's the worst movie in the world." I would understand why someone would make this kind of film if he directed, acted, produced, wrote and got his best friend from the desperate life to do the filming and editing. Probably one of the worst science fiction movies in history. A truly kidnapped movie.
