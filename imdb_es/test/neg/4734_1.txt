This is the worst movie I've seen, and it takes the price of the 2007 rotten movie (which was made by me). Anyway, this film misses all the ingredients of a good movie. Bad performance, the story is crap. I'm really, really disappointed that they could have done better things, than this piece of junk. I just wasted my time and my money in this movie. I want the production company to be able to return my money. Anyway, I would have high expectations in this movie, and I was disappointed. I do not recommend anyone to see this. So if you want to waste your money on something, do it in something other than this garbage.
