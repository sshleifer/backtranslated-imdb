I've been in a bad run of movies. It is a clinker about an incendiary plot and a psychopath. Tom Skerrit, who I really enjoy, was quite young here. He is a passionate builder, but he has a partner whose profit objective includes over-insurance and burning. In the mix comes an agent, who drowns, his daughter and her boyfriend crazy. James Mason plays the insurance researcher. Any idiot, given a little warning, would know that something was rotten in the nation of Australia. Even so, they complain about their path. The most interesting thing for me was that the huge hotel that was going to be built never became a pile of sticks. Low budget, I suppose. The plot could have been interesting. Maybe they should have hired a film editor (did they?). Half the time you do not know where the characters are, but I guarantee you that a five million dollar reward would probably have made a close watch on the mandatory structure. It does not work Although there is a lot of clean fire.
