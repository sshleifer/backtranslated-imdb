Yesterday I saw this television production, and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I did not have high expectations when it was a television production, but the whole movie was painful and without end. I felt it lasted 3 hours, but it was me who was bored to die. Every minute was a long fight and I fought hard to stay away from the "turn off" -the switch. <br /> <br /> The film is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who has many AIDS patients. , and most of them die during the movie. Verghese is difficult to live with, so her family is punished with her frustrations. However, this film has problems showing both sides, it focuses mainly on their conversations with patients, and sometimes we watch movies at home, but we do not get much. The difficulties to show more than one part of the life of Verghese do not improve with the bad performance of Naveen Andrews, a man that (hopefully) I can not see in any good future movie. <br /> <br /> I think I got 7.6 because of the subject (taboo?), but I'm sure there are better movies on the subject on the market. Get away from this movie, it does not deserve more than 3/10. <br /> <br />
