The few scenes that really attempt to depict a revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute Boy Scout troop that tentatively meanders between swimming holes. When Sharif or, please, God, Palance tries his hand in the burning oratory, it sounds like Kurtz swallowed an insect. The exhibits of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of Cuba full of smiling fish in the ocean and a positively vaudevillian hypothesis about how the Bay of Pigs was produced. What does that leave us with? A scene of comic dentistry; a wave of luxurious Hollywood peasants heading to the camera as if it were a moving train; and, just for fun, a series of homoeroticism that is not limited to the mania and the tireless fellatio of the Castro cigars. Never trust a Medved, but even a broken clock is correct twice a day: this is a HISTORICALLY horrible movie.
