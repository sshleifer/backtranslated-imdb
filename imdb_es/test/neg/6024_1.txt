I remember Hey Hey Fuss and I saw The Jackson Jive, it was a fairly simple comedy sketch, but I saw this, is it free and clear? Have I missed something? If the black community should complain about a racist comment on a TV show, it should be this and if you have read my previous comments, I am not the easy guy to offend. The basic plot is that an African / American moves next to this white man and makes these racist comments as the value of a house will fall only for the black neighbors and the white man makes references as (if you are easily offended by the racial slurs Do not keep reading) Nig-Nog Jungle Boy Sambo. (I apologize, but that really happens in this program, I'm really a guy who is good with the black community). People might say "Joy", but even when you take the racial fanatics, it's not fun. There are no new jokes. You can swear in an episode I saw someone's eyes Focused on something that is not related to the situation. All in all horrible comedy.
