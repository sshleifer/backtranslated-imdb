Okay ... he's in the boat with this guy, realizes he's trying to kill her, knocks him out, and then discovers that the reason he's out is because of this record that killed his co-worker. So, what would any rational person do? Maybe hit him in the head again to make sure he really is out? Tie it up?? Look, Sandra, honey, you have the chance to escape while the boy is out alone for a long time. Until you know how long it will take to get him to escape, make sure he can not chase him. I hate these stupid roles of female victim. The rest of the movie was just a series of twists and turns that were completely complicated and too incredible to remain interesting.
