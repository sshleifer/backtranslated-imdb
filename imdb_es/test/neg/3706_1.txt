The Capture Of Bigfoot is one of the dumbest and worst movies of all time. I love the Sasquatch and Bigfoot movies, but this is just a waste of time. Terrible, terrible, terrible! I saw this movie last night, and it was all I could do to finish watching. I understood that this strange crazy man wanted to capture Bigfoot, but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie. However, I had some fun parts. There was a very cheesy disco with a very bad nightclub that danced in a nightclub that seemed to last too long in the movie. I think the director was trying to fill the time. The worst was the way Bigfoot looked. The obvious man in a suit looked like Bigfoot in faux-pink leather. It was ridiculous. If you want to watch a very bad movie by Bigfoot, then I suggest you buy this movie. Personally, I lost my time and my money in this one!
