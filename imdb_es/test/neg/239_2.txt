Oh, man, they sure knew how to do it back then. Hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of bad filmmaking: the steel board and the scientist scientific action hero. <br /> <br /> This movie was so close to a masterpiece, unfortunately it was not like that, since it did not present firearms or invaders of the Moon. The MST3K version tried to solve this by adding a pilot from a program called Captain Cody, where a guy with a jacket propelled by a rocket fights against the badly made people of the Moon, but it was not very good. In addition, the comments of the boys in the theater were not as funny as expected. In short, a big disappointment.
