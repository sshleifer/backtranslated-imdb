When one considers that Carson McCullers is one of the most outstanding literary figures of the 20th century, it seems that a great lack of talent is needed to ruin one of his stories, but this movie shows what can be done! How do actors get ingratiated to become directors? Wood, not atmospheric, unfriendly, totally desynchronized with the poetic compassion of McCullers' writings, I was dumbfounded by the horror and disbelief that such a mix of films could have found finance and supporters. The only redeeming features are some moderately good acting (although that said, Vanessa Redgrave seems to represent permanently the same interpretation of the character she plays), and a good picture in some places, but otherwise is a bitter and bitter disappointment. it could, and indeed should, have been a contemporary masterpiece. Simon Callow should duck his head in shame and keep acting!
