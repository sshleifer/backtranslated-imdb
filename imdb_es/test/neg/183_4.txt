The one that fights with monsters can take care of itself so that it does not become a monster. And if you look into the abyss for a long time, the abyss also looks at you. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is from Nietzsche's Aphorism 146, from "Beyond Good and Evil". And that's what you find at the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you see the whole movie, you will doubt if it was the message that the Production of Ram Gopal Varma wanted to convey. As the scenes emerge one by one, quite violent and, sometimes, vomit, the spectator is expected to forget Nietzsche's appointment and think otherwise. To deal with few people, you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agashe, who will have the license to kill anyone, not just to write FIR (something the police do not deserve to do, as we are forced to believe). <br /> <br /> When TADA was revoked and the government wanted to pass newer and even more draconian laws, the "Satya" of RGV performed the necessary brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplexed urban thought crowd whose views are important in a democratic country like India. In one year, MCOCA was approved. <br /> <br /> When the real-life encounter specialist Daya Nayak 'became a monster on the road to fighting them' and was hired by MCOCA, "Aab tak Chhappan" stepped aside "false" impression among people about this. With the "you have to be a monster to save your nation" approach. <br /> <br /> And people consumed it. No questions asked. Just praise and hope that you get a Sadhu Agashe at your local police station that will solve all the problems and, therefore, will only let milk and butter flow everywhere. Blood? You can ignore. <br /> <br /> Every time Israel attacks Palestine or Lebanon, we hear voices like "India must also attack Pakistan in a similar way". This movie is made for such psychopaths. If you do not give them this, they will probably die of boredom and LSD and of what they do not. <br /> <br /> Hence this game of the passion of hatred.
