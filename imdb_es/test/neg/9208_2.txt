This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several races, if garbage could ruin the film careers these days. <br /> <br /> Melanie Griffith took off her shirt and, in her days of previous improvement surgery, I really should have been dressed. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, he has gone to much better things since this ... this ... this ... well, heck, piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, all of your main players have moved on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted, but he deserved a reluctant admiration. I mean, anything that is not worth it is not worth doing right. But anyway, he did it well. <br /> <br /> However, there was a bright and bright look: Ray Liotta, who has his name on the credit list, simply stole everything. Liotta was fascinating! Hypnotic! Amazing. <br /> <br /> I saw this piece of garbage when it was still relatively new, in the private theater of a friend. For some strange reason, my friend LOVED ME. I think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and honestly, she should not have done it), although she tried to say that they were other, more artistic reasons. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I even thought at that moment, after his first scene, that Ray Liotta would become an important star, or at least an important and highly respected actor. <br /> <br /> Despite the garbage aspects of the garbage script, the absolute ugliness of the whole story, Liotta made it worth seeing. In fact, it's worth seeing once, just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean, on the one hand, his name now usually appears on or near the list. <br /> <br /> Even in that case, even in a pile of garbage, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. <br /> <br /> Alone, if you see this garbage, get ready to hold your nose. Each main character is amoral or immoral. Terrible movie Terrible movie idea. <br /> <br /> Comment added: Many people respond "Was this comment helpful?" with a "no" because they do not agree with the opinion expressed. Maybe IMDb should ask that question: "Do you agree with these opinions?"
