In 1989 here in New Zealand, the fight was something like a mega-hype phenomenon, and whoever was directing the starship at the pinnacle was the same orange goblin, HULK HOGAN (one of my super heroes at the moment), so which seems obvious to me now. Why I loved this movie in 1989-90 when it came out here. HULK HOGAN A.K.A Terry Bollea is a surprisingly bad actor and Zeus A.K.A Tiny Lister is worse. The story line follows a standard WWE (then WWF) around the story line 88-91 that culminates with the shape of a good normal boy, pounces and then defeats itself from the story line just to follow that the good man resorts to all his inner strength (gained by eating vitamins, praying prayers, etc, etc.) to mount the epic returns ... A fairly standard formula here. It is worth seeing if only to remember your youth!
