I found this movie completely and completely incomprehensible. He knew some of the facts about Caravagggio, but here they were crooked and disconcerting. The images were strangely interesting, but I was looking for a biographical and / or critical report of Caravaggio's life and works, not a trip of LSD-type drugs. The dialogue was very confusing and jumping from one place to another in time through the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes was a great distraction. If it had been labeled as an "artistic film" I would not have bought the DVD; Now I have a DVD that I will never see again and who would buy it? I prefer conventional films, not those that require translation or clarification. Thumb down on this for me!
