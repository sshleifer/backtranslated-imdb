This movie is so bad that they would not buy it again at my local CD / DVD store. I only have it because it came in a box that I bought for the masterpiece "Deadfall". The store bought the other two movies that it sold on the set of four albums, but they would not buy Underworld again, and those other two movies redefined the range, what does that say about this movie? So I tried to sell it again to another store, which even bought budget DVDs that could be bought for a dollar at a local store, but they would not buy Underworld either. This film is bad on all levels, and it is one of those that came out in the excess of post-tarantine clones of the mid-90s. The only slightly redeemable element is that Dennis Leary tells Joe Montegna, who is a "friend" stinky "and calls him" Stinky's friend ". That phrase is so horribly horrible, that I can not stop citing it at least once a week when I describe a stinky friend. But now that I've enlightened you with that date, you do not have to go through the pain of watching this movie.
