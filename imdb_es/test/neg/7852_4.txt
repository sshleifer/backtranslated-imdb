Paul Muni and Bette Davis monstrously exaggerate as the studio's lackluster hack, Archie Mayo, seems distracted and oblivious in this racially provocative film that derives from its "bittersweet finale" by tolerating segregationist attitudes. With a hard hand and poorly constructed, the film collapses under its own weight in the first fifteen minutes with a scene out of control in the court from which he never recovers when Mr. Muni begins to chew landscapes next to the patio and howls almost incoherently. <br /> <br /> Johnny Ramírez is a Mexican-American from the other side of the tracks who, through determination and agility, gets a law degree at a night school. In his first big case involving a car accident, he shows only ineptitude and quickly looks like the fool on the part of his opponents and an impatient judge who recommends killing him. Devastated by the reverse, an angry Johnny accepts a job in a gambling house where he becomes friends with owner Charlie Roark (Eugene Palette) who likes his style. The owner challenges him, but problems arise with Ms. Roark (Davis) who also wants a piece of Johnny. She kills Charlie, implicates Johnny and slowly goes crazy before he is acquitted and free of being with a high society wasp that coldly explains that they are from "different tribes, savages" and that it will never work. When she flees to escape her fury, she is run over and killed by a car. Ramírez sells the casino and returns to his poor neighborhood, rationalizing that it is better to keep his own. <br /> <br /> In addition to this unfortunate outcome, Bordertown has a series of bad performances to complement the general ugliness of the story. . Unfair as his situation may be, Ramírez, from Muni, is so aggressive and arrogant that it becomes difficult to show sympathy for such a clumsy mistake. Davis is no better as the less loyal wife who combines the same adolescent emotions of Muni. His crazy scenes of Lady Macbeth do not show that she was about to become the best film actress of her time. Margaret Lindsay, like Muni's American Dream, is cold, remote and flat. <br /> <br /> Bad as Bordertown (and it is very), it is still an interesting indicator of the times and the acceptable attitudes. The rest is just a mixture of bad acting and uninspired direction.
