Like another critic, my wife bought this movie as part of a family pack of 20 movies. I guess you could say that this was a decent movie made for television in 1980, but it's super predictable and the acting, with the exception of Robert Conrad, is generally unsatisfactory. The soccer scenes are nothing special and seem to act mainly as a filler for the film. The movie is very outdated now, but a decent remake could probably turn this into a good movie. However, is that really necessary? I mean, how many "non-favorite sports teams work together for the big game with the undefeated guys" that we really need? This is probably a good movie for your youngest children if you find it in the bargain box, but a sports movie fan will be lacking.
