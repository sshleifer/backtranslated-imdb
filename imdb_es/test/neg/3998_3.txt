Is this supposed to be serious? I hope not. This is one of the most pathetically funny movies I've seen in my life. Since I bought it for a dollar on the shelf of "Bad movies", it sure is up to its place in the store. What can I say, the effects of blood are splashed (meant for a play on words) everywhere, some seem quite real, others look like a teddy bear that had an accident with a bottle of ketchup. Music is one of the most horrible I've heard, acting is one of the funniest elements ... should I continue? Do not get upset unless you've seen all the other pathetic horror movies in the store and this is all that remains.
