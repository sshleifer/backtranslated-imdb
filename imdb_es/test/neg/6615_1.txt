It's obvious that ESPN is drooling every time Knight is in the news, but did they have to make a damn movie about him? This was the worst attempt at a serious dramatic film I've seen. He had everything: a terrible performance, a terrible dialogue, a ridiculous casting, cheap sets, etc. It looked like it had been filmed with a $ 10 budget. Cummon, what about the scenes in the game? Were they in a high school gym? And the lighting, well, let me tell you, it was ridiculous. And Brian Denehy as Bob Knight? Give me a break. Denehey looked like ... Denehy in a red sweater, nothing more. ESPN lost a lot of credibility with this failed attempt. They poured millions of $$$ on advertising, then the prime minister was a big disappointment. Bob Knight is not a topic that can be covered in a 2-hour movie. ESPN ruined it. Even Knight himself thought he was stupider than anything else.
