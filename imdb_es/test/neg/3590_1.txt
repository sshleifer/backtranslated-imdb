I rated this movie a 1/10 and I have done this in good nature. This movie is not what it seems and I do not understand the point. Take the first joke, for example. It is your sign at the beginning to start. Well, that was fine, but then they start having a guy who talks about the hood and then he dies, then his, the other who talks then dies when the other says that people do not reach his birthday without dying. and he gets a cake now. then he dies. <br /> <br /> The jokes are stupid, they are so smart and I would have thought they would have been better than someone like the directors of the horror movie: <br /> <br /> Shawn Wayans (written by) and Marlon Wayans (written by) and Phil Beauman (written by) <br /> <br /> but stunned and the next time they want to do another comedy, they make some good jokes, not bad ones.
