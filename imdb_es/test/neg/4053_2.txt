In the only act of common sense they have done, the New South Wales Film and Television Office refused to fund this film. The producers gave a great stench and, in an outburst of publicity, brought their production to Victoria. In addition to the work lost to the technicians, NSW was lucky not to have been involved ... <br /> <br /> The film fails on almost every level. Postmodernism fails, the cast fails (what is Rose Byrne's character about? What is the unpleasant 1-dimensional grunt that Hugo Weaving used? What the hell is Pia Miranda's character doing?) And the story is a disorder of contradictions. In fact, the story unfolds like a dragged prelude instead of a complete plot. <br /> <br /> I could have had a chance if the style of "pop culture meets depression" was thought and executed better. If the casting was weirder, if the style was less serious ... if everything was different. <br /> <br /> Apart from the usual excellence in costumes, design and cinematography (like most Australian films), the film is just a total error. <br /> <br /> With a reported budget of more than $ 7 million, "The Tender Hook" is a symptom of the malaise of the Australian film industry: the wrong people and the wrong projects are being funded. Compare this mess with "Noise" (less than $ 2 million) or "Cedar Boys" (less than $ 1 million) and you get the idea. Difficult and interesting films are struggling to obtain financing and flabby and exaggerated projects with names of actors are making money. <br /> <br /> The funding agencies that invested in this deserve to go in the same way as Hugo Weaving's character at the End of the movie.
