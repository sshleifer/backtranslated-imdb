I rented a copy of this from Netflix, a big mistake. The DVD version entitled "The One-Arm Swordsmen" was produced by crazy people who thought that the fight sequences would be better appreciated in a great chapter than as part of a coherent and sequential story. Part of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Do not rent it or buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful in the original story, an absurdly complicated nonsense. As much as I have liked to see Wang Yu at his best after all these years, this is a complete waste of time. I have had detergents for dishes that made a better film than this one. What the reduced version of the DVD shows us is that no matter how stupid a Chinese script can be, you have to see some kind of story to worry about the outcome of the fight sequences. <br /> <br /> But "The One-Arm Swordsmen" offers you the opportunity to see Wang and Shaw Brothers' stalwarts, Lo Lieh, who smiled sympathetically at the handsome boy David Chiang; It is always a pleasure to see that happen. He plays a kind of second-line villain here, and it serves as an excellent example of why some people really need orthodontists. The film is also grateful for the participation of Taiwanese actor Chang Yi as a magistrate. <br /> <br /> Another comment above mentions the obligatory scene of fighting at the inn (there are two, in fact) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a pack of barbaric comedians using what look like caveman weapons, making Bruce Lee It makes noise while they fight. None of this makes sense, but it's fine if you do not expect clarity or common sense. Anyway, it was fun to watch it. <br /> <br /> Another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant female characters. There are a couple of female roles, but they do not play any serious role in the action or the plot. <br /> <br /> If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie, the one that explains why he only has one arm and why he uses a broken sword, go ahead.
