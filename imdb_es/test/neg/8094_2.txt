What can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man fighting a garden hose? The performance, particularly that of the leader Jerry O'Connel, is shameful. The dialogue is so artificial and without grace that it makes you tremble. The controlling idea is not really bad for this genre (juvenile children's comedy), but, somehow, the director manages to make the most of it. I rate it with 2 out of 10.
