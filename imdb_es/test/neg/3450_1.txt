This was one of the worst movies I've found. The cinematography was boring, with long and tedious shots (like a camera on a tripod that shoots a play) interspersed with "dramatic" angles that made little sense for the content of the screen. The editing was terrible, the scenes combined with the delicacy of a butcher. The plot depended on the viewer being familiar with the historic night in which Mary Shelley wrote frankenstien. The performance was forced, with the type of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them die horribly (the sooner the better).
