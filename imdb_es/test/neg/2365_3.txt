"TNT Jackson" is not completely inadmissible. But either the version I saw on DVD was edited with a herbicide, or the script itself is the lowest level of grinding / blaxploitation sausage. Or maybe both. <br /> <br /> Jeanne Bell is supposed to have been a playmate at some point in her career, and the film makes the most of the connection by showing her breasts at least twice as much as was really necessary ( Including a hilarious topless fight scene that I'm pretty sure was meant to be fun). I admit that they are very beautiful. However, it is quite similar and does not have the charisma of a Foxy Brown, not even Cleopatra Jones. However, she has her moments as an actress in the film, but it would have been good if the director had pushed her a bit more or if the script had given her the opportunity to do more than express an "attitude" and kick people . br /> <br /> Speaking of kicking people, the fight scenes (the other putative reason to watch a movie like this one) are pretty badly made. There is no real choreography to talk about, only people who pose and put their feet and fists. The general direction of their opponents. A small exception is a good time with an opponent equipped with butterfly folding knives; another is a sequence near the end where an obvious trick for Bell (and maybe for Stan Shaw) jumps and makes some decent sweeps and base work for a minute or two before Bell / "Jackson" hits the liver of his enemy, Shaw collapses and the script simply stops. (Once again, I will admit that this is closely related to the shaw tradition of Shaw Brother since time immemorial). <br /> <br /> There are a couple of supporting actors who are really better than the movie deserves (I'm thinking of "Joe" and the partner who plays the right-hand man of the drug lord). There is a decent midway soundtrack that complements the action on the screen and adds a star to the rating itself. There is a semidigante sex scene that manages to be effective almost in spite of itself. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for unconditional fans of blaxploitation. I saw it out of pure curiosity, and I do not regret taking the time. But I can not imagine wanting to take the time to see it again unless I decide to write a dissertation on the intersections of the pop culture of "Kung Fu Theater" and "Foxy Brown".
