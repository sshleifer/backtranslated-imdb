I had not planned to see O12 because I did not like O11 so much. I thought that O11 was a nice little movie of bank robbers with a sensational arsenal of stars. In any case, one night they spoke to me to see O12 and I was very sorry. The plot is not only boring but also meaningless. Honestly, I do not even know what it was about. I left the movie after three-quarters and had a coffee with another girl who did not like it. Much more pleasure I can tell you that. But even the guys who stayed until the end later informed me that the plot was still horrible and useless. My advice: do not look. Go see Team America (by the way, hilarious ;-)) and forget about Ocean's Twelve. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the most boring and meaningless peace of shit to be on the screen in years.
