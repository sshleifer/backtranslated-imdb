(Some Spoilers) Bored as a slasher movie that has this helpless Harry, Darwyn Swalve, murders a real estate agent in the entire city of L.A due to the high prices they charge for their properties. Looking like an extra from a Clint Eastwood "Spaghetti Western" Harry who has been living in abandoned houses eating dog food, gets very upset when his lifestyle is disrupted as an illegal occupant. This happens when a series of real estate agents invaded their space in an attempt to sell the houses, and he stays with his potential customers. <br /> <br /> Joseph Bottome stars in this barrel-bottom horror film as talk show host on the radio Dr. David Kelly, the handsome and popular psychologist host of the KDRX survival line. DR. Kelly is being sued by the family of one of her interlocutors, Tracy, who ended up blowing her brains while on the air with the doctor who could not do anything to help her survive her ordeal. <br /> <br /> The real estate murderer talks to Dr. Kelly about his adventures and the police try to get the doctor to get his phone number and address, keeping him on the line, but refusing to do so. To avoid damaging your rating by making potential callers do not call for fear of being monitored by the LADP. <br /> <br /> Kelly is also having an arduous and heavy relationship with a real estate administrator and agent Lisa Grant, Adrienne Barbeau, whose sales office are Harry's main victims in the movie. Harry can also assassinate Lisa's main competition in the housing business, the stubby and outrageous Barney Resnick, Barry Hope, who threatened to leave Lisa out of business by any means possible, even if he has to kill her. <br /> <br /> Putting Berney alone and with his pants down, Harry cuts his head while one of his customers entertains him, a prostitute, which he leaves dead and hangs next to Barney, without a head. The movie ends with the crazy Harry taking Lisa hostage and having Dr. Kelly try to come to his rescue just to have Det. Shapiro (Robert Miano), looking as if he had not slept in a week, came out of nowhere and ripped Harry's brains out. Harry quickly returns to life without the gay material between his ears and is killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground when a dozen members of the LAPD, M16 cocked and ready, Come on The scene. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie "Opean House" worked with the almost nonexistent laughter tension. Even the scenes of hot sex between Dr. Kelly and Lisa did not save the film, since there were very few, only two, and the sexy Adrienne Barbeau was too underexposed, with no light and too many clothes on, in all of them. <br /> <br /> Harry, the killer in the movie, was also a little funny to take it seriously when trying to prove something, to Dr. Kelly by phone and in person, on high Rents and prices of real estate in the country and how people like him find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live. You can sympathize with Harry's concern about the high cost of living, but be very critical of him in the way he went madly in fixing it.
