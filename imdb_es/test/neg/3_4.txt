Wow, another movie by hero Kevin Costner. Postman, Tin Cup, Waterworld, Bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, even that baseball movie. It seems that he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention. The characters are almost always the same ... the heroic, the defects, the greatness, the fall, the redemption. Yes, within the first 5 minutes of the movie, we are all supposed to be amazed at his character, and he accumulates more and more from there. <br /> <br /> And this time the story ... history? ... it's just a collage of different movies. You do not need a spoiler; You've seen this movie several times, although it had different titles. You will know what will happen before it happens. This is like mixing an officer and a gentleman with Backdraft, but both are easily better movies. Watch Backdraft to see how this type of film should be made ... and also to see how a good but somewhat underestimated actor, Russell, plays the hero.
