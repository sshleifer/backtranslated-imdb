Pretty terrible, but not entirely unnoticed. Another review mentioned "predictable", and that's almost an understatement. You can make a game guessing what the next line will be. Each character is stereotype or archetypal. The good man in a bad situation, the struggle between the senior priest and the younger priest for acceptance and discipline, the repressed woman with sexual and emotional deprivation who returns to the small city after failing in the big city, committed to the impotent and weak youth of youth, the bad boys who can not be exchanged, two "lost boys" who look for a sense of family: they are all here, and none of them, not even with the most remote turn of something new. From the first few minutes, you can find out exactly what will happen at the end of the movie. The story is not completely boring, but the direction, the performance (even of a cast with some talent) all articulates without skill. As for the story, we've all seen it before in a movie called "Law of Sisters". This is also one of those films in which the lack of attention to small details manifests itself in an even more evident light. (As an example: the nurse and our hero drive to the city, but they park several blocks away from their destinations (post office and hardware store), however, both walk in empty parking lots for no apparent reason. the night during a scene, apparently that should happen in no more than half an hour.The film is full of that kind of thing and then the labels in an unlikely outcome.
