Mel Welles, you may remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman's Little Shop of Horrors, directs this rather interesting but totally twisted tale that Dr. Frankenstein's daughter continues her father's work after his death and creates a creature not because of his intellectual ability or is it likely to be good or not, but because of his sexual attractiveness. You see, Tania Frankenstein, although she is a doctor and scientist in her own right, does not really care about satisfying her primary desires for the stable guy and for doing a bit of sex slavery using her body with the excellent brain of a man she makes. no love The story is very fine here, and one gets what one might expect: many malicious and suggestive comments (surprisingly most of the female characters), special effects that are not so special, a performance that lacks the depth of characterization and that is not really very important. Action or suspense. And while this film is almost sterile in regard to good storytelling, Lady Frankenstein has strangely some aspects that make it visible, but not very visible, but visible. The Italian actress Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bay / Bey plays the daughter of the baron with a certain aplomb and much, much sex appeal. She exudes desire and seduction pretty well. His performance is quite one-dimensional, but he is quite charming and plays too well. She is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift. Poor Joseph Cotten, now regulated to European horror films for money, plays the father in a brief but competent performance. He is the star attraction, but he left before the movie really gets going. As for the rest of the cast, Paul Muller is somewhat effective as Dr. Charles Marshall, assistant to the baron and admirer of the daughter for some time. As the crimes and missing persons begin to develop in the village, the policeman (he was not buying this) Mickey Hargitay starts pumping Tania to get answers, despite what he may think that does not satisfy him. Where the film really loses credibility is in the last third of the film where the suspect script, weak performances and mediocre direction are heading south. The creature reveals itself and looks pretty ridiculous. The film ends abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the seventies. While not as bad and repulsive as some might want them to think, Lady Frankenstein is, in fact, a very flawed film with some perverse but intriguing nuances.
