As a fan of old movies, I had heard a lot about the controversial film CALIGULA, considered ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others. I decided to see it in all the uncut version to evaluate it in the hope of finding something positive that would do justice to the many accusations about the film. I sat in my chair one autumn afternoon and began to look. The first quote from the New Testament surprised me a little and provoked the first controversy in me ... why include a Gospel of Mark prayer in the film about pagan Rome? But the prelude to the pastoral scene with a half-naked young couple (Caligula and Drusilla) running hopelessly through the meadows seemed quite sentimental. The music that sounded memorably while the credits also provoked me in the positive sense. However, the negative feelings arose in me very soon, particularly with the death of Tiberius. The cruelty seemed very intense and the sexuality exaggerated. However, it was not so horrible in the middle. During the second half of the movie, I felt like I had not seen an historical epic but an extremely nasty porn. In the end, I said to myself: "This is one of the films that one can really hate" ... I am aware that a film can be controversial, but I had never expected CALIGULA to be so far away in eliminating all the limits of the taste. . I hate this movie for many reasons, but particularly for one. <br /> <br /> CALIGULA does not have the purpose of an ancient epic (which it claims to be), but Bob Guccione, the director and founder of Penthouse Pornographic Magazine, aims to combine film art with porn. That is, I think, the most serious issue that can be accused of the film. The film is an art that must be reigned by taste, by the message, by some feeling of epic grandeur, while this film kills all the limits of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most beastly side of the human being in the most perverse and decadent way. Some scenes are so disgusting that I do not think there are people whose psyches are not affected by them. Some say that Rome under Caligula's reign was so brutal. Yes it's correct. Corruption flourished at that time, several sexual deviations were preferable to Roman citizens. However, I do not think it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and to make them the focus of an ancient epic. I think it rather demonstrates the strange psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies ... <br /> <br /> BIG HISTORICAL ERRORS: The script by Gore Vidal is notorious for inaccuracies. It is remarkable, for example, with the figure of Proculus (Donato Pl√°cido), a historic Roman senator. However, the film shows him as a simple soldier to whom Caligula forces his most decadent forms of torture and rape. In addition, Livia was not the wife of Proculus raped by Caesar at his wedding. What's behind changing the stories of historical characters into stories full of incredible vulgarity and violence? Another example of historical parody is the figure of Caesonia portrayed by Helen Mirren. She introduces herself as Caligula's wife along with Drusilla, his sister. In fact, Caligula married Caesonia long after the death of his sister. The sexual abuse of his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical basis. I also hated the moment with the killing machine, a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical events. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL AND FUNDED ASPECT: From the technical point of view, the film is nothing special. The cinematography can not boast of being exceptionally well, and the sets together with the costumes are also nothing extraordinary. However, the only strong point of the film is the performances, particularly that of Malcolm McDowall as Caligula. He does a perfect job in the main role portraying the Emperor's madness and cruelty. McDowall raises the value of the movie. If everything bothers you in CALIGULA, at least you can admire its performance. I also liked Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (however, the film is based on a Suetonian gossip that Caligula made love to her sister). Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O'Toole as old Tiberius are also memorable. O'Toole does his best work in the sequence of the Capri Grotto that portrays the decadence and escape of the old emperor. Yes, I admit that THE ONLY thing I like about CALIGULA are the performances. Therefore, I do not rate the movie 1/10. <br /> <br /> LAME CONTINUITY: The historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with little continuity. Let's analyze only the beginning: Caligula arrives at Capri Grotto where he sees the horrible pleasures of old Tiberius. Then, after about 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome, where a black bird near the bed of Drusilla and Caligula constitutes a bad omen. And immediately the characters are back in Capri where Nerva (John Gielgud) is dying ...? <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend seeing CALIGULA to anyone. If you want to know the history, read the magnificent novel by Robert Graves I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD or watch the mini series of Herbert Wise with the magnificent performance of Derek Jacobi. CALIGULA is a sick film whose most serious crime is the destruction of art. It is, for the most part, a porn movie that should never be considered an epic. <br /> <br /> There are films that are truly artistic and that sharpen the taste for the beauty of people, <br /> <br /> There are films that are medium entertainment; however, they have something to offer, <br /> <br /> there are movies that show extreme violence; However, they still transmit some morals. <br /> <br /> There are, however, films that show disease and decay for their own good and, consequently, damage the minds of people. <br /> <br /> CALIGULA unfortunately belongs to the last group
