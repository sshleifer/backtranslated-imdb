The DVD release of this movie expects you to buy this movie with the name and face of Sandra Bullock. His photo (of years after this movie) is basically the cover ... and the cover ... and the cover ... the same photo. His name appears prominently on the cover, the 4 edges and the disc. She is the first name on the star list. His biography is printed inside the case. This movie should revolve around your character, right? INCORRECT! It is his first film and he plays a minor role. After watching the movie, each role seems to be a minor role. The character of the dog actually shows a certain personality. Less than an hour after seeing it, I do not even remember the names of many characters. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I saw it several times more, I could really figure out the plot, but I do not. I think it would be worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait, I just remembered a little funny! Fans of Shoot-em-up video games will enjoy the "Doom-cam". It looks like a first person shooter. The hands and the gun point towards the front of the camera. <br /> <br /> In general, I am not a person who criticizes movies, but this may be the worst movie I have seen. I kept waiting for some silhouettes to cross the screen, to sit down and start making fun of her. <br /> <br /> I am glad that the money we spend on this (used) will go to charity.
