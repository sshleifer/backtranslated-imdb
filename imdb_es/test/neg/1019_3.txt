This movie is really MALA, it has nothing attractive or worth commenting on except for the beautiful scenery: the Chilean landscape. I know I have to provide four lines as a comment for this film, but it is a bad movie, I can only say that it is really BAD. Michael Ironside is the only one who saves money in the movie.
