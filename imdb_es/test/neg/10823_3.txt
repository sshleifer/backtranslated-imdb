I rented this Blockbust movie because of the cover and the title! It sounded intriguing !! This film suffered because of the writing, needed more suspense. The "monsters" needed more face time. We needed them to have some kind of special power and, definitely, more "Oh Sh--" moments. The photograph did not bother me, except for the scene in which a vent explodes. There were too many close ups. But aside from that, the movie seemed to crawl and the heroes did not really work for their freedom. In general, I would say that everyone spent a lot of time, even writers. But this movie is definitely a below-average income. <br /> <br /> There are definitely better selections. I would recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 in this selection.
