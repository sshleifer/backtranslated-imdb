I saw this movie (unfortunately) because it was the only option at that time and because David Zucker was the director. I saw his previous "naked weapon" (both parts), Airplane and Top secret!, And I liked it, at least I had a good time and I laughed. I'm not saying that the films I mentioned were masterpieces, but they were fine. I do not remember any other stupider movie than this one. It's amazing how the Hollywood industry is in total decline. If any study spends money to produce this horrible image, then it is not a surprise that these types of stories are more common these days. This is a clear reflection of a decadent civilization where sexual symbols and stupid plots are produced to entertain ordinary people. I have nothing good to say about this movie. If you plan to rent or buy it, do not waste your money or your time, avoid it no matter what. Even if you're a fan of one of the actors, it's not worth it. In fact, this could be a very good example of what a Director should avoid. I will not see a Zucker movie again. (He's planning to direct the fourth sequel to the movie Scary, imagine that!) Pathetic. Horrible.
