In addition, entitled BURNING MAN and FLASH FIRE for its various premieres, this film made in Australia, filmed in New South Wales is problematic for its producers from the beginning due to several conflicts of personalities and the time of prolonged filming that prematurely depletes the budget assigned, and although The story is sometimes very well detailed, below the standard postproduction finish and the excessive cut of the issue. Tom Skerritt plays Howard Anderson, an American businessman with a "passion for construction" who is in the process of erecting a tourist hotel in the Blue Mountains region, not knowing that his business partner, Julian Fane (Guy Doleman) has insured the incomplete structure for ten million dollars, much more than its real value, and plans its destruction as a corollary of normal summer brush fires to charge an attractive sum through fraud. In line with this illicit scheme, Fane arranges for an arsonist to carry out the incendiary action, a young man who is also the boyfriend of Anderson's daughter, and because the future complex is in the middle of a critical sector of risk. fire (one of the many unexplainable elements of the script) Julian has all expectations that his cowardly design will occur without major obstacles. Because the local crime insurance firm is majority owned by Fane, insurers naturally skeptical of the policy, Lloyd's of London, deploy lead researcher George Engels (James Mason) to investigate the nature of the crime, it became more sinister because to the death, possibly a homicide, of an insurance investigator (Wendy Hughes) who, following the clues, apparently approached the cause of the fire. The scene of the film is the week before Christmas, the highlight of the summer in Antipodes, a dramatic background, but the links within the story are not combined without problems, resulting in the presentation of events that are quite difficult to follow for the viewer, a problem aggravated by the erratic editing, the aforementioned heavy cut and poor image and sound quality. Skerritt's semi-comatose and droning style is fatally invalidated by this weak sound processing, but Mason is very effective, as always, and enjoys the best dialogue with Hughes as the researcher too soon written; Doleman wins performance laurels with his performance as the malevolent Julian Fane.
