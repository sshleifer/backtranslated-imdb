When I was flipping through the channel, I came to a channel 124. It's an urban channel. I saw this movie and I decided to try it. I almost became a mass murderer because of this movie. I have made home movies and they are of Oscar quality compared to this great Dookie mass. The lighting was terrible and the performance was absolutely relentless. I'd rather see Star Crystal ... Holy cow may not be a good example. The main question I have about this movie is ... Was it a morality movie? The reason I ask is because there was a sentence in which this lady in a wheelchair says "I would have been another gang statistic". Oh, my head is starting to hurt. After hearing that line, I went to the kitchen and pulled out a knife ready to stab anyone who dared to watch this movie. But some sense started and I just changed the channel to see the man with the afro painting. Well, that's all I have to say about this movie. If you want to endure this pain, go ahead, but it is not recommended for people with short fuses or a bad case of tourettes.
