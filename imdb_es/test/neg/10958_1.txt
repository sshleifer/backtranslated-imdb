New rule Nobody is allowed to make more Zombie movies unless they really have an original idea. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie does not do it. They have the premise that bounty hunters go out to kill zombies and try it by cutting their fingers. Well, problems with that. Most people have ten fingers, why not collect ten rewards for a Zombie? Why not kill a normal person and pass that as a Zombie finger? <br /> <br /> Not to mention the absolute stupidity of hunting zombies with a bolt action rifle. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I think movies like this one are filled with curriculum vitae for makeup and FX guys. "Hey, this is what I did with ten dollars and some recycled bottles ... Imagine what I could do if you gave me a BUDGET!" Do you think someone goes to a theater or film school to star in a Zombie movie? "I went to the School of the Arts. Look at me as the" Zombie Tunnel "in" Fast and Undead ". Your mother must be so proud. <br /> <br /> These had to be the weakest zombies in history, since a whole song of them apparently could not push a wooden door or break a glass window. No, they had to wait for the bounty hunter to open the door ...
