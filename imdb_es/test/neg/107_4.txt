Low budget horror movie. If you do not raise your expectations too much, you will probably enjoy this little movie. The beginning and the end are quite good, the media drag sometimes and it seems that they do not go anywhere for long periods of time, as we observe what happens in the madness that adds atmosphere but does not advance the plot. Pretty a bit of blood. I enjoyed the performance of Bill McGhee, who made it quite credible for such a low-budget image, that he managed to take the film at a time when it seemed like nothing was happening. Nurse Charlotte Beale, played by Jesse Lee, played her character well, so be prepared to want to slap her towards the end! She makes some really stupid mistakes, but that's what makes these low-budget movies so good. I would have been out of that place and five states before she thought it might be a good idea to leave! If you like this movie, try Committed since 1988, which is basically a scam of this movie.
