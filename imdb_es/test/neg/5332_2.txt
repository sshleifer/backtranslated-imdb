This movie is bad as we all knew it would be. Most of the time I usually love the bad comedy of the garbage dumps of the 80's and early 90's (haha, I did not intend to play any games). I list the ski school, career opportunities, hot shots, summer school and many more around this time. This even has the classic but forgotten comedy of Dean Cameron (also known as instructor of section 8 of the ski school and Party Maniac for summer school). But this movie is only to slow down. It takes almost 30 minutes to get going and we have to sit through a meaningless dialogue between the guys from Sheen (E & C). And yes, I can hear the bloggers dying to tear me apart "obviously you do not look at 2 and 1/2 men ... Well, Charlie was not at the level he is now during this movie ... it's not worth seeing now." Charlie only shines when his co-stars support him and Emilio is nothing more than a used wonder bra that offers little support. Actually, this movie was written by Emilio and it looks. It does not have a real ending (come on, Emilio, even The writers of ski school 2 threw up an ending). I have no idea how any problem was solved, there are no hot girls, they do not swear to lighten the bad plot, the characters, the acting ... Now I'm tired of this roll. and look at the movies I listed above. You will enjoy them much more.
