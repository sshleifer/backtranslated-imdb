This movie is really bad, it's not very well made and it's an attempt at lack of brightness in something, but I'm not sure what. I saw it and it disappointed me a lot. He promised a lot, but he did not give anything at all. The characters are shallow and wooden, and the music, if you can call it that, is terrible. Of course, there are all creatures and animated beings, but they are so badly made that they do not present themselves as anything other than a third category movie. It's a real pity that I could not devote more attention to special effects, not being everything and at the end of a movie, I agree, but in a movie based on them, it's a very important factor. For me, a very sad attempt, and it should be avoided.
