I am so angry to the point that I usually do criticism with spoilers, but in this case I will make an exception. The first scenes of this movie are weak and then, when they get to the meat and the potatoes of the movie, it stinks. This is a movie in which I was encouraging the bad guys because the captain who saves the day was amazing and there was no connection with him or anything that made you like him. The main actor gave the weakest performance and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon could not even save this movie. At some point there are revealers or great moments in a movie that may not be so good ... this movie has none. If you are looking for a movie to watch in the meantime, while nothing caught your interest ... do not choose this ... save your money.
