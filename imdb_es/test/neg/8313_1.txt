What a giant pile of smelly order! You, Gods, where do you start with this? ... <br /> <br /> Well, mix the shitty performance (including a bloody woman who gets mad and talks like one) painfully chewing some ice cubes or b). recently awakened after having undergone extensive endodontic surgery), an issue that seems to donate that the celluloid was cut and spliced ​​by using an angle grinder, some choreographed "actions" truly irremediably choreographed, a script that has apparently been written by a background music of two years and some of the most horrible and intrusively noisy ever committed to any movie, and voila, you have Death Machines, also known as The Ninja Murders (although note that surprise, surprise, there is really no ninja nowhere can you find yourself in this damned farce!) <br /> <br /> In short, if there was ever a cinematic equivalent of a particularly vehement dysentery match, then surely it must be this one! Avoid at all costs!
