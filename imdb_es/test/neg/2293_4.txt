A Swedish splash movie? Has the world gone crazy? <br /> <br /> Probably not, but it's not yet a common vision these days with the Swedish Gore-Flicks, the movie business in Sweden seems to have problems these days, it's been a long time since the Golden Days of "Rymdinvasion i lappland". And this movie seems to have some problems of its own: it's too much talk, it still manages to be fun, mainly because of the good effects, which are great for a b-movie. However, the script and most of the actors are still pretty bad, but in reality that does not matter much, it's supposed to be a flick gore and nothing else, that's where it goes a little bad for some reason. There simply is not enough blood to fill the void. <br /> <br /> Everyone who knows about Gert Fylking will laugh at his role as a sergeant. even though. I almost laughed. It's really so hilariously bad. <br /> <br /> In addition to the good parts I've listed, there really is nothing more to recommend here unless you're hungry for Swedish movies. <br /> <br /> 4/10
