Watching this movie made me wonder, why Universal released films like this? They had a wonderful series of movies with all the classic horror movies. The dawn of the atomic age triggered an avalanche of movies of giant creatures. Spiders, ants, praying mantis. With The Deadly Mantis, we have a giant mantis that flies around the Arctic, frightening the Eskimos and being harassed by the armed forces. The error reaches a tunnel in New York where the soldiers eventually destroy it. Of course, all this becomes much more visible when seen in MST. Who thought it was a good idea to start the movie showing a giant map?
