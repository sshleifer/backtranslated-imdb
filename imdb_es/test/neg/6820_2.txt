Dooley and his canine companion, Jerry Lee are together again in this second continuation (???). Honestly, I had no idea that they did a second part and much less two. And for a movie that was only slightly better than "Turner & Hooch"? This time, after Dooley retires, he has to mate with his dog (with other dogs, people) and wait for Jerry Lee to start cackling. Real class things I mean, let's go now. The original had at least some good laughs. This one does not have one. Jim Belushi looks old and worn. Both Belushi brothers were great in the 80s. If John had not died, would he be as bad today as his brother? That thought saddens me for some reason. <br /> <br /> My degree: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: EE network. UU
