Oh boy, oh boy. This film is something for lovers of "real" cinematic art. It really does not make any sense at all. It is totally boring, especially because of the "anti-climax". All people behave more than strange, and unrealistic. Sometimes it feels as if we are sitting in a theater, because in the dialogues the actors tend to look at the camera (and, therefore, the audience) instead of the others. As I said before, if you like those more artistic films, which are shown in Cannes, do it. If it is not, better leave this film in peace, because you will be more than disappointed and, in the end, you will know that you have wasted your time, like me. Two thumbs down ...: - ((
