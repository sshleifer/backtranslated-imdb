This is one of those movies in which the acting, the location of the stage, the direction and the effects were so bad that you need to rent a copy, get 5 or 6 friends, a keg of beer, sit down and watch it. To borrow the late Douglas Adams, "Watching this movie will be like breaking your brains with a slice of lemon ... wrapped around a large golden brick." <br /> <br /> What is wrong? All. British actors posing as Americans, there have been many who can achieve it as Bob Hoskins, but he is not in this. It was not even necessary to choose North America as a place, why not say it took place in England or something like that? The director seemed to like to take photos of girls' tits and asses rather than actually having some kind of character motivation. Then, at this point, you, drunken friends, will be saying, "ALL GOOD! Another shot of T & A!". There's not much dialogue, so feel free to jump into the kitchen and make those sandwiches. What did I like about this movie? After my friends fainted, I managed to collect $ 185 from them and told them that they had spent them at the strip bar after we finished watching the horrible movie.
