Unfortunately, this movie is not very good. But does it really matter ? We all know the basics for the story, and this has nothing new. But I love the low budget sci-fi and horror camp classics ... so I forgive this one. About the only thing that someone remembers about this movie, is that the little Leonardo DiCaprio made his debut in it. <br /> <br /> He did it well. The part did not ask for great acting skills, and the direction probably never gave her any chance to provide one anyway ... Little Leonardo DiCaprio was very cute ... and the girl too. The movie is fun, if you like the horror and science fiction classics and you have experience in watching them.
