Have you ever read a book, then watched the movie and wondered: how have they spoiled it so much? This is one of these. Huffaker's book, "Nobody likes a drunk Indian" was great, incredibly funny ... this movie is not. It seems that nobody cared enough to move the address, so we CARE for the characters. This film, which addresses some real concerns about the Indians, makes us wonder why we have not seen more comedies about the holocaust or slavery. Not well done
