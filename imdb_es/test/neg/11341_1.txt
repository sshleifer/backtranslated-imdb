Fabian (like Tommy Callahan), racing enthusiast, smokes, drinks and suffers blackouts while juggling seductive brunette Annette Funicello (as Francie Madsen) and blonde godfather Diane McBain (as Annie Blaine). To complicate matters, Funicello's career boyfriend, Warren Berlinger (like Eddie Sands), and his father, Jan Murray (like Pete Madsen), encourage reckless drivers. Funicello's cow-eye show is sometimes pleasant; However, his drunken driving scene is disconcerting. "Thunder Alley" provides a bit more excitement in NASCAR than its predecessor, "Fireball 500" (1966) *; Be careful, it's not much. A wild party scene, with a soft strip tease, is the highlight of the movie.
