A fast and fun matinee coming of age that attracts the weakest of all of us. It works, in effect, as a vehicle for Justin Long, who subsequently erupted on our screens in the fourth Die Hard through PC ads against Mac, Dodgeball and The Break Up. It's fun, serious and young: a great career in front. <br /> <br /> Worthwhile university aspirants find a fake website that Bartelby (Long) created to fool his judicious parents and descend to 'college' as it was a Facebook party at short notice. Lewis Black sums up the anarchic philosophy as Dean's surrogate: Long-time delinquent friends provide support for subterfuge and, therefore, appeal to the greatest traditions of education and friendship (Adam Herschman deserves special mention for his slapstick contribution than ever points) Well executed, feel good and instantly forgettable. 4/10
