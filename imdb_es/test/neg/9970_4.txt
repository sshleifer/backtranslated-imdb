I think it's a routine, when it comes to television movies. I can believe that it is based on a true story because the plot seems too clumsy to have been written by anyone with narrative skills. <br /> <br /> For example, old John Ritter (now a rather bulky and bearded villain) poisons his wife enough to make her sick, then accuses her of being psychosomatic and leaves to marry another young woman immediately . Fourteen years pass before the story resumes. Why fourteen years? I suppose that although the narrative does not demand it, the story does. <br /> <br /> However, some of the particular scenes are so cinematically adequate that they almost certainly were invented by a writer. As he rummages in his attic, Ritter's first wife, Helgenberger, runs into an old electrical appliance and has one of those black-and-white flashbacks with pitting on the score. Suddenly, he remembers when, fourteen years ago, he discovered Ritter's selenium filings. of a rectifier, picking them carefully and putting them in the shampoo and eyeliner of the eyelashes (or whatever it is called). Later, it is discovered that he was also putting it in his cafe. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I do not think so. Nor do I think that he had that particular revelation in the attic or that Ritter put selenium shavings in his shampoo or eyeliner. Selenium is mentioned in the film as a "toxic metal" and I suppose it is, in sufficient quantity, but it is also an antioxidant that is sold over the counter in pharmacies and swallows it. Someone will have to prove, as nobody else does in this movie, that it is a topical poison. Many people have tried the nicotine patch and have failed. So why does a little selenium in your shampoo give Marg Helgenberger immediate and drastic headaches? And his eyes become as painful as it boils when applying makeup? I think the anthropologist E. B. Tylor called this simple idea "sympathetic magic," but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Mais je divage. Anyway, Ritter evidently tries the same trick with his second wife fourteen years later, although there is never evidence of cheating when he gets sick with the same symptoms. The wife number two is taken to Mexico and apparently is cured, but suddenly falls dead shortly after his return. Circumstantial evidence accumulates against Ritter, who plays the villain with all the stops: when his first trial is suspended, he smiles at Helgenberger, who initiated the investigation. <br /> <br /> You see, Helgenberger was a good friend to Ritter's second wife and she was terribly disturbed by his death and behavior. (I will bet). And she wants to avoid the same thing happening to the wealthy young woman who seems to be in the third row in Ritter's marriage calendar. (Of course.) The best performance is given by the guy who plays Detective Mauser: Lawrence Dane? All others act by numbers. They project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railroad crossing. But Dane does little things that are original. "I've been told he wants to report a murder." (Long pause as he sits and waits), then pushes his face towards Helgeberger and asks in a reasonable and curious voice: "So, who was murdered? "I suppose, except for the bones of historical events, nothing prevented the characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life, I mean, what the heck, Ritter is still in jail convicted of murder and the character of Helgenberger is dead, I would like forensic things to have cleared up Ritter seems to have used so many toxic poisons and metals, let me see, selenium, cyanide, a massive dose of chlorine and maybe something else, that confused me. Not that I was encouraging Ritter, here is a mathematician with a PhD who insists that people call him "doctor." He even corrects people who address him simply as "professor." Most doctorates have that Narcissistic problem behind them very quickly. "Jes' calls me Whitey, although I know how to get a standard deviation and he does not." Average TV rate.
