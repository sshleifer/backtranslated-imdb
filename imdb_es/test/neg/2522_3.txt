This movie was really stupid and I thought it was not so bad and that I could tolerate a movie about a bed that ate people. Then, the part near the end where the guy has skeletal hands ended up being the icing on a bad movie. I could see the screws in the skeleton's plastic hands for God's sake. The brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones. The funny thing was that he could still move his hands, that was not right. Without muscles, you can not really move your hands but he did. The brother should have bled to death, even before moving his hands. The movie was not great, but it was fine until the scene of the hand. I was laughing so hard that I really do not remember how it ended. It had something to do with foam or something.
