In short, this was a pompous piece of canine poop. Too scenic and everyone is the queen of total melodramatic drama at every moment. After a while, I began to wish that all the characters in the film were not so retained as anal. <br /> <br /> And, this movie has another one of those really annoying things that have recently emerged in vogue and should not have done it: all the scenes are in a kind of bluish gray, faded blue steel. Hmmm, the last time I checked, candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly broad spectrum of colors. In fact, the light they emit tends to be more in the warm-orange-orange range of the spectrum. So, where does all the blue-steel-gray light come from? <br /> <br /> This movie has elegant settings and dazzling image effects, but it's still dry. It's the pathetic trash that is distributed to today's moviegoers who are easily placated with pathetic trash. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy vampires and werewolves as movie plot devices, but this was a total hacking job. <br /> The "Werewolf" of Universal Studios in 1941 is infinitely superior to this, although its FX is quite primitive compared to what could be done today. <br /> <br /> I'm done with this franchise. The first movie was reasonably decent. The second is still something entertaining. But this one I could not finish until the end because it was very boring.
