'You're in the Navy Now' is terribly bad: most likely the worst movie Gary Cooper ever made. It is supposed to be based on a true story, but the incident that inspired this movie does not seem to have enough argument to sustain a feature film script. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on local television when I was at home. -Sitting for my mother-in-law on Long Island, New York. There was a snow storm outside, and I was literally in the snow. If I could have walked out the door, I would definitely have stopped watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting names in the cast, especially Charles Bronson (with his original name), Lee. Marvin, Harvey Lembeck, Jack Webb and Jack Warden. Forget this. Everyone sucks in this movie. Even the generally reliable Millard Mitchell is horrible. Lee Marvin and Jack Warden are on the screen so briefly, that it does not make sense for them to vigiles. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper plays a dark naval officer assigned to command a ship that runs on a new experimental steam. Turbine: basically, the whole ship is a giant teapot. Cooper realizes that the assignment is not prestigious: if it were, it would have been for a better officer. <br /> <br /> Cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles, but he just did not have comedy skills. He made several bad comedies, and this is his worst. Jane Greer has always bored me, and she bored me more than usual here. This ship came down with all hands, and sank without a trace. Did I mention that this movie stinks? I'll rate 'You're in the Navy Now' a point of 10. Toot! Sound!
