Let's go straight to the heart of the matter ... This is a terrible movie. The story is confusing, the supporting cast is ridiculous and the main actors seem to be forced to participate. History asks us to believe that there is a clandestine lesbian sex cult where members are being killed by their psychiatrist, who turns out to be a transvestite. Ellen Barkin investigates the crimes and falls in love with Peta Wilson, whose job seems to be the cult recruiter. The sex scenes are equivalent to bad pornography and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, poor Ellen seems to be in pain. Barkin's talent is totally wasted on this scrap piece of grade B sexploitation and I hope he gave his agent the pink slip after he saw her in this movie.
