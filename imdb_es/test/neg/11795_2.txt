This movie is a good partner for Blair Witch, because it's so bad that BW did the right thing. Like BW, this is intended as a documentary of ghostly events, with each member of the team managing their own camera. <br /> <br /> However, the sense of reality is never there. The participants are characters of badly written clichés and the events that take place are equally clichés (the cat that jumps out of a closet, a spider that falls, etc.). In addition, the forced dialog and the inept improvement work for a too attractive cast that detracts from the documentary sensation. And, worst of all, the supposedly participating cameras record too many events too perfectly to be even remotely credible. Actually, with some reissues, this could have been a parody of Blair Witch. In fact, there is a scene in which the blond historian is eating a sandwich with a huge cockroach that is quite funny and reminds me of a similar scene from "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me". But in the end, the event is played directly, without a punchline. It is difficult to say what the intention was with the St Francisville Experiment, other than attracting some lost BWs. But it's pretty sad when the only real interest I could find was if the blond historian was going to have his shirt tied to his belly on a particular shot or not.
