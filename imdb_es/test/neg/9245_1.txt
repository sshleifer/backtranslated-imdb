Why would someone make a movie like this? Why would someone invest in a movie like this? Why would someone in the movie business work in a movie like this? Why would any theater show a movie like this? Why would any television channel program a movie like this one? Why would any critic bother to review a movie like this? Why would someone watch a movie like this? Why would not mental examinations of the writers / producers / directors of a film like this take place? Sometimes there are movies that are so bad that they are good. This is a movie that is so horrible that it is horrible. IMDb should really institute a "0" or even a negative scale to encompass the works of this frighteningly frightening pretension.
