We are going to cut everything in the first paragraph. "The Messengers", the most recent film by Pang Brothers (Danny and Oxide), as a horror movie, is deeply bad. And just like a movie in general, it's a big disappointment. It is nothing more than an overheated "Sixth Sense", and as long as that image is still available, there is no reason on Earth to pay money to see this turkey. <br /> <br /> Lately, horror movies / slasher like The series "Final Destination", "Wrong Turn", "Boogie Man", "Ring 2" and "The Grudge", are increasingly dependent on large unrewarded shocks (for example, something jumps out of the person on the screen, causes a sigh in the audience, but turns out to be a cat or a raven or something like that.) Little becomes a truly terrifying experience like "The Sixth Sense "or" Signs "or something of the classic horror. The films of the 1940s, 50s and 60s. <br /> <br /> "The Messengers" are based on the same old and tired clich√©s of these new films, much lower, and they are old, tired and , for my surprise. - I ended up as one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The plot has another stupid family, led by dad Roy (Dylan McDermott, "The Practice"), mom Denise (Penel ope Ann Miller, "Awakenings", "Kindergarten Cop", TV series " Desperate Housewives "), older sister Jess (Kristen Stewart," Zathura: A Space Adventure ") and child Ben (Evan Turner), who moved to North Dakota from Chicago. <br /> <br /> The reason for the move is never described here, but it has something to do with the father's inability to find work and Jess's drunken driving adventures. We know there will be problems immediately because they move to a big Gothic house in the middle of nowhere; An address that looks like the Munster summer house. Oh, and the first five minutes of the movie show that something really horrible happened there. <br /> <br /> Jess hates the place (hey, who could blame her), but the optimistic pop hopes to get ahead by raising sunflowers (despite the unusually large amount of crows fluttering around). But when he meets Burwell (John Corbet, "Raising Helen" and looks like Kevin Costner in the film version of "My Name Is Earl"), an itinerant vagabond and expert in the cultivation of sunflowers, things start to improve. <br /> <br /> But then strange things start to happen; Jess is terrified by a violent force that is not seen in the house (of course, nobody but Ben, two years old, can see it, so it is labeled as a scale) and the crows keep circling. Ben is also capable of detecting supernatural creatures, but since he is two, he can not articulate it. Scene after scene of people telling the child to tell them what they see, I finally wanted to shout at the screen: "I can not tell you, he has two years of shit!" Yes, having the only protagonist who can solve all these things, being a dumb child, is really intelligent. <br /> <br /> Anyway, they let us reflect on the sanity of Jess; when and if Ben will ever adequately describe the paranormal visions he sees; if dad will make the sunflower thing work; if the drifter of the high plains is a good or bad man; what is the point of George Plimpton's Real Estate Agent; how a fork sunk in the back can only be a wound of flesh; what is the role of the mother in the family; and where all the crows come from. <br /> <br /> All this while waiting and asking about something, anything, that happens. The conclusion is really boring, too, and once again raises the question of how a spirit that has no physical body can cause harm to a living person. Very boring, meaningless and most terrible of all, without frightening in the least. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there are many crows in this movie.
