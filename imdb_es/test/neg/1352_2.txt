To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. An amateur movie made by professionals. I was about to leave the theater on two or three occasions (something I've never done). I stopped Cloris Leachman really. She sounds real, the only one I should say. These new women are less modern than those of George Cukor of the 30s. These are "acting" for us trying to be with him, but their "conflict" is exactly the same as it has always been, in the movies anyway. The fun of the original was based on a clear, vitriolic and very funny script. A masterful direction and an unrepeatable cast. All the missing elements here. Television actresses mixed with models and nominated for the Oscar / winners. There was nothing organic about it. Everything felt like a sunset, improvised at the moment without a clear objective. 2/10
