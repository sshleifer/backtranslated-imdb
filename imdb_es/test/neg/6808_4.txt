Warning, spoilers ahead (even if I doubt someone has not seen this yet) <br /> <br /> The movie starts quite well, but almost in half it collapses and becomes a cheesy, sweet sugary, predictable and Unrealistic mess of 'romance romance'. I mean, it's very obvious that there are serious problems in the marriage of the main characters, but these problems are never solved but forgotten. <br /> <br /> Basically, as soon as she decides to have a baby on her back (without even asking) all her problems magically disappear without a trace or explanation. Taking into account what happened up to that point, it would have been much more logical if the marriage collapsed instead of becoming something trivial and clich√©: "having a baby will change everything" and it will end. <br /> <br /> The two main characters "Families and neighbors are also extremely one-dimensional, and they do not seem to really serve at all if they do not irritate the viewer, and they also mysteriously disappear from the movie as soon as the 'moments' begin. of harmony ". <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to be tearing this movie, but from the beginning I would have expected something more.
