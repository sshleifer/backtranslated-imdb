Yes, that's what I felt when I finished watching this movie. The acting is below average and the special effects are horrible. In fact, the worst I've ever seen. It is a very low budget movie. There's no way this movie can scare you, it does not have scary or frightening moments. The bone-eating gentleman was more of a funny creature to me. It could have been much better, but hey, they did not have a big budget. The movie does not convince you that you're watching a horror movie, hahaha. I would call this movie The Time Eater (waster). I'm sure you would have many better movies / etc to watch. Keep looking at it if: 1. You have nothing else to see. 2. You have the opportunity to see it for free. It's not worth renting at all.
