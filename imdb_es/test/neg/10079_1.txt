Probably, this is a good movie to watch ... as long as you've seen all the other existing movies, and have thoroughly explored the navels of yourself and those around you. God, this movie was incredibly insipid, with some of the worst (or nonexistent) writings captured in the movie. There is no saving grace for this movie; Even the animatronics are a bit lame, and it's just a complete waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Run. Quick. It is more than horrible. <br /> <br />
