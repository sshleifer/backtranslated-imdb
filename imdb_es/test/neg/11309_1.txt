After seeing this movie, I felt sick to my stomach and if I had seen one more minute, I would have had to run to the bathroom and vomit until dawn. A sick movie that was NOT funny and it was NOT worth the money, no money. If someone ever wants to see this movie, no! Your children will never forgive you and claim illnesses for a week. So, if you value your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind, do not watch this movie. I'm begging you, NO!
