Ask a thousand people what is the best unintentional comedy of all time, and they will almost always tell you Battlefield Earth or Plan 9 From Outer Space. They are wrong American Ninja has these two turkeys defeated for a number of reasons, among which is a script that clearly was not thought. While I fully support the B imaging industry to keep slobs like Michael Dudikoff at work, a little work on the product would have made a great effort. <br /> <br /> For those who give a back of the rat, my next paragraphs will give away significant parts of the plot. <br /> <br /> In the first place, when we are given basic information about the titular hero, we will be informed about his date of birth, relatives, parents and others. , they are all unknown. I do not know about you, but I hope that the US military takes research about its personnel a little more seriously. They also manage to ruin the continuity of the dates quite effectively, although I do not remember exactly which dates were wrong and when. This is one of the less obvious failures of American Ninja. <br /> <br /> It has been noted above, but a common flaw in many martial arts films is that when our heroes face a large number of antagonists, the antagonists said. Attack one at a time. More recent films like The Matrix Reloaded challenge this convention, but almost all the films of the 1980s have the audience shouting "hey, why do not they all attack at once?" Martial arts films tend to be much more impressive when the fights are more extensive than the individual ones. <br /> <br /> The central premise was originally a joke, but in light of recent events in which the US military can not crush a multitude of insurgents simply because they do not delegate to specialists, it seems strangely ironic. The Filipino renegades are stealing weapons from the local division of the US Army to sell them to wealthy clients. It does not matter that such a robbery causes the army to give the local businessmen responsible, or even those who are considered responsible, a rectal aerial examination. After all, this is a cheesy action movie from the '80s. <br /> <br /> By far, the funniest However, part of the film is the climactic battle. As Joe and Jackson combine posing and fighting in an art form, the evil ninjas begin to explode for no apparent reason. I agree with an earlier commentator that this movie should have been called Ninja Holocaust, because I'm willing to bet that at least three hundred evil ninjas bite her during the movie's execution time. In addition to that, the Black Star Ninja begins to fight with rocket launchers, lasers and all kinds of ridiculous implements that are not only badly thought, but are badly executed. You will never see a laser beam effect that seems cheaper. <br /> <br /> What heads it is that the film takes itself so seriously. During the scene in which Joe meets again with his old mentor, I dare the spectator not to laugh at the horrible dialogue. It's not that I know any modern Ninjitsu practitioner, but the logical part of my imagination has a hard time believing that they have spoken like this at any time in their history. During this mentoring scene, I almost expect the old man to tell Joe that he must prove his manhood by cutting his head off with a blunt plastic spoon. <br /> <br /> In total, I gave American Ninja a 1. This is a special score on my system, as it is reserved for the worst, most frightening and offensive movies I've seen, or movies that make me laugh without even bothering to try. American Ninja is definitely an example of the latter.
