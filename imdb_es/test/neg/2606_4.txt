When Family Guy premiered for the first time, it was not in a discriminatory mood. With the 1990s containing a lot of intelligent and surreal cartoons, why should it be? Nickelodeon produced Doug; Ren and Stimpy and Rockos Modern Life among other fine cartoons (Yes, this includes Spongebob). All had extravagant and dreamy animations and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialogues. The Simpsons became an absolute phenomenon, perhaps not as brilliant as their greatest advocates say, but it is a good investment of their time and certainly rules out the false axiom that all television is garbage. South Park began as a raw but hilarious attack with a unique and intelligent satire underneath. It evolved into a Monty Python-esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally fast societal critiques (such as his defense of gnomes in boxer shorts) and, finally, became totally self-referential and "meta" like the Simpsons did , and Unfortunately the shark jumped. Family Guy is superficially like The Simpsons and South Park. Press the buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts. However, what he has in loquacity is that he lacks real ingenuity. <br /> <br /> The program is famous for its use of tricks, especially for flashbacks. Many are references to bad television or commercial comedies. Some are fun (especially since the first two seasons), most are not. Are the references intrinsically fun? I'm not sure, but they are mostly what the show is based on, considering that their characters are painfully uninteresting. Where Homer and Bart have charm, and Cartman has an artillery of self-consciousness and pure indignation to back up his horrible behavior, Peter Griffin has no excuse. He is just a loud, obnoxious pig. Any funny thing that comes from your character is just because the writers forget how not to be happy that day. Lois is also very shallow and dull; Meg is a pillar, only to be abused; Chris is retarded and only occasionally amused, and the two main stars of the show (Stewie and Brian) are so inconsistent in their characterizations that everything is really useless. <br /> <br /> Other tricks that I can not support is when a character points to something obviously and remains in it for an awkwardly long time. This happens a lot lately, and I can not take it anymore. Not only the chicken that is often mentioned who likes to hit Peter, I'm talking about the painful moments in which they talk about pop culture and stimulate it as if they were alien spectators. That's not wit or even ironic humor, it's totally boring and lifeless. <br /> <br /> It's not that the show can not be fun, in fact, some of the previous episodes made me shoot. The highlights include the pilot episode, where Peter loses contact with reality after losing his precious television; when the father of the religious fanatic of Peters appears and wreaks havoc; When Peter becomes a narcotic at the school of Megs, and in the episode "pancake". I suspect that these are the episodes that accidentally incorporated real human traits in their characters, or simply were times when the writers had true comic inspiration. <br /> <br /> One last thing, the show is not offensive. It's just offensive to those who would not see the show in the first place, so it's almost like an imbecile from the circle of hipsters.
