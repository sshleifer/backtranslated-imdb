Martin Lawrence could be considered a talented man, but those days are gone. Runteldat shows a man who, immediately, tries to play the sympathy card before his difficult situation, but assumes the responsibility when he thinks it will benefit his ego. The sad truth is that at this time in his life, his best days were behind him: his half-funny show was dead in the water after his co-star went away and until today he faces a voice acting career and tremendous action movies. . <br /> <br /> One gets the impression that this concert movie was not made to give Lawrence's career another boost after his humiliation, but rather a childish attempt to clean the air trying to pathetically save it. what was left of his life. and in some way, turn it into something to be proud of, a defining moment in which it proved to have gained its fame. Unfortunately, the concert is nothing more than a serious-voiced Martin who incoherently tries to be funny, invokes pathos and then says he does not care at all because it's unconditional. The sad truth is that this is the real public shame for Lawrence: the way he rambles invoking sadness and sadness makes him want to simply undress his underwear on stage, wave a gun and simply re-enact it. . There is no real vision of their performance at all. Just like the children's title says, Martin is trying to make his last moment of truth in his own way and fails miserably. It would have been better to wait for E! The real Hollywood story instead of running on stage and becoming an idiot for the second time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the saddest thing about this concert movie, or rather, praise of the race, is that Martin did not do it. Do not put any thought into this. What was I supposed to try this movie? Unfortunately, his fame was fleeting, it was a flash in the pan before the underwear incident, and now that the only way to get work is to carry Will Smith or a Pixar production. You could also call this concert 'Tombstone' because that's what it is. Martin Lawrence just died on stage here, and with that goes what could have been an interesting career. Now? Only a pathetic side note in the story.
