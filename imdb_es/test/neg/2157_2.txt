I'm not sure what the point of making this movie was. It seemed as if it had been made by some historical society to display it in their local museum 'Pistol Pete'. At first it seems that it could be the beginning of a sketch of Mad TV or SNL. But then the joke is on you when there is no auction and you realize that someone was taking it seriously. The story was not bad, but the inclusion of the SASS members seemed to be a ploy (that worked) for me to watch the movie. I swear, the trailer listed all the characters in the movie until "dead cowboy # 5". The reason why westerns are so fun is the atmosphere and the characters he brings. I just had the feeling that I was seeing the new Civil War actors disguised as cowboys. It is not even worth the digital video in which it was recorded.
