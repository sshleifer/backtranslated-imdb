The director does not know what to do with a camera ... too many options and always always chooses the wrong one ... she let travolta take over ... and he controls the film from the beginning to the end ... the characters do not they are developed ... maybe because we need to see them sing ... without rhythm, sometimes too fast sometimes too slow ... wrong: travolta OK ... johansson, she is too big to be 18 ... even if she is really 20 ... <br /> <br /> the happy ending? Well, it seems that there must be one, so the story is sad but not too sad ... travolta does not know how to play a guitar, but the director does not seem to care that she is not synchronized. ... <br /> <br /> the idea is the only thing that is great ... but how did it develop? well, it's just full of stereotypes and lines heard many times ... <br /> <br /> too bad, another lost opportunity ...
