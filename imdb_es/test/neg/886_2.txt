Wow. Not because of the 3-D images, which were sometimes used very well to provide good deep images, but what a boring ending! The end of the film seems to implode in itself. This movie has to be one of the most ridiculous movie monsters and one of the most pathetic attempts to try to explain it. The misogyny of this movie is also painful. If you're looking for a bad science fiction movie from the 50s to laugh (also known as 'bot forage'), do it. Otherwise, look for better movies.
