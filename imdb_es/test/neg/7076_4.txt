I'm working in a video store, so I had the opportunity to watch it for free. Thank God, if I had paid, my criticism would be less lenient. <br /> <br /> Well, the main idea of ​​the movie (geeky The girl takes a bloody revenge) is not so original, there are several parallels with "Carrie" (play a malicious prank on a loser, except for one nice girl who really feels sorry for her, the tamaras and has a bad family history). I still think it's a fun idea for the nasty teen horror movie. Unfortunately, they did not take much advantage of the potentials that are here and put emphasis on all the wrong things. <br /> <br /> What worked: I liked The actress who played tamara. He looked great (when he was hot) and his malicious lines were funny ("Sean can not answer the phone, he's f ** King Patrick!"). <br /> <br /> What did not work: the whole Wicca thing was silly. I generally prefer rational explanations (she could have plotted the whole thing with her teacher or one of the guys for revenge). There were many logical things and the gore looked very bad (when the boy is cutting his ear and his tongue, please !!!) <br /> <br /> the idea was not destined for Oscar's buzz, but only I think they wasted the comedy and suspense potential they had. It was bearable but far from being good!
