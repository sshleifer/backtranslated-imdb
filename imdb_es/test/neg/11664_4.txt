Everything you do in this world should have at least a little sense. Unfortunately, very little of "Delusion" makes sense. Jennifer Rubin is adequate in her role as the main squeeze of hit man Kyle Secor. Secor, on the other hand, behaves to the point of annoyance. Jim Metzler, the yuppie embezzler is very amazing as the novice, the one who seeks revenge, the adversary. When Jennifer Rubin returns the money she has been hiding carefully, all credibility flies out the window, and the weapons that point to the final showdown between Secor and Metzler are more than ridiculous. Avoid the "Delirium", unless you are excited enough to believe the positive reviews wrong here. - MERK
