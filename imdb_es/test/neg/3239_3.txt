Based on the excellent novel, Watchers by Dean Koontz, is this extremely horrible movie that probably should not be seen by anyone. Not since "The Running Man" have I seen a book slaughtered beyond recognition. The difference, however, is that the movie "The Running Man" was still nice as a fun action movie loaded with a million catch phrases. This movie?? No, nothing remotely funny. In fact, if you love the book, like me, you will hate even more this bastardization. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** Rightio, I'm basically going to tell you the story here, almost in its entirety. Why? Because you, dear reader, do not have to suffer for this abomination, it's fine for me, because I enjoy watching the shit. Because I like to complain about the things of sh * tty. Now, to the unpleasant: this film revolves around a boy and his mother fleeing government and a mutant soldier-monkey-creature who escaped from a government genetics lab destroyed with a super-intelligent golden retriever that the "hero" called "Furface". Groan?? Trust me, in the novel, this story shook. I'll get to that later. Anyway, the hero is none other than the dreamy boy Corey Haim. Oh, I'm not kidding. Our hero runs around, with a brittle voice and all, trying to convince his mother to help save this dog from the "evil government" that gave birth to him and made him genetically ultra intelligent. The monkey-creature, known in a delayed way as an "Oxcom" (God helps us) is also a genetic stew of a creature built to be the best fighter on the battlefields of the future. Michael Ironside (Total Recall, Starship Troopers? Always plays a badass) is also in this movie, and no, I could not understand how someone convinced him that this would be a good idea. He plays a government agent with the NSO hunting the dog and the creature. Ah, yes, here is a bit of spoilerama: it is also a creation of the government and the same laboratory, and here is that most of the movie is a moronic and murderous people, and all they are supposed to kill is the monkey . soldier. Instead of a spooky and creepy horror movie, we have a rectal hemorrhage from a teenybopper horror movie. The intelligence of the dog is discovered too easily and is believed to be easier than we think we can see the clouds looking out. Breakdown! <br /> <br /> Change from book to film: <br /> <br /> - Main character (Travis) converted from man to child-child. <br /> <br /> - The love interest of man in the book (Nora), now is his mother and all his depth and character growth have gone completely. <br /> <br /> --Lem Johnson, black man, is now white, Mr. Ironside. This matters since the character's strength is based on his heritage in the book. <br /> <br /> - The relationship between two authority figures completely ignored, Lem now kills the guy who was originally his best friend. <br /> <br /> - A main character in the book is now totally absent, the "immortal" who hunted the heroes, maybe it is supposed to be Ironside, but why is he another person? <br /> <br /> - The dog never gets the deserving name of "Einstein" in the movie. <br /> <br /> - No part of the book took place in a high school, at least nothing that had a strong influence on the plot. br /> <br /> - It happens in a matter of days, instead of months, like the book, the unrealistic rhythm. <br /> <br /> - Corey Haim's girlfriend in the film appeared in no more than two chapters in the book, and they never met in the book. <br /> <br /> - The character of Lem Johnson is no longer insensitive; Instead, he is a total asshole who works his way through people. <br /> <br /> --There Travis was part of Delta Force (military segment specializing in hunting terrorists), instead, his father, who is never seen in the film was part of that group. <br /> <br /> - Intelligence inherited in the monster now totally absent. <br /> <br /> - Subplots involving the Soviets and The Mob completely destroyed from the story. <br /> <br /> - These are just the most unpleasant changes, and I can remember them by hand (and a day later). <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> - Finally, after 90 minutes of pain and mental anguish, the movie ended. <br /> <br /> It did not hurt her, it did not help her: <br /> <br /> - -Michael Ironside, I usually like it. <br /> <br /> - The dog is still pretty nice. <br /> <br /> - Extravagant title screen "totally from the 80s". <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> - Okay, the writing for one is extremely horrible. <br /> <br /> - The direction is so partial that anyone who sees the movie will feel superior to everyone. I'm not involved in it. <br /> <br /> - The acting is shabby and weak, especially from Corey Haim. <br /> <br /> - History loose, weak, diluted. <br /> <br /> - The monster looks pathetic, that is, when we are actually allowed to see the bloody thing. Its head is gigantic and oversized, the yellow eyes that were part of the object of the book are not seen more than two seconds. Instead of a lean, powerful, fast and intelligent killing machine, we have some imbeciles with a monkey of ugly vomit forced on us. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> - Even violence and blood are badly made, for the love of God, this is supposed to be a HORROR movie! In general, violence is, at least, well done! <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The idea that Dean Koontz brought out his brilliant novel to become this piece of shit * * I'm dangerously close to throwing up on myself and on anyone close to me There are movies worse than this (it induces headaches as that idea may seem), but so far, only "Alien vs Predator", at least for me, is a bigger farce and a more painful disappointment. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: seeing how the final credits begin. <br /> <br /> Acting: 3/10 Story: 4/10 (the novel was really good, this is just terrible) Atmosphere: 5/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character development: 1/10 Special effects / Makeup: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 0/10 Violence / Gore: 4/10 Music: 5/10 Address: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br / > <br /> In general: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I would recommend that no one see this movie, except for a few fans of extreme and harsh terror, and only if you have not read the novel. Instead, I would recommend that anyone interested in this avoid it altogether and buy / check / borrow the book. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
