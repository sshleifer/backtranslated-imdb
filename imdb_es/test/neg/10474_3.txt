I rented this movie courtesy of Netflix, thinking that I would receive the 1972 version. I sat clueless, looking at this new version, thinking: Wow, the production values ​​were spectacular! I was convinced that the soundtrack had some 70s sound. I was even more convinced that this was a 70s movie when it occurred to me (almost every five seconds) that what was missing between Gene and Finney was an intense hug , a charged look, a passionate kiss. <br /> <br /> Sorry, although John Knowles himself has indicated that this was not a homosexual relationship, it is painfully obvious that yes, that is exactly what it was. When people (usually teenagers) of the same sex have "intense" friendships, it means that those longings for love, union, the desire to express themselves sexually, are overflowing. These guys needed to connect, but they were never allowed to do so. <br /> <br /> Also, despite Toby Moore's energetic performance, I never felt emotions were real. I never connected with either of the two boys, for the same reason that their relationship was not truly honest. <br /> <br /> People want to live in a fantasy and think that because this happened in the 1940s, these guys could not "have had these sexual feelings for each other. least in the book they did, and in this film, Finney had them, almost in pain, for Gene. The "intensity" that John Knowles suggests existed among them was an intimate homosexuality, a worship of heroes, an idolatry that, in Normal circumstances, it would be expressed in a sexual way, even if these guys were suppressing it, it should have been very clear, but this movie does not even really hint at it. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is an incredibly strange moment when Finney , who has broken a leg, is playfully skipped by all the other children during a ball game, unless they were just a group of nincompoops, they would know that they could not throw their bodies at him. evastador was lost both in the director and in the producer.
