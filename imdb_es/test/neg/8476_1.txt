"Son of the Mask" is a terrible excuse for a movie. I went to see this with my friend and I would still like to have seen "Because of Winn-Dixie" instead. I must say that it is partly my fault, since I agreed to go see him with him. Being a fan of the first movie "Mask" (Jim Carrey was very funny) I hoped it was not as bad as all the critics said it was. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes after the movie, I knew it. He was heading towards disaster. The disgusting, nonsensical attempts to be funny made seven- and eight-year-olds chuckle, but the rest of us stared at the screen in disbelief. It surprised even me, since I loved "Scary Movie" and "Anchorman", two films that many people I know considered rude and offensive. But the point is that "Son of the Mask" is not funny unless you are less than ten years old. <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot of CGI, but it can not save this piece of garbage. Whoever allowed this film to reach the big screen probably thought it had potential, considering the success of its original. Unfortunately, it does not have any of the laughs, fun or excitement of the first, creating a mockery of the original movie. I recommend renting the original "Mask" to anyone who is thinking of seeing it. 1 star out of 10 is generous for this terrible disaster.
