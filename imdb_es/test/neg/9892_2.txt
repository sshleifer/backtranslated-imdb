I should have realized that any set of two videos that sold for only $ 6 would be bad. I even read the reviews before watching this movie, and that still did not convince me. I loved the book and I knew it could not be as bad as people said. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is. <br /> <br /> A mosaic of films, videos and what appears The archival images combine to make a three-hour tour of a chapter of James A. Michener's epic novel. Well, the period of time covered was a chapter, but I do not remember many of the situations that actually occur in the book. The package in my copy of the film gives Maria Conchita Alonso the best billing, although it turns out that she is only in a Spanish speaking scene. In the second tape. <br /> <br /> You have to congratulate the actors for interpreting their roles well, despite an elegant and exaggerated script. However, they must be insulted for accepting roles in the first place.
