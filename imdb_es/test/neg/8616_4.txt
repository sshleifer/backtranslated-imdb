A sequel only for the name of John Carpenter's Vampires, this film takes place in Thailand and involves a sect of evil vampires, who enjoy killing people, and a sect of good vampires who do not. While it is an interesting idea to establish a vampire movie in Thailand, the writers do not seem to do much with the exotic setting. This movie could have been set in Los Angeles. Which brings me to my next point, which is that it looks a lot like Blade Lite. We have the rock soundtrack, the martial arts battle scenes, a bloody dance club and, of course, many sharp objects that go through vampires. What we do not have is the budget and the talent. Yes, the hero is a good martial arts fighter, very bad his performance was not so good, and there is a lot of decent work, and tons of accelerated fighting sequences, maybe too many. The problem is that they simply do not have the same impact as those of any of the Blade films. Maybe it's just that the movie has a "seen from before", sorry. <br /> <br /> However, for me the biggest problem was that the filmmakers did not take enough time to establish the relationship between the protagonist. , played by amateur and bland Colin Egglesfield, and his girlfriend. She is snatched at the beginning of the movie after an exchange of complaints with her boyfriend. We have no personal interest in your welfare at this time and we have no reason to believe that your boyfriend would be willing to risk his neck to save her. Now, that is a great inconvenience when it is the biggest impulse of the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end, you could do worse than lose 85 minutes of your time with this, but I can think of much better things to do with your time, like renting any of Blade's movies.
