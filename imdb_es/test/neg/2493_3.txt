I saw him years ago on television when he was sick (I do not know, I tend to be more complacent with my television when I'm sick, I guess it's a great effort to use the remote control). <Br /> <br /> As far as I can remember, all aspects of the film (casting, acting, writing, direction, etc.) were badly advised at best. I could have forgiven the historical inaccuracies if this movie had created an idea of ​​what it was like to work at Trinity; but it did not do it. There were attempts to humanize the scientists, but they were insufficient and they never transcended the caricature. <br /> <br /> I did not know much about the people involved in the Manhattan Project at the time, but the performances in the film were so caricatured that I became interested in learning about real personalities. And I did it. So I guess this horrible movie has done very little good, after all. <br /> <br /> This is not an in-depth review, but FMLB does not deserve or require one. You could enjoy it if you're a fan of bad movies.
