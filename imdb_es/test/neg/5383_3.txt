I enjoy movies of different types and qualities. Whether it's your typical Hollywood action movie or the Oscar season, movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be nice to me. <br /> <br /> At Soap Girl, I got nothing but confusion. First, we meet Maya, a worker in a massage room that seems to attract all the clients in the room. A virgin poet named Harry comes in a day and they fall in love. After that, there are several twists and turns thrown at the plot that seem to lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> Although many have commented on the controversial issue of an Asian prostitute exploited by the white man, keep in mind that this film was made by an Asian director who wanted to clarify the issue. But whether it succeeds or not, it does not matter, since the subject in question is whether the movie is nice or not. <br /> <br /> For me, Soap Girl does not meet the standard I expect from movies. It was hard for me to get emotionally involved with this movie, given the loose plot and the mediocre performance. Worse, it seems that the director wanted to make a drama, when the tone falls more in comedy. <br /> <br /> A movie like Soap Girl, which fails to catch the magic of cinema, will always leave me. boring. Throughout the film, I could not help thinking: "What is it really about?" A movie has to answer that question before it is done. If not, what will end is an empty impulse to captivate the audience. <br /> <br /> Grade: D + <br /> <br />
