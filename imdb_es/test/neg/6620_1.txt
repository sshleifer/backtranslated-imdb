There is a reason why the Chairman of the Board got a 2, (which is too high) this movie is one of the worst movies of all time and I have seen my share of rotten movies. The president of the Board is led by two of the most annoying actors / people of the present time, Carrot Top and Courtney Thorne Smith. Carrot Top is no longer fun and was not in this piece of garbage. Courtney Thorne Smith is not better, just look "According to Jim" and you'll see an excellent example of what I'm talking about. The president of the Board took me a 1, because that's low, how can you go, it's so bad. I'm a little surprised that this piece of scrap is not in the IMdb bottom 100 somewhere, it would put it in the top 5 of that list, but it is moving slowly.
