This is a film that is based in part on Rob Halford's departure from the British Metal Gods' Judas Priest and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who used to lead a tribute band to Priest. Originally titled Metal God, this movie could have been something great. Instead, someone in an office somewhere who knows little or nothing about metal music decided to dilute it. From the change of title of Metal God to the 'safe' in the middle of the road 'Rock Star' to the silly soundtrack, this movie does not work well. After having spent most of my life in a professional metal band, I really wanted to see this, I was disappointed by several points in the film. The soundtrack is not very metallic for one, and the end of the film is also scarce. The film has some bright spots in writing and acting, but in general, it fails in the end because ... 1) A movie based on a metal band must have a metal soundtrack. 2) There is NOTHING about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of ​​"heavy metal", go see this movie. If Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio and Black Sabbath are your idea of ​​metal, watch this movie to laugh.
