That's how it was when I came out (wobbled) from this "movie". I could not leave, because I was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people. I was stuck in the middle. Caught. <br /> <br /> The small fragment of original footage that tried to unite this film presents some of the worst acts that have been seen on the big screen. The daughter was an outstanding performance, standing out in the bad sense. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was horrible, consisting of a disconnected frame and some of the strangest lights I've seen. > Regarding the archival material ... well at the beginning ... <br /> <br /> Wait. <br /> <br /> Why am I reviewing this movie? Why do I recognize its existence? Please, do not look at it. Do something useful with two hours of your life and go see some dry paint.
