This film may have some historical significance, and it certainly seems amazing how well the facts are, the stage, the rocket, the spacesuits, the surface of the moon, everyone screams "a classic", but in the end, the result makes a pretty boring movie for the eyes of today, and the technological scenes of the 50s that can be expected in a movie like this are not, by far, enough to reward all the malicious dialogues and predictable plot developments. The characters and the plot can reward a scientific sociological analysis, but they have very little entertainment value many times. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie seems to be a good movie for nine-year-olds. Mature themes, human drama and violence are maintained at a level appropriate for children as well. <br /> <br /> The images of Earth and Moon seen from space may be more accurate than those of "2001", but what if their use is dramatically inefficient. Especially 2001 may seem an extended meditation on the themes of this film, and, Star Wars has not somehow modeled its space opening titles in the opening titles of this movie? But, again, the inheritance is marginal. <br /> <br /> If it's a classic 1950s science fiction classic from the mega-influential and mega-influential you're looking for, check out "Forbidden Planet."
