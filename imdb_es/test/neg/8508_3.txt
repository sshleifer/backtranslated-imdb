First of all, I am a big fan of Tolkien, and as one I will base most of my critics on their books. <br /> <br /> The movie is a standard adventure movie, well made with ingenious special effects, good sound. Follow up and good performance. Now, if this movie were to be called something more than the Lord of the Rings, the reviews would not be as good as they are here. <br /> <br /> The problem of the film is that it takes the basic plot of Tolkiens books, but then they disappear and "everything possible", many scenes of the book are missing or have been changed enough, the characters have also changed of the book, something that I think should be punished! What the film lacks is a deep vision of the characters it contains, I know it is almost impossible to make a good movie with a good book, and it did not work here for a moment, mainly the motivation of the characters is confused. best. <br /> <br /> Like an adventure movie, I would rate 7+ / 10 As an adaptation of Tolkien, it will qualify 2/10 <br /> <br /> I mean honestly, what the hell was Arwen doing in Rivera Ford? And as for the comments that this movie is "the best of all", I can only say that you are still very young, or that you have not seen good movies ... <br /> <br /> Peter Jackson should have qualified to this movie as an adventure movie based on the Lord of the Rings.
