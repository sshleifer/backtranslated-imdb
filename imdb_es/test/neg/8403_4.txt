A disturbing film, this, culminating, as it does, with an intensely intimate reunion between a naked man and his young son, but in its confused structure contains a poetically imagined visual exploration of the innocence of an idealized amnesiac. <br /> <br /> The plot follows two threads, the weakest of which is the gradual revelation of Graham / Paul's condition. However, the wound through this is a beautiful description of his condition and his serpentine path to a partial awakening, driven by his adventure with Irene. <br /> <br /> The issue is the strong thread, while the details of the plot is carried by a collection of characters seemingly stuck: Graham's best friend, who can reveal the cause of his condition in a flashback of clunking, his manipulative boss and his crazy mad psychic comic scientist: all of whom are interested in keeping him lost and dependent. <br /> <br /> The failure of the film lies in the conflict between the two threads. One is visual, serpentine and sublime, while the other is structured like an inept thriller, all exhibition dialogue and unresolved symbolism patterns. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed Novo. He continues to flirt with the abyss of taboo and dodge something beautiful, like in the quarry, with the double bass and the two women, when a scene from a scene of cheap pornography becomes a segment of peace and rejuvenation. However, I still do not have the tooth. <br /> <br /> Strange, clumsy and a narrative failure, but with an almost redeeming beauty.
