If I had included Jack Black as the lead actor, I would have walked away from this movie immediately. Actually, it makes some of his films look good compared to this movie. This movie should have been filmed as a caricature for ages 3 to 8 and would have been much better. It's just a handful of the stupidest scenes from other movies created to make a big mess. It seems that the movie was filmed in a day without thinking about it. There are times when it seems that there will be a turning point and the film will actually have an argument for the film or at least a story will develop, but the stupid scenes inserted only ruin the whole movie.
