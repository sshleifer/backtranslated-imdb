Few videos in recent history have been produced as amateurish as this one, at least none that has been published by such a reputed distributor. Each frame of this film is a plaguerismo of best films of the past. The word 'clich√©' receives a new meaning from a writer / director without talent who should reserve his imagination for minor masturbation efforts that do not victimize moviegoers. Helping in the 'horror' effort of amateur night is a number of little capable technicians who contribute with bad photography and a laughable makeup and special effects. Unfortunately, one or two of the amateur actors in the film show a hint of talent that will go unnoticed due to the reputation that this atrocity will produce.
