First, season 1 is intolerably bad. The prison is ridiculously unrealistic, the characters are so two-dimensional that they are almost transparent and the direction is terrible. It works like a bad video of a high school play, the characters wander beyond the camera and pronounce very timed and rehearsed lines, passing as random chats in the prison. Soon the show gets better, but not by much. The return of the commercial break is always accompanied by a ridiculous monologue by Augustus Hill in a wheelchair, which is interpreted impressively by Harold Perrineau. The only time that his character is constantly bad is during the art monologues of misinterpretation, most of which take place in an inexplicable spinning glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what is happening in the show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, bad ideas in Oz could fill a multi-volume encyclopedia. Consider the whole situation in the first place. Prisoners can pass the time in plain sight getting drunk, doing drugs, and not only have CD players (CDs can also pass the meat knives), but all incoming mails are examined thoroughly by PRISONERS. Christ, the place is like a men's club with guards. Guards that do not do much. <br /> <br /> Near the end of the second season, the grandchild of a major prisoner is diagnosed with leukemia, and all prisoners throw thick stacks of $ 20 and $ 50 bills to help send him to Disneyworld to meet his last wish. These have to be the richest prisoners in the world. Suddenly, all the prisoners in Oz became affectionate and affectionate kids, except Kenny Wangler, an irritating character but one of the only ones who is always convincing. Even Adibisi wanted to be nice. But it's fine, because there's no order or meaning in the program, so even this is not a big distraction. <br /> <br /> Later, surprisingly, there is a boxing scene in which an inmate is wearing an "I Love Cops T-shirt". In prison! You can imagine?? I have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago. I sent him an old photo of us with some friends in high school, and in the picture, one of my friends was holding a bumper sticker "I Love Cops", and one of "the woods" (guys who have been in prison for years and years) saw the image, but only grabbed it and broke it into pieces. My cousin was lucky. <br /> <br /> Kenny Wangler also constantly criticizes the guards and even the senior officers for not calling him Bricks. One of them even tried to bribe him into going to an English class. You can lose track of who is in charge, the prisoners or the guards. More than one investigator, for example, enters the prison in a covert manner and dies trying to stop drug trafficking. Personally, I would simply stop allowing inmates to inspect incoming mail instead of risking investigators' lives. <br /> <br /> Let's see, what else? Shillinger's son is alone and no one thinks of asking the guard how he got the drugs. He just ... got them, I guess. And be sure to pay attention, otherwise you will miss the reason why the inmates have enough money to pay for the ascellular dermal grafts when they have bad gums. I did not know that guests in maximum security prisons had such luxurious treatment options. What about this? When Robson asks about Dr. Faraj's program to ask what race of gums he received, Faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and leaves his job on the spot. Do not doctors and dentists have the right to request not to see certain prisoners? After Poet and O'Reilly make the announcement to the entire prison, Robson asks him to see Dr. Faraj, and they accompany him to his office, they take him without calling, and the guard retires without saying a word. They could also give him a weapon. <br /> <br /> I should not go on with stupid ideas in this show, but it's like a flood, I can not stop it. Who thought of Chinese refugees who can not speak Chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless they are needed? Who thought of the ridiculous religious wars and all the reverend prisoners? Who thought about Robson's gum transplant? What is the deal with Busmalis and Agamemnon? Agamemnon because he clearly does not belong to the prison and Busmalis for the whole affair with his grandson. Macbeth, because it was only a ridiculous means to an end, so to speak. <br /> <br /> But what are the worst ideas? Things that do not go anywhere, that are constant. An Irishman comes to prison and builds a bomb. Threat to blow up the entire prison, the bomb turns out to be a failure and the episode ends when the bomb squad carries it away after the entire prison is evacuated. Nothing is heard from him or about the whole situation again. It's as if it never happened. In one episode, the prisoners receive dogs to train. What the hell?? If that was not bad enough, during a training session, a guard shoots his weapon inside the walls of the prison as a training exercise. Nobody seems to care. <br /> <br /> I also like how every time there is some kind of altercation, the guilty are put aside, they do not say anything, and the guards or the warden or Sister Pete or whoever always says: "I hope you do not think I'm going to let this happen!" And then they move away and let it go. The audience will not remember. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm ruined by Prison Break, but Oz is just a silly prison drama that could be better as a play. A short one. At least a low budget movie. There simply is not enough here to maintain a television program for several seasons. On the other hand, I watched six seasons on DVD. Sometimes I do not understand ...
