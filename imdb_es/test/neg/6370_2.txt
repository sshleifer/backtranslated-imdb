He was in sixth grade and this movie aired on PBS during a series called 'Wonderworks'. I remember clearly sitting in an armchair watching the movie with tears running down my face at the end. In the film, Jesse, the main character, forms an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie. Due to a very simple error, but neglected, one of the two dies. At that time, I found the story very powerful, because the fatal mistake is exactly the kind of mistake that a child would make, so any child who sees the film will find it very easy to identify and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that follows . . <br /> <br /> Last year, I finally located a VHS copy of the program. I probably should have stayed with my memories. When I watched the program as an adult, I was absolutely impressed by how horrible this movie was. My girlfriend also had a similar memory of the movie, and she was also very sad because of how bad the movie was compared to her memories. <br /> <br /> Many adults probably have a good memory of having seen this movie when they were children. I strongly recommend that these people leave their memories intact, and avoid watching this movie as an adult.
