this movie was not good I thought it would be a nice Disney movie like the original one. incorrect. It was uncomfortable for Christina Ricci, whom I expect much more than this, you could see just watching. I think doug e. Doug did the best he could. Sit 5-year-old children in front of this one, whichever is greater, and they could begin to fall asleep.
