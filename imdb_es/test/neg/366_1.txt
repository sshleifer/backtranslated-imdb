Okay, now this movie is a job. It is full of stupid references from Jesus and Dialougue that would make most human humans question whether or not they should be carrying movies at all. Big names like Roddy Piper and David Carradine appeal to you, but, tell me, this movie stinks. History is incomprehensible and completely lacks intelligence. The sets, the veihicles and the costumes come as a cross between bablon five and a bondage movie. I'm sure there's porn with better dialogue.
