I think "Rosemary's Baby" is the most overrated horror movie that exists. It's not scary, interesting or a lot of anything. It is reasonably well run and Ruth Gordon was wonderful, but that's it. But this sequel makes it look like "Gone with the Wind"! <br /> <br /> I caught this on television when I was 14 years old. Unfortunately, I still remember it. As far as I can remember, Rosemary's baby, Andrew, has now grown and the coven wants him to start taking over (the world he is). But there are forces that try to stop it ... and Andrew is also having doubts ... <br /> <br /> I give a 2 to this for several reasons: Gordon is in this (and still very good); Stephen McHattie was actually quite good as Andrew and at the beginning there is a spooky time with Rosemary (Patty Duke) being "kidnapped" by a bus ... without a driver. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's boring, silly and unnecessary. The original did not need a sequel! The follow-up of Ira Levin's book in 1999 was not much better. <br /> <br /> Tune in from the start with Duke ... and then disconnect. It's not worth the effort.
