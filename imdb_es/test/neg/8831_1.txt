I would like to make it very clear that I am not religious at all. I'm an atheist, but I could see that Richard Dorkins contradicted himself again and again. I would also like to make known that I am not the kind of person who discusses something with philosophy all the time, but I feel that when comparing science and religion we must be philosophical and willing to question the belief in the main science. In addition to questioning religious beliefs. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Richard Dorkins ever spends some time thinking philosophically about beliefs, anyone who thinks enough about science and religion will realize that science is, in fact, a religion . itself. Yes, there is a fundamental difference between the way in which scientific beliefs are held in comparison with other religions, but at its roots, it is faith in a particular human instinct. <br /> <br /> Throughout this series, Richard insists that scientific methods are the only correct way to think and that it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence of it is strong enough. If you dig deep enough into how science works, you will realize that it is as irrational as religion and that in the end it is about faith, faith in evidence, faith in our sanity, faith in our senses, but more than anything. if not, faith in our instinct to follow patterns of recurrence. <br /> <br /> This is not easy to explain, but think about how the laws of physics were decided, it was because they were and still are the most common patterns of recurrence. that we are aware of I think that human beings have an instinct that makes them believe that the more something remains in a certain state or place of existence, the more we suppose, beyond the blind FAITH, that it is more likely to remain so. For example, we do not expect gravity to suddenly work the other way around tomorrow, by this I mean moving matter away as it is supposed to attract it. But the only reason we do not expect this sudden change is because we have known for so long that it has always attracted us as far as we know. However, that does not mean that I can not do exactly the opposite tomorrow or even now. No matter how long something may remain in a given state or change, there is no rational reason to make assumptions about it, but we do so by instinct. I ask you to consider what a long and short period of time is. There is no such thing, I do not know exactly how long it took these wise assumptions to decide that everything must be made of matter, sound, light, etc., but we give them what they would consider as an advantage. ! Let's say much more than what was really 12,00000000000 years! Is that a long period of time? 9999999999999999999 years ago 12.00000000000 years seems an incredibly short period of time. As far as we know, there could be an extreme change in the so-called laws of science in the next trillion years. It is a comparison, only when we compare things can we say "that is long" or that it is short. It is the same with large and small, wide and thin, heavy and light, strong and weak and others. <br /> <br /> I doubt that any scientist can tell me why they think that trusting this instinct makes sense. I certainly do not see why I should do it, but that does not mean that we, as humanity, must necessarily stop using it. With this in mind, the most hypocritical comment that Richard Dorkins made was when he said that faith is irrational, "a process of not thinking," he said. If what we have in this instinct that I have been describing and this instinct that we all possess at some level is not faith, then I do not know what the hell it is. Other times when he is being hypocritical is when he talks about religions being of the Bronze Age, "says myths of the Bronze Age". I would like to point out that no matter how many scientific methods have changed over the years due to experience, experiments and evaluation, the pure rules of science are getting older and older! They could even be described as the holy bible of science. He was talking about how fed up he is that the different religions are stubborn "I'm right, he's wrong", but remembering how rough he was with the different interviewees, he seems to be as stubborn as himself. To be fair to him, at least he does not try to bombard religious communities. I appreciate their hatred for certain religious beliefs that generate war, but I do not respect their arrogance in their own beliefs. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, Richard has the right to believe in science if that is his way. I also have a scientific mentality, but I do not think he has the right to go to religious leaders who have hostile arguments, trying to impose their opinion and practically describing them as stupid. Despite all his education, experience and discoveries, he does not seem to have the wisdom to properly question his own belief system. I have read what he says in defense of this argument that open-minded atheists, as I have presented myself, what he says suggest to me that the point is completely lost. <br /> <br /> Finally the title of the documentary, Root of all evil. This establishes that religion is the root of all evil, it is not true. There are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion. <br /> <br /> The whole documentary series was frustrating, narrow-minded, hypocritical and total garbage.
