The 70s were undoubtedly the golden age of horror "made for television". This is one of those that probably occurred as an ABC movie of the week. It is the old story of a house and / or ghost that has one of the new owners. The film has a promise, but it has never been made. Everything hurries too much. Tension and suspense need time to grow and grow. And there is nothing new. We have seen everything before and a better one. <br /> <br /> One last reflection: I do not understand why the character of Robert Wagner would fall in love with the dead movie star when he is married to Kate Jackson for the love of God! !!
