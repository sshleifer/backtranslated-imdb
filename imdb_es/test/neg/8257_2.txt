It's a shame, really, that the script of this film had more holes than you could shake a stick (intentional mixed metaphor), because Kinski and Coyote, both interpreters with a supreme talent who are capable of a great subtlety and nuances, have a wonderful chemistry. , and the always provocative Fairuza Balk did not damage the mix either. Jeremy Piven would also have been great here, if his character (and all the other supporting characters) had not been written as a plot device. As for the main proceedings, the writers simply did not know how to create the appropriate guilty or innocent tension for Kinski's character; instead, they gave us confusion, contradiction and, for the end, simply, let's hope that the spectators -Do not notice the trap.
