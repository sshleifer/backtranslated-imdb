If it were not for editing out of the curses and a superimposed blur when one character gives a finger to the other, it would be easy to confuse this low budget snoozer with a science fiction channel pilot. The plot about the government's attempts to destroy a group of telekinetics that were originally trained as military weapons ends quite ambiguously with the hero, himself gifted, in search of a telekinetic survivor willing to take revenge. Unfortunately, the movie is talky, boring, predictable and even without interesting special effects. The prestigious Louis Gossett, Jr. has a minor role as the evil government bureaucrat who originated the program and now wants to eliminate all traces. He walks through the part and it's hard to understand why he got upset. Other cast members do a decent job with a script that demands little.
