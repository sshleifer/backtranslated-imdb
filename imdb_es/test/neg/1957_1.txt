This is the worst movie I've seen, without exception. From the weak-looking, poorly lit scenes, to the ridiculous acting, to the children's plot and the poor-quality action sequences, this movie is so bad, so hilarious. For about ten minutes. After which you will reach the remote control or the power outlet to finalize this film without experience. Although obviously it was done with all the production and the collective language of the acting staff ramming into the cheek (please, God), I found Jack Frost 2 so terrible that he could not be seen for more than a quarter of an hour. If you have not had enough after this time, you must be abusing drug abuse.
