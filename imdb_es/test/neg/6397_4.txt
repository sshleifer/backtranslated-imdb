In general, do not expect much and you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And if you want to see a movie that will take you back to 1983, this will do it for sure. The only reason I gave this movie 2 more points than it deserves is for 2 reasons: <br /> <br /> # 1. Michael Caine <br /> <br /> # 2. People, the sights, culture and music of Brazil <br /> <br /> Caine takes the film almost completely, since it is committed to the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semi-credible story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper fall short. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is pure class, as always. In addition to being a talented classic actor and comedian, Caine brings a mixture of introspection, malice and sensitivity to each film he makes ... the focus of his charm from his role in Alfie ... and the reason why he won the Award of the Academy for Hannah and her sisters 2 years later. In this farce, he is tenderly deceiving ... funny and vulnerable ... melancholic and sentimental ... and besides the jewel that is Rio de Janeiro, the ONLY reason not to look for a better form of entertainment. <Br /> <br /> Well ... maybe a look at the 2 beautiful young actresses, Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore would be a reason. But the only thing you can do is look at Michelle (although her appearance seems quite old-fashioned) ... there could not be a more painful cinematic experience than seeing her "try" to act (most of her dialogue also seems over-recorded). Demi's performance and appearance hold 100 times better and you could easily transplant her, as she is, to any movie today (she does not really look very different to be honest). Mrs. Moore is probably underutilized, especially considering that she was the biggest star of the 2. <br /> <br /> Except for the fact that it is a silly farce, in the end, I really like the maturity with which all these people handle this scandalous situation ... that does not end with friendships or marriages and that an issue, even with the minor's daughter of his best friend, could be forgiven and everyone can move on. The injured parties show anger and disappointment at what happened, but everything works in the best way ... a little unreal, of course, but surprisingly refreshing. Hope always is.
