I am from Australia and I have observed with respect the extraordinary culture that surrounds the rugby union in New Zealand. I can fully appreciate the comments made by the Kiwis in relation to this movie. It was a total insult to a race of people and their beloved sport. <br /> <br /> Whoever has been involved in the making of this atrocious movie must do so to formally apologize to anyone who has had the misfortune to see it. Note: people do NOT kneel and cry while they slowly recite the Hakka. What a sorry scene this was. <br /> <br /> We're supposed to feel some kind of sympathy for this idiot who almost killed his girlfriend, who refused to listen to any advice from anyone with half a brain, and apparently saw the light? What a disagreeable character (with visits to children's hospitals that do nothing to redeem his despicable personality). <br /> <br /> And why do people make a movie about Americans playing rugby? Do they just appear in the sport on the world stage, not even to justify an attempt to make a film about that (yes, Rugby is a 'world' sport, unlike the grill and baseball)?
