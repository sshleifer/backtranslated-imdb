The excellent production and a good comic performance of George Clooney can not be saved from the strangely strange, sometimes clumsy comedy of Joel and Ethan Coen. The story of the depression era goes back to yesterday with three chain prisoners who escaped in search of a hidden fortune, and inadvertently became stars of country music in the process. The film snakes along, but never builds any momentum. He gets a big boost thanks to Clooney's charismatic gable assault, and also to the artistic direction and the lively music of T-Bone Burnett. Otherwise, the script (for the Coens) lacks much humor and interest, the cameos of John Goodman and Holly Hunter do not contribute anything, and the second half of the film slips precariously into self-indulgence. ** since ****
