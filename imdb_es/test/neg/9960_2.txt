OK, this movie seems to have been well covered by previous comments, but there are a couple of elements that I want to add. The mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a caged animal to turn a man into a werewolf. If we suspend our disbelief enough to buy that, that's fine. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would make a werecoyote. Did the audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They are easy to differentiate. That is weak. <br /> <br /> Second, this movie was discussed in the third episode of MST3k (in the comedy channel). Joel and the bots needed a series of episodes to reach the maximum, and had not yet reached that point. HAVE ADDED enough to this snoozer to keep you awake until the end, but it was not one of his best episodes. They did not even mention the omnipresent omission of a real wolf, and THAT joke was hanging in the air waiting to be hit.
