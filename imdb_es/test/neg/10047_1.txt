This failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily won a place as one of the 10 worst movies I've seen. I am seriously considering buying a copy, if I can find a very cheap one, to scare away the unwanted companies. Honestly, it's so bad. I see it as a kind of anti-personnel weapon. If you're the kind of person who only has to see a train crash to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem. To be fair, Kelsey Grammar's character has 1 line that almost works, but he does not. Apart from that, everything in this film strives to be insightful, but loses its mark at approximately the distance between Earth and the closest pair of colliding galaxies. In general, I can appreciate a book or a movie where the protagonist suffers some kind of existential angst, but the anguish that is presented here is so incredible and exaggerated, and the film does not even address the nonsense that presents in a valuable way. If you are familiar with the term "word vomit", then you can get an image of the cinematrocity. Oh, and the narrative structure is ill-conceived, pretentious and amateurish. He has failed both in style and in substance. If you really hate someone, invite them to a double feature of this movie and "The Terror of Tiny Town," a western in the mid-1930s and place them in the restrictions with their eyes forced to open the "A Clockwork Orange" style. . But that probably violates some provision of the Geneva Conventions.
