weak direction, weak plot, not impressive music, I wonder why Udita Goswami is in the world of cinema in the first place. She tried to reveal a lot of her talent (mostly skin) but could not impress. <br /> <br /> the music was not that impressive, just one song "Jhalak Dikhlajaa" was worth listening to .... <br /> <br /> Aksar, the title? Well, in the end they tried to justify the title of the film, but it did not make sense ... <br /> <br /> there were many twists and turns not wanted in the story, which made it more boring. However, if someone is a fan of Dino Morea, please go ahead and look at him.
