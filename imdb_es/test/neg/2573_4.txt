Since I'm not a big fan of Steven Seagal, I thought this was a good movie. It is evident that his fans are very upset with this drama that lacks an abundance of martial arts and brute force. Weapons violations. He surrenders with the intention of releasing a deadly virus. Seagal is a former CIA agent who became a rural doctor who is pressured to find the antidote for the lethal insect that has incapacitated a small town. His grandfather's Native American herbal remedy figures in salvation. <br /> <br /> Notable appearances of L.Q. Jones, Camilla Belle and Silas Weir Mitchell. My personal favorite in this movie is Whitney Yellow Robe. It is impressive and seems to have what it takes to take on a more challenging role. <br /> <br /> Despite the crazy ending, this was a decent movie that could have used a lot more action.
