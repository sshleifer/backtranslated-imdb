Plot synopsis: Los Angeles in the future. Crime is kept under control by Core Trackers, android killers sent by the United States Computerized Judicial System to execute the perpetrators. Secret Service agent Eric Phillips avoids an attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (the man who created the USCJS), by the Union for Human Rights, a group of anti-machine activists. Dilly tries to start Phillips in his private circle, but the SS agent goes on the run after seeing Dilly murder a UHR agent in cold blood. Dilly sends Core Trackers after him. Phillips joins the UHR group and helps them uncover a conspiracy involving Dilly. <br /> <br /> "Cyber ​​Tracker" is the first of a series of sci-fi / action hybrids led by Richard Pepin, co-founder of PM Entertainment. , a power of action movies during the nineties. Other Pepin films include "Hologram Man", "T-Force", "The Silencers" and "Dark Breed". Pepin films usually start with an important action sequence that lasts about 10 minutes before allowing the plot to begin. The script of this movie has some plot holes? It is never clear what the conspiracy that the heroes are trying to stop is really. As for acting, Don "The Dragon" Wilson can be tough but can not act for beans, with little charisma. Your castmates are much better. The best bet of the film are the action scenes, which throw an impressive artillery fire, a huge body and not one but three moments when a vehicle flies through the air, turns and hits the ground, exploding. The edge of the visual effects on the cheap side and the musical score is discreet and sharp.
