I just watched this to see Joe Morton in a first role and, honestly, wished he had not bothered me, he can and he has, much better than this shit. I can not understand why someone finds this kind of fun stupidity, but each one to his own; It's an absolute mess and it's not funny in the least. No, wait, A line was just fun, where Mr. Kent (Joe) and his family are having dinner with this nut, as he has been invited to dinner (God only knows why). Pest for Mr. Kent: You know what a dog is like, you've been there. Mrs. Kent: Not lately, Joe's expression was funny, but that's a line that is not a great comedy and this tattoo is far from funny. be consigned to the nearest garbage cart, it is enough for that. Joe Morton: I'm glad to see that you no longer appear in the trash in this way; You are very superior and a great great actor.
