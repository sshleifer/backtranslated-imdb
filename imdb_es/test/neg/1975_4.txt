This program lasted most of the 1980s, and it had its moments, but the plots were usually sparse and often painfully not very funny. <br /> <br /> Terry Scott and June Whitfield were wasted in this series, both deserved better, but it provides some good memories and I found myself smiling in some repeated scenes. June Whitfield's talent for comedy may shine through the occasion (when she's not being frustrated for Terry) and she's really smart. <br /> <br /> The 1980s is the last decade in which you'll find this kind of middle-class, middle-aged comedy, and many people remember it fondly, but I'd rather remember the decade for alternative comedy and biting satire of Spitting Image.
