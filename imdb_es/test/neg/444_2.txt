God, it stunk. You can not end a horror movie with a happy family atmosphere forever. Yeash. I was a bit ambivalent in the final act. But, my God. He did not have to kill the girl, she did not die, the ghost father appears with a cure (which does not make sense, because his spirit would have been released after the Yankee boy killed all the bad werewolves). What a piece of garbage. This is the worst horror movie I've seen in a long time, and I've seen a lot of horror movies. This is a slap for Landis and everyone else involved in the American Werewolf in London. Blegh I hope this ruined everyone's career at the Julie Delphy bar. And CGI: something new and elegant in 1997, but nowadays it only looks monotonous compared to London's ingenious prosthetic / makeup work. Anyway, I'm done, I hope I scared some people. Get the original in its place, or failing that The Howling. Or failing to see that American Idol is repeated. Just do not look at this mess.
