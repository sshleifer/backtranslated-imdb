Let me start by saying that I loved the original Grudge. It was not one of the creepiest and most spooky experiences I've had in a crowded movie theater. I'm not kidding. Being a self-proclaimed, Japanophile also made the film look better in my eyes (if the stage had been changed to some American suburb, I probably would have ended up hating the movie). <br /> <br /> That said ... This movie is a complete disaster! I will not say that it stinks, because A) the movie has some good points, B) "stinks" is the most despicable in the history of insults. So, what does the movie have in its favor? Well, to begin with, it looks quite attractive: through the filters and the use of discolored and somber colors, Takashi Shimizu almost recreates the depressing and anguished atmosphere of the original. Some scenes are really shocking and unpredictable. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just bad. Period. <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere, unnecessarily told Tarantino style, that is, the scenes are out of chronological order. This technique does not make sense in the case of this movie and it just makes things more confusing. Frankly, a simple plot would have worked better. The original also lacked plot, but it made sense and the movie more than made up for its thin plot with many fears and a really tense atmosphere. Grudge 2 does not have any of these elements and it's just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the acting skills of the television shows that make the Grudge cast look like Emily Watson and Katherine Hepburn. In a nutshell, the movie does not work. It's too slow, too boring, and it's not scary enough to make up for the confusing plot (which, by the way, does not add anything new to the story, so even Grudge fans will not be happy). <br /> <br /> Oh, and what about the old man playing Japanese peek-a-boo on the bus? Is this supposed to be a comedic relief? Artistic statement? Or what?
