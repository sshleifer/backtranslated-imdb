It's just when a band rotates, and it only has one original member. It is not the same as the classic line. All the new actors play the main roles of Rag, Scotty, etc., with Ashby as practically the only recurring face of the first film. And he was unimportant in the first movie, serving as the only exchangeable group of the three types that Scotty was trying to help meet women. The film is badly written, with the most foolish dialogue on this side of Armageddon. Even for a T & A movie, this is a turkey. Not even the low-budget 80s films die. The fans would like to sit through this movie, which has no plot, and has a lot of bad acting. This movie would have been better never to be released. Just bad
