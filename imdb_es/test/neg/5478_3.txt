Of course, the concept had already been done with Alf and the enchantments: he pushed modern society to one or more characters out of place. But I loved both shows and I watched them religiously until they ended in 1990. When I heard about Scorch, I had high hopes for something new, since the new television in the 90s had not impressed me (but at least Star Trek: TNG and the Simpsons were still going. <br /> <br /> What I got was a big disappointment.The acting was horrible, but considering the ridiculous dialogue and the totally incredible writing, I can not blame them too much for what they had There were some comic moments, but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced in their delivery.All the production work on the show seemed too low for what was on television at the time.In the 80s it would have fit. <br /> <br /> Even so, it was the first episode and he had to present the characters and establish the whole premise of the series, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. It was bad, and I began to regain my hopes that once it got to its rhythm, the show would improve. Unfortunately, my VCR ended without recording the third episode aired, I never saw it, and the series disappeared from the television lists after that. All I have now are the first two episodes recorded from the air on a VHS tape.
