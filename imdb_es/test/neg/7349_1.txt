I've seen this program for a while, just for my cousins, and I HATE it! First, girls are dressed in the same style clothes and have the same first letter in their names. (Come on, I could do better than that!) Then the villains (excuse me), first we have a monkey with part of his (small) brain showing, then we have a (gay) version of the devil, a pink hill. , a gang of green gangs (pinch is ironic, that's her name) a pampered princess (once again, ironic, that's her name) among others. I have also found that there is no male hero in the show. (Not that I'm sexist or something ...) I prefer to see Sailor Moon, it's much better than this. If someone else wants to watch the program in the room you are in, look for a way to break the television. Believe me, it will save you half an hour of torture. <br /> <br /> Rating: I give this what it deserves, 1 out of 10. DO WHAT YOU DO!
