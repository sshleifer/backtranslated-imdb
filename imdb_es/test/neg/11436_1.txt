I can not imagine what Jon Voight might possibly have thought when he got involved in this ten-class, incoherent, pretentious, insensitizing decline. He helped write the supposed "script" himself, and I should be very ashamed of it. The movie (I can not call it a "movie" because it barely moves) is shamefully pretentious nonsense, something like a very bad show of Oprah Winfrey, but worse. He moves senselessly from medieval times to the current city of Los Angeles, with Voight as a television producer who believes he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the machinations of his evil brother, and somehow this is transfered. to modern times where Voight has to save the country from the evil machinations of an oil company executive. If the strange casting (Wilfrid Brimley, Frankie Valli (!), Kaye Ballard and Armand Assante, among others) is not enough to kill him, the direction superbly inept, the photograph destroyed (it seems that shot with a really cheap camera of 16 mm ), the almost complete lack of editing (the scenes continue and continue without stopping or are cut in the middle of a sentence), and Voight's shameful "performance", apparently of stream of consciousness, is enough to bury it, which is exactly what what should have been done with it. An amazing experience Avoid this dog at all costs.
