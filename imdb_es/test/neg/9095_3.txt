This is a candidate for the worst movies I've seen. He wanted to be as shocking as "The silence of the lambs", but he has neither the style nor the wit of the aforementioned. The makeup is excellent, the acting is pretty good, but the story seems to go on for years and the murders are so horrifying that they are more disturbing than entertaining.
