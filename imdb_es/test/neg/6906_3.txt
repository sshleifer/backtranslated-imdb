Today I took my 4 year old twins to see this movie and I would NOT recommend it for children of their age. <br /> <br /> This movie had many scenes of struggle, which I found too violent and which my children considered terrifying. <br /> <br /> The theme was well above the heads of my children and the death scene was too scary for a caricature aimed at children. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because we were all anxious to see this, but it just did not cut it. If you have children under 7, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Besides, all that went crazy for the whole movie.
