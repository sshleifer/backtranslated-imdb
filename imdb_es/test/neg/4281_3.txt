Being a big fan of Disney, I was very disappointed when I saw this garbage. The animation was beautiful and the backgrounds were incredible, but I think that good animation does not make up for a weak script and a weak story. I will have to disagree with people who say it is not suitable for children. Are there any deaths in the film but is not death something that children should be exposed to? But I digress. The script is riddled with bad puns and boring jokes ... the kind you would expect from most Dreamworks movies. The music was soppy, the moral forced (and forced without any charm) and the characters would explode into songs at totally inappropriate moments. The characters were also cold, and I really could not express any form of emotion towards them (irritation from the bar). I am a big fan of the jungle book, Aladdin and the new rhythm of the emperors, but this Disney movie was a total and absolute loss of time ... Do not see it !!!
