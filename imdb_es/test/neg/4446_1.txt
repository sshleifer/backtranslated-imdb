Wow. I thought, Eskimo Limon was the most horrible and embarrassing first class movie in history. But I had forgotten that Germany always tries to compete. In this case, the well-known German film producer Bernd Eichinger succeeded in producing even worse garbage. Harte Jungs is stupid, not credible and predictable, and above all: it's not funny. It is almost a tragedy that so many children have gone to see this in Germany (and, I fear, also Austria). <br /> <br /> Tobias Schenke, 19, seems too good not to have a girlfriend and is too mature to have 15 years, and his character is too stupid to be true. Schenke makes a great effort to make us believe that he does not know anything about sex, but that does not help. Harte Jungs seems to have been created by someone who saw Al Bundy and took it very seriously. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the film are Sissi Perlinger and Stefan Jürgens, who play Schenke's semi-liberal parents. Perlinger and Jürgens are comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting. Even so, their performances are the "best" and the "funniest" in comparison. <br /> <br /> A complete failure.
