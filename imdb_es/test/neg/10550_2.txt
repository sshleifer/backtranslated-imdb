I knew that this was heading towards disaster after looking at the clock within 7 minutes of time in the air. The plot: two people get married. They move to the house of the wife's parents. And the husband does not get along with his father-in-law, and if he has not seen this plot before, he probably has not seen television in the last 15 years or so.
