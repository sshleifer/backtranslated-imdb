Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this horrible movie. The acting, directing and the script are all of third class, with the whole film represented as an excuse for writer / director / star Larry Bishop to have sex. The only reason why it was performed is most likely due to its association with QT. The plot of the movie is quite flimsy, and basically it tries to survive with not-so-dark references to the older B movies and some cameos of guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper and Vinnie Jones. Everyone is indifferent in their performance, particularly Hopper, who is in full payment mode at this point in his career. The saving grace, if there is one, is that the script is so ridiculously bad that it can be entertaining. Bishop tries so hard to get the trademark of Tarentino to mock and simply fails miserably, which can sometimes be quite funny and annoy others. I only check this if you like bad movies ... or if you really like motorcyclist movies.
