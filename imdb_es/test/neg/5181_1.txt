This movie is beyond the horrible. AVOID ALL COSTS! I want my time and 20 minutes back! <br /> <br /> Not funny at all, you can watch this movie without laughing or even smile once. The oaths spill over the speakers like a waterfall, each becomes more annoying as the last, and does not contribute to the comedy Or the plot (general comedy, not this movie in general!). <br /> <br /> In short, it's a $ 5 ish movie, diluted and watered down - "Out Cold", but awfully awful. The film focuses on two groups of a city Pools and Riches (how obvious is that?), Where the two opposites have snowboard battles with each other. (The story is very similar to a 4-year-old's sleeping time without all the stupid jokes and pranks) <br /> <br /> MOVIE - 1/10 - because you can not give lower scores
