It is almost shameful to say that I even saw this movie. I want to say that it does not take much to make a good movie of zombies as well as good special effects, a lot of blood and blood, some moments of fear and a decent plot. Does House of the Dead 2 do any of these things right? No, not one. Of course, it's not as bad as his predecessor, Uwe Bowle, and that's the only thing in this movie that scares me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film is notorious, with lines like "What do you do to make a living?" in response "I kill zombies" and "I was never a disc jockey, I was a soldier". The special effects are embarrassing, even for a movie made for television, I mean seriously, all zombies seem to have bloody lips and are exaggerated. The base of the army in this film, is a parking garage, with a desk and a closed room. This movie has a budget so low that they could not even get mixed costumes. In fact, it seems that this whole movie was filmed in a high school. <br /> <br /> Also, why is it that all the female soldiers in this film are models? And why, why is everyone in this movie so clueless about what's going on that they just stay and let the zombies kill them? Hell, a boy even tries to feed the zombie. <br /> <br /> In general, this film makes even the worst Scifi Channel movies look fantastic.
