I can barely find the words to describe how much this garbage offended me. Why is it that American filmmakers always strive to portray Jamaicans as a group of crazy babies and, what is worse, Jamaicans who interpret an absolutely ridiculous tone when they try to imitate the accent? We are not all extremely dark, not all of us walk with machetes, either for work or for PROTECTION, we do not walk naked in our houses and we do not practice VOODOO. We are doctors, lawyers, architects, business men and women, musicians, actors and filmmakers. I am tired and tired of seeing all these representations of the Jamaicans as a group of trackers using the Rastafarians who do nothing but sit all day smoking marijuana on the beach or firing weapons in the air (when we are not living in our homes in the trees). ). Yes, we are wearing clothes. Yes, we have electricity. No, weed is not legal on the island. The worst part is that it is not just that I am angry and bitter, but that they are real answers to the questions that most Jamaicans who have traveled abroad have received at some point. Read a book before assuming what is in another country and, what is worse, decide to make a film about it. <br /> <br /> WELCOME TO JAMAICA! The land where all we do is murder white people and beat our bongos drums ... Tales from the crypt have officially sickened me, along with the entire team of people who worked on this garbage, especially the writer.
