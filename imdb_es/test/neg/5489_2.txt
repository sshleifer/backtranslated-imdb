'Illuminata' has extended the limits of the mediocrity of John Turturro from second-class actor to director, writer and producer of the third category. This movie was frightening. It is disjointed and flits from scene to scene with little flow or meaning relevant to the main storyline. <br /> <br /> We are presented with a heterogeneous mix of fragmented scenes, each one is not a sequence for all the others. The only thread that seems to run through them is that they occur in the lives of members of the same theater repertoire company. The few scenes that do matter to the plot are so complicated that often you can not tell if the dialogue comes from the story or from the actors who interpret their lines for the work within the story. <br /> <br /> If this story were a person, it would be a schizophrenic with a multiple personality disorder. I could not decide if it was a drama, a romance, a comedy, a tragedy, a sexual farce or a parody of the theater. It came closer to being bearable like a sexual farce. <br /> <br /> Turturro had no life and was impassive like Tuccio, supposedly a complex and passionate writer whose work has its great opportunity when the show currently in execution needs to be canceled due to the illness of the main actor. Susan Sarandon had a good performance as the oldest actress trying to seduce Tuccio for a role. Unfortunately, it seemed necessary to go topless, which only serves to illustrate that the hardware of the aging of sexual symbols is left much better for the imagination. Christoher Walkin gave a charming performance as the theatrical critic who makes passionate proposals to a cast member. Beverly D'Angelo and Ben Gazzara also had minor roles. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2. Apart from the Walken vignette, there really is not much to recommend, except that the puppets used in the opening and closing credits were phenomenally realistic and beautiful. Avoid this movie like the plague it is. <br /> <br />
