The basic premise of this film is that everyone in the world can know that a person is gay, except that person. And that a man who likes melodies, has good taste and has a neat appearance SHOULD be a homosexual. Yes, the movie is funny in parts, but the basic premise is homophobic and insulting that the whole movie collapses into something that is very painful to sit on. The performances, particularly Joan Cusak and Kevin Kline are very good.
