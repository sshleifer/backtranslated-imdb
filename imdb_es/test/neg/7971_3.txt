First I have to say that I have read everything about this topic and I know it from the inside out, and I was excited to finally see it, too. But you just have to read the book on which this miniseries is based to realize that it is not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago. It is based loosely on the facts, the rest is taken from the imagination of the scriptwriter. And, unfortunately, these changes are not successful and are mostly unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Vita and Violet did not use the names of Mitya and Lushka until they began their relationship, and during it Violet also called Vita Dmitri and Julian. It was Violet who chased Vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. The "seduction" scene when her adventure began, Violet was much more passive than the one depicted here and she certainly did not kiss Vita first. I could go on and on, all these examples were included when the series just started. In addition to all these alterations of the facts, the characterizations are also all wrong. Sometimes Vita behaves like a madwoman. Especially the scene in which he saw the announcement of Violet's commitment to the newspaper is simply ridiculous. Vita kept her wave of emotion inside. It was Violet who was temperamental and let her feelings (good or bad) show. Everything Vita did when she read it was that she almost fainted, that's all. Being a kind nature, Harold avoided confrontations in real life, but here sometimes it is quite severe and accusing. Harold and Vita always discussed their intimate things in letters, not verbally. And Violet ... I know that this series focused on Vita and Harold, but that does not mean that all the other characters have to be mere puppets on the sidelines. Here she is a totally one-dimensional character, and the lines she was given are mostly embarrassingly shallow. Actually, she was an intelligent, gifted, and extraordinary woman who has rarely given her the credit she deserves. I have always found a person much more interesting than Vita. In this series, her unhappiness, loneliness and her problems with her mother are totally ignored. The viewer also has a small clue of his origin and family, what kind of relationship (and marriage) Denys Trefusis had or how hard he fought for Vita. Vita was the only love of her life, her reason for being, and if Harold suffered during the romance, so did Violet. After that, his life was in ruins, and it took him time to recover. The statue could have played the role of Denys, with the depth that his character has. Lady Sackville-West is just a badly drawn caricature; An annoying chatterbox with an exaggerated French accent. <br /> <br /> The series ends with the scene totally badly written in Amiens, and that was the end of this subject, according to the scriptwriter. No, it continued a whole year after that, and its completion was much more persistent and sad than what was presented here. But what one cares about is the stupid ending if the whole series has been stupid from the beginning. I have to give the actors some credit, they tried to make the best of those roles they were given, although Janet McTeer as Vita is the only one that really shines. One can not complain about the configuration either. All complaints go to the director and, above all, to the scriptwriter. Instead of insightful character studies, there are too many sex scenes and a bland conversation. Many of the scenes are too long, others have no meaning and do not contribute anything to the story line. On the other hand many details are shortened or omitted completely. Especially there should have been more information about the young people of Vita and Violet, and how their friendship developed. This is a fascinating story that would have deserved a much better adaptation. Maybe someday someone will do it. At this time, one can do much more of this story by reading the actual book or the letters from Violet to Vita, which are brilliant things.
