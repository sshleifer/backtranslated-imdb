I was an extra in this movie, but I wish it was not because it's garbage. The worst thing about this movie is the music, but the acting, the script, the editing, the direction and the story are also terrible. The main reason is bad because the budget is very low and the only way to make a good movie with a low budget is to have a good script. the script that should have been ripped off before the movie was made is not funny, I did not laugh once. What made me laugh is how the manufacturers probably think that the most important thing was to make the film, who cares if it's total garbage. The film needed about a million pounds more budget and a better writer. The only reason I did not give the movie one in ten is because I felt sorry for the guy who's going to lose a few hundred thousand dollars doing this, if you go and see it, just make sure you're drunk in that moment. LOL
