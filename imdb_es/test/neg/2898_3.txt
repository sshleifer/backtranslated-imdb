"Ninja III" is not as bad as "Enter The Ninja", the first part of this "trilogy", but it's still a very bad movie. It will hardly please fans of martial arts movies, because there is not enough action, but even the action scenes themselves are often marred by ridiculous excesses and unnecessary violence. As if the film was not weak enough, the filmmakers turn parts of it into a stupid "The Exorcist." The only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the "dominated" heroine; She is a beautiful and athletic woman, who the director does not forget to exploit in various sordid ways: she turns out to be an aerobics teacher. I do not mind a bit of soft core exploitation, but you should not pretend to be anything else.
