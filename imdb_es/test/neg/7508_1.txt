Now, I'm a big fan of Zombie movies. I admit that Zombie movies are generally not that good, but I like them anyway. Despite the bad performance and worthless dialogues that occur in almost all Zombie movies, this is by far the worst. Look, there are some basic rules with zombie movies. 1. Zombies are suicidal. Tactics are rarely used, and NEVER act like a boxer. Do not dodge a blow to the head, take it with an ugly smile. They do not try to hit you in the face, they grab your arm and bite you. 2. Zombies can not talk. Only in Evil Dead. Otherwise, they DO NOT SPEAK. 3. You do not face zombies with weapons at a distance. You lose in a hand-to-hand fight against zombies. Firearms are used. In this film, however, hand-to-hand combat is the way to go, what is wrong. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I did not have redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Zombie movie, see one with an average score higher than 3 on IMDb.com
