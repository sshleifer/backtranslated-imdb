I thought that this movie was too absurd for me to finish watching it. The premise was too foolish and predictable. I did not get very far in the movie. <br /> <br /> Let me see. She is obviously older than the taxi driver (unless she is much younger than she seems). He is black and she is white. She earns more money than he (he's just a taxi driver). Those are 3 of the most statistically failed unions in society, all in one and we're supposed to pretend they have a chance in hell. It would be better if he married the boy he does not love. <br /> <br /> I only saw it partially because I love MJW as an actor. His performance was excellent. His was fine, but the premise is too silly. I did not see the end. I could not do it there, so I do not know if it ended differently than I predicted it would be the end. I can not imagine any black woman who likes this movie. There's something disgusting about seeing a black man tending to a white woman like that. And an old man in that. PLEASE! Not in the real world!
