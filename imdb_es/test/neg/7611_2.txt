I have not reviewed IMDb before, but this documentary is so overvalued that I felt compelled to vent. I would not even have finished looking if I had not been invited into someone's house. The film was deficient on many levels: First: the Treadwell video was created. The more he looked, the more it seemed that he acted like a person desperate to be famous instead of one who acted out of conviction. <br /> <br /> Second - The others in the movie, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were as witty and cheesy as he was. God, they seemed artificial. <br /> <br /> Third: Treadwell's mission to protect bears is pointless, as it did more harm than good by making bears get used to human presence. I think Treadwell really loved bears, but there is a lot of research that indicates that his efforts were wrong. Sometimes we have to sacrifice our enjoyment of wildlife to really help. <br /> <br /> Fourth: the entertainment value of the film was not half that of other wildlife films such as "The March of the Penguins" and "The Winged Migration". The filmmakers, in my opinion, did a poor job of sequencing the scenes and gave little incentive to keep looking. <br /> <br /> As a person who loves Alaskan bears, and other wild animals, I would love to see more people. Dedicated to the preservation of our wild lands. Hopefully your efforts will be less focused on people.
