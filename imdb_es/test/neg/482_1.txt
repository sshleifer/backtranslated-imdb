I love the movies called "blaxploitation" and I've seen dozens. Some, like COTTON COMES TO HARLEM, SHAFT and HAMMER have excellent production values ​​and are very entertaining, while many others are very cheap and dumb, but they are still entertaining, like BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH or COFFEY. However, DOLEMITE handles something weird for the genre: it's cheap and stupid and not at all entertaining! It's like a blaxploitation made for very, very stupid people. <br /> <br /> Years ago, I saw a takeoff of the Dolemite movies on "Mad TV" and, unfortunately, the real DOLEMITE is not better. Like the parody, the acting is simply atrocious. Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood. He can barely read his lines and his "karate" is a joke, with his kicks, obviously, he loses the goal again and again. As for the rest of the actors, many could be even worse. My favorite was the FBI guy who could not even remember his lines and really struggled to get them out, however, they did not even bother to re-shoot these scenes! In fact, both was inept that it cost me to understand if the movie was a joke. <br /> <br /> If you think that, despite the horrible action and action, there is something worth seeing. This movie, you're wrong. Even for the perverts out there hoping to see some skin, they will be disappointed. The naked women in the movie really look like unlucky prostitutes and there's nothing remotely sexy about their fallen bodies. I think looking at older people naked (seriously naked older people) is no worse than looking at these "ladies". And as for Rudy Ray, he has "male breasts." No black superhero or antihero should look so badly naked! For the love of God, put on your clothes and create a script that does not look like it was written by winos! <br /> <br /> FYI - Apparently, there are sequels to this movie! ! I can not imagine seeing them, so you'll just have to find someone else to review them. I've seen PLAN 9 FROM OUTSIDE SPACE, TEENS FROM OUTDOOR SPACE and ROBOT MONSTER, but I do not think I can watch another Dolemite movie, they're so bad!
