First of all, I am a gay man, although I do not live my life within the so-called "Community", and because of films like this, Gay's themed movies are not my favorite genre because 90% of them are garbage. Like this. If I could give you a zero, I would. (I do not understand all the positive comments, unless they were made by people who made this film) In fact, I stopped him in the 24th minute when the so-called "Anthony" kissed Adam out of the restaurant for no reason. And how is the son stealing the diner if he does not even live in the city? Bank transfers? The acting was horrible! The sound edition? (Listen to "Anthony" and Adam when they are sitting on the fence eating their lunch Each time the camera switches between the so-called actors, the sound changes, as if there was no filter in the microphone) Seriously, do not rent, or God forbid, buy this movie. horrible horrible horrible acting and just a stupid story.
