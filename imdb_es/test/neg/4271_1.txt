A total shit <br /> <br /> I was a little excited to see this, since it's the only movie version I've seen of Mansfield Park. I suffered the first four episodes, but as for the scene of the proposal between Henry and Fanny, I took brusqueness and had to turn it off. Whoever employs this lady of Sylvestra Le Touzel must be blind and deaf because the woman is the worst actress I've ever seen in my life. Everything is simply bad, bad, bad. I do not know. I just do not know why people who write Jane Austen's scripts seem to be unable to give their work the respect it deserves.
