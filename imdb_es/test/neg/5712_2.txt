This is a high-gloss soft-porn; A boring soap opera that concentrates on one thing: sex. They actually made sex boring, it's sad to say, because I challenge you to look at this lightly and tell me what the story was. What this is, is an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show off his great body and for Mickey Rourke to smile a lot. That's. The sufficiency of Rourke is so bad that it is disgusting and Bassinger, in spite of the great figure, looks cheaper than beautiful. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the photographer for some beautiful shots of a closeup and a wonderful color, but the story is very weak. There is no development of characters or plot, you can not compensate. Let's face it: this film was made for one reason only: to enthuse male viewers. At that level, he probably succeeded. If I remember, that's why I took a look at being a fan of Bassinger's looks, but in reality I was also expecting a story. <br /> <br /> Those who try to pass this as "artistic" and something deeper than soft Pornography is only fooling itself.
