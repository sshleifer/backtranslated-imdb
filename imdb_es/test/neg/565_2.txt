Peter Watkins, who has committed to fatalism and pessimism, sneaks around the pond to face the American justice system in 1971, with this priceless piece of paranoia zeitgeist that leans so far to the left that it falls constantly. Watkins is a pure tourist as she assembles this tragedy of our gang with cliche fanatics, hippies and black revolutionaries confronting happy police and military and a kangaroo court composed of disapproval of calcified adults who make fashion statements. Talk about a revolution. <br /> <br /> At Punishment Park we have a system of radical youth versus corrupt systems, since dissidents convicted of crimes have the option of imprisoning them or taking a three-day trip through Punishment Park (Death Valley) and freedom. Of course, the law enforcement officials who watch your trip are not willing to play fair and, combined with the suffocating heat, the fate of our protagonists seems sealed. <br /> <br /> Punishment Park has elements of Kafka in the environment and in the theme. The tests are carried out under a large tarpaulin where the prisoners in chains scream in defiance of a group of inquisitors (like members of Silence Majority for a Peaceful America) who snarl at him. None of the groups spends a lot of time listening to each other and the procedures at some point take a battle between teen parents over the car keys. Mainly, only one part says what is wrong with America and the other says what is right, without anyone offering solutions for change. Meanwhile, the martyrs of the Punishment Park stumble non-stop for the dessert, while the policemen with firearms act as twelve-year-old children. It has the look and feel of some of the 70s in my college film class when we were younger and we knew more than we know now. <br /> <br /> Peter Watkins has always been on the side of the weakest and the common man against what he perceives as a corrupt and powerful few. Culledon was a strong accusation of military atrocity in 18th century Scotland that still resonates. The war game is a crude and serious look at the nuclear consequences that should be necessary for all. The Punishment Park has its value too, but for another reason than the one planned. Watkins' vision today is an example of a textbook left in the paranoia of 70's culture and given the times (Vietnam, Kent State, Chicago 7), such shrill hysteria did not seem so far from the true. But 35 years later, the fever has decreased and Punishment Park, with its narrow and unrestricted point of view, is a pretty silly journey.
