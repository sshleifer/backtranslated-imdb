The box of this film is completely misrepresented. The cover shows a view of legs and panties in a short skirt. The title is 'Cake'. The synopsis on the back of the box seemed that Cat, the main character, was an outcast who became one of the popular students, but that popularity led to a strange lifestyle that he could not escape. Everything the box built for this movie was a horrible lie. I expected a kind of bad version, direct to video, of `Heathers' aimed at teenagers today. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you what Tart really was. Yes, this is really the plot; So if you do not want to know what's going on, stop reading. We have an unpleasant, boring rich girl. The best friend of this nasty girl is a moron. The skank is expelled from school, so the nasty girl makes friends with a British girl. This leads to the nasty girl who goes out with this bored guy, whom the box refers to as the "most popular kid in the school". If that boy was the most popular at his school, I wish I had gone to that high school, because I could have thrown a shit in him. Anyway, as any movie will tell you, the most popular boy in school is invariably a murderer or drug addict or thief, or in this case, all of the above. Anyway, they all end up disgusted by the nasty main character because she is Jewish. Then, the most popular boy in the school hits his best friend, the skank, to death with a rock because the skank caught the most popular boy in a homosexual act. The nasty stoic mother of the girl and the hypochondriac younger brother are there for her in the end. Oh, and the whole movie is about rich and miserable children and their horrible parents too. Wow, what's wrong with that? That sounds like a fantastic movie! Well, that's what I thought. But you see, there are no nice characters in this movie. The main character is boring. The filmmakers made their average, while during the film she continues to talk about how rare it is. The skank is not skanky enough, and has little screen time. The popular boy is nothing special. The popular girls are only your rich and ordinary girls. There are no moral lessons. Cat, the boring main character, is not a weirdo, has never become one of the really popular girls, and (worst of all) after all the crap she goes through, she thinks it's still too good for make friends with the only nice girl, the silly girl. To be honest, I have no idea why the movie is called Tart. I kept asking, who is the pie? Is she the cake? Are they all pies? At 94 minutes, in theory it's not a long movie. But after really seeing this terrible loss of a VHS tape, and not knowing who the cake was, I was surprised that the film lasted only an hour and a half. The movie felt like it was two hours and some change. After a while, I expected the movie to be about pop tarts. At least when you look at a box of pop cakes, you know what to expect.
