Do not be fooled This is not a zombie movie. Take it from a guy who loves zombie movies and who rents them all: the good and the horrible. Yes, this movie has a sequence of extended zombies, but it's basically an artistic exercise of existentialist fear, which is a long way to say it's boring. If you have worked hard all day and want to spend a couple of hours entertaining, rent something else. <br /> <br /> "Rise of the Undead" has cheap special effects, mediocre performances and unpleasant dialogues. All this is understandable in an independent, low-budget film, and I can forgive such shortcomings as long as a movie has an entertaining story to tell. Unfortunately, "Rise of the Undead" has hardly any history. On the other hand, acting is not ridiculously bad as much as non-existent. All the actors seem to have studied at the School of Wood Faces Buster Keaton. Would he have killed them to show some emotion? (And no, yelling is not equivalent to emoting). The only character that actually had some pizazz was killed first. Of course, there was another character who briefly held my interest. He looked and acted like Kyle McLachlan channeling Norman Bates, but it was too little, too late. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten one small detail: the film is a VISUAL medium. That means lighting your scenes well enough so that the viewer can really see what is happening. And all those jump cuts and artistic close-ups might have looked great at the time, but all they did was make the film jarring and confusing. There is nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple and clear way; just look at George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" to see how it is done excellently. And I know these people had a small budget, but if you can not hire the equipment and technicians to make the dialogue really audible, just go ahead and make a silent movie (then those wooden faces of Buster Keaton could work). <br /> <br /> I'm going to say this for the movie: the zombies were creepy. Unlike most zombie movies in which the undead are shown in all their decaying glory, the coarser, the better, the zombies here were just shuffling people, with bloody faces. In fact, it worked to make them more similar to us, and therefore, more terrifying. That's the reason why I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1. <br /> <br /> The sad part of all this is that, despite all its flaws, "Rise of the Undead" does not insults your intelligence. The filmmakers seemed to have really wanted to make an intelligent, frightening and original film, and it is a pity that they have failed so miserably. If you could just give up too sophisticated editing, buy some extra bulbs, increase the dialogue and create a real story that really goes somewhere, then I think you have the talent to do something really good. <Br /> <br /> Trust me: do not waste time on "Rise of the Undead".
