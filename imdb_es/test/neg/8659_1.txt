this is the worst movie I've seen and what disappoints me the most is that this is the yash raj movie, so at the beginning, when you see the promotions, you think so, that's definitely another hit from yash raj. disappoint the plot is stupid and silly we have seen many times, the boy will soon get married and falls in love with a girl, blah, blah, blah. If you see this pathetic movie, do not go with your family, there is too much exposure and kissing scene. I do not even see why you would go see it on your own. In general, this is a disgusting shame and anything else that is bad and starts with a movie and you do not go to see it, you will end up hating the films of yash ji and yash raj.
