I've seen stuffed kung fu fights. Living in Taiwan, they appear instead of comedies in the United States. I've seen movies that make fun of themselves, but this movie belongs to the sad category of wrestling films that try too hard with horrible actors, horrible props and horrible music that must be taken seriously. I seriously felt sorry for the person who composed the music for this movie. How sad it must be to be a composer who has to produce nonsense like what I thought should have been titled "Generic ninja fight scene, Op. 1" or "Variations on a bad boy pointing a gun at the head of a girl when he stepped back to A corner "or the daring" Helicopter flight ". Then the fight scenes ended and the credits rolled. Those in fact had me in tears laughing. If the "special effects" were not proof enough that it was a low budget, the fact that only two or three of the crew members, presumably the locals, although it is good for the much needed economy of the Philippines, probably It was done just to save money. I've done something since this series of movies. Equipment was rented, despite making sequels to this movie. That was also quite fun. However, what really made me go on, was not the music (which left me almost waiting for an animated Sargeant Slaughter from GI Joe), but the ending ... I guess this would be a problem if there really was an argument. to spoil it, but when the American Ninja drops the girl in Jackson's arms and then removes the mask, he wanted to see him jump from the ceiling and Jackson drop the girl to catch him. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been the perfect phrase for this movie joke.
