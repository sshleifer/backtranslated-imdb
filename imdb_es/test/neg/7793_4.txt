This seems to be one of Noel Coward's lesser-known films, and it's easy to understand why. Taken seriously, it's not a bad movie, but it's not terrible either. Nothing happens at all throughout the course of the film, it is simply the story of the unfortunate romance of Chris and Leonora and the reaction of Barbara. The only thing that keeps the film interesting is the fact that we already know that it will end badly for one reason or another, due to the first scene. Interestingly, there are many perfect opportunities in history for the conflict and yet none of them is used. For example, it would have been much more interesting and credible if Barbara had quarreled with Leonora, but instead the two remained on good terms throughout the film. The notion that Barbara had been betrayed by her friend was not explored at all, in fact, she did not even seem betrayed by her husband; he even encourages him to go on vacation with Leonora. Similarly, Chris' two secretaries in their practice, Susan Birch and Tim Verney, who are also close friends of Chris and Barbara, are never forced to take sides. In fact, Tim pulls himself away from the conflict by telling Chris that he's very fond of him and Barbara. Despite the strange lack of conflict, the biggest flaw in the movie is the fact that we do not care if Chris ends up with Leonora or Barbara. The personalities of the two women are indistinguishable anyway, so we do not know which of the two is better to be with Chris, and besides this, Barbara's permissiveness gives the impression that she does not care about the matter anyway. Also, I found Chris and Leonora's relationship somewhat unconvincing. I can overlook the ridiculously short period of time in which they fall into each other because that is very common in movies of this era, but even then the relationship seemed superficial. The character of Coward was too austere and cynical to be the subject of Leonora's affections. It reminds me of the socially inept genius Sir Earnest Pease from the movie "Very Important Person": I'm sure the two would have got on well. Chris's coldness and austerity made his love for Leonora seem disingenuous. I think Coward should have sat down and given his share to a younger man. As it is, I constantly wondered what this young beauty saw in a bald, mostly emotionless and balding middle-aged man. Despite all my criticism, the film is still interesting, but not terribly convincing. The fact that none of the characters is particularly well developed gives them an enigmatic nature, which is somewhat intriguing. The Astonished Heart is worth seeing, but it is a defective piece of cinema.
