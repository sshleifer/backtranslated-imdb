Extending the panic of Broadway to Bombay, The Giant Claw of 1957 presumes to be the best flying monster in the history of cinema. Described by a terrified Quebecer witness as "La Carcagne, she's a demon in the storm with the wolf face and the body of a woman with wings, bigger than I can tell", does not say much for Canadian women since we finally see it Focused, it is a cross between an overgrown vulture, a chicken coop and Gonzo the Great. But is not this an old giant turkey? rocket-proof, invisible to radar and with the pleasure of swallowing whole paratroopers and pecking at the United Nations Building, it's a giant extraterrestrial turkey from an antimatter galaxy millions of miles from Earth that has come here to build a nest : "No Other explanation is possible". Luckily for humanity, Jeff Morrow, test pilot and "head chef and bottle washer in a one-man birdwatching society," invents a weapon to defuse his impenetrable shield so they can hit him with everything but the kitchen sink. but do not worry: the general of Morris Ankrum assures you: "We have kitchen sinks, son". ??

"The only problem is that the last time I spoke with a chaplain that there was no phone line to the only place where we can get the kind of help we need" and the immortal "There he is now, attacking the United Nations building!"
