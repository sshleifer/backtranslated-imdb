Okay, the only reason I saw this movie is because Krista Allen is in it. Since I admit seeing the days of our lives ... I know her as Billie. Oh, sure, maybe there's a reason to watch this movie ... that would be the soft porn area. They seem exel of that. And a little more. I hope that anyone who rents / buys this movie has rented it just for the sex scene. Because if they bought / rented it for something else, let's say, quality TV, they can die from a heart attack. This movie implies little imagination at all. Although I laugh a lot for his stupidity, and maybe I buy it myself, I'm a fool. Rent before buying in this. 2 of 10. (note that I have not yet given a movie a 1. The sensual scene just gave itself and went up a 1. if you did not have a 1 in the pot and I want a refund if you do not I would have done it.
