MGM Jimmy Hodgepodge During organizing a great party for everyone in Hollywood. No big stars appear: we have the Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I did not recognize anyone else, they were probably strangers (for good reason). The film contains annoying and funny jokes and some really frightening songs and choreography. The only things that prevent this from being a total disaster are the "battle" of Laurel & Hardy with Lupe Velez and a wonderful Disney cartoon called "The Hot Chocolate Soldier". It is a beautiful colorful caricature that gives a great boost to the film. Otherwise, the movie is a colossal boredom. There is no accredited director, what does that tell you?
