This film was included in the DVD of the Six Wives of Henry VIII of the BBC. I loved those six movies. They were well acted, well written, and historically accurate. In fact, I read Gregory's book and I liked it well enough, even though it has HUGE historical inaccuracies (I mean the whole homosexual angle with George Boleyn in particular), but this movie did not even mention that. That angle was one of the fundamental points of the book. <br /> <br /> Above all, this movie leaves me wondering "WHY?" Why do we see, as someone else rightly said, "The real world: Tudor England"? Why are the angles of the camera so bad in general? <br /> <br /> Why is the script so bad? I mean, I know it was improvisation, but come on! The actors at the moment stutter and stutter about their lines and it is obvious that they are inventing them as they go forward. <br /> <br /> Why are sex scenes so uncomfortable? The way they were made in the book made them at least something interesting. In the movie they are just bad, on the verge of being absolutely fun. At one point, the actress who played Mary Boleyn was having sex with the actor who played Henry VIII. He's walking away and he has this expression on his face that says "Hm ... I need to go to the store." "It's over already? Maybe if he ends I can go pick up some cheese very quickly ..." It's just bad . <br /> <br /> Why does Catherine de Arag√≥n play such a small role in this movie? His refusal to divorce was one of the main causes of the scandal that shook Christianity. She is the reason why Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn could not marry immediately. Why is not he present here? Above all, this movie is just bad.
