This movie was total cheese. The only good thing about that was the performance. Apart from that, nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> Big Time Spoilers Coming Soon! Do not read anymore if you have not seen it! <br /> <br /> This film focuses on a family whose happy and wonderful lives have been shattered as a result of their youngest son and then, as they discover their eldest son have been bothered by their daycare providers. Although they are called liars in court and the defense attorney is a real problem, the jury finds them guilty and finds them guilty. <br /> <br /> In the end, all I can say to the director is: "The next time I want to make a movie like this, do it another way".
