This movie is very modern and advanced. It's around 75% in English. It is aimed at a young audience that speaks English and is multiple. The basic plot is similar to DDLJ. Acting is below average. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they are portraying an incorrect image and setting a bad example for young people. Tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle or taking pictures of tequila about 5 to 6 times in the movie. The principal does not even acknowledge that he is an alcoholic and has problems with drinking. Throughout the movie you only wear bikini tops if you are at work, on the beach or at a wedding. The heroine in the film who does this makes the young feel that this behavior is acceptable. <br /> <br /> The less said about the failure of Uday Chopra to do the DDLJ role of Shahrukh Khan of arrogant girl chaser, the better. The film is about the equality of the sexes. But equality should not consist in making the same mistakes, instead of doing the right thing to do the right thing. If men have been portrayed as chronic Casanovas in movies, it does not mean that women should also exhibit the same behavior. <br /> <br /> Although the film is made with a fun and cheerful spirit, it promotes many misguided social notions. The name of being a forward, that "funny" part of the movie has no impact. Even in Canada, women do not dress like that, or boys behave as they have shown in the film. It certainly is not a reflection of Indian society or even of Canadian society. Maybe they should have a disclaimer at the beginning that says: "All the characters and events in the film are imaginary and do not reflect the real culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film." The only good thing about this movie is the duration, 1.5 hours, thank God.
