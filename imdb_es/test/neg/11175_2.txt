Ring! Ring! Having been the direct line of terror directors, how can we help you? Um, yes, soon! I mean hello, my name is Rugge? err, call me by my initials R.D! According to Mr. R.D, what seems to be the problem? Well, the criticisms of my last movie "Dial: Help" were negative and harsh and, frankly, I feel that my career has also seen better days. All right, Mr. R.D, and why do you think that's the way it is? Well, I gained fame and a well deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking film about wild tribes of cannibals that devour a film crew and another about implacable thugs that terrorize rich people in a house on the edge of the park, so He borrowed the idea from Wes Craven, but "Dial: Help" revolves around ?? err?? no matter! No, no, Mr. R., go ahead and tell me what the movie is about. Um, it's a spiritually possessed phone line that stalks a sexy model and kills the people around her. Oh I see. That premise actually sounds a bit silly and not as petrifying as cannibals or rapists, but I guess there are deeper issues in your movie, right? Oh yes, Um, what do you mean by that? Well, is not the symbolism of the telephone line for another type of terror? Or maybe everything is happening in the mind of your female heroine? Um no? It is a phone that goes crazy and kills people with cable, vibrations, electricity or even common currencies. Interesting, Mr. R.D, but how do you explain all these supernatural things to the viewer at the end of the movie? You see, I realized that the plot of the mystery of the phones would slowly unravel and would not be so important or relevant, so I concentrated on processing all the possible phone tricks I could think of. Phone tricks? What do you mean? You know, like the wind blowing through the horn, the tones of the sphere that penetrate the mind and the spinning tables that are thrown into the air. Very original, Mr. RD, but not exactly horrible and as an experienced director, you should know that, in the end, people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events. Oh, but there! Everything has to do with negative and unprecedented energy, if I remember correctly! Everything is a bit confusing, I admit it. Hmm ?? I see. Oh, well, as they always say, a good moving image is based on more elements than just the story. Did you at least process some of your usual commercial brands in the movie, so that your fans at least recognize your style? I tried! God knows I tried, but the murders and the bloodshed just do not surprise anyone! It's a shame, Mr. R.D, but what about sex? Everyone likes a good part of laziness and nudity in their horror movies and you yourself said that the movie focused on a sexy fashion model in danger! Yes, but ?? But what, Mr. R.D? Well, to tell you the truth, we promoted the type of "Dial: Help" as an erotic thriller with revealing images of Charlotte Lewis on the cover, but in reality there is no sex in the film and Charlotte even refused to go topless. Mr. R.D! Now I am really disappointed, that is simply to deprive people and deceive them with false promises! I know, I know, and I'm ashamed, but I just wanted everyone to rent "Dial: Help" and I love them. Well, to summarize, I can console you by saying that all the principal directors have the right to make some wrong decisions without affecting your career right away, but next time be more cautious and do some research, are you okay, Mr. R.? I will; Thank you! You are welcome. Tell me, do you already have any ideas for the next films? Yes, in fact, I do! I was thinking about doing a Giallo with a killer washing machine! Does not it sound fascinating? Hello? Hello?
