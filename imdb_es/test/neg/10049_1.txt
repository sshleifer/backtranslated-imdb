What would happen if someone made a horror movie that had no argument? <br /> <br /> Well, I think it will probably end a bit like this. I do not think I've ever seen such a stable movement that has slipped from the beginning (at the beginning) to complete the shit (at the end). I just kept going with that, because I kept thinking that it could not possibly get worse. Well, until the end, "Necrophagus" / "Graveyard of Horror" showed that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Who would have suspected that a movie with an undead lizard man, an evil cult cultivating tombs, and mad scientists thrown out for no discernible reason could suck this? One would think that at least there would be some humor value ... but not here.
