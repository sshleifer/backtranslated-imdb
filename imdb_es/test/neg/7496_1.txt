I was ready for a movie like Crouching Tiger and all I got was the worst movie I've seen in years. He was almost as bad as Baron Von Munchhuasen. Dead writing. Acting dead. Dead everything. <br /> <br /> Of course, there were some good fight scenes but the positive side ends there. If this movie comes to your house, go to a phone, dial 911 and say: "Please help me, there is a movie in my house designed to force people to commit suicide."
