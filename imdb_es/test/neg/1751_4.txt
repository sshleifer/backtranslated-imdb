I just saw Shame, which is directed by Ingmar Bergman. The movie was interesting and very unique. I liked how it was in Swedish with subtitles in English and also in black and white. These characteristics allowed me to better relate to the characters, the period of time and their stories. I did not like how the movie was very slow at first and how you did not know what was really going on. At first, it was mainly a story about the relationship between Eva and Jan. The film also ended on a very depressing note because nothing good came out of all the conflicts and changes throughout the film. I probably would not see the shame again, but it was a very cultured experience.
