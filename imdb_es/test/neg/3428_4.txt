The story of Farewell to the King is intriguing. An American "deserter" (I had the impression that he and his 3 companions were just trying to escape from the Philippines, since their desperate raft escape to Borneo is not their classic desertion). But as soon as they reach land when they are discovered by the Japanese. The character of Nolte (a sergeant) only a few moments ago walked alone on the beach and did not notice. And incredibly, no one noticed his footprints in the sand that would have taken the Japanese to him. But anyway, Nolte is taken in by a tribe of headhunters and becomes his king after defeating another member of the tribe. So he is out of the war. Then the British commandos appear and want the tribe to help them fight against the Japanese. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Nolte's incessant hamming ruins an interesting story. Instead of acting like a former soldier returned to war, now with a tribe of warriors under his command, Nolte acts as if he had been raised by the tribe. He speaks as if English was almost a foreign language, he rarely used contractions. He makes radical gestures when he speaks, and acts as if he were one with nature, as if he had grown up in the jungle. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action and many interesting scenes with the British interacting with Nolte and the tribe. But the character of Nolte is never credible. It always seems that he is exaggerating. He needed to be a little more of an American soldier, let alone a member of the tribe. As it is, it appears, not as a real king, but as a madman who has forgotten who he really is. But that is not the intention of the film, since the script makes him admire and trust the British commandos. It is never suggested that the British thought their behavior was strange. It is simply seen by the British as the de facto leader of the tribe. Therefore, it always seems that Nolte's character does not fit what is supposed to be happening in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another actor could have done a great job with the paper, having presented his lines in a credible way and done it. It's an outstanding film. But Nolte ruins the movie by silencing each scene and apparently does not understand what his character is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> What a waste.
