If you look at the ratings, you would assume that this is a classic, but once again, it is just another example of independent filmmakers trying to increase interest in their film. Are not you even being smart about it 10/10 on the votes? I guess to change the curve and compensate all the 1/10 you will get. Is this better than any decent zombie movie? No. <br /> <br /> Acting, cheesy and trash. <br /> <br /> Sound effects, cheap and unpleasant, if it were not for where the actors looked, I would not know where they came from. Since. <br /> <br /> Cinematography. These people act as if they borrowed their parents' camera right after seeing the matrix. Less is more, but more of this equipment is absolutely pap. <br /> <br /> Zombies are also garbage. I do not doubt that most of these people will never be heard again, and it will be for a good reason. I hope the zombies eat their eyes since they were 90 minutes of Papanicolaou that I will not return. <br /> <br /> And the falsified grades do it a million times worse. <br /> <br /> A critic said it was one of the best horror movies he's seen in the last 30 years? I can only assume that your recent corneal transplant was a success at that time. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer as a warning of how bad this movie is.
