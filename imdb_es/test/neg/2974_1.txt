For football fans everywhere, stay away from this movie. It was so baaaaddd! Lame act, lame script, lame football and no direction! I rented this movie during my stay in Asia and I was horrified to consider that this was one of the best movies in Singapore. It was simply absurd and completely boring. There are thousands of rich and exciting stories in Asia. Why write a bad story about stereotyped and superior Singaporeans?
