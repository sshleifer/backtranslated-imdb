The only reason why this movie is not given a 1 (awful) vote is that the performance of Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan is excellent. Ida Lupino, who is charming, as usual, becomes increasingly disturbed as she tries several ways to get rid of a madman. Robert Ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character, guided only by his disturbed mind, changes from minute to minute. Seemingly simple and docile, he suddenly becomes clever and threatening. Mrs. Lupino's character was in more danger because of the house in which she lived and because of her own stupidity than for anyone who came. He could not leave his own home: the windows did not open, the front and back doors were locked and locked from inside. You could not have designed a worse fire trap if you had tried. She did not take the precaution of even having an extra key. She also could not figure out how to ask for help from nearby neighbors or leave her own basement while she was locked up and out of sight of her captor. I do not know in what war her husband was killed, but if it was World War II, the furniture in her house, the clothing styles, especially the children, and the telephone repairman's car are clearly anachronistic. I recommend watching this movie just to see what oddities you can find.
