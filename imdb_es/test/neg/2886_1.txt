A man is building a hotel with a partner. Discover that the hotel is over insured. Things get worse. This movie has a lot of scenes. They must have been put together in someone's dream. Jump from place to place. He does not stay focused on anything for a long time. The ending begins on Christmas morning with a hotel fire. Then cut to a night scene of that fire and then return to the day. The sound track of the DVD is horrible. It takes a fair plot and it becomes the worst movie I have scene in a long time.
