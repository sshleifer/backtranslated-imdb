"Wagons East" is widely known as the latest John Candy movie, since he died on the set. That's what makes him so sad: not only that Candy suffered a fatal heart attack, but it was on the set of such a horrible movie. Seriously, I do not know what you were thinking when you came up with this shit, but the movie DOES NOT have redeeming qualities. It's as if they took all the scripts that were not used for stupid westerns and simply mixed and filmed them. It is not surprising that John Candy did not want to make the film; Maybe his contractual participation was what made him enter. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the point is that Candy did a lot better than this throughout her career. To be sure, he had already completed the "Canadian Bacon" by Michael Moore, in which the United States declares war on Canada. Just keep that and you can say that Candy ended her career with honor. As for Richard Lewis, who had previously co-starred with Candy in the absurd but hilarious Eugene Levy, "Once Upon a Crime", he made up for this piece of trash by the frequent guest who appears in "Countdown with Keith Olbermann" in later years.
