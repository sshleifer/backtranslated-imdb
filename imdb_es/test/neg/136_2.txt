I'm trying to find something of value here. The best I can muster is that Truffaut wanted to make a film as tedious, painful, puerile, annoying, illogical and brainless as the experience of being in love. If that was your goal, then you succeeded, but the solution to your exercise is really an obstacle to see. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that screams for a parody: Belmondo compares the features of Deneuve's face with those of Deneuve's face. Traits in a landscape. All I could think of all the time was "glacier," "ice floe," "two lone fishermen carrying the Army's surplus on a frozen lake in Minnesota." <br /> <br /> The only other point of interest was the resurrection of Buffoon's theory of climate determinism. The tropics are presented as a paradise, and things get progressively worse as they cool down, hell being French Calvinist Switzerland. That was funny.
