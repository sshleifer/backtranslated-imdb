I saw this movie and I got bored in the head! I'm a Peanuts fan, but I do not understand why Charles Schultz let this disaster happen! Spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Snoopy let his friends sleep on the floor outside in a dangerous situation and go to a bar and drink a few cold without being on duty. The story was complete nonsense, even for comic book characters. It takes them too long to get to France, and once they arrive in France I had the feeling that the writer (I still can not believe it was Schultz) did not know what to do once they got there. <br /> <br /> Peanuts is best done in 30-minute episodes, not in 80-minute movies. <br /> <br /> Go home, Charlie Brown, you're at your best there. <br /> <br />
