I was encouraged to see Shark Hunter because of the comments posted on IMDB. The movie was bad, but the shark was great, blah, blah, blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was bad on so many levels that I'm glad to have the option to move quickly. The shark itself is fine. His appearance is decent and is the only thing that prevents this movie from getting a 1 (I gave it a 2). The acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is equally deplorable. I did not expect much, but this suckfest surprised me continuously. Antonio Sabato Jr. is a kind of biologist or scientist or something, he really was not paying attention. He goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that the shark eliminated, of course. By the way, all scenes that show someone working underwater are not under water. First of all, if you're just going to find out what happened to this station, what about the huge tranquilizer darts and the harpoons and stuff. These are the things that you normally carry with you when you investigate an accident. The theory of sharks was advanced by Antonio as he progressed, so it is not as if they knew what they were facing. Antonio and this young university student, horrible actress by the way, just jump to the controls of the submarine when the submarine is in trouble. What's up with that? Unless everyone is receiving some kind of sub training before leaving high school, I find this a bit silly. The director seems to think that if team members are working in the background, then it's a good idea to put someone in the background. Metalworking is very important when you are in a sub, I suppose. Anyway I could go on but I've already said too much. Conclusion: Go to your local video store, rent this video and then destroy it. Then, send an email requesting IMDB to remove all records of this movie from your site. All the memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed. We can do it if we work together.
