Rarely seen a film that deviates so much from the original premise and still remains (more or less) acceptable: Bloodline is a fairly short adventure (which is good in this case) that focuses on the mysterious Hellraiser box. Who wanted it done and how it spellbound the entire bloodline of the man who finally created it. We are introduced to 3 generations of the Merchant family (all played by Bruce Ramsey); One in the 18th century in Paris, one in the present and the last in a future galaxy far, far away? Opinions about this story may differ a lot, whether you think it is very stupid and outlandish or original and bold. The initial atmosphere and configuration of Clive Barker have completely vanished, but the morbid remains that surround it and several sequences are still very scary and disturbing. Hellraiser: Bloodline contains a lot of exquisite killings and the charismatic presence of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) is still an additional horror value. Pinhead ?? Accompanied by a pet puppy this time He still knows how to kill very badly, he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get bored quickly. The best aspects of this production are the newly introduced 'cenobites' and the hidden Parisian portrait. The giant blackouts are the weak script, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to the initial masterpiece of Barker. <br /> <br /> Although it is not very memorable in itself, Bloodline is the latest Hellraiser movie that can be seen. After this sequel, the series fell completely. So far, 2 more sequels have come out (2 more are still in process) and none of those are worth seeing. Hellraiser: Bloodline suffered many production difficulties and the director finally preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee, which means he does not want to be remembered as the director of it. Who could blame him?
