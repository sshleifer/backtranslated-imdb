Okay, Gus Van Sant wanted to remake Psycho in color to be able to take it to modern audiences, who would probably suffer a cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see a black and white movie, while conveniently forgetting that both "Employees" and "Schindler's List" were filmed in black and white and are excellent films. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the same narrow-minded people who would not want to see a great movie just because it's in black & White are the same people who would not want to "Psycho" anyway, because they do not have a scene of murder or sex every two minutes. And the murders are not the creepy blood / guts / blood / bone that people are used to seeing "Halloween", "Friday the 13th" and "Nightmare on Elm Street". This is the reason why redoing "Psycho" almost exactly as it was originally intended to not work, because in reality it is only of interest to people who are fanatical of the original. Everyone else is just watching to follow them until the next sequel to "Scream" comes out, and for that reason, they will be disappointed. "Psycho" is based on suspense and mystery, not blood and guts. (And so that nobody thinks that I must be a person of the third age if I like the old films, let me clarify the subject saying that I am 21 years old). <br /> <br /> So if making the film in color was all that Van Sant wanted to change, why not just color the film and relaunch it? I mean, what's the point of redoing a movie if you're not going to change * anything *? The least he could have done was turn his own director around, instead of just copying Hitchcock's, or even better, hiring a new writer to adapt a new script for the original book "Psycho." But it seems that Van Sant could not decide if he wanted to redo "Psycho" * exactly * or not. This should have been an all-or-nothing project, either redo the film exactly or do it differently, but as it is, this movie is about 95% the same, but with a few touches thrown in there seems to have no purpose. Like having Norman masturbating while he spies Marion undressing. It is useless to the plot, and the only reason why he put it was because * could *. He wanted to say: "Hitch could not show people masturbating in 1960, so I will." Whoopee, great thing, like I was so surprised to see someone masturbate. And what was the point of showing images of a single picture of clouds and farm animals spliced ​​in the scenes of murder? And then leave * out * an important scene, where Lila and Sam meet the Sheriff outside the church. <br /> <br /> Also, by using the same almost exact script, the whole movie seems a bit anachronistic. The initial credits say that the year is 1998. So, what about Marion's 60-year-old dress or the parasol she carries? Why should Marion and Sam have their appointments in a hotel room, when these days nobody would be surprised by what they are doing? Why is there no air conditioning in Marion's office? Why does not the Bates Motel have televisions in the rooms and apparently there are no automatic locks on the doors? Why does the Sheriff have to ask the operator to connect him to the Bates motel? This was the reason why the exact use of the same script was an error, simply to change some words here and it was not enough to modernize it. I needed a complete revision. <br /> <br /> While Vince Vaughn performed well as Norman, he just did not seem right for the role. Part of what made the original "Psycho" so scary was that Norman had that innocent quality of a boy next door, so no one could believe he was capable of such horrible crimes. With Vince Vaughn playing the part, is anyone really surprised that Norman was a psycho killer? <br /> <br /> That said, I can understand that Gus Van Sant was obviously a fan of the original movie "Psycho", and I wanted this to be a tribute. This is not a bad movie, but the problem is that this may be the only exposure of some people to "Psycho". I really think you should see this movie only if you've seen the original. Since I'm a fan of everything that has to do with "Psycho", I bought a used copy of the remake, which I can occasionally watch. The original movie was a filet mignon, while the new version is a hamburger. But even filet mignon would get bored if you had it every day, so it's good to have a hamburger every once in a while, for a change.
