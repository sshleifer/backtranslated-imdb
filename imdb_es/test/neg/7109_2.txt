Being a fan of Marlene Dietrich's films, I was very anxious to see this "documentary". I also let myself be caught by the reading of one criticism after another of the national critics. That should have warned me. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply boring and obviously extremely overrated. You do not even see Dietrich. She listens in the background, discussing her films and this video. She does almost nothing but complain about everything. What a bore! <br /> <br /> The filmmaker, Maximilian Schell, constantly complains and begs him to be in front of the camera ... all in vain. She continues to refuse to cooperate. After a while, this kind of thing becomes really exhausting. With your attitude, why would Schell continue with this project? I should have told the prima donna to "push it." <br /> <br /> Regardless of what you read, do not waste time with this.
