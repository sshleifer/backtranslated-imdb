The best of "The Prey" is the line of the label ... "It's not human and it has an ax"! The film itself is a stinking quilt ... endless shots of insects and wildlife make the viewer want to die! No slasher fan will like this garbage ... Look "Friday the 13th" again and burn any copy of this movie you find! <br /> <br /> It is also considered one of the 25 worst movies ever made!
