As if the world had not already had enough cheap imitations of Jaws, the writer Boaz Davidson decided to make the sequel to Octopus, his characteristic but rather nice creature, the octopus, a complete scam of the Spielberg classic, until he came to have a concern . police that no one believes, and a mayor more concerned about their celebrations of July 4 than for the lives of people. <br /> <br /> Even in the hands of an extremely skilled director, it is unlikely that this derived garbage could have been anything other than the garbage of Hokey's movie B, but with Yossi Wein (yes, THE Yossi Wein!) Calling the shots behind the camera, a man with a fraction of Mr.Spielberg's talent (I estimate around 1/10000), Octopus 2 is guaranteed. Be as bad as one could imagine! <br /> <br /> The predictable and extremely clich√© argument is not worth describing in much detail (replace the island of Jaws with Amity Island in New York, and Bruce the shark with a giant rubber octopus and you will get the essence), although several points about the film ar Definitely worth mentioning, simply because they are very funny: all the octopus attacks involve the actors who fight to make the giant tentacles look incredibly fake real look, which is very fun to watch ; Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, unconvincingly replaces New York, and the excessive use of archival material makes the illusion even less convincing; Best of all, a sequence of foolish dreams that sees the rubber octopus attacking our hero on top of the Statue of Liberty, is not only stupid, but also presents some really terrible special effects. <br /> <br /> Davidson's script does not do either I do not know when to quit: there are several points in this movie where he could (and probably should) have finished, but the action goes on and on, with the octopus surviving several explosions and causing a tunnel collapse. (catching the love interest of the film and a group of children), before finally being dragged by the hero. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, very foolish, technically terrible, but never really scary, this stinky STV can find fanatics Among those actively looking for cinematic garbage. However, it would be recommended to most normal people to stay away.
