SPOILER !!!! Mind Ripper hmmmm ... I had just seen the nightmare in the Elm Street movies and had just heard about Giovanni Ribisi. I thought that Giovanni Ribisi had not done any horror, so I registered. I saw "the outpost" (ripper of the mind). I verified it in my Tivo. There was a transmission date in Sci Fi. So I was ready. I prepared my popcorn, went in and sat on the couch. What the hell is this? A daring guy in blue sweat pants running around screaming! Nothing is scary in this movie! If something is funny! It's funny how low the budget is, how funny how predictable it is, how funny how bad it is acting and how funny it is the amount of money it did NOT WIN. Ok, Giovanni Ribisi is a good actor, but this movie is silly. It is so stupid. They killed him in the end and then they get on this plane and the "monster" is in him. He is shot in the head with a shotgun and falls very far to the ground. And <br /> <br /> -GASP- The killer ending, is still alive! WOOHHH! Scary! Woooohhhhh! Sucky fat garbage bag wasted 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: You have a place to go and you need to kill time. Mind Ripper is not the suggestion. I'd rather be naked in the snow than see this movie for the second time. <br /> <br /> GENERAL DEGREE: F- - - - - - - - - - (ENTERNAL)
