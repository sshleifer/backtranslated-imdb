I saw this movie and I thought it was a sleeper. Sometimes I can get into romantic intellectual movies. This movie just did not move me. I felt it was like an hour too long. Camille is portrayed as a very nice sculptor, who loses almost everything. I thought that the whole movie was sad and dejected. If you like tragedies, you may like this. I just thought it was too long, which meant I had a lot of unnecessary scenes, which eventually led to an hour of boredom. I would not recommend this movie. If you want to see a good romantic tragedy go see the Titanic.
