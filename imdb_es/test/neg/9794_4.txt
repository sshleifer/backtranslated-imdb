After his widowed father dies in a riding accident, the young Tom Burlinson (as Jim Craig) stays to manage his Australian farm "Snowy River", with the help of prospector Kirk Douglas (Spur), only cunning and legs of stick. Times are tough, so Mr. Burlinson goes to work for the rich rancher "Mr. Harrison", Mr. Douglas' rich, silver-haired brother (also played by Kirk Douglas). When a great job arises, Douglas, with silver hair (older?), Feels that Burlinson is too young and inexperienced to do so; thus, Burlinson stays behind and falls in love with the boss's daughter, Sigrid Thornton (as Jessica Harrison). <br /> <br /> The less than satisfying aspect of "The Snowy River Man" by director George Miller is a weak point. history Observe, for example, the sequence of events "Jessica is lost". The damsel is lost in one of those "monstrous" storms, while running away. His worried father rounds up a possession of drunken men to find her, after predicting bad weather. Damsel "Jessica" rolls over the edge of a cliff that appears conveniently. Father and the suddenly sober men do not control Burlinson's farm. Hero Burlinson discovers the damsel. After lighting a fire, he decides to kiss her. <br /> <br /> The "romance" is played very innocently for such an obvious man and woman as Burlinson and Mrs. Thornton. To make matters worse, the Douglas brothers have a "dark story" that is revealed before a mystery is built on the matter. The main attraction, here, is the Australian landscape. <br /> <br /> **** Snowy River Man (1982) George Miller ~ Tom Burlinson, Kirk Douglas, Sigrid Thornton
