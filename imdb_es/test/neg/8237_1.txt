This movie sucks. Without money, without acting, without anything. I noticed this in the 3 o'clock movie late tonight and I felt compelled to comment on it. This movie has nothing to recommend. I can not believe he's ever premiered on American television! No one in this movie can act out of a paper bag. Unsuccessful comedy attempts fall flat on your face, special effects consist of a worm-like "worm" monster ... I can not even begin to tell you what this production is like. It looks like it cost about $ 50,000 to shoot, but only because it's 16 mm, and that's probably a generous estimate! Anyway, I lost interest quickly and had to settle for seeing the "Matlock" replays instead of finishing it. This is how this movie is BAD !!!
