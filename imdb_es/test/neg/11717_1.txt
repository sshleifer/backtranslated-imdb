Upon completing this infernal piece of garbage, a friend and I made a solemn promise not to talk about how we had just destroyed the last 90 minutes of our lives. This movie is completely useless, a two-dimensional hero and a heroine that we can not realize if they survive or not and some of the vaguer villains to obscure the screen of the horror genre (or any other). To further demonstrate how utterly useless this film was, I would have liked to add a synopsis of the plot, but I can not write fiction. In general, the only reason I can think someone would want to see this movie is if they have just murdered their entire community and are looking for a self-inflicted punishment that will haunt them for years to come!
