In an up and down race with all kinds of movies, this is Altman's only attempt at science fiction, and it clearly shows that it is not his forte. <br /> <br /> The movie is practically incomprehensible. It seems a disastrous combination of experimental theatrical pretension and a great study that tries to get on the wagon after the war of the galaxies (not that this movie is modeled after that, but you can imagine that the studio signed with the hope of a difference Movie of science fiction by Paul Newman). The story is non-existent, the characters remain unknown to us throughout the process. <br /> <br /> Altman has groups of dogs that feed on corpses throughout the film, obviously striving to make some kind of POINT. But since the film is so badly designed, starting with the lack of plot, it really is not about anything. <br /> <br /> The designed production is confusing, the photography is undone by the blots. On the edges, and the score is terrible. However, "Quintet" has a redemption feature. The film is not only filmed clearly on snow and ice, but the interiors also remain cold. You see the breath of the actors in each scene. You really feel the cold.
