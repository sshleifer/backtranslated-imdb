I looked forward to Dante's contribution to this excellent series of horror anthologies by Showtime, but this was easily the worst of all. It is really very bad. Part of this may be due to the scarce, although strange, choice of source materials. Why Joe did not just write an original, I have no idea. Instead, we received this episode in which the "message" overwhelms the script, the characters, the staging, everything, and at the end I was wondering if it could get worse, and I will not spoil it ... but it ended up getting worse. What stinks for such a talented creative team. Skip this and buy the John Carpenter instead. He manages to balance all the elements: horror, humor, character, vision and it's fun. The return home is as fun as a bear throwing a boat while you sleep.
