Once again, like many other television programs, a certain actor / actress took center stage, in this case Miranda Cosgrove, having acquired his reputation in previous films / series (especially by Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider.) Now is the star of the Wonderful: he creates so much imbalance in popularity with his other castmates, especially Nathan Kress, who is continually pushed into minor roles in every episode, except iDont Want to Fight, Cosgrove's music would never have reached the charts without this program and her main song (which was not written by her) and other versions like About You Now and Stay my Baby Do not forget that she also synchronizes her lips / sings her song live, is that how a vocalist is created today? <br /> <br /> Back to the show, Cosgrove reveals more physically by acting in bikini scenes, a Hawaiian halala-style bra mentioned bra many times to through Bras and Seen in many cases (though not from the other actresses). The Wedgies are mentioned, the panties have been mentioned once. Og let's not forget "Oh, my God", a phrase that comes (are any of the scriptwriters / actors Christians?) Granted that the program does not pretend to be only for children, I am surprised by the multitude of mentions of women's underwear , especially in the first episode, where the phrase "pointy breasts" was mentioned. I'm not sure if the children would refrain from saying that at home / at school later. <br /> <br /> It's not like I'm against mentioning or showing women's underwear (which the girls will wear), but for a Nickelodeon program, the people in charge should have realized that the children would be exposed to Those things I doubt that other Nickelodeon programs have such content. <br /> <br /> As mentioned in other comments, the hint of laughter is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many places, for example, when the character Sam cries, how? Is the earth a time to laugh? Distract people from the joke and use it almost in every sentence. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, Cosgrove became the star of the show and, therefore, gets the most fame and support from the fans, who even scolded a hotel employee when told to keep the Low noise level (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0gtfUk98U). Jennette McCurdy is the second star of the series, but faces the Cosgrove competition in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single against the covers of Cosgrove). As noted, third co-star Nathan Kress is the least known of all. He is portrayed as an atypical child who suffers most of the bullying from a girl and other children, but somehow a technology wizard. His height in the early episodes make him a cute actor, but unusual given his infatuation with Carly / Cosgrove. Beyond that, Kress is not entering the music industry and, as Cosgrove's fame grows with each episode, Kress is left behind. I would bet that he is the least paid of the three actors. <br /> <br /> The content of the program is, of course, fictional, but it also allows us to ask how it fits into a series of comedy at certain times (therefore the laughter track is used). It also contains several continuity errors (how can your father and the Air Force Colonel be on a submarine?) The US Special Forces have their own branches, and the US Air Force does not use US submarines. Seals). A unique feature is to allow viewers to send their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes, but again, the videos do not meet the theme of the comedy. <br /> <br /> Once again, it is a show that is full of mentions of women's underwear, skin exposure and the most used laugh traces. It is a series that puts a teenage actress in the crowd in such a way that her songs / actions are overly supported by her fans, leaving behind her stars.
