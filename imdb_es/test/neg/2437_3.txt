It is difficult to say to whom this film is directed; The characterization and style smell like an "ITV infantil" series crossed with an Australian soap, but the theme, nudity and language point to a larger audience. <br /> <br /> The first half hour has the heroine Justine philosophizing about the loss of her virginity and it is terribly embarrassing for anyone over 18 years of age. A complete scam of "Ferris Bueller", from the sound of talking with the camera to the on-screen graphics. <br /> <br /> Her nerdy friend Chas takes her to a computer fair where an explosion while using a virtual reality machine makes her a man. Or actually, create a male alter ego of hers, called Jake. Do not look at me like that; I'm just telling it the way it showed. <br /> <br /> After this, the movie is slightly funny for a while; Among all the assaults to the theater school, only Rupert Penry-Jones gives a real comic touch to his role as Jake, a woman trapped in the body of a man. There are some funny scenes with Jake dealing with his new body and new feelings; Nothing that you have not seen before, but in this movie you will hold onto anything that is entertaining. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Justine and Jake meet, and funny pranks happen (I wish), involving the owners of the virtuality machine that wants to kidnap Jake to have sex with him, or examine him, or something like that. Anyway, it's just an excuse to complete an additional half hour with some explosions and car chases; for such a cheap movie, explosions are frequent and noisy, suggesting that the money was spent in all the wrong places. <br /> <br /> In the end, the heroine realizes that she can not fall in love with herself, eliminates her alter ego and ends up in an overnight adventure with the nerd to lose her virginity (this is presumably what must go through a happy ending in the 90s). But only after you take off your glasses and put on some hair gel and a leather jacket; God forbid that she really has sex with someone who looks like a nerd. Of course, this is a little subversive: in these days of PC movies that tell you to love and be yourself, and that everyone is special in their own way, it is refreshingly reactionary to have a movie that screams "CONFORM!" to you, and treat virgins and nerds with the contempt they deserve. <br /> <br /> The characterization is very simple; the nerd is very nerdy (room full of computers, thick glasses, social retardation, virginity, no leather jacket), there is a whore, she is very slutty (blonde, tight dresses, orange tan, music that accompanies the vampire), there is an athlete, he Very ... well, you have an idea. You can get away with this type of characterization in a broad comedy, but the "Virtual Sexuality" is not very funny. It is only slightly entertaining in some parts, and unbearable in others. A woman as beautiful as Justine (played by Laura Fraser) has a hard time bothering me, but she succeeds. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the title; There is absolutely nothing erotic about the film, and it does not address the issues of how new communication technologies are changing the way we see and acquire relationships (unless you think there is a possibility that your PlayStation can explode and change its sex). <br /> <br />
