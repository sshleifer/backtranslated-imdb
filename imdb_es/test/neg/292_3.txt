Summary: Simon leads a small team of special agents that has specialized in finding and returning missing people, against all possible odds. His last mission is about the granddaughter of a friend of theirs. It seems that she has been trapped in the network of a particularly brutal criminal and all those who have sought her have disappeared. But now the librarians are in the case. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is pure B action, through and through. The key phrase for this is the unlimited supply. There is an unlimited supply of ammunition, they do not have to be recharged once. There is an unlimited supply of bad guys, so the heroes have something to shoot. There is an unlimited supply of breasts, many of them naked, in a vain attempt (and as always has failed) to distract attention from the holes of the plot. And there's an unlimited supply of bad performances (it's almost as if Erika Eleniak's performance shines on this, what about that?), And actors who do not seem to care more than the check (and why they should do it when no one else seems to?). <br /> <br /> And like in most B action movies, there is an unlimited supply of bad shootouts. But these almost seem to be of a ridiculously bad kind. I think I saw more realistic shootings when I played cowboy when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> But, again, I did not expect much either, how could it be from an action movie called The Librarians? And actually it is delivered on what could be expected. 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the intermediate points. But I'm not sure if I can call it entertaining, it did not keep my interest for long. <br /> <br /> 3/10
