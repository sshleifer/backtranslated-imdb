... Or better yet, look at Fandango if you want to see a college-age road movie that's really smart and fun. Rolling Kansas sounded promising (in fact, the program guide gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars, which usually means it's quite visible), but I moved pretty fast. Usually, road trip movies have good music, but I can not even remember if there was music. The only highlight was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old hitchhiker / guru. Otherwise, the jokes and times lost all the way. The four main characters are unknown actors and I do not remember having seen them in any other movie. (Oh, yes, I see that Thos, Hayden Church was in that, but he is in everything, good, bad or indifferent). This movie is as fun as watching someone else drugged when you're not.
