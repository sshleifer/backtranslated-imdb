I was surprised in this movie from the beginning, to my surprise, because I did not intend to see it at all. Now I wish I had not done it. The suspense begins well, with the hit-and-run that results in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess, or be discovered, or (feasible now, though not-not in the old days of making movies) . ) get away with it. The plot has been made before, the plot has not, but the tensions inherent to it, with the complications and additional motivations that arise from illicit love, constitute a first absorbing half. Then, the film leaves the hit-and-run to embark on a misty exhibition of two unrequited and suffering loves. The two tracks of the plot, the love of coming and going and irrational love, simply do not have enough to do with each other, and the fact that they involve the same characters does not unite them enough to justify the exit from the original story line. The screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other. At the end of the movie, in the middle of the second funeral of the film, I found myself thinking: "Now, what does all this have to do with that hit-and-run?" The filmmakers may think that the answer is obvious, but I think the film was plotted and executed with flaccidity.
