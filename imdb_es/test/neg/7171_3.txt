The Willies begin one night, when Josh (Joshua Miller) and Kyle (Jason Horst) of his brother are camping outside with his cousin Michael (Sean Astin), decide to spend time telling stories of fear ... <br /> <br /> First there is Michael with a story entitled "The bad apples" in which a boy named Danny Hollister (Ian Fried) is harassed at school, however, the new and sinister janitor, Mr. Jenkins (James Karen) decides help him . <br /> <br /> Next up is Kyle when he tells a strange story called 'Flyboy' in which an overweight bully with a worried worry about dead flies gets what he deserves in a horrible and twisted way ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Brian Peck. The Willies did not do much for me and I doubt I'll do much for you either. The script is strange in regard to episode anthologies, instead of the usual three or four stories, it only has two main stories and a few strange scenes of "urban myth" type at the beginning, which consist of the person who asks food from a fast food restaurant only to find a dead rat in his chicken, a man who dies of a heart attack on a walk and someone who tries to dry his poodle in the microwave only to explode. I have no idea what the purpose of these scenes is, but they do not add anything to the film, since for both main stories they are both weak. To begin with, they are too long, which is a big mistake in this type of movie. Usually, the stories in the anthologies are short, crisp and fast, with a nice twist at the end that usually involves people getting what they deserve. However, in The Willies, the stories last for most of the 40 minutes each, which are longer than the average television episode. I must admit that both stories seem very boring to me, have little value for them and seem to be aimed at children. The first story is the best one to see as a whole, but it does not have a turning end as far as I could see, while the second has a good end to 'just deserts', but the accumulation is weak and has no reason. . I really like horror anthology movies, so The Willies comes as a disappointment, frankly disappoints the genre. <br /> <br /> Director Peck was obviously working on a low budget and, in general, The Willies is pretty hard to understand. , there are a lot of continuity errors and it is badly done. There is no atmosphere, there is no fear, there is no bleeding, the special effects are poor and it presents useless unnecessary takes of a dirty toilet several times. In general, it is a rather unattractive movie to sit on. <br /> <br /> Technically, the Willies are coarse, to say the least, the effects are far from special and look very gray and grainy in the image. The acting is bad, nobody is going to win any prize, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The Willies is a poor movie, it's not scary, it's not fun, it's not entertaining and it only has two very long stories. Definitely not recommended.
