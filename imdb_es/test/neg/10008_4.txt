The wealthy horse ranchers in Buenos Aires have a policy of no trade with the Crawfords of Manhattan for a long time, but what happens when the Latin mustachioed son falls in love with a Crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair and some cheerful movements in the dance floor? The musical 20th Century-Fox has a bright appearance, but it seems a bit shabby around the edges. It is very heavy in the frantic gymnastics dance, extremely thin in history. Betty Grable (a replacement for the eleventh hour for Alice Faye) gives her a boost, even though she is paired with the Am Ameche lead (in tanned makeup and straight hair). It's also good: Charlotte Greenwood as a conscientious aunt of Betty, a limousine driver who is constantly asleep at work, and Carmen Miranda playing (who else?). The archival footage of Argentina far exceeds the action filmed in Fox's backlot, and some of the supporting performances are pretty horrible. At the time of the grand finale of the horse race, most of the spectators will have had enough. * 1/2 of ****
