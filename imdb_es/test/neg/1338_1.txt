Do not! no no no! My whole being is rebelling against this terrible remake of a classic movie. I knew we were going to have problems from the moment that Meg Ryan appeared on the screen with her ridiculous hair and clothes, literally like a scarecrow in the garden she was digging. Meg Ryan playing Meg Ryan, what a pain it is! And it got worse ... much worse. The lines were horribly clich√©, the characters were common, the sense was growing that I was watching a spin-off of "The First Wives Club" and the last trick trite in the delivery room. How many times have I seen this movie? Only once, but it seems a dozen times, nothing original or novel. To shame!
