Terrible. There is no way to avoid it. A script at the height of one of a Mexican telenovela, a choice and use of filming locations that make the film labyrinthine and, at the same time, repetitive and monotonous, with disastrous performances of almost the entire cast. The references to Tarantino's work, so poorly made, are more an insult than anything else. I suspect that it was not because of the blatant exploitation and not related to the plot of the generous curves of Matadinho, no one would strive to go see this movie to any theater. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movies that make me have No desire to see Portuguese cinema.
