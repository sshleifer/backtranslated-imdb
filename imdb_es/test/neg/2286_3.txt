Connery gets on board Moore's jester train in this stench of a movie. Discarding everything that made Bond successful in the first place, this film further degrades Bond's character and throws him into the category of Inspector Gadget. Get smart this is not. There's no style here, only second-rate actors who act in cheap sets. It's a shame that Connery has not been able to lend a class element here, but it has not been found. Everything here stinks of mediocrity, including Connery's bad fight. Maybe if it were snowy and I had the option to see "Never Say Never Again" and "Howard The Duck", I would choose first. If you want the real James Bond, choose any novel by Ian Flemming.
