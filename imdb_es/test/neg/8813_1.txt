This was the most unrealistic movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that the writer and the director did not see that almost the whole film looks like SF's. <br /> <br /> For example: <br /> <br /> 1. It is impossible for the killer to stay in a cold glaze and after 10 hours he gets up so fast. <br /> <br /> 2. You can not electrocute yourself through a water pipe like in the movie. (Believe me, it's my domain) <br /> <br /> 3. With a saw you can cut 10 tubes in 10 hours very easily. Let's say the chain was made of steel but the water pipe was rusted and made of iron. <br /> <br /> 4. If you try to cut your foot with a failing saw (in the best case, it is more likely to die because your heart does not work) before reaching the bone (shin). <br /> <br /> And there are more Other examples.
