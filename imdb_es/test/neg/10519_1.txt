What can be said about a movie about a dressing gangster? Not much. With the creation of average indie style movies, this movie has the all-evil timing. The edition is just horrible. As for the history of the gangsters, it could have been removed if the mobsters did not lack character. Everyone seemed to be there for some kind of slam line. None of which was funny. The usual suspects in this film are the prostitute with the heart of gold, the moribund dying father who wants his son to legitimize his business, the best friend of the "cranks" of a single line. But the main character, the gangster who likes to dress like a girl. Only her motivation to dress like a girl is that she was assaulted by a woman? Strange. The end of the movie had to be the nail in the coffin. It was anti-climatic to say the least. I mean, I understand that indie filmmakers do not have the equipment for proper filming, but they could also be using water guns. In general, I would say that the exaggeration that took him (the premiere of the red carpet in Vancouver) was a disappointment.
