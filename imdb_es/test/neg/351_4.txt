I saw this movie as part of a Billy Graham show. The church I attend was part of a large community to present God and Christianity in our community (Hartford, Ct. USA). I was one of the counselors who helped the attendees (who were invited to come and do whatever religious profession they wanted ... and follow them up after the movie.) As such, he did what he had to do, and personally I thought a means to strengthen my faith in God I also found it very useful for those I counseled, I especially like the work of Kim Darby in this film, and the parents (the Wintons?) were, in a way, a bit overdone ... no one tells their child if they think he or she may be the father of an illegitimate child, something like the Wintons did "oh, no, no, not that." is not exactly what they said, but the compassionate audience that I saw laughed at what they said and also about the son's emphatic "No, MOm, not I."
