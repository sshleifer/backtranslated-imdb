they (Dueringer, Dorfer) are good comedians, young, not ugly, they have money, the girls love them, the public appreciates everything they do <br /> <br /> and then they made this movie ... <br /> <br /> No history at all, some jokes were old in the fifties, the acting is horrible. Save your money for something useful, as a gift for your girlfriend.
