(The beginning can be a spoiler ...) <br /> <br /> "The Eye 2" is the sequel to "The Eye". It is about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident that happened to her. <br /> <br /> The sound effects scared me momentarily though momentarily, but that's the only terrifying thing. Some of the scenes in the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated, so the chilling effects have certainly cooled down. <br /> <br /> "The Eye" has a pretty frightening and indelible impression, while "The Eye 2" is a forgettable horror-drama movie. Skip watching this. See "The Eye" is good enough.
