Let me say first that I did not go in expecting much, and seeing it on prime time on opening night should have helped. I think it would have been like that, if there were more than 20 people in the theater. <br /> <br /> He sucked so hard. The performance was robotic at best and nothing was really explained until the last 30 minutes of the movie. I guess that was his way of twisting the plot; Keep everyone in the dark with crucial information to understand the direction of the films until the end and then explain things and hope they feel like a plot twist. <br /> <br /> Unknowns until the end of the movie: is it a dark-ling? The CG was great but I want to understand! -Why can not the powers be wanted? Especially if mass murder is the ultimatum. -Why is it so far to want the powers? You just normal later, right? Who farted? <br /> <br /> Approximately 50% of the minutes with only men on the screen, were shots of them in women beaters, sleeveless and then a heart-pounding scene of all the teenage men in the most sparse driving Speedos knowing that they have ever been manufactured. I swear you could see the start of the boys ... well, I was close to the soft-core. And, of course, there was a shower scene, and to mix it was the DUDES. The butt cracks were plentiful, a sausage party in progress. But there was a one-girl shower scene where you could not see anything and wandered around the bedroom bathroom with the best looks for about 12 minutes. Then there was a PJ girls party. The other thing I could not overcome was the amount of driving that Caleb did in his SUPER COOL Ford Mustang GT. It was a Ford commercial for about a quarter of the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not see it. Or go see him with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. Then it might be worth it. But do not expect anything impressive.
