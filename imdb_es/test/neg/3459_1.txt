I also made the mistake of thinking that I was going to watch the 2003 swim course with Geoffry Rush. This was worse than many student movies I've seen. The script was forced, the performance was unsatisfactory and the editing annoying. It was so slow that I managed to force myself to stay. But I always give a movie a chance, so I suffered until the end. Apparently there was a note about this movie, because my friend and I were the only ones in the theater. Why did not someone send me this memo? That's why I'm posting, as a warning to others who are thinking of disbursing good money to see this. I just hope you really got to this page, and you did not get stuck like I did watching the "Swimming upstream" wrong PD I'm sorry for the cast and crew if you're reading this. I know you worked hard to do this. I know what it means to make a movie ... keep trying!
