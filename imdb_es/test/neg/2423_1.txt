Preacher or Recto Sappy Trainer. It's bad writing combined with worse acting. You can choose to take the Gatorade of this special after school, but I did not do it, even in your 20th philosophy Toby Robbins / Islander, motivational moment. It is too posturing to be entertaining and not substantive enough to be informative. I have respect for the coach and the program on which this film is inspired, but the movement itself is horrible. As someone who has played rugby for almost 20 years in the United States, I expected a better rugby movie (even one that has something to do with rugby). And I can tell you that the Haka performed by a group of haoles and islanders is not intimidating (like when the All Blacks do it today, seriously guys, everyone has seen it, it's time to forget it). If you want real intimidation, stand in line in front of a group of South Africans (the true rugby convicts of the eye). This is a false and ill-made film about being a genuine and good person.
