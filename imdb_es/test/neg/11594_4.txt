This is like a zoology textbook, since its representation of animals is so precise. However, here are some details that seem to have been slightly modified during the transition to the film: <br /> <br /> - Gun bullets never hit the giant Komodo dragons. No matter how many times you shoot the Komodo, the bullets simply will not come close. <br /> <br /> - The best way to avoid being devoured by a giant Cobra or a giant Komodo dragon. It's just to be there. The exception to this rule is if they tell you to stay very still, in which case you should flee, until the Komodo is right next to you, and then you should stay there, waiting for defeat. <br /> <br /> - The minutes of slow-motion images stuck behind the credits really make it a pleasant observation. <br /> <br /> - $ 5,000 is a memory improvement tool, and a large substitute for losing your boat license / being arrested. <Br /> <br /> - Members of the elite army units do not see the giant Komodo dragons come until they are less than a meter away from the large beings. Maybe the computer-generated nature of these dragons has something to do with this. <br /> <br /> - When a story is filmed with the objective of exposing illegal animal tests, a reporter and a camera with a camera is all the equipment and personnel you will need; sound equipment, a second camera, microphones, etc. they are superfluous <br /> <br /> - When you hear a loud animal cry, and a person has a gun, you should take it out and point it at the person closest to you. <br /> <br /> - When you pull out a gun, you will hear the sound of safety being removed, even if your finger is not close to safety. <br /> <br /> - Reporters agree to go half of the world to expose something, without having the slightest idea of ​​what they are exposing. Background research and vague knowledge are outdated in modern journalism. <br /> <br />: guns contain at least 52 bullets in a clip, and then more than that in the next. Despite this, those with weapons claim that they will need more ammunition. <br /> <br />: expensive cameras (also, remember that the reporter only has a camera) are left behind without even a moment of doubt or regret. These cameras incredibly manage to return the reporter by themselves. <br /> <br /> - The blonde girl is really stupid. <br /> <br /> - The same girl who says not to enter a house because a Komodo dragon can easily cross it, making it unsafe, takes a team to a building made of the same material for protection, and nobody says nothing in regards. <br /> <br /> - High-tech facilities resemble simple offices with high school chemistry sets. <br /> <br /> - Genetically modified snakes grow from normal size to 100 feet in a matter of a day, but do not grow at all <br /> <br /> in the coming weeks. <br /> <br /> - The military routinely destroy entire islands when people do not meet contact deadlines. <br /> <br /> - Men with weapons do not necessarily change the direction in which they shoot when their target is no longer right in front of them. Instead, they just keep shooting into the air. <br /> <br /> - The better you look, the more chances you have to survive giant creatures. <br /> <br /> - The intuition of women is reliable enough to change. even the most stubborn minds. <br /> <br /> - Every time you're chased by giant creatures, it's a good time to hit girls half your age. <br /> <br /> - Animal noises are an appropriate masking noise to "swear" in the same volume. <br /> <br /> - The US Army UU regularly uses Israeli and Russian aircraft.
