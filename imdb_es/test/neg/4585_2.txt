As another user I have this cheap - I thought. 85 crowns (Â£ 8). Although it is not worth that amount of money, it is a total classic that I, like the other users, saw for the first time when I was a child and I expected to see it again some 20 years later. The story is incredibly thin (so it might have worked for children), but all the language of the radio and the things of the truck drivers make up for it. It will look good on my DVD shelf for years to come. First visualization (1980): 10/10. Second visit (2002): 4/10
