On the positive side, it ended. That's the only thing that this film has in its favor, of course. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've seen, and I've seen some bad ones. This movie is really so horrible, I went and changed my Children of the Living Dead rating to a 2 just for not being a Raptor. <br /> <br /> Official classification of a single line: "Come with me to another movie if you want to live".
