I thought it was weird and just bloody, not terrifying. I've seen a couple of Japanese horror movies, Ringu and Juon, and I loved them; But this movie was a disappointment. He did not even explain anything about the curse. I just did not see any horror ... it did not scare me at all. All the time I was watching, I was waiting for Kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why it was happening now. If this was an ancient curse, why did not it happen before Shuichi's father? And he never told us what happened to his father. I kept waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasoning behind this curse and then it just ended. I was very disappointed.
