I am a big fan of the LoG. I thought that the first two series provided some of the best comedies that this country has seen and the third, although different, was wonderfully dark and imaginative. The idea of ​​seeing Tubbs, Edward and Briss on the big screen made July 3 something to look forward to. However, somewhere, everything went terribly wrong. The writers had no history or real ideas. The part set in old England showed the flashes of genius we know the League is capable of, but these scenes did not fit well with the film. Geoff provided the best of the few jokes, largely bad, and the performances of Lipp and Briss were big disappointments. If you love the League, save time and money and watch the episodes of the television series again. And again. A massive disappointment
