This movie is a shame. Nothing works at any level. The direction, the script, the acting and the editing work together to repel your eyes from the screen. Everything is inappropriate and incoherent. At first, you can sit there and moan, make a face and laugh at him, but very soon all the effort to look becomes too heavy.
