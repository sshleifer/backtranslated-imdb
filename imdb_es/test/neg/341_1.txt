I'll need to take a deep breath for this ... <br /> <br /> Terrible special effects that tried to go well beyond budget constraints. Blameless and unashamed plagiarism of other science fiction movies (like Pitch Black). Terrible acting. Endless slow motion scenes of characters walking aimlessly through the sand dunes. Serpentine dialogue that does nothing to drive the story. Characters with turtleneck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns. A "cargo" ship attended by a group of soldiers with camouflage weapons (why exactly would you need a forest camouflage in space?). Some of the worst casting choices in the history of film-making without a budget: a "captain" swollen with steroids that looks more like a beach sportsman than a reliable commander, and a "convict" who It looks and acts as dangerous as a bunny. 70 minutes of duration, 35 of which could have been cut if the director had some concept of "compression of time through editing" ... <br /> <br /> I will not go ahead. Suffice to say that while some components of this terrible film can (and should) be forgiven due to its low budget; The bad conception, the holes in the plot of laughter and the scripts that induce the snore are unforgivable in * any * budget. The end result is a tedious, boring waste of time. Sorry guys, I hate being so hard with an amateur movie, but you have no excuse to do this kind of work.
