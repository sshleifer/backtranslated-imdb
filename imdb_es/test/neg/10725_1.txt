A satire on greed and money, what? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the subjects that they pathetically mock. The reign of Jim Carrey was certainly short-lived. It is an unbearable presence on the screen. The lack of sincerity of his representation is nothing short of creepy. He also produced this "masterpiece", so he can not blame anyone here. "The number one comedy in America," screams the desperate television. Of course, Jim Carrey was supposed to guarantee full houses, but the game was over. If I sound angry it's because I am. I spent a sunny afternoon in California, in addition, between tickets, parking, Coca Cola, etc., almost 45 dollars in this thing, starring and produced by Mr. Carry. Not anymore, do you hear? No longer.
