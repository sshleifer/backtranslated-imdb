It's amazing what you can see if you wake up at 2 am and turn on the TV. I did not know they showed movies like this. I immediately thought of Roger Corman, who reused movie locations or used other movie locations for his own films. <br /> <br /> The marks of this movie could move the camera angles and add some time, and they would have XXX Movie. <br /> <br /> There was no story, only a minimal dialogue that led to undress and sex. I bet there were not 100 words in the whole movie, but I'm sure there were many big busts and hot lesbian action. There was also male / female action, but it was only about 25% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing came to mind when watching this movie that may interest those who are buying HD DVD. Sony refused to license Betamax to adult film producers and adult films came out on VHS. You can guess what happened to beta max when the adult film industry makes millions of videos. Sony again refused to grant Blu-ray licenses to the adult film industry and they have just signed an agreement with Toshiba. You can guess which HD system will disappear.
