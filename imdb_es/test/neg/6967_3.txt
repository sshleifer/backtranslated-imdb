As many know, this is the film debut of Edward D. Wood Jr. as writer / producer / director / actor. I have been a fan of Ed Wood for several years. Although I do not like this as much as some of his other films, it was probably the biggest idea that the film audience gets from Wood during his life. Everyone knows that he was a transvestite. This film is about changing sex and how being a transvestite can create conflicts in relationships with loved ones. This film is well ahead of its time to address this issue and how it is treated. However, the film still contains the usual pitfalls of Wood: the bad dialogue, the meaningless file images and the special effects of Hokey. Add Wood's usual overdose to Bela Lugosi and you'll have Wood's first attempt at being a director. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after discovering the body of a transvestite who committed suicide to ask for advice on how to avoid further problems in this regard. The doctor tells him the story of Glen, who is also a transvestite. Glen wants to marry Barbara, but he can not tell her his secret. She also tells the inspector about Alan, who undergoes a change of sex because in reality it is more appropriate to be a woman. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of continuous comment about what is going on (the part of Lugosi is not really well defined and proves to be a vehicle for Wood to have a star in his film and Lugosi to get something in cash ). <br /> <br /> In general, the film shows the characteristics of Wood's career. Obviously, it was filmed with a very low budget and enough things have been introduced quite randomly. He definitely has the feeling "it's so bad, it's good". However, I have to applaud Ed for his progressive thinking in making this film. Transvestism and sex changes were not very open topics in the early fifties. Wood took a big risk in making a film that portrays transvestites as people who are not sexually deviant and who put a more human face on transvestism.
