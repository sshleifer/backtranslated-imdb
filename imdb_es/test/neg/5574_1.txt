This movie is so bad but it's so bad that I was laughing. For people who like movies, do not watch this one. For people who like good and bad movies, I recommend this one. The shaky story lines, the script is horrible, the acting is horrible to mediocre. The soundtrack of the whole movie was corny, but I loved it. The interesting phrases were a plus. LOL. "If it can bleed, it can die." The fight scenes cracked me. I thought they spent more time in those parts than in any other, because the fight scenes for the most part were pretty clean. I almost feel that this movie could have been good if it was not for the f / x ... no, it would still have been a crapshoot. The eyes were cheesy. and how the chick was eating the boy's stomach in the kitchen, they could have done something in which he might be eating something or at least putting more fake blood on his face. And the explosion of the lighthouse disappointed me. I thought they might have received real fire instead of synthesized things by computer. and the ending was very predictable, which surprised me when they really did what I thought they could do. so in general I'd say that this is a classic when it comes to fucking movies. It's in my bottom 5.
