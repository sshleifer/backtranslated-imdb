I gave this movie a 2 mainly because it actually has a good cast, but the film itself is like that (insert an unusually coarse word that begins with the sixth letter of the alphabet): I have no sense that I felt bad because at the time in which I voted your lowest vote was a three. <br /> <br /> A very predictable argument ... two musicians who do not do anything right do not have money and have many money problems. However, when a friend leaves a bag full of money (belonging to the drug traffickers) under his charge, of course they spend it and then the "fun" begins. <br /> <br /> It's not an original idea in this whole movie.
