For many years, the classic 'Plan 9' by Ed Wood has been considered the worst film ever made. Forget it The Roller Blade Seven is infinitely worse. The cast is made up of brothers from famous and almost famous towns or has been actors and actresses. The plot along with the budget and the script do not exist. The execution time is not shaped by Ed Wood's classic style of using archival material. Instead, there is an endless amount of slow movement and repeated action. And as for The Roller Blade Seven, it's not even seven! <br /> <br /> You should see this movie just to know how bad it can really be to make a movie. Give hope to independent filmmakers around the world.
