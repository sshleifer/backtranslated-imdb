Pam Grier is the super soul sister of the 70s, and she appears in many blaxploitation movies that a new generation has recently discovered and appreciated. I can safely say that BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA may be the worst Pam Grier movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Grier is Lee and Margaret Markov is Karen; they are two prisoners who escaped from prison after Karen's revolutionary friends attacked the rice cart. Chained to each other, the film becomes THE DEFIANT ONES for women, but it has three different plots: a fat criminal (the Filipino mute Vic Diaz) wants Lee dead, a cowboy bounty hunter (the excellent Sid Haig) seeks the two girls; and Karen's revolutionary friends seek her out. Over time, the film becomes so complicated and not involved with the two women that the title should have been MEN WHO FOUND THE WOMEN. Grier, an action star, has no chance to participate in any of the many (too long) action scenes. Markov is excellent, since Karen and Grier are fine as Lee, but both are finally forgotten in the many secondary plots. An interesting scene has the bounty hunter who forces a police officer and his boss to lower his pants so he can shoot the one with the smallest penis (judged by his whore), but he easily forgets amid all the chaos. <br /> <br /> BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA starts off great as a movie of women in prison with lesbian guards and a shower scene, then completely switches to a chase movie. If director Eddie Romero (famous for directing Filipino horror films) had stayed with the WIP theme, it would have been fine. Instead, BMWM ages very quickly and the surprise ending makes the audience wonder why they sat in a 90-minute movie to end like this. Another problem: where is the movie supposed to be? While some of the accents are Hispanic and the cities have names in Spanish (Los Robles, etc.), all the natives are obviously Asian! Hmmm ... Recommended only for Grier fans, who even then will be disappointed.
