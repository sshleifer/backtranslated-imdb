I have to say that I am not a big fan of the Troma movies. Of course, I've only seen three of them (or four, including this one), but two (Freaks Blood Sucking Freaks and Mothers' Day) have the reputation of being the best, which leads me to believe that everyone else is not worth the pain. seeing. That seems to be the case on Graduation Day, which is a version of Troma from the popular slasher of the eighties. While the film is never particularly bad (given the type of film), it is not particularly good either; and in the end, all he could think about was "why did I bother to see this?" Anyway, the plot sees a girl die on a racetrack, and shortly after; More people start to die Naturally, there are some possible suspects; But it is difficult to really worry about anything that happens. Of course, in slasher terms; what is more important is the blood, and given the history of Troma in regard to the red matter, I expected cubes of it. There are some scenes of decent killings, and some of them are bloody; but it's never very shocking, which really makes this another sad slasher based on a celebration event in the American calendar. It is worth noting that there is a small role in this movie for the seedy queen Linnea Quigley, but the rest of the cast is not worth mentioning. The direction, the plot and its execution are very mundane; and I'll say that unless you're a big Troma fan or someone who wants to track every slasher that's been made; Do not bother with this movie.
