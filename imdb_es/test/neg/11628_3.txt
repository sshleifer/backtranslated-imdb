The simple Jack Higgins thriller about an IRA bomber charged with guilt forced to "one last job" (where have I heard that plot before?) Receives a sarcastic treatment from cult director Mike Hodges. Mickey Rourke, with alarming red hair, confesses everything to the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all the people) who accidentally witnessed the shooting. The rules of the church prevent Father Bob from speaking, but then Rourke goes and falls in love with the priest's blind niece. They come together in the church organ. What? Actually, that's the plot. Alan Bates is the best gangster dog that is calling the shots (literally) and seems to be the only actor that has the jokey tone to which Hodges points. Bates is ready to make a kind of HONOR OF THE PRIZZI DE U.K., but nobody else, including Liam Neeson, a charismatic without effort, has been informed.
