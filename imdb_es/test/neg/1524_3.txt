I loved all the other Don Knotts movies, but I never heard much about "How to frame a fig" and now I know why: I can not think of anyone who finds it nice. This movie seems to attract children of 9 or 10 years, but even most of them would give a thumbs down. At best, there are brief moments of mild amusement, mainly from Don Knotts who plays the same nervous and helpless person who made him famous. <br /> <br /> After the movie finally ended, I was curious to know if my teenage son could realize the fatal flaw of the movie. We completely agreed: the character of Prentiss Gates's partner was even more foolish than the character of Don Knotts. <br /> <br /> Be happy that Mr. Limpet, Reluctant Astronaut, Shakiest Gun and Mr. Chicken are at your fingertips.
