I have read a lot of books in my short life, but this is the worst of all. I just read this useless piece of trash and when I finished it I threw it around the room! I hated him and he let me explain the reasons! 1.The soldier dies. Why would the author kill the soldier? Why could not she keep him alive like a good love story the author would do? I deeply applaud Patty for trying to get the FBI agent out of her eyes. <br /> <br /> 2.Ruth says goodbye. Ruth (the black housekeeper) is fired and for no apparent reason too! She tried to comfort Patty and then Patty SOB's father dismisses her for no reason! Ruth, Anton and Patty were the only bright spots in the book. Oh and the grandparents too! 3. The perm. Yes. The perm. Now, you might think, why does the permanent bother you? Well, here's why. Patty's mother asks the girl if she wants to be combed. Patty says no, but the mother calls Mrs. Reeves (the horrible hairdresser) and tells her to give Patty a perm. Why on earth would God do that? Why would a mother ask her daughter if she wants a permanent only to have it anyway? Mom always pretends that Patty has something to say when she has nothing to say. He should receive the "Prize for the worst mother of the year" for the things he administered to Patty. Thank God, Ruth cut her! 4. Discrimination, racism and prejudice. I hate discrimination in this book. They use the word * beep * too much. Yes. I know that in those days blacks were free, but basically they did not have rights, but come on! Why teach today's children that word? It simply teaches them to discriminate against people. Not only blacks were discriminated against but also Chinese. In the book, people refer to Mr.Lee (a Chinese man) as "The * beep * That's really despicable and last but not least ... Jews and Nazis, I hate the city for spitting on a girl What was so wrong for her liking Anton SHE IS A 12 YEAR OLD GIRL It was just a crush Like a 12 year old can really love a 22 year old boy Come on! This is not "Lolita" And "Lolita" It's a good book, not a piece of filth, I'm surprised that this movie is not considered "dirty" as "Lolita". <br /> <br /> 5. Patty goes to a reformatory. I should have gone to that reformatory.The referees are for thieves and murders, not for innocent 12-year-old children! The teacher or her name was Patty, a mean, spoiled and spoiled! Patty should have received community service or something, she did not do anything wrong, she just helped a friend. <br /> <br /> 6. Favortisem. With her friends, Hildren Patty, her eldest daughter is clearly the least favored, while Sharon, the five-year-old girl, is her favorite daughter. The father says he wanted to take Sharon to Hollywood but clearly forgets his other daughter. <br /> <br /> 7. The father. I hated him! It was so cruel that Patty could have Hitler as her father. Her father hits her for no apparent reason and the way he talks to her in the end will make you so angry that you will be surprised thinking that "Patty would receive better treatment in a concentration camp." <br /> <br /> Well there you guys have it. 7 reasons why I hate this book. Instead of reading this book, read "The diaries of Anne Frank" or anything else because I warn you, it is very depressing and will leave you really angry. The only reason he gets 4 stars is because of Anton, Patty, Ruth and the grandparents!
