I just do not understand why every time someone makes a show about one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country (Houston, Dallas, Austin / San Antonio, etc.), they represent the average person as someone who wears wranglers / cowboy hat , speaks with an accent, has no fashion sense and drives a truck on his way to the "saloon" or his next hunting trip, rodeo, clay pigeon shooting or country music concert. I've never seen a policeman in a small city driving a police truck ... anywhere in Texas. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that this is not done for artistic or comedy reasons ... they are really serious and I guess I think the average person is too stupid to know the difference. The bad writings and the bad performance reveal it. This show makes ridiculous shows in the past, like Knightrider, look like high-level entertainment. At least Knightrider had the talking car.
