This is another one of those fundamentalist Christian movies that hit you in the head with religion like a hammer. You know you're in trouble when the configuration of the story is completely ridiculous. Three men are flying to Mexico to deliver Bibles. This does not make sense since the church is Protestant and most Mexicans are Catholics. Protestant and Catholic Bibles are not the same. The Catholic Bible has books that are not in the Protestant Bible. I also find it hard to believe that churches in Mexico would not distribute Bibles to them. I can understand if they went to a place where Christianity is in the minority. But Mexico is very far away. If you can not believe the configuration of a story, then neither does the rest of the story. A film about religion can be entertaining, but not this movie.
