A malfunction in space causes the astronaut Neil Stryker (Glenn Corbett) to deviate from his course and go to a parallel world, called Terra, which revolves around the Sun exactly in front of the Earth. As a being from space would pose a threat to the order of this world, Stryker is retained until he can determine exactly what to do with it. Stryker, however, suspects his surroundings and escapes. With the help of a sympathetic nurse and an old scientist who opposes the government, Stryker will attempt to board a spaceship and return to Earth. <br /> <br /> Stranded in space (or The Stranger, if you prefer) is another. of those 70 movies made for television that would become a regular weekly program. In this case, it is easy to see why he did not succeed. First of all, there is nothing new about the configuration of the show. Without a doubt, it was designed to follow the same formula used by The Fugitive or The Incredible Hulk or Planet of the Apes. You know, a stranger who constantly moves from one city to the next, assuming any strange work that can be prosecuted by a government agency or a newspaper reporter. It is a formula that has been made to death. The second attack against Stranded in Space is his advantage, Glenn Corbett. Could this guy find someone less pleasant? I was encouraging him to be caught. Without sympathy for the main character, this type of show would never work. Finally, this is supposed to be science fiction. Just because everyone is left-handed and someone has hung three false-looking moons on the horizon, I'm supposed to jump to the conclusion that this is a distant planet? So, is it a mere coincidence that everyone speaks English, dresses up as people on Earth and drives Plymouth Furies? Yeah sure. <br /> <br /> What struck me most was the inclusion of Cameron Mitchell in the cast. Sure, it's hard to see him in something so scary, but you know the old saying: any Cameron is better than no Cameron (yes, I've never heard it either). <br /> <br /> As with much of these 70s made for television movies, I looked at Stranded in Space, courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I would not call it a great episode in any sense of the imagination, but there are some Good jokes on the road. So in the end, while I rate the movie with a 2/10, it gets a 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
