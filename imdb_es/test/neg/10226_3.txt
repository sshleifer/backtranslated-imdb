Nothing more than a football hit from The Mighty Ducks, this movie proved to be annoying in most aspects. This was one of those times when your parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they do not have to deal with them for a few hours. To say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it turned out to be very similar to the Mighty Ducks, who are far superior. Oh, well, at least Olivia d'Abo was hot and Steve Guttenberg still had a job at that time.
