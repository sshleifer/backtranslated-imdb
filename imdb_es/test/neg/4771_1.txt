If you value your life in some way, shape or form, you will make a courtesy and go through this seemingly "interesting" movie on the DVD shelf. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking, "I saw the preview and it looked great!" However, the buyer be careful, I fell into the same trap. One of my friends expressed some reluctance to see this movie, but I forced her to sit down. Oh, how much I regret that decision. <br /> <br /> Like most horror movies, the film begins blithely at a sunny Mexican resort where two couples are drawn to an ancient Mayan ruin by a roommate. Upon arriving, they are disturbed by the appearance of two people from the jungle who almost do not realize their cries of greeting. As if this were not sinister enough, the tourist group sets aside the growth of large plants and declares that an unused road consumed by wildlife is a perfect route to its destination. I guess it would not be a great movie if they used rational decisions and turned around at the time, but hey, it was not a good movie anyway. <br /> <br /> After some excursions, the Sixsome (the visitor of the resort brought a friend) stumbled over the ruins and immediately their doubts were dispelled by their beauty and history. That is to say, until the frantic tribe emerges from the jungle armed with a vengeance without any particular reason, shouting in an indecipherable language. Since when are brutal verbal assaults mitigated by a calm and condescending language, do not ask me, but, nevertheless, the cast tries anyway, without success, obviously. Suddenly, the sixth member of the track, Dimitri, is pricked with several arrowheads of the Mayans and all hell breaks loose. One shot ends the job and the horrified travelers quickly retire through the ruin. <br /> <br /> Now, if there was ever an argument for this movie, it ended here. The introduction took a maximum of 20 minutes and, unfortunately, it was the best 20 minutes of the movie. At the top of the ruins, he now realizes that they are trapped by locals and proceed to make innumerable good decisions, one of which is to use a dry rope to lower one of its members to the bowels of the ruin. Needless to say, the adventurer is seriously injured and then trapped inside the ruins and the two brides are seriously injured trying to rescue him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie continues without complication, without real horror, just that. blood and blood, as shown when a girl plucks a plant that grows inside her, dripping torrents of blood and then again when someone's legs are cut, only to be strangled later by the same inner platform. <br /> <My only satisfactions in this movie were watching the very attractive Jonathon Tucker, playing Jeff McIntire, increasingly exhausted and anguished and sitting long enough to determine that almost the entire cast dies of a horrible and frightening death. His simulated pain seems an adequate compensation for the duration of this movie. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, the plot says that the ruin is an old house of dangerous spirits with an evil plant that eats meat to protect itself and consume unfortunate visitors. Unfortunately, I did not get such a warning to scream bloodthirsty plants and the only bad thing related to this film that really horrifies me is the screenwriter.
