I know that so many criticisms in IMDb are extreme, since the reviewers praise a movie completely or break it into pieces. I do not find any of the criticisms of this kind useful, so I do not give this movie the horrible criticism I'm about to make. The film is a science fiction art of the worst kind dressed as a blockbuster Hollywood. Advances show you what appears to be a cohesive plot, but in reality it is only a small part of a series of intentionally disconcerting events that never resolve correctly. I like movies that challenge the viewer and I do not need a plot, so my complaint against this film is not that it's too intellectual. No, the movie is just terrible. As the credits progress, you will feel a real anger for having lost your time in Cameron Diaz's wooden performance and in a hesitant plot. Avoid.
