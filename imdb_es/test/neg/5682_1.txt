First I have to say that I do not like fiction movies very much. But there are some movies that I really liked. This is one of the others;) I have the same opinion as some (most) others here. The movie is still on my back, but the few effects are really not enough to see all the time ... I think what they have done well are the animated scenes of 3 suns and 4 moons, but it is the only one. taste. There are no intelligent dialogues (do they exist ???). But it's a great movie for all those who love Lara Croft or some other girls in HOT-PANTS ...;) <br /> <br /> For the directors: "Stop trying again, PLEASE!"
