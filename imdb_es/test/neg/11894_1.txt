This must be the most boring movie I've seen. The only positive thing I can say about it is that fortunately I did not pay to see it. They gave us a free presentation at school and everyone in the audience sat embarrassed wondering when the fun would begin. This scrap piece is a badly filmed movie, too long. The real idea of ​​why to make the film took about 10 seconds to appear. The only ones who may be interested in this film are those who lost their jobs and want to know why. They could find some interesting interviews. A different edition could have made an interesting documentary of this, but I doubt it, the interviews shown were not in any way attractive. As it is, it is just a tragedy, both for the eyes and to be part of it. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ANY COST!
