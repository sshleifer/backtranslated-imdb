If you want to see an example of how not to make a movie, then you need to see this. I, without cinematic experience, could do better. The script is laughable with a weak plot and there is no effort to be seen by any intelligent structure. To compensate for this failure, you would think that the action would be decent, right? <br /> <br /> As the acting, editing and general composition of the film is frightening, the only salvation is The terrible acting of the main actor. The reason why he is the savior, is because he is so genuinely bad at acting, that he should win an Oscar for it. At least some recognition for making me laugh so much about him. <br /> <br /> Throw the body of a dead woman after a male shooting (where did it come from?), squeeze the semi-automatic trigger several times while the sound technician pulls out two shooting effects, the team reflex camera in the shadows of Kool Mo Dee, one and only ONE music track for the movie WHOLE, an original script that has no logic; It's a perfect recipe for a really bad movie. It is really more fun to detect mistakes than to try to find something positive. Avoid at all costs.
