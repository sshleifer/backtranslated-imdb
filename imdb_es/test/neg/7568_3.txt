I like J-horror, anime and even a little digging the pink movement, which some have declared is a member, but this did nothing for me. I am willing to go one step further and label this one of the biggest disappointments of my career as a spectator. <br /> <br /> Three young rockabillies are having fun for raping the girls. One of the groups begins to develop a conciseness about their time of passage when their younger sister almost catches them in the act. Invariably, the group ignites itself when the friends once begin to fight each other. It ends with a note below as befits the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> In addition to seeing friends yelling at each other, what they do a lot, there's not much to do here. The movie is full of LONG continuous shots that only exacerbate the problem. On top of that, even when the movie starts doing something interesting, it suddenly gets stuck in an ethereal philosophy that never makes any sense. For example, after one of the friends changes his mind about assaulting the girls, he goes out and does it again, but then prevents his friends from taking turns. Eh The cinematography is slow and the lighting poor. Writing is fine, as is acting, which makes it a cinematic effort below par from the start. It combines the lack of technical skill with the weak content and you only have a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more note, at least one of the girls that appears in the buff does not. look old enough to be doing that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
