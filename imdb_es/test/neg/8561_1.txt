I can only say this: ee03128 from Portugal, I could not say it better. The worst movie I've seen ... and I've seen a lot of shit! When I read your comment, I just thought about the thoughts I had while watching the movie. When I saw who was one of the writers, I got it. Balaguer√≥ uses the same tricks in all his films. And their scripts are not much better either. And, of course, in Barcelona we have tons of temples and churches around the city, so we can keep the damn nuns to scare the young Americans who come on vacation. Please, be serious! And I do not want to talk about the quality of the actors ... There is also something extraordinary. It is fair to recognize it. In comparison to the usual level, all Spanish actors use fairly good English.
