This is a spin off of Pulp Fiction. I thought it would be good for a few decent laughs. Well, it turns out that this movie really was terrible. The whole plot does not follow in the Pulp Fiction plot. It becomes another movie like Forrest Gump and more. Some laughter came out of this movie, but all that took me 90 minutes out of my life. If you are thinking of renting this movie, you will not waste 90 minutes of your life. I reconsider renting this and continue and find a movie that really makes sense. Please, if there is a Plump Fiction 2, I definitely will not continue and I will rent the sequel. Just giving a warning to those who are out there.
