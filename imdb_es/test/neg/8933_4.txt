"Flashdance" meets "Meatballs III" or maybe it should be called "Meatballs IV". This is my friend Wesley's favorite movie of all time, largely because he still has something about J.V. cheerleaders. As someone once said: "This is fine, more than good, but as you get older, you need to expand, whether you want it or not, society demands it." <br /> <br /> "Give me an F" has the best cheerleader in the film's JV, Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller), who looks like a sweet-faced Alicia Silverstone since before her "Clueless" days. Wesley hates Miller's other film, the horrific "Teen Wolf Too" made three years later, where he plays a fickle Southern beauty much like the character of Martha Smith in "Animal House." Personally I admire the rank of Miller, since the two characters could not be more different and she is convincing as both. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mary Ann is a naive rookie cheerleader for Moline (member of the "The Lucky Ducks" squad) who comes to Camp Beaverview to receive instructions from cheerleaders. She became friends with Jenna (Karen Lee Kelly), the leader of the hard girls squad, appropriately called "The Demons". Jenna becomes protective of Mary Ann after her main rival becomes instantly angry with Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> Then, Mary Ann falls in love with Tommy Hamilton, the main instructor. Tommy is going through his summer fight with the dilemma of having to grow and move on, which is a problem, since his only skills are teaching cheerleaders and performing elaborate dance routines in the shower, for the enjoyment of the spectators who enjoy of that kind of thing. Phoebe (Daphne Ashbrook) is Tommy's long-suffering girlfriend, has a well-adjusted attitude and an experienced perspective. He even tolerates Tommy's flirting with Mary Ann, hoping that Tommy will not take advantage of young Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> Although these four characters are solid and their relationships have a pleasant charm, the supporting cast is almost as weak as the material they have to work with. Which is a shame because if they had brought some real comic relief to the production, it would have been a decent movie. Jennifer Cooke plays Pam, a socially and mentally draining climbing instructor who is working with Bucky, the hungry camp owner. And there is another couple with something for the characters of "Mad Max". Since nothing is very fun, you are left alone with a nice semi-romance and some excellent dance routines. <br /> <br /> You try to create some suspense by slowly leading a final competition, but unless this is your first cinematic experience the result is never in doubt. And there is a background story about some Japanese businessmen that Bucky wants to get money from, but he does not get anywhere dramatically or comically. <br /> <br /> So, again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
