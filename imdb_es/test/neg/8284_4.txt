After his cross country starlet dies after a race, members of an athletic team are harassed and killed by a mysterious masked assassin seeking revenge for the girl's death. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of this movie, it was pretty obvious that it was not going to be very good (at least in regards to true quality). The "dramatic" track race at the end of the introductory scene was one of the least credible sporting events I've seen in a movie. It would seem that the winner of the race had never run before in his entire life. Do not just run the track. . . but, run at all. Forever. From there, we received a horribly unreal Navy woman who violated numerous rules of appearance with her jewelry and makeup, not to mention the fact that her hair hung loose from her neck in uniform. Camera angles ridiculously uncomfortable, haematological effects pathetically made and performances ranging from terribly exaggerated to boring (all in one actor, yes) help make this movie one of the most hilarious horror movies without any intention. . On the other hand, the writing was not so terrible and the story was actually fine. But, the direction was horrible, made worse by an offensively bad cinematography. The performance varied from acceptable to simply abysmal. However, despite all the shamefully bad elements, there is something here, be it cheese or something else that I can not understand, which makes the film extremely enjoyable and worthy of a watch. Maybe it was just Vanna White. <br /> <br /> Mandatory elements of Slasher: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: the scenes of death were quite funny, but the gore was just horrible: squirting blood from impossible angles, not there are real wounds or wounds of knives, etc. But, this movie has the first 'death by soccer' scene I've seen. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There was a bit of nudity (I mean, Linnea Quigley is in that, after all, and some high school students too hot, but nothing too much. <br /> < br /> - Cool Assassin (s): If you think leather gloves, stop looking, follow suits, and the fencing masks are great, this is for you. <br /> <br /> - Scares / suspense: it's really nothing, there's a moment in the girls' wardrobe where I was getting ready to scare me ... but, it only led to a typical stupidity and it got ruined for me. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: a little, but if you can not discover the murderer's identity in 20 minutes after the movie, then 'I'm not too sure about his powers of deduction. <br /> <br /> - Awkward Dance Scene: there's a great improvised session of improvisation ("Graduation Day Blues") with a guitar and a harmonica that leads to some impressive touches of the 80s. This is briefly followed by a It was a rare album from the 70s and break dance that was probably the most terrifying part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 4/10. Do not take it too seriously and you could enjoy it (as in almost everything Troma plays). <br /> <br /> -AP3-
