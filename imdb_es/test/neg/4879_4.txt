This is a really mediocre movie in the vein of "Buckaroo Banzai". The cast runs like the aspirants to "Mad Max", and it seems that they share a joke that they do not want to share with the audience. Wheeler-Nicholson is one of those guilty actresses for pleasure you love in movies, but it's not worth paying the rent price. Space Maggot starts an electric fire and burns a vote of 4.
