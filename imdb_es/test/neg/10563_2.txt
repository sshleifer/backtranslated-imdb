If you want to truly experience the magic (?) Of Don Dohler, check out "Alien Factor" or maybe "Fiend", but not this. Alien Factor is actually quite imaginative considering the low budget and it's pretty spooky, but "Nightbeast", which I think is an Alien Factor update, is just stupid. The actors walk alone through their roles, especially the sheriff of Mr. Monotone, and the monster is a kind of silly Halloween mask instead of the creatures of Alien Factor that seem tremendously imaginative (but somewhat stupid). A spaceship crashes on Earth and there is a creature inside, of course, that runs around people who vaporize. And pulling arms, etc. And he has a lightning gun that he uses to vaporize people, too, until it's fired from his hand. And that is really about that. "Alien Factor" overcomes this disaster without a doubt, if you really want to see a good Don Dohler movie, take a look. And RIP Don Dohler, 12/2/06.
