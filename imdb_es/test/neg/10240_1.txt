How can ANY give something higher than a '1'? <br /> <br /> I thought that "Hands, the Hands of Destiny" would always be the worst movie in which the optic nerve has impacted me. In fact, I did not think anything could BE worse. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. "Galaxin" is that rare movie in which EVERY UNIQUE ELEMENT is painful, agonizing and blindingly bad. How many times have you seen a movie and commented: "Who the hell LIKES this thing?" From the lighting to the soundtrack to the effects, the script, the cinematography and the cinema. . . Well, EVERYTHING, this movie is absolutely unbearable. It's so bad, I could not even say for a moment if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's too bad even to be ridiculous. I would rather eat a plate full of broken glass than sit through it again.
