Another entry in the subgenus Pacino-As-Mentor. You know the drill: hot youngster with a central flaw (in this case, Matthew McConaughey, trying to start a run for the flag holding on to Pacino's skirts: well, it worked for Keanu and Colin, right?) For a father figure glamorous and deliciously corrupt (Pacino, natch). Young Hotshot learns from Father Figure all the ins and outs of a lucrative but degrading career (this time, it is a disadvantage of football). Father Figure applies to Young Hotshot with money, prostitutes and power, but we all know that this decadent situation is in the process of colliding with dissolution and despair. . . that is, until Young Hotshot finds his moral center rejecting the father figure and everything, or almost everything, what he represents. (Clearly, Stone's * Wall Street * established the basic rules of the subgenre Pacino-As-Mentor). <br /> <br /> We are also destined to take these Pacino films of recent days as a reality parallel. Once again, you know the exercise: the living legend actor demonstrates his unquestionable superiority compared to an inferior young actor. The latter can stand and smile during the process, but you must recognize that you will not get any of the good lines, much less have the opportunity to chew an important scenario before the outcome. Now it has to be said that there are actually two good films in the canon of Pacino-As-Mentor: * Scent of a Woman * and * Donnie Brasco *. In the first case, anyway, it was a one-man show; in the latter case, Pacino had found his partner as a scene thief in the person of Johnny Depp. However, those two films had a serious mentality, not just a showboating exercise for the sake of showboating. Pacino has made sure that his younger castmates in the movies, since "Brasco" are not as charismatic as Depp. By the way, none of this speaks very well of the living legend actor. Like his contemporary De Niro, Pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels. * Two for the Money * is the worst example so far, worse even than * Devil's Advocate *, which at least had the virtue of presenting a nude Connie Nielsen and being chronological before this movie. Well, this is what happens when you're crowned King too soon, just ask Marlon Brando. Frankly, I've seen too many films of Al Pacino with the same plot, and the same overacting of the star, to remain charitable. Did I say "none of this speaks well"? Actually, it is humiliating for everyone involved, including the payment hearing. No one is going to accuse Matthew McConaughey of being a Shakespearean actor, but even he does not deserve the second-place role in this intolerable old show, with the additional implication that he, McConaughey, will never live up to the Greatness. That's Al. <br /> <br /> I have not wasted space on the details of the plot. If you want a synopsis, IMDb provides a sensible summary, although I think I presented a fairly complete summary in my first paragraph. Basically, you've seen this movie before. Many times. The particular environment in * Two for the Money * is the shabby world (actually, the underworld) of sports disabilities. Pacino runs an office of "betting advisors", that is, intermediaries between you and your bookmaker, and even has a program for disabled cable TV, organized jointly with several of its best players. One thing that the film did well was the sordidness of this type of programs. . . but one detail they were wrong about was the constant use of the words "gamble" and "gambling". If you have ever seen ProLine or other similar programs, you will NEVER, NEVER hear Jim Feist and his companions say the word "bet". They ask you to call your 1-900 number to get your selections. . . but if you were from, say, Mars, you would have no idea what you were supposed to do with those selections. "Game" is the word F in television programs for the sporty disabled - strictly verboten. <br /> <br /> The game is against the law, you know. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10.
