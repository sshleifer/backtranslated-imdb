This is a horrible replacement of a very good movie called "Up In The Air", starring Frankie Darrow, Mantan Moreland and Marjorie Reynolds. I could only go through about 20 minutes before turning it off. Almost all the lines are identical, I have no idea why they would make the film again. I totally disagree with an earlier post that does not like the songs (also the same), in the original the singing is first class, I'm not sure if Marjorie Reynolds actually made her own singing, it's hard to say since the Voices were generally added later, and the songs are very good, surprising in a movie "B". If you have the opportunity to see the original, it is available on DVD. You will be pleasantly surprised.
