Here is a summary of a typical Rachael Ray Show: <br /> <br /> 1. The horrible musical theme begins to play, and Rachael descends with her Snapcrotch outfit in this strange cargo elevator. 2. She starts running screaming and / or insulting the audience, then yells at them to sit down. 3. An uncomfortable monologue. <br /> <br /> (The following are in any order) 4. A segment that touches Rachael's horn (ie, "I lost 500 pounds with Rach's recipes," Rachael Ray saved my life "" Rachael's Fashion Tips. ") 5. A totally useless DIY suggestion (ie, how to record words on casserole dishes, how to use your washer as a salad making tool, how to build a lipstick tube with a light on it). 6. The unleashing of a horrible recipe in the trusted audience (the reaction shots of the first bites are never shown) 7. A guest celebrity with an awkward interview, followed by some obviously written questions from the audience. who gets help from one of Rachael's friends (that is, I say yes to all women, I have nothing but monkeys, and I do not find time to put on makeup) What would they do without you Rachael? * Panting * <br /> <br /> Reasons why this program should avoid rse like the plague: 1. Fake: Rachael Ray says that the whole program does not have a script. Many people Those who have attended the recordings of the program have stated that the entire program is scheduled. Many of these same people have also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Your program jumps too much: where, like Oprah, who is the highest rated interview presenter of all time, has a definite theme for her program, Rachael's jumps as a child with soda with ADHD in crack. Your program has an average of perhaps 10, short segments and no value in a program. Secondly, you will receive fashion tips from Kojo, and the next Rachael will make thick "Spanish" peppers stuffed with Manchego cheese, and the next one will be a giant anaconda on stage, and the next one, well, you will get the image. <br /> <br /> 3. Rachael is a bad host with bad ideas: apart from his challenging personality, Rachael's accommodation capacity is terrible, at best. Your questions for your famous guests are poor, and often they are not even relevant to the interview, and their segments are not attractive and offer little educational or humorous value. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you do not need to waste your time with this chump. It will be canceled soon anyway.
