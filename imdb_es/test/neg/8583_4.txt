For a horror movie, this is criminally boring. A few memorable and frightening bits can not compensate for a really poor script. Very little coherence is achieved, and the film relentlessly surpasses its basic idea (a killer cat), until it becomes repetitive, and things get worse by the constant use of shots from the cat's point of view.
