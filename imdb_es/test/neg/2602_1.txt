You already know that Family Guy started as something fresh, fun and more original. Random humor used to be fun. Actually, I used to think it was the best animated comedy with The Simpsons. After seeing the new episodes that were aired during the last weeks; I got fed up with the show because I relied too much on random humor to be fun. South Park was right about the death of FG when they mentioned the Manatees and the balls of ideas. <br /> <br /> And seeing the program itself, I do not understand why my parents like it so much; There is nothing good in that. "Smart" humor is fun and would have been more fun if the show did not depend on randomness.
