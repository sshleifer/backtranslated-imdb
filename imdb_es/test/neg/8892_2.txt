I wanted to see this movie because I liked "Kavkazskij Plennik" ("Prisoner of the Mountains") and "Brat" ("Brother") with Sergey Bodrov, Jr. and "Vor" ("The Thief") with Vladimir Mashkov. Well, unlike other movies, "The Quickie" was a total waste of time. The story that makes little sense, a very unequal performance (Lesley Ann Warren was especially bad), really terrible dialogues, bad cinematography, what else could go wrong? I find it funny that in practically all films made in the United States, when foreigners who speak the same language (Russians in this case) are left alone, they prefer to communicate with each other mainly in broken English (and when they speak Russian). , for some reason, translators feel compelled to add a large amount of "f ** ks" in sentences, which have no profanity, literal or non-literal). At the same time, native English-speaking actors choose to speak in broken Russian. Why is that? Returning to the story, most of the secondary plot of the film (for example, betting on the house, inviting Latin American paramilitaries, etc.) have no meaning or do nothing but confuse the spectators. It's a shame that Bodrov, Mashkov and Leigh (all good actors in my humble opinion) have been involved in this disaster.
