The story of this film is a clich√© and, obviously, it has been torn from Jurassic Park. The filmmakers did not even try to hide that. It seems as if there is not enough budget to make decent dinosaur dolls, so instead, the viewer sees some robot-like toy dinosaurs (from a cheap toystore) that move in a very unnatural way. Although it's funny, because it's so bad. The performance is almost as unnatural as dinosaurs are. Nobody seems really excited to be in this movie (which I totally understand). Especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it is almost impossible to see her without falling asleep. The only positive comment note I would like to make about "Raptor" is that it does not take 90 full minutes.
