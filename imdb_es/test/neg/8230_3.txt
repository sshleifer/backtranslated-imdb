This is a strange movie. On the surface it is not unlike many other grade D gore movies, but at least in some ways it stands out. First, the main killer character is really weird. How the heck, a guy who only makes a song like a chicken went on parole is totally out of my reach. What did that woman member of the parole board think about: "It's totally reformed and rehabilitated." The cackles Another problem with Luther the Geek is the script / direction for women. The daughter is so pathetic and seemingly stupid that if she were mine, I would slap her. When trying to untie her mother from the bed, she struggles with the knots and simply does not seem to think: "I'll get a pair of scissors or a knife." Later, in a similar attempt to unleash her mother, she walks down the stairs and starts looking in a junk box to find scissors, and finally gets a knife. By the way, this is after the killer obviously left in the car and came back. Strange. On the positive side, the daughter took off the kit for the shower scene, so it was nice, though again unusual. It seems that in many of these bloody Grade D films, they gleefully show that the throats were bitten with blood gushing, but the vision of a female breast is, in some way, too strong for the audience. In general, it worked but it was annoying and unpleasant, although naked breasts made up for some of that.
