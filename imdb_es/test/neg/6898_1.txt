BARNYARD sucked! I watched this movie last week and it's horrible. What bull has the udders? My 2-year-old daughter asked me if all the cows have udders and I tried to explain to her that this is simply not true and watching the film just confused her more! <br /> <br /> In addition, the violent theme scared my 2 years. They made the coyotes a fierce look and this has instilled a fear of the coyotes in my daughter. I know that coyotes are not fierce and they are natural predators. The mother and the son who were sitting in front of us shouted: "Kill him, kill him, yes" in a particular scene of the film in which good versus evil is spoken <br /> <br /> It is a scam of the Lion King . outside and should stop using renowned actors for a lame movie. Steve Oederek, who has also made Thumb movies, like Thumb Wars, Thumbelina and many others, is so bad! <br /> <br /> If there ever is a good Steve Oederek movie in my life, I'll shoot naked and swallow my diarrhea and post it on Youtube.com ... Enough of that!
