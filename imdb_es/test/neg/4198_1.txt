I rented Dark Harvest (the first) because it looked like a kind of monster-type adventure game in the box. The scarecrows also scare me. The film had an effective sequence of titles, but what followed was quite scarce (flat, bad lighting, acting, editing, direction ...). Recently, I noticed that DH 2: The Maize had a fairly extensive advertising campaign. I thought that maybe the first one was a bit successful, so they increased the initial bet a bit in this case, possibly delivering some bigger and fx fears of the murderous scarecrows. Well, there are no scarecrows in the video ... No problem. The problems begin in DH 2 with a sequence of titles that seems an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and bars that erase titles and other things. As for the real picture ... every time the sun shines in one shot, you would have all these targets turned off, confirming that you are watching an ultra-low budget mini-DV project that some of the Midwest filmed on their Uncles. farm. The acting did not work at all. The cheap scam of The Shining twin girls was below the standards of first-year film students. The edition was extremely amateur and lazy. The sound was jarring and choppy. (For example, every time the editor reduces to a new plane, here you will have the perspective of the sound change). It is as if someone gathered their friends and family (actors), took a video camera in a field of corn for three days, put a light on the sequences of the night (no kidding, that's what they really did) , burned through some tape, pasted the footage on his computer, cut a (very) rough version, incorporated some music, omitted any imaginative sound work or mixed, recorded it directly on a DVD and threw it on the shelf from the video store. Any fan of horror should be insulted by this type of direct video work that is devoid of ANY skill or style. The fact that a person has a video camera and is able to get something from an image on a tape does not mean that it should be published to the public. If I could give this one a score lower than ONE, I would.
