It is difficult to write 10 lines of copy on this black film noir. There is simply not much to say about it. It is not memorable enough to add to your collection, and I have a considerable amount of noirs. <br /> <br /> Paul Henreid plays a tough guy here. I do not think it's one of those roles, but it's fine with that. He is a good actor, anyway. <br /> <br /> Everything, including cinematography, is fine, but it is not memorable. One thing that stood out: the abrupt end. That was a surprise. It was also a surprise to see this under the heading "Hollow Triumph." I've never seen the movie called like that. It has always been called "Scar". <br /> <br /> If you read about a "tense cinema", etc., do not believe it. "Tense" is not a precise adjective for this movie.
