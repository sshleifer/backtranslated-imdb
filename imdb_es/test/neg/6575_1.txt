This was so bad that I can not even check it. So I'm going to write down some sentences about what I witnessed, and it will be up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Captain Kirk, with toupee and tubby gut, is the captain of Yosemete in rock climbing. Spock meets him halfway in a floating skateboard-like hovercraft. Kirk falls. Spock flies down, catches him in before Kirk touches the floor on his head. <br /> <br /> Later that night, Spock, Kirk and McCoy are eating beans around a campfire. Spock likes beans. Then, Kirk and McCoy sing "Row Row Row Your Boat," and they want Spock to join the three-way harmony. Spock does not want to sing. And later that night, he does not agree. "But life is just a dream, captain." Should I continue? <br /> <br /> Well ... A renegade vulcano, who is Spock's half brother, heads a revolt on a sandy planet: take hostages. The crew of the company lands on the planet, and Uhura, pushing fifty-five and weighing two hundred odd pounds, lures the natives with his bare legs. But they can not cheat the brother, who says he can find God. <br /> <br /> Kidnap the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a great bearded apparition, claiming to be God, spits fire on Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Spock's brother, realizing that he is not God, but in reality is a form of himself, or something like that, joins the apparition to destroy it and ... the sparks fly. <br /> <br /> Then, after things happen too complicated to explain, they involve the Klingons who look like Lorenzo Lamas ... <br /> <br /> The Three Friends - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - return to Yosemite (right? Mention, Kirk wearing a GO CLIMB TO ROCK T-shirt?). With Spock playing a kind of funky Vulcan guitar, they sing "Row Row Row Your Boat", this time the three harmonize as credits accumulate.
