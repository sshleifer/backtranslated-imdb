The Mexican 'classic' was the third entry in the Aztec Mummy series. As you will soon discover, this film is anything but a classic, instead, it is more like a movie that tries to bore you deliberately. <br /> <br /> Some scientists want to steal the Aztec treasure from a tomb, but guarding That tomb is that traveling toilet paper commercial: The Aztec Mummy. Knowing that he can not defeat the Mummy, then he builds a robot, and a very bad one in that. We can only see Mr.Robot on the last roll, while he bends down and fights the Aztec mummy. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of really bad science fiction movies, most of the Fi movies I see are bad, but this, for its total duration of 64 Minutes, is the worst movie I've seen, with Fubar in second place nearby ... <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Do not waste your time.
