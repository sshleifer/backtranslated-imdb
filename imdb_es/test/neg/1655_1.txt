This is one of the worst pieces of cinema I've seen in a long time. This is also my first review, so you can say that I should hate this movie for a long time. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like my serious films. I do not like Hollywood too much, I like French, Italian, the unconventional United States or anything that tries to communicate something sensible. <br /> <br /> But this was horrible. Why? 1. The plot (as it was) was totally incredible, even though the director seems to be leaning everything to a feeling of realism. <br /> <br /> 2. The main character has nothing to recommend him. Do you smoke to refresh yourself or to show your anguish? For God's sake, this man is destined to be a former mob mafia lawyer. Are we supposed to worry more because he is also one of the most hostile people you could meet? And he smokes ... so he must have deep personal problems. The psychology of pop at its best. In the final moments, I almost applauded him when he buried himself in cement. The best place for him. And I thought that it was the only good scene. Or maybe it was because he was very close to the final credits. <br /> <br /> 3. The totally tired and incredible interest in the main character of the beautiful girl. She was there simply because beautiful girls always have strange sexual relationships with old men, men with a deep and significant personality (as evidenced by smoking). Happens all the time. In really bad movies that is. <br /> <br /> 4. The rhythm was so leaden. I like slow, I like to be careful. But this was just deadly. <br /> <br /> 5-50 a lot of other things that I really can not bother writing. <br /> <br /> It's horrible.
