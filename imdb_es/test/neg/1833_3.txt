Okay, I had reasonably high expectations for this. The controversial issue was a good concept. As a fan of horror, I admit that I was fascinated and very excited about this. <br /> <br /> It turns out they had a great idea, but it was terribly executed. Let's see. This movie seems to work in 3 modes: happy, sex and dark. The problem is that the film never decides what it wants to be. The "Happy" parts that I think were made to contrast with the "Dark" parts, but do not work. The soundtrack is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> The transitions of the film between these 3 modes very badly, I can not even begin to tell how much the address and editing stinks. There is sex in the most unpleasant and little erotic way. I'm not complaining, but even by Horror's standards they were unnecessary and full. <br /> <br /> All the characters are unpleasant, except for Paula (Powerful). Her friend from Munich is a whore and possibly one of the most annoying characters in the movies I've recently encountered. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of argument that I will not detail ... It is not stupid and in more talented hands I would make a good movie. There's even a good turn and a great conspiracy going on. Do not try to understand everything because there are huge holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Everything is so badly done that you do not care about the victims, the perpetrators, nobody. And to think that this could have been great. I can say ONE good thing about it, which is that the film sheds some light on today's unethical medical procedures. With genetics and the controversial sciences advancing, this could have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these issues. But you will not find that here, just a series of scenes stuck freely with people and things that do not interest you. <br /> <br /> Skip this and go to Flatliners instead, you're welcome. <br /> <br /> 3/10
