Okay, I read the director's comment about this movie (which appears as the 'most advanced comment'), and I must admit that I can identify with his position. <br /> <br /> Micheal, I hope your career has recovered from this particular setback and moved on to other better things. I have seen this movie in the MST3K form. Even with all the interrupted continuity and the malicious comments launched by the robots, I saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas that tried to get ahead with the limited budget and the limited actors available. And this is one of those movies ("Mitchell" is another) in which the MST3K team made many cheap shots at the main character, even when she really deserved better. You know they had a little unfairly at the expense of the actress because it was a livelier episode. <br /> <br /> IMO, the fact that the film really tried to be ABOUT something and had some decent and effective moments here and there, should keep it out of the 'Fund' ("Tangents / Time Chasers" is another movie with a plot and a heart that does not deserve to be there either). <br /> <br /> But It's still not a very good movie. I do not blame the writer / main actress for being who she is. It's just that his acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before he could carry out a vanity project like this or take a movie. The writing and characterization are amateur and slapdash, and the dialogue is often barely up to the ABC Afterschool special standards. The cast sincerely gives it its best effort, and acting in general is definitely superior to abortions such as "Future War" or "Space Mutiny", but here there are no truly professional level performances, with the exception of 'Big Joe' Estévez , which is hammy but adequately intense. I never saw the complete original cut, but the sample of "Soultaker" of MST was representative enough to clarify these facts. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie has Robert Z'Dar. That is, IMO, a true 'Kiss Of Death' for any film that hopes to be taken seriously. Yes, he's big and scary in his role, but I hate the guy as an actor. (In real life, I wish you the best and hope you are financially comfortable). <br /> <br /> There were few things I liked about the movie. For example, the camaraderie between the male protagonist and his dead partner added some warmth and humor to the film and made it much more visible. The idea of ​​an elevator in the hospital that opened its doors to Afterlife was an inspired way to invoke some creepy vibrations without the need for special effects, and I respected anyone who included that in the script to try to keep the budget manageable. It really did not work, but I could have done it with a little more adjustment. <br /> <br /> So anyway, Mr. Rissi, better luck with your other projects: your participation in this error would not keep me from seeing anything else you did if the 'buzz' was good. And Miller has nothing to be ashamed of, she was young and ambitious, and the movie was not that bad.
