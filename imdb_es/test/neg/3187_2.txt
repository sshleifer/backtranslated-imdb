I'm afraid that I only stayed to see the first hour of this movie, since it really seemed like a meaningless television crap and a loss of talent. Liv Tyler plays a sumptuous beauty, but her acting skills are not yet developed enough to give a real touch to the part. While she slowly seduces a bartender in a life of crime, it is difficult to feel a true concern for any of the characters. Even John Goodman delivers his faintly comic lines with an absence of style, as if witty humor was recited slowly in case someone missed the joke. The end is supposed to be good, but the starter and the main course left me with no appetite to find out.
