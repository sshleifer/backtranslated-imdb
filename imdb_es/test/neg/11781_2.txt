This is one of the stupidest movies in history, not the MOST stupid you, but one of the stupidest. This is 96 1/2 minutes of material that induces sleep. Probably the worst movie of Jim Varney. The last 30 seconds of the movie are the best part and the funniest, but it's almost not worth sitting in the whole movie. On the other hand, if you're a Jim Varney / Ernest fan, then like me, you should add this movie to your collection. It has brief and rare moments of humor, although they are few and far between. The mere fact that this film is so difficult to find makes it a collector's item and an essential element for its collection. I was lucky to find this movie online at a very cheap price a couple of years ago. I think I paid 1.99 plus shipping for it. And it was the only copy I could find anywhere. Even though this is a really horrible movie, it's a must if you're a fan of Jim Varney and an Ernest movie collector like me. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give this movie a 2, but only because I've never seen a 1 before;)
