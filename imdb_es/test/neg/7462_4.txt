Slow and strange film that drags and treads (I mean really PLODS) to its disappointing climax. You can expect some kind of auction at the end, but there is none. Both Milland and Snodgress give uncomfortable performances; In fact, the rarity of the movie may be the only thing it can do. The generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts (like the music played during the first appearance of a monkey), and there is a truly horrible fantasy scene involving ... a gorilla. (**)
