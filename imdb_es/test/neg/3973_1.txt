Parts: The Clonus Horror is a horror. Of course, there are the bad fads of the late 70s. There is a really bad performance from Dick Sargent to Peter Graves. And then there are the clones themselves. His days consist mainly of running, jumping, riding a bicycle and fighting each other. When they are not doing that, they learn about America. Not the Latin band, or the Neil Diamond song, but an America where they become part of a larger society. But they are given a strange drug, then all body fluids are drained (General Ripper was right!) And they are placed in the freezer and await Thanksgiving or Christmas when they will be defrosted and roasted at approximately 450 degrees. Wow, that is not what happens, but it would have been much more interesting than what is shown. Mario, of the fame of Super Mario Brothers, makes a charming cameo as a doctor who discusses with Dick Sargent.
