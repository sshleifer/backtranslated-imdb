This is the best Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I've seen! I'm giving too much credit to this movie! My best guess for the reason of making this movie is that someone wanted to show someone else's martial arts skills, but he realized that you can not film a guy who fights with another guy and that people see him, so he put a story behind the movie. fighting ... and people have not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie was thin as onion skin. That performance was ridiculous and stereotyped from any Kung Fu movie. The dubbing was literally the worst I've heard. It seemed that if you played a small role in this movie, like the fat man or the two guys who were trying to catch the main character with a network, it did not matter who you overcame your voice. It could have been a dyslexic with a stutter and nobody would have said anything. But next to all this, the film is compensated with the somewhat amazing fight scenes. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were definitely what this movie was about. But the instigations of the fights were totally absurd! In most cases, a boy leaves the tall grass or looks at the main character from a distance and then attacks him. But once the fight started, things were balanced. However, there were only two things that really hindered the fight. Those constant "wooshing" sound effects that were added to each stroke of a fist or a foot or a sword, and the bad editing that made 25 percent of the fight VERY exciting and choppy. Someone would be in the middle of a back flip and then suddenly he would be on the floor being kicked, and then, instantly, he would be standing, blocking a punch. But although the cut and paste editing was more annoying than anything else, it did not really affect the film in general. <br /> <br /> In the end, this was not a great movie, but I was not. waiting for a great movie A great movie is not something you should expect when you see a cover like the one in this movie. Everything I saw in this movie was a way to spend an hour and a half of boredom. I rarely say that, but this is just one of those movies for which you do not have a practical use, so you see it every time you have free time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! Good morning gentlemen. <br /> <br /> -Scott-
