This movie is cash. A cash that depends on an inspired themed melody created for a previous classic. Yul Brynner has long since left the ship and also the majority of production values. Lee Van Cleef takes on the lead role of Chris. I can not think of any actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, at least you could have shaved your hair and lost your mustache, just for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centers show this movie to punish the offenders. One step off the line and The Magnificent Seven Ride! is brought to the foreground and is managed. They did not even bother trying to make this movie not look like a television movie! Abysmal.
