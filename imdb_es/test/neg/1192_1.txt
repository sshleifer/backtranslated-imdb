Do not get me wrong, I love the League of Gentlemen television series. It was fun, twisted and completely inspired. I really wanted to see the movie, the premise was interesting and I was hoping to see what they had done with the characters and where the strange story would take them. <br /> <br /> It was a total disappointment to begin with. the three weakest characters in the series were the protagonists and only contained bit parts for the other characters (why not choose mickey and Pauline, dad Lazaro or tubs and Edward for the main parts?). It was not fun at all, half jokes and a bad mood slapstick. <br /> <br /> The deciding factor was the simple and ridiculous drama / comedy (and I will use the word comedy lightly). He was distracted from the main plot and felt uncomfortable, not to mention painfully inopportune. The direction of the film is atrocious, and it is often felt that the lines were delivered by the characters in one shot. Very hurried. <br /> <br /> Then - the three-headed plasticine-skirmish monster. What the hell was all that? simply ridiculous, it seemed that the League of Knights had labeled it at the end. <br /> <br /> In general, I found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my experience of the film. What was once an amazing television series has been tainted by a terribly unfunny film. <br /> <br /> If I could give you 0 out of 10, I would. Do not waste your money watching this.
