I realize why people hate this movie. And I hated Blair's witch project, so imagine. This is all that is staged and yes, they insult your intelligence by trying to make it look real. I really liked the story of Madame Lalaurie, although it is more than likely. But, the main reason why I like this movie, is false or not when the ghosts start attacking them and kidnapping them, it gives me chills every time and I have to look back since I feel that there is something with me. I know it's my imagination. , but hey more than half the nonsense that is the horror in today's cinemas and DVDs does not give me goose bumps, so this makes it a spooky delight. Not for everyone, since the skeptics will hate it and not for the gorehounds as with a PG 13 rating there is no gore. And the females are very annoying! You want the ghosts to take them off and experience them before everything is said and done. ** outside *****.
