Or has someone else noticed the fact that the first group of episodes was too inspired by the movies of the 90s? <br /> <br /> I mean seriously the wife who is trying to have someone else murder her rich husband in order to claim her property. Medical students who are temporarily stopping their hearts to reach memories that have been lost; Flatliners. A lot of university bodies meet again to remember the old days but they are not completely comfortable because they did something in the past, very bad things? Groundhog Day is one of my favorite movies of all time. Unfortunately, the writing team behind their turd is a group of lazy bastards who can not create their original scripts. <br /> <br /> Noble idea totally frustrated in its execution.
