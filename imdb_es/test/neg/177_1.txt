The movie is annoying. <br /> <br /> Technically, there are too many times you see defocused and edited scenes in a very approximate way. One could easily get a cleaner movie with a decent amateur camera and $ 100 video editing software. On earth, man on the street does not mean a careless issue. Defocused scenes that do not contain an important statement should have been deleted. The same goes for making sure that the object's head / hand / others remain in the frame. My 8 year old son already knows it. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long. The main point (anti globalization) is understood after 30 minutes, why bother with all the rest. After the interview with James Suckling, I pressed the "stop" button. What waist of time. <br /> <br /> The main theme does not work for me anymore. I have seen too many small wineries that produce mediocre, commercialized wines and many large wineries that produce great and unique wines. The film identifies small producers as those who produce wines with more identity or terroir. The largest are accused of producing "internationalized" or "commercialized" wines. The film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones. However, the film has not proved this claim. They look at a couple of sporadic examples, "link" some of the big producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism and provide "interviews" with key people. Well, did all the small producers go through World War II in the resistance? Is it relevant to see that Parker has something with the Bulldogs? The film is very manipulative and unconvincing.
