The title practically lets you know what you get. It's a grade C howler, but not as blatantly funny as I expected. Directed by film-maker Eddie Romero from a story that originally came from Jonathan Demme (long before directing "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this low-budget action movie from 1972 was obviously filmed in the Philippines , but recorded anonymously. third-world country. Playing the prostitute and the small drug trafficker Lee Daniels, the blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the lead role, while the forgotten Margaret Markov is the other half, Karen Brent, an unlikely revolutionary like Patty Hearst who seeks to associate with His comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. Naturally antagonistic to one another, they find themselves in a prison camp for women in which they wear mini inexplicably bright yellow skirts as uniforms. Directed by a locked guardian and a lustful matron, the prison is just an excuse for a long shower scene and some halfhearted cat fights when Lee and Karen confront each other. Of course, they escape but they are chained by force "The Challengers" and they continue the fight of cats until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, several groups of unsavory men are in search: the evil drug lord looking for Lee who stole $ 40K, the rather passive revolutionaries looking for Karen and the incompetent police (who they suffer the humiliation of exposing their private to the lord of drugs). Needless to say, everything reaches a critical point, but not before the free nudity of several Filipino women, a dog wears Karen's panties and some of the worst in men's fashion of the 1970s (a revolutionary with a belly of beer wears a sleeveless leather shirt with a straight shirt) expensive). There is a rather sad ending, but what is truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is completely lost in this hilariously absurd exercise. Unfortunately, Grier is disappointed in this exit because his character is not allowed to do much more than deal with all the "jive", while Markov is an Amazonian blonde to whom I am convinced that he is desperately trying to be credible. Since no one shows any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth noting, except Sid Haig, bald and bug-eyed, who uses his standard psycho persona as the lord of drugs. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an extra.
