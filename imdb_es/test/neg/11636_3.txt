This movie did not do it for me, an avid SNL fan for the last 14 years. The performance of Jamie Gertz was fine, but there was something very unpleasant about the film itself. The facts presented in the film are totally biased. But Merv Griffin produced it, so that would explain a lot. He was never in SNL, nor had anything to do with it. The points in her life when she was in SNL are the other way around. When we first see her in SNL, walking through the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is around 1988-1989, not 1975. And let's talk about the cast: who are these people? I have never heard of one of them. Really unsatisfactory. This movie shows why television movies are just that, TV movies.
