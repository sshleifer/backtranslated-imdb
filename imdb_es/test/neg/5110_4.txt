From time to time I will remember that I have really seen this strange fiasco that is a cross between "What became of Baby Jane?", "Sunset Boulevard", Lana Turner's LSD movie "The Big Cube" and Manson's murders, which It also took place in 1969, but maybe before this so-called "movie" was made! There are already some descriptions of the plot here, so I'm not going to go into it. But it is worth noting that Miriam Hopkins interprets a parody of herself: an actress who speaks, is selfish and vanishes. Maybe he thought he was making a movie that would be as successful as one of the horrors of Bette Davis. Old gal Hopkins never stopped working, so you have to give it to her. She shows too much meat in this movie, something Davis and Crawford would never have done. And there's a scene with Miriam at the Christmas Parade on Hollywood Boulevard, which must have been filmed Christmas, 1968. <br /> <br /> Gale Sondergard is old, old, old. It is amazing how wrinkled and horrible it looks. John Garfield, Jr. looks a bit like his father, but it's not that interesting. I think one of the Three Stooges is the guide at the beginning. If it is not one of the Stooges, it is someone. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find this in the form of a commercial video tape given to me by a friend who knows all about junk like this. It's amazing!!!
