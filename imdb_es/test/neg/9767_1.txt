This movie was not good at all. I could see it at a film festival and I did not appreciate the content that I was forced to see. It is a well-shot film about the family that seeks to reconnect after the death of the family's cornerstone (Gabrielle Union) dies. The film stars Billy Dee Williams as the brother of Gabrielle's Union. Well, actually, Gabrielle Union played the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was Billy Dee Williams' older sister. This had to be Billy Dee William's worst performance in his career, ever. It seemed as if he did not remember his lines in a few scenes. He was an unpleasant character, almost never empathetic, who fathered a daughter when he was married to a white woman with whom he already had a daughter. The two daughters are older now and while the daughter he had with the white woman (Lucy) was trying to connect with him, his other daughter did not want anything to do with him. The character of Billy Dee was so pathetic that the only way they could make him travel from Paris for his sister's funeral was by telling him that the funeral had already passed and that his late sister had left him with the responsibility of handling his papers. Why did they have to deceive him? Because he did not like attending funerals. I know. You're asking, "But he did not want to attend his own sister's funeral too?" Yes! He states that he did not like being close to the forced feelings of emotions that are shared among people who pay their respects. He did not want to have anything to do with that. Now we're supposed to empathize with that a ** hole? The rest of the performances in the film were flat with equally flat characters. The director and the editor did not mind considering the pace of the movie. The flashbacks were painful to watch. It was a bad movie. However, he seems to be the favorite at black film festivals; a film that glorifies the African-Americans' dependence on Caucasians to find a love with which they can establish themselves, even if it is a healthy relationship. When bad love stories like this one win the best of festivals at black film festivals, it makes me question the judgment of blacks in the movie. In these same festivals, the only films that win prizes are educational films about African-American culture and black films directed by Caucasian directors. I'm not saying something is wrong with a white person who runs stories written for people of color. The problem with these films is that they never argue from both points of view, which are usually the films that really speak to the masses. These films are often forms of unilateral didacticism. These films fail to execute the powers of both sides of the argument that the film revolves around it. Writers and directors never compose scenes and sequences that contradict their final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. These films always tip the argument. What I am saying is that the people who run these black film festivals judge a film with pure content, which for me means directing, acting, writing cinematography, editing, etc., or judging the films by the strictly delivered message. about African-American culture? Are we supposed to expect a movie like Constellation to have a shot in the world against films like "Million Dollar Baby" and "Sideways?" What happened to the movie being entertaining? When I refer to entertainment, I mean the ritual of sitting in the dark, staring at the screen, investing tremendous concentration and energy in what one expects to be a satisfying and meaningful emotional experience. Why these festivals can not appreciate the movies that transmit their messages without preaching? Why these black film festivals can not recognize movies that are well-told works that are brutally honest, telling the truth? "I think we do not have the responsibility to cure social ills or renew faith in humanity, raise the spirits of society or even express our inner being, we have a single responsibility: to tell the truth." - Robert McKee. That is something that I totally agree with. These same black film festivals write "Hustle and Flo" as if it were the horrible film of black stereotypes. However, it is an honest movie about a pimp with a dream. Can not a pimp dream? I remember the last time I saw a real pimp who was a human being. And are not they, pimps and prostitution a harsh reality in our society in general, not only in the black community but everywhere? The powers that are in the "black Hollywood" believe that films like this one are making African-Americans look bad in the eyes of others, as if others did not know that there are pimps on the hood. The truth is, until African-Americans in film can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world, our films will never have a chance in the world. This movie was horrible. The best was the cinematography and Zoe.
