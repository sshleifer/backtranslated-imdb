This movie was incredibly stupid with the meaning of what ever. I felt bad for all the actors and actresses who ruined his career in this stupid movie. The whole movie was based on how unrealistic it could be, to do little like the one that made it even more stupid. even some of the names were unrealistic. The movie is fun to watch, so it had 2 out of 10 stars. This is probably the third stupidest movie ever made. I really won after I realized that I had actors mostly adults, but in a children's movie. The most disturbing was Danny Trejo, a horror movie actor who is always dirty. the other actors were pretty clean as far as I'm concerned.
