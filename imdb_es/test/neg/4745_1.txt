This film and the first film of AvP, both in the entire Aliens and Predator franchise. <br /> <br /> They are dreadful movies, badly performed, badly written and terribly directed. They look like desperate people trying to make money with the good name of the original aliens and predator movies, but instead of delivering a thoughtful and quality production, they came up with the predisposed. <br /> <br /> The original Alien / Aliens / Predator / Predator 2 movies were great, they redefined the horror / suspense genre by inventing these crazy (and yet credible) creatures who took on the role of "serial killer" ", instead of a human. <br /> <br /> These films are just the milking of the franchise and they only obscure his name. <br /> <br /> The comics of Aliens vs Predator were brilliant and had a great history. They were faithful to the Alien / Predator mythology, they did not shit on all the original stories, etc. Why did not they make a great movie from the comic? Because Hollywood are idiots, that's why.
