I like bad movies, but this is a lot of steam. From the unstable cameramen to the horrible sound and devastating performance, do not waste a second in this pile. The fifth graders could have made a better movie and the first graders could have written a better script. Do you want a real synopsis? Ugly girls in neon bikini dancing for too long. A disconnected plot worsened by an appalling performance. The location sets were not even passable. The scenes of the church take place in a dance studio, and oh yes, what about the two numbers of tap-dance that come out of nowhere? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the total number of bare breasts, they could not. I have not even saved this movie - 0. Add this one to the trash heap.
