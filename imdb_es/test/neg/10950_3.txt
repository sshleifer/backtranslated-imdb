After seeing this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon, I could not understand why so many people liked it. It was not "moving" or "intelligent"; it was simply an amalgam of all the other "misfit people who gathered together during a holiday and, despite their ideological differences, learned something about the other" movie that has been made. <br /> <br /> Blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Asians and homosexuals, and they never do anything except what everyone expects characters in a movie like this to do. The black mother declares that "it's okay, then" when it is mentioned that another black character is in the church instead of helping to prepare the dinner (because all blacks love the church), the Hispanics seem to be able to speak Spanish when they greet each other or make comments. exclamations, lesbians do nothing but embrace and kiss (and one of them wears a handkerchief, because all lesbians dress like Ani DiFranco), and the Vietnamese family has a video store. In the. Imagine that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is called "What's Cooking" because every ethnic family cooks a different version of what they think the Thanksgiving dinner should be. The black mother wants corn bread and macaroni and cheese, Hispanics are shown rolled tortillas, the Vietnamese family fry the spring rolls; I'm surprised there was not a bottle of Manischewitz on the Jewish table. All this is shown through the traditional tradition of "musical montage", where they play the "Wipeout" of Surfari, quickly changing the instruments used in the melody to reflect the respective cultures. Its not cute? Anyway, once the director finishes establishing how different each person is, he tries to show the inner humanity that we, as all people of all races, religions and cultures share, inventing unreasonable and excessively dramatic conflicts for each family to deal with It would be a killer of the plot to mention what each of these conflicts is, but you can be sure that they are surprises, that is, if you have been sleeping during the first half of the movie. The theme of "dishonoring the family" is quite strong in everything. <br /> <br /> In general, if you're the kind of person who enjoys these new movies that revolve around the stories of unlikely characters that intertwine, well, you still will not like this movie. If you like extended mounts of food that are passed around a table, then you need to put this in your Netflix queue. But if stereotypes and clich√©s are attractive to you, then make sure you order this for Christmas. Or Hanukkah. Or Kwanzaa.
