This movie must have been seen when it was launched at the development stage and getting a Redgrave and a Jacobi on board must have thrilled the money men. All I can say is that they clearly had nothing in that week. Jacobi camps in the way that only Jacobi can do it and I thought it looked more like the actor who parodied his cameo role in Frasier a few years ago. Vinnie Jones is not exactly bad, he is clearly out of his depth as a leader. He is really very nice at all times and if this was a pilot for a television series, he may have been picked up. However, the work and work of the camera were frightening. It is never explained why this "jounalist" and a Met press officer will never work together. Certainly it could not have been for sexual chemistry, of which there is none. There is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and implausible plot that you can pass off as original, but everything is so well conceived that the two stories simply do not make sense at all. It was like two stories confusedly edited into one to make two hours. Go see some dry paint for a couple of hours. Your life will be fuller than seeing this garbage.
