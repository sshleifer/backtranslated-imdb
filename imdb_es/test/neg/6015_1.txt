What is the point? Has not this been done before, better? And again? Why is Werner Herzog losing his good talents and his time with trash like this? Should not I be filming a movie somewhere? I mean a real movie. <br /> <br /> Everything felt false from the beginning. Werner Herzog would never have tried to make a film about the Loch Ness myth, at least not on such a small scale surrounded by losers, so the plot was not credible from the start. The actors who are supposed to act as if they were not acting obviously acted. The story was not interesting, the requirements of "the common people" in each simulacrum were invisible, the personalities were past, the jokes were not funny, the effects were not convincing and the end was not in sight. <br /> <br /> I just do not see the point. It's a fake movie about a fake movie. Hah, hah. Maybe if those who thought of a movie like that tried to make one that made fun of people who were really looking for a real Nessie, now that could have had some potential. But Herzog is not a believer and never claimed to be one. A fake documentary about the crowd of cryptozoologists would have had much more fuel. <br /> <br /> It was a foul.
