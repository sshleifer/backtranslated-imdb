The discussion has been celebrated a thousand times. Is the "merchant of Venice" anti-semitic? (I think it is.) Is not it unfair to always point out this bit of anti-Semitism in a great work of art? (I think it is not.) Does this tarnish Shakespeare's reputation as the best dramatist in the world? (I think so.) Does he play a role if he did not do it for a particular racist purpose? (I think it's not like this). Michael Radford knew all this and for that reason he added to his film a prologue on the lamentable situation of the Jews in the Renaissance Venice. <br /> <br /> In vain; The work remains what it has always been and the new makeup only gives a first (but useless) hope that someone has dared to establish something that is a permanent outrage, not because their degree of anti-Semitism is particularly surprising, but because La work has the name of William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Why spend so much time portraying a man's hatred: Shylock? Why employ a great and serious actor like Al Pacino, if in the end everything is ruined in this scandalous scene (but hey, I'm not responsible for Shakespeare, I wrote it)? And now I would like to be very precise, like Shylock himself. <br /> <br /> You are demanding your right, in accordance with the contract that the (not very responsible) Christian Antonio, who always used to watch. Below him, signed with full awareness of the consequences. Of course, what Shylock demands is cruel and useless, but that is not the point. What we see (or should see) is a man who has been humiliated throughout his life, to the point where all that remains on him is his hatred. I think it's certainly a bit inappropriate to teach such a man about things like compassion. <br /> <br /> But what the play / movie (they are one and the same now) does at this point is ... Become a soap opera! The cruel madman with his knife, the audience horrified (but somewhat polite), the poor "victim" tied to his chair. It is true that Antonio accepts his destiny, but why can not he just say a word, "I'm sorry"? I do not think we need to lose many words about the ridiculous verdict of the young Dottore of Padua; It is a veritable "popular verdict" not very different from what would be seen 400 years later in the trials of the Nazis. From one minute to the next, this Jew is robbed of everything he possessed, condemned to be baptized as a Christian, and thrown out. <br /> <br /> Is not that outrageous? Obviously not. The story advances to the romantic complexities of the rings and their happy ending. <br /> <br /> What one can learn in the Jewish Museum of Libeskind in Berlin and in similar places around the world is that anti-Semitism often goes unnoticed by the mass. because what is so devastating for a minority or some individuals is embedded in the supposedly greater good for the majority. It should be exactly the task of each of us to develop a sensitivity to detect and unmask such tendencies. <br /> <br /> I do not accept the excuse that this movie was created to create empathy with the badly treated Shylock (it just does not work). I do not believe that anyone can be forced to be merciful. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie; particularly not for an Oscar.
