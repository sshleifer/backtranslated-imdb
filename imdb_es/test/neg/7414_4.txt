Bigfoot movies tend to be bad, so I do not feel inclined to watch them. However, there were some good announcements on The Sci-Fi Channel, so I decided to watch them. A climbing expedition goes to the Pacific Northwest to find a fallen plane carrying the daughter of the expedition leader (played by Lance Hendrickson), and has brought a revolutionary DNA detector that could be used to prove the existence of the sasquatch. And actually it generates something of suspense at the beginning. The sasquatch is not seen, but sees the heat of the mountaineers' body (like the alien in "Predator"), and I wondered when I was going to hit. The acting is passable, like the background music. The dense wooded location is well used. And when the creature is finally seen, the suit is not bad, but nothing great. But as the film progresses, it becomes more and more annoying and absurd. Most of the characters are unpleasant people, rude to each other and only in the expedition for money and publicity (except for the character of Lance Hendrickson), so it is impossible to worry about what happens to them. And his behavior becomes increasingly stupid. A man shoots the creature (not fatally), then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark. A camper puts on an elegant silk robe before getting into her sleeping bag, and then barely escapes and is dragged into the forest by the sasquatch, without getting her hair or makeup dirty. Then, the survivors conclude that the sasquatch is really after the DNA detection machine and will let them live if they leave it behind ("a creature knows what threatens it"). Obviously, the instinct does not apply to these actors, or they would not have appeared in this movie. And the ending is so stupid, you'll want to kick the TV screen. If it were not for the script, it would have been a decent horror movie.
