... Then, some people could argue that this can not be the worst movie ever made, and no, it is not. I have seen films with weaker plots, worse acting, etc. <br /> <br /> So, why do I hate this movie Ã¼ber alles? Well, basically it's about a man, who is kidnapped for many years, and when he goes out, he tries to find out who did it and why, to get revenge. The problem I have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror, but <br /> <br /> *** THE MAIN SPOILERS STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW *** <br /> <br / > our main character is basically tricked into having sex with his own daughter, and he wants to cut his own tongue so that his enemy does not tell him, because she did not know it. It is as humiliating as he crawls on his knees like a dog in total submission. And why did he deserve this? Because many years ago, he saw a brother and sister having a delicate moment, incorrectly. She continued and told some people, and as a result she commits suicide. And viola, it's the brother who put our main character through all this just for that. I have asked myself: Maybe I hate this movie so much because I think its punishment is too severe. Maybe because I feel that this movie does not condemn incest, but somehow it confuses it with love. Maybe it's because I expected something more. <br /> <br /> *** END OF THE SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Believe me, nobody deserves what happens to our main character at the end, and I'm very serious Do you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there? Well, I felt damn dirty after seeing this movie, and I REALLY wish I had never seen it. He stayed with me for days, and some might ask: well, is not that the purpose of a good movie? The ability to affect us in such a way? Yes, it may be, but this movie not only made me sick, it made me feel raped.
