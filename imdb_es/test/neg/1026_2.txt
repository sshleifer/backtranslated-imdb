Although there is very little plot and what exists is only improvisation, it was a good start for a new director without previous financial backing and also an intelligent move by Andy Warhol to make his film productions more commercial and easy to use. In any case, this story of a street con man is based too much on showing Joe no money (almost all the time!). And the creative use of a striking edition really disappears after the hundredth time and the cut of the dialogue becomes really annoying halfway. This would have been much more entertaining or even more dramatic if they had made a documentary from the newspaper of a real prostitute or swindler, instead of letting the actors invent a plot and a meaningless dialogue.
