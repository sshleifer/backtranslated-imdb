The 1935 version of "Enchanted April" manages to be simultaneously tedious <br /> <br /> and superficial. It is difficult to show the transforming magic of Italy rolling in a studio with a stereotyped Italian behavior to elaborate. The transformation of the four strangers fleeing London is instantaneous in the cut from the first day until a week later. Instead of developing, the script activates a switch and the characters <br /> <br /> are different. <br /> <br /> The spouses are bored enough in flashbacks without appearing, even if their presence does not propel the four women back to their shells and / or hostilities. <br /> <br /> Jessie Ralph has more fun (moves instead of completely chewing the landscape <br /> <br />) and Katharine Alexander has a poignant charm out of the shadow of her <br /> < br /> husband (and far from his horrible droning). Ann Harding is <br /> <br /> with nothing remarkable here (with the Production Code applied). She had an appropriate line <br /> <br /> in a previous movie (Pre-Code), "When Ladies Meet": "You do not have the value of one minute of an hour of anxiety worthwhile. she has given it to us, "but in" Abril Encantado "she can only seem hurt, running away and proclaiming fidelity to her wandering husband.
