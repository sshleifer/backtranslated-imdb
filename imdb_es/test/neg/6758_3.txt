The remains of an ambush Army unit are hooked with a group of cowboys to make their way through the Indians on the warpath. It seems that it could be an exciting western, but this one is boring, boring, boring. It moves like molasses, the action scenes are not inspired, the performance is pedestrian, the writing is flat, even the photography is not very good. Eastwood, in a very early role, plays a former Confederate who does not like the idea of ​​fighting on the same side as the Yankees. That is the only remotely interesting situation in the whole movie, but Eastwood did not have enough experience as an actor to achieve it, and his character appears as smug instead of angry or bitter. A very common western. Actually, a very ordinary western. It's worth checking out if you're a Eastwood fan and want to see him at the beginning of his career. Otherwise, do not bother.
