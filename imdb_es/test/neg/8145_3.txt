Two years after this short, the last short "Our Gang" was made. After seeing this, you wonder how it lasted much longer. The quality of "Our Gang" fell short after moving from Hal Roach to MGM, and this short is a perfect example. All the gags are very funny and the last line of Froggy is that this is the happiest day of his life, and it gives him a bad image of what he is for him the rest of the time. A very poor example of film making.
