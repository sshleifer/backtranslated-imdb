The movie "Chaos" takes its name from the scientific explanation of Gleick's 1988 chaos theory. What does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie "Chaos"? Nothing. The filmmakers seem to have flipped through the book (obviously without understanding anything) looking for a "theme" to join the series of mundane action sequences that cover the flimsy chain of events that acts instead of a plot in the film. In this sense, the movie "Choas" resembles the Canadian effort "Cube", in which the prime numbers function as a device to mystify the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot is not noticed: in "Cube" a lot of prime numbers are thrown so that viewers attribute their lack of understanding to the lack of knowledge about prime numbers: the same approach is taken in "Chaos": the disconnected extracts of Gleick's books are incorporated to make the actions of the bad boy in the movie seem devilishly intelligent. This, of course, is an insultingly condescending treatment of the audience, and any "chaos" viewer who can stand to sit through the whole movie will be disconcerted. How can you make such a bad movie? Rewritten as a novel, the story in "Chaos" probably would not even pass from the desk of the secretary of a literary agent. How could they have thrown away (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars in what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone, except for those who took money from the movie? With respect to what is in the film, all the performances are called by phone. Except for technical problems, it would be surprising if more than one shot was used for each scene. The story does not make sense: the last time I saw a story that was disconnected was the production of an eight-year-old boy. Among other massive deficiencies are the following: The bad boy leaves clues for the police to follow. He has no reason to leave such clues. Police officers do not carry or use radios. The bad boy elves have no reason to act in concert with the bad boy. Allow me to strongly recommend that no one see this movie. If there is another movie that you like (or just do not hate) look at that instead.
