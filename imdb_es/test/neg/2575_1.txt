Forget the fact that most people expect an action movie from Seagal. This movie simply did not have substance. Very long, stretched, and boring. The scenes were much longer than they had to be: the camera often focused on something for long periods of time when nothing happened. Cure for insomnia. The worst Seagal movie by far (I like some of his other movies). 1/10
