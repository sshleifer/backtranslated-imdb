... and in this series, I've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle. Remember my friend Marco, who has all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series, his one-sentence phrases put Mr. Freeze to shame. Remember our nemesis of the evil Visser three? He is a bald guy with crazy phrases. Do you remember Rachel, "Xena, the warrior princess," and Cassie, my sensitive and caring interest? They have been turned into meaningless bimbos by the 10 (!) Writers who decided that the original characters were not good enough for television. Remember the amazing extraterrestrial Ax, who was great, smart and really liked cinnamon buns? In this series is the Alien Token with an extremely annoying voice. Do you remember the ingenious jokes that our team had in the books? In this series, our dialogue is so sad and stupid that it is obvious that the writers were indulging in the lowest common denominator. <br /> <br /> So forget everything you thought you knew about the Animorphs! It was Cassie who became allergic to the transformation, not Rachel; thought and speech are supposed to echo, and Visser Three and Ax, rarely, if ever, appeared as Andalites (no, it has nothing to do with the budget!). <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy. And I'm not lying. The idiots are around us. And if you're not lucky, one of them could adapt one of your favorite books, or series, or graphic novels, into a really horrible TV show. They have warned you. <br /> <br /> "Finally ... it's worth watching TV." ~ (the very bald) Visser Three <br /> <br /> (r # 91)
