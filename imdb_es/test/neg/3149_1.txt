Barney is that idiotic dinosaur that (unfortunately) did not become extinct with the other dinosaurs many eons ago. Instead, he sings stupid songs and has a stupid moral about life that is 100% useless and / or extremely dangerous: that is "THE STRANGE ARE THEIR FRIENDS WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN YET!". The reason why I say it is evil? Well, on YouTube, there is a video of a Barney song about toy balls. When played backwards, it comes out as "WE ALL SEE YOU, HANG TO YOU! WE SHOULD SPEAK TO THE DEALERS!". You do not believe me. See for yourself! I also read in another review that they are now reading PC folklore and fairy tales. Now that's just stupid with a capital S! Seriously! Anyway, I do not recommend that your children see this filth, since it contains stupid morals, since strangers are your friends (as was said before), there is never a reason to be sad and if you are sad to eat junk food, be a individual is taboo, magic can solve all your problems and lots of other ridiculous crap.
