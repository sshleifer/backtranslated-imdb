Attention, possible spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it really becomes fun. The director has put in all the clichés that have always plagued the films of the series B. The stupid bimbo (good shelf) was caught again and again by the bad guys, the boss villain smiles and reveals his plans before they happen so that can be ruined and who, of course, intimidate / kill the hero's father in an uncertain past side kick in the person of a policeman: small, bald and whose only preparation for the last battle (another cliché) is to return the baseball cap with the edge back, etc. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie really exceeds it. After the villainous boss dies when the hero Paralised Stoneface Jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a ten-story tall building, they leave the building. Which, from the outside, is only three stories high and looks a lot like its regular town hall. <br /> <br /> When they leave the building, the side kick can not walk, as their right leg seems to be injured. How, no one can say it: ten minutes earlier, he fell on his shoulder and his feet were fine. There is no more detailed explanation for the inquisitive mind of the viewer who would be curious to know such trivial things as "Where is the body of the villain that should be near the building?" and "Why are not there policemen or curious people gathered around said body?" <br /> <br /> I could go on forever with the list. Why does another bad guy say he invented martial arts when he gets kicked in the ass right away? Why do bad guys generally make silly moves when they attack? Why does the hero look so dizzy? Is there anyone who really thinks "yes, these characters and this plot make this a movie to remember"? And the actors stink. Our hero and savior of the day carries the same expression on his face. The whole movie. That disgust, trying to be an arrogant smile must be a feat copyrighted by him. <br /> <br /> Also, to think that up to now 12% of the people who rated this movie gave me a 10 fills me with fear inside. They could have been serious and then we are condemned.
