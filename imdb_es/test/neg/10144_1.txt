This show is made for people with an IQ below 80. The jokes in the show are very bad. If you are on a deserted island and you have nothing to do, you will be better than seeing this garbage ... You will hate your accent, your behavior and all the jokes and stupid jokes that you try to make ... It really bothers me that the spectators have given to Reba 6.7 in his vote ... Of course he knew that there are some people with an IQ below 80, but what he did not know is that there are many of them. So, if you have to read this, I hope you never download or buy this tranquility ... I know it's not the place for him, but I want to recommend a much better miniseries 'Scrubs'
