I saw this movie in a Cinema-Club in Germany in 1970. Most of the attendees were from the local private school where I was teaching. I had seen a few Godard movies while living in France and, although they were not my favorites, I could at least understand them. Being able to speak French helped. <br /> <br /> The rather innocuous start of "Le week-end" soon became a kaleidoscope of images, very well, perhaps too well photographed, that soon did not make sense to me. For me, movies, like books, should have some clear meaning. This was not for me. I guess I'm not "in" the artistic films. The images still chase me from the movie. Today I refuse to eat rabbit meat, much loved by the French. Those who have seen the film could realize why. Yes, the issue of materialism arose, but cannibalism, car accidents and all the other scenes of destruction and horror only made me sick. I'm not sure if I came out before the end, but I certainly feel like it. I promised myself that I would never see another Godard movie, and I have not, never will. <br /> <br /> My rating: nothing. It was the most unpleasant movie I've seen. Others may have been more inept, stupid or stupid. I have forgotten those scenes while this will haunt me forever.
