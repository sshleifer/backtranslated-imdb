This is without doubt the most ill-conceived film in history. The gags of the invention of Carrot Top are some of the most terrible attempts to be funny in recorded history. I'm not familiar with your other job, but if it's half as bad as this, then I'm just going to cry. I give this movie 1 out of every 30 billion stars, and may God have mercy on the souls of those responsible.
