Pinocchio's revenge is not a good movie. It is not terrible either. <br /> <br /> The performance was made of wood at least by Pinocchio. The puppet had all 2 expressions. Like most actors, except for how strange it seems ... the supporting characters ... most of them were nice at the top. <br /> <br /> The special effects on this are quite "B" and, as I said before, the puppet really exploded. <br /> <br /> The 2 best scenes in the movie is the knife in the hand ... it looked pretty good, I think they spent about a third of the budget on that ... and the shower scene. .. WOW ... I think they should have spent the other 2/3 of the budget to talk to the actress who made that scene to do it. Outstanding. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a horror puppet movie "b" slightly below average ... rent to Chucky if you feel like watching the puppets kill. <br /> <br /> The story had some interesting ideas, enough for me to keep watching until the end.
