Brilliant performance, excellent plot, wonderful special effects! This is what I would say about this film if I had seen it with a bag of diarrhea on my head throughout the film. Instead, I endured a 2-hour crap-or-branch. Our "brilliant" story begins with some billions of people who have nothing better to do than look at the volcanoes in a vain attempt to find their lucky charms. Instead, find a 5'4 "man in a cheesy rubber dinosaur costume and a strange man from the cave. <br /> <br /> In his infinite wisdom, (along with his infinitely large nose) decide to go inside this volcano with a team of "special" people To travel to this underground land, are you going by plane? No. Boat? No. They use this giant soup can with a "solid metal" drill at the end I swear I saw it wobble In summary, this movie was more false than ... Oh, right! This was the most fake movie I've seen! For those of you who have not seen it and are thinking of sitting on a Sunday for the afternoon with this wonderful movie, I warn you! If you watch this movie, you must be prepared to eliminate any part of your manhood and give you a full frontal lobotomy. <br /> <br /> ECCCHHH !! The classification system only allows a minimum of 1/10, I give this a -10/10!
