Christopher Tookey, of the Daily Mail, had some things to say about this movie, including "watching her for 82 miserable minutes, and I guarantee she will shake her head and ask, 'Have we really come down to this?' Yes, we have , in case a film ever testifies to the absolute cynicism, the lack of flavor and the moral corruption of those who order and make British films, is this abomination. " Tookey continues "aiming directly at the holes with unwashed underwear, dirty minds and knuckles that rub the pavement when they walk, this sexual comedy is so sordid, graceless and smelly enough to get away from sex and, in fact, the cinema , for life ", before concluding" The sexual life of the men of the potato is not simply a truly vile film, it is a symptom of a new national culture of instant self-gratification, selfishness and sadism that is now celebrated in the screen". Normally, I do not listen to critics too closely, but in this case, Tookey went to hit the money. This film goes beyond the bad, in fact, it goes beyond being simply ungraceful and enters a strange parallel universe where each painful minute goes on for an hour and where the definition of "hilarious" seems to be "say twice with Brummie accent. " It's depressing for anyone with a half brain who grew up with Goodies, Monty Python, Spitting Image, Not the Nine O'Clock News and Fawlty Towers. <br /> <br /> Ideally, Sex Lives Of the Potato Men would have Disappeared silently after its premiere at the cinema and joined Vix's scum, The Fat Slags (2004), and the All Saints vehicle, bad quality, Honest (2000) in the celluloid cemetery, but as it seems destined to an endless night program. Screenings and "Best movie of all!" Compliments of people who should know better, so I must apologize in advance for trying to correct a mistake that the British film industry, with all its wisdom, has inflicted on a world that does not deserve it. Yes, I really regret having come back from the celluloid, but I really remember thinking "It can not be as bad as the critics said" ... but, as God is my witness, it was WORSE. <br /> <br /> Acting: serious from the beginning to the end, special mention to Mackenzie 'Albert Steptoe about the body of a young man' Crook. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack: cut and paste 'ladrock', mostly, ska-pub-friendly from the pub jukebox, which brought back horrible memories of having seen the cheerful cockernee doing the Lambeth Walk to a watery imitation of the knobs of Specials Shiners Madness in every comedy / variety show in the eighties ... and Motorhead's 'Ace Of Spades' as the musical title? What the hell ... trying to evoke memories of one of the most genuinely exciting scenes ever offered by The Young Ones, in fact, once offered by ANY comedy show ?! Cheap shot, well below the belt. <br /> <br /> Script: written by a 12-year-old boy who has just read all the previous issues of Smut and Zit in a long session of Red Bull ... SAFE? Come on, can not any real, proper, mundane and adult person put this kind of nonsense on paper? And Mark Gatiss was in it ... Mark Gatiss ... the least annoying member of the League of Knights and Sweaters fans involved in such a large pile of flying movie excrement? 'One of the brightest British comedy stars'? It is not anymore! On the subject of League Of Gentlemen, someone gave me a pair of lead-lined diver's boots and the 'Steve's face as a straight collapsed' and a long weekend in a soundproof room before he died ... PLEASE. .. <br /> <br /> The cinema, British or otherwise, is not much worse than this. The Headless Eyes (1971) by Kent Bateman is a new wave masterpiece compared to this disgusting aunt.
