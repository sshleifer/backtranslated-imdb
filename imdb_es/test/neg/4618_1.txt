** Some slight spoilers could be considered, but no more than in the revision of this film by any other person. ** <br /> <br /> I knew that nothing could live up to the absolute brightness of the original "Carrie". that it was more a movie about social criticism than about setting the gym on fire. Carrie White was the "victim" personified, and her story conveyed the impotence that the real exploited must feel. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has conceived the character of "Rachel" for "The Rage" must have completely missed the subtleties of "Carrie." For the audience to genuinely share the victim's anger, it must be a character sympathetic, a true outcast who is more a victim of circumstances than of his own vices. Rachel is too disgusting to convey any kind of emotional depth and connection to "Carrie" by Sissy Spacek. And it looks and acts as if it were next to the "attractive and popular brigade" that ends up burning. She, like the rest of them, has such a corrupt soul, while Carrie was completely innocent. <br /> <br /> It just does not work. There is no satisfaction in seeing beautiful children, not even the "Home Improvement" boy, in the climactic scene of this film. And it's so unnecessarily bloody! No real bloodshed was seen in the burning gym! <br /> <br /> And there is one person in particular that this film should NOT have had the audacity to kill ... but I will not say who it is. If you have seen the original "Carrie", it is the type of character that dies unjustly. <br /> <br /> At least, they did create the connection with Carrie appropriately; It explains how it should have been. But that, and the tattoo on the arm, which was done quite well, is almost the only thing that this movie has in its favor. <br /> <br /> Another disgusting imitation of "Scream", and tarnish the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. I did not expect much, but I was still terribly disappointed. An unfriendly character, a series of irritating references to pop culture introduced for no good reason, and a final scene that pales in comparison to the commotion of "Carrie's" tomb.
