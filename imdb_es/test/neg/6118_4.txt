1993 was a time of change in the WWE, but for this Wrestlemania they decided to delay the clock when Hulk Hogan returned, along with his good friend Brutus Beefcake, who had been out of the fight since a paragliding accident in 1990. <br /> <br /> This was not a great event. Only two games had a real construction and everything went as hurry. The action in the ring was not very good and the turn at the end, which I will discuss later, was not really the most devastating moment WWE expected it to be. <br /> <br /> This unforgettable night began with Shawn Micheals defending his Intercontinental Championship against undefeated Tatanka. Tatanka had defeated Michaels a couple of times before the fight. Michaels had a new manager, Luna Vachon, while Tatanka was joined by former manager Michaels and future WWE Hall of Famer Sherri Martel. Tatanka won by DQ. Michaels retained his title and returned directly to his enmity with Marty Janetty, who had been put on hold only by Wrestlemania. I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Next, the Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick) defeated the Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) with Scott scoring the pin after hitting Samu with the Frankensteiner. Good match. <br /> <br /> Doink the clown needed the help of another clown to win his match against Crush. A second Doink distracted Crush when he was in complete control and allowed Doink to get the pin and victory. Doink was an entertaining trick character, who grew pretty fast. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon easily defeated the return of Bob Backlund in the next game. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the first in our Double main event. While the Mega Maniacs team of Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake, with the good boy and newly converted Jimmy Hart in their corner, they faced the old friends of Hart Money Inc (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster). This was a pretty vague ending. Beefcake, as mentioned, had been in a paragliding accident that required full facial surgery and had fought the fight with a facial mask. Shyster tore off the mask and hit Beefcake with a pulp. When the referee fell, Hogan grabbed the mask and eliminated DiBIase, Shyster and then Hart, who was wearing a referee shirt, he counted all three. Another arbitrator came down and reversed the decision, declaring the winners of Money Inc for DQ. <br /> <br /> Next, Lex Luger or the Narcissist, as he was also known at the time he defeated Mr. Perfect. This game came about because Luger was being run by Perfect's former manager, Bobby Heenan. Perfect was with his feet on the ropes when he was caught, but the referee lost it. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker got a mediocre victory at DQ in a pretty poor match against the Giant Gonzales. Undertaker had earned the ire of Gonzales' manager, Harvey Wippleman in 1992 and Taker had defeated his great monster Kamala in Survivor Series. Wippleman swore revenge and took it at the Royal Rumble when Gonzales attacked Taker, which cost him the game. Gonzales dominated Undertaker in this game, but received a DQ for hanging Taker with chloroform. Strange final for a bad game. <br /> <br /> This took us to our main event, as WWE Champion Bret Hart, seriously challenged as champion for the first time, put his title on the line against the unstoppable monster Yokozuna of Mr. Fuji. Yokozuna controlled the early start, but Hart resisted and then took control. He had Yokozuna on the shooter, he would surely surrender and Hart would establish himself as a heroic hero after eliminating the great monster. But Fuji had other ideas, throwing salt into Hart's face, leaving the Canadian defenseless when Yokozuna received the pin. <br /> <br /> What a sad ending. But wait here comes Hulk Hogan. He's checking Hart to make sure he's okay. Suddenly, Fuji challenges Hogan to a WWE title at that very moment. Hogan accepts. Fuji throws salt towards Hogan, but hits Yokozuna instead. Hogan hits the leg fall and wins the match and the title. What did I just watch? And so, what most fans thought would be the night we saw Hart establish himself as a giant killer, or Yokozuna to establish himself as an unstoppable monster, instead, we saw Hulk Hogan win a senseless title. A title that I would not defend for three months. In fact, this was the only game that Hogan fought for the WWE before the PPV of the King of the Ring in June 1993.
