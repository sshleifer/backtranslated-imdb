This is close to the worst movie I've seen in my life. The writer initiates you in a way that you will align with Jasper (Josh Hartnett). When he did absolutely nothing wrong, Sam (Leelee Sobiesky) leaves him for Kelley (Chris Klein), in a way that leaves you angry with Sam. You are not told what she feels, so her feelings with Kelley are not real to you and their relationship is false. It drags you in any direction, and it becomes quite exhausting and annoying. The only good thing about this movie that I saw was the cast. <br /> <br />
