This movie is just horrible, the movie lasted only an hour and for about 25 minutes of the movie alone were useless random snowboard clips that do not even connect to the movie. The story is completely "rebooted," my 5-year-old cousin could probably write a better script. I do not understand how anyone could finance the production of a movie like this ... horrible. This is definitely the most horrible and horrible movie I've seen in all my existence. I think the casting director has just taken some children out of the street to act in this movie. The direction, acting, production and writing of this film are very bad. I feel bad for the people who wasted money financing this garbage. You could not pay me to see this shit again.
