I saw the beginning twice, I could not understand it, and the whole movie bothered me. <br /> <br /> So, solve this with me: Wayne (the GOOD guy) gets on the stagecoach, disarms. the drivers (!), steal the money (?!) and take off. <br /> <br /> Disarmed, one driver is killed and the other injured by the bad guys. Thanks to Wayne, who disarmed them and then saw how it happened. <br /> <br /> Then Wayne drops the money on the ground, rescues the girl, travels to the city, laughs with Yak (pity for the dead) boy, I suppose) ... and then says that " He found "the money in the scene. And everyone agrees with that. <br /> <br /> And he's the good guy? And I'm pretty sure there were no small hand-held flashlights at that time. And Bell made his first telephone demonstration in 1876 ... were they home then? Am I thinking too much about this? Normally, I'm happy to suspend the trial to enjoy a movie, but this bothered me. And that's a sign that the move did not work for me.
