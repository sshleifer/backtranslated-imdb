I do not see what the total deal of this movie is. Patricia Kaas sings, yes, and that makes the movie lovely, but singing is not enough. I mean, if you want to get all the benefits of this, go buy Patricia's CD and enjoy! The plot is simple (if you omit the "dreams"); The main characters seem to love each other instantaneously, and they also instantly forget about their other acquaintances. Relationships seem almost "obligatory," and the little "detective story" introduced only makes things worse. What at first seemed to be a perfect movie ending, first gets ruined and then reveals itself as a dream. I measure the films for how well I would remember them, and for this, I began to forget the details.
