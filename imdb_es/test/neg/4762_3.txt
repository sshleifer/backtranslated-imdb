If you suffer from insomnia, Radiant would be the best way to send you to a coma of 7 years. The movie is so absurd and so mundane that it's hard to imagine that director Steve Mahone can overlook such an obvious truism. <br /> <br /> The story has an exiled Doctor (whom we never see) who moves to the desert to create a vaccine that will cure all diseases by filling the hosts with antibodies that can fight off any infection (yes, like that episode of Futurama). Vaccines do not work and human guinea pigs are infected with a virus that kills in 48 hours. <br /> <br /> Not wanting to be caught by the masked government individuals, the group goes to the desert to protect themselves. Waiting for the sun to kill the virus. All this is narrated by Michael, the only one of the quartet immune to infection. And it's the most boring story of all. They could have chosen someone with an interesting voice, but instead we have someone with less vocal personality than Clive Owen. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, the publisher insists on cutting more than half of the film, giving it a strange touch dreamlike sensation and increasing the desire to sleep. It's no wonder that half the audience came out of this, I was not one of them for some reason. But I should have done it. <br /> <br /> The end is supposed to be shocking, intelligent and premonitory. But it is simple and simply not. A relief, yes, but not dramatic in the least. <br /> <br /> The low price of this production and the drowned sound that makes much of the dialogue unintelligible, what could have been an interesting science fiction story if there were Better actors, colder places and a sense of urgency. As it is, Radiant is a snoozefest.
