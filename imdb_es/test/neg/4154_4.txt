An epic story of hope limited by budget and limited artistic ambition. Seeing that Terrence Malick produced this, I expected something disturbing and lyrical. Instead, we get a typical Norwegian co-production ("Revolution" with Al Pacino, anyone?), Where, quite possibly, good intentions are frustrated by a terrible script, and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes . Is the dialogue in English "me-Tarzan-you-Jane" among the protagonists who do not speak English particularly clear? One could speculate if Nick Nolte and Tim Roth appropriated theirs, since they almost look like real people. The story is loaded with implausibility: we are expected to believe that Binh can speak a little English after having spent his whole life living as a peasant slave (his vocabulary, but unfortunately it is not a grammatical command, increases in an impressive way in the field of refugees from Malaya, without The benefit of night classes). The coincidence abounds; I wonder if one or two hours have been published since the first third: he traces his mother in Ho Chi Minh City almost immediately, after colliding with his younger brother of thirty years, who recognizes him blithely! Mom gives him a gold medallion (or something similar of great value) as part, but this is never mentioned again. It is assumed that his relationship with "Me Dead Inside" Ling provides the obligatory "love interest", but it feels as artificial as Leonardo and Cameron in "Gangs Of New York". <br /> <br /> The trip in a ship's oxide bucket conveys a sense of the terrible conditions that human trafficking brings. In fact, the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable, is the manual and abrupt filming taken from the bridge during hectic weather conditions. (By the way, a boat cruise from Malaysia to New York through the Cape of Good Hope and the African coast, without stopping for fuel or supplies, is undoubtedly an epic journey). The beautiful picture of the New York skyline echoes Malick's use of magic hour, but I want to know why the Coast Guard did not show up. Maybe they were watching the Super Bowl, or something like that. Of course, Binh manages to locate his old blind father on a remote farm in Texas, with the same style of navigation he showed in the city of Ho Chi Minh. I was impressed how Nick Nolte could roam the excavation fields and feed the horses on a large ranch without the help of a guide dog or a white stick. For a demonstration of how you could structure a story about the tribulations of the refugees and shoot them with a small budget, see the much higher "In This World" by Michael Winterbottom.
