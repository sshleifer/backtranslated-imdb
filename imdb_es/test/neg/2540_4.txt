This film was different from most Jimmy Cangey films of the 1930s in that it was NOT made by Warner Brothers / First National, but was lent to a smaller studio. Because it was a "row of poverty" study, the production values ​​are lower than what you might be used to seeing with Cagney movies. In addition, the plot is without doubt one of the strangest I've seen. Instead of being a gangster, he was a good guy in this case, fighting for the law. This is not so unusual because Cagney frequently played men of the law, like an OSS leader (the CIA ancestor) of an FBI agent. BUT, making him an investigator for the Bureau of Weights and Measures was really strange, especially because, at times, he acted in the same way he did in the movie G-MEN. <br /> <br /> In short, a time passer and that's it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the videotape I saw on Memory Lane Video was perhaps one of the poorest I have ever encountered. The sound was terrible and harsh and the impression looked very white and had many movies and gaps.
