Algiers is not a classic, it is a perversion of the wonderful and original Pepe le Moko, directed by Duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming Pepe, Jean Gabin. If you want to fully experience the Casbah and the characters of Algiers, I recommend you not even see this movie and see Pepe le Moko, since it is much more elaborate, it is more beautifully filmed, the lines are not clich√© and the characters adhere much more to reality. In addition, the ending is so dramatic and key to Pepe's character that he will find the version of Algiers intolerable. Although Algeria does an almost excellent job imitating each scene, the performance falls short as does the credibility of the characters. In addition, the costumes are really impressive in all the scenes, especially those of Pepe in the last scene and those of Gaby (at all times), but also when he is on the ship. Frankly, Algeria is cheap in terms of imitations.
