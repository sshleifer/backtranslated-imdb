I watched this movie shortly after watching Moonlight & Valentino with Elizabeth Perkins, Gwyneth Platrow, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner. There are many similarities between the two films. Both have great deals and good performance. Both have common characters of sisters who are very different, an offensive stepmother, a friend / confidant woman, an emotionally unavailable father, a dead mother and a surprise lover. Both films make the characters experience transformations that change their lives and both films suffer from a kind of sentimentality "love conquers everything". Both add a bit of excitement with Cameron Diaz in black underwear and a partial back photo of Gwyneth Paltrow nude. <br /> <br /> Both films seem designed, as if the writers of the works on which they are based were based on market studies and said: "Ok, there is a market for stories about relationships between women, so I'm going to write about two sisters with an offensive stepmother. " In other words, instead of the drama that arises from the truth of the relationship, the relationship is invented to adapt to the dramatic situation. It seems forced, the characters do not seem real, the relationships are incredible. <br /> <br /> The resolution of the tensions between the characters is simplistic, with simple apologies that remove years of acrimony, leaving everyone feeling warm and confused. forever. It just is not real. Romantic fantasy <br /> <br /> The characters in In Her Shoes are a little more exaggerated than Moonlight & Valentino, especially the stepmother part. Sydelle Feller is so evil that it's hard to believe that the father stays with her, or even marries her in the first place. <br /> <br /> If you liked Moonlight & Valentino, you will probably like In Her Shoes as well. Pleasant performances in both, in fact, the actors bring depth to their parts that goes beyond the artificial sentimentality of the scripts.
