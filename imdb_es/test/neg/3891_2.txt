Lovely music Beautiful photography, some of the scenes are shocking and shocking. But the dramatic tension is lost in a film that is so badly edited that it is difficult to know exactly what is happening. Sometimes, the dialogue is incomprehensible. Then there's Richard Gere. He is supposed to be a factory worker who gets into trouble and gets a job on a farm. We see dozens of peasants sweating and dirty in the sun. Then we see Gere, looking like he walked away from a Calvin Klein ad. Sam Shepard, another type of glamor, is supposed to have a terminal illness. But it looks great. Good try, but it just does not work. Brook Adams tries hard, but she gets lost on stage. The real star is the girl.
