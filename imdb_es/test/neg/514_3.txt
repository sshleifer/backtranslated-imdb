Pun intended This low-budget horror / action vehicle for Don Wilson's ability to kick things is the subject of the direct rate to the video. <br /> <br /> The plot: Wilson is a vampire hunter without humor that is under fire from the locals. Law enforcement after that is forced to kill creatures of the night in view of the public. The police chase him, the vampires chase him, he responds kicking ... a lot. <br /> <br /> There's a little more in the story, but it's so inconsequential that I can not honestly remember it; I think people really spoke in the movie, but that's a matter of debate. The plot is nothing more than a configuration for Wilson to kill as many vampires as possible at runtime, usually by kicking them. <br /> <br /> The technical specifications are, in a word, anemic. Treatment of little color, amateur use of lighting, simplistic use of the camera and angle. Blood and blood are markedly limited, which is strange for this type of film. The most damaging of the shooting fallacies is the jarring change to a super-unstable camera during each scene of the fight. If the camera starts to bounce like a Reese monkey in speed, then you know that Don is about to start kicking everything in sight. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the kind of bad movie that can be made. Good with some friends and a lot of cynical humor. Otherwise, do not look, unless you really like to see how things kick. <br /> <br /> 3/10
