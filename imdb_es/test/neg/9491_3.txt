I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where the scenes of the film were filmed. It is really beautiful and recalls the architecture of the 20s and 30s, like the Hotel Del Coronado. I know I was in Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and I would like to know if it still exists. As for the film itself, it's really surprising that Jane Wyman has been nominated for an Academy Award. This must have been a period in which her colleagues in the Academy loved her a lot. It would have been really interesting to get a real impression of Wyman and the other actors in this movie regarding the script. The script of this film, like Kevin Costner's recent film with a message in a bottle, is so incredible that it limits the credibility that actors can bring to their parts. Rock Hudson can be forgiven. He was never a great actor, he was able to cope mainly with his appearance and did not obtain credible roles until later in his career (the only exception is Pretty Maids). But Wyman must have been forced to take this film through contractual requirements or the study system.
