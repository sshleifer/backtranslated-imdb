Companions noir devotees, do not be fooled, this is a bad smell ... badly filmed, badly acted and there's nothing ... here for the moviegoer looking for another solid B film from the gold mine of the 40s and 50 of the classics. I tried it based on the relatively high rating in IMDb. The likes are not taken into account, but I did not find anything in this movie to recommend to other IMDb members. This is a classic example of having seen a movie and feeling that you have been deceived by the amount of minutes it took for the film to come to your grateful death. Having Alan Ladd on the cover of the DVD / tape is almost a fraud, is in the camera less than two minutes and has almost no dialogue. This is not the people from This Gun For HIre ... it's a classic in the bad sense of studios that work without forage without a budget ... We all look for the best ... save time at Gangs, Inc. / Paper Bullets. .. That's wrong!
