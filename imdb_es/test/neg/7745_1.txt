In 1990 I saw Kathy Ireland in person; I was at the UNT in Denton during the filming of "Roughness Needed." Oddly enough, the voice you are using in this movie is not too far from your real voice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot is this: Kathy receives a letter telling her that her father has fallen into a bottomless pit in Africa. She goes and investigates the place of her father's death, only to be absorbed by an underground world that is partly a dystopian nightmare, partly an uninspiring fantasy, and inhabited by rejections from the Plasmatics. This film really wastes the talent of Linda Kerridge, who, in my opinion, could have been someone if she had obtained the great role that was right for her. Anyway, the main hero of the story, Gus, is a scam Mark "Jacko" Jackson, swindler. To begin with, the original is annoying enough, but this guy really is torture. Finally, the nebbish Wanda comes out of her shell and ends up wearing a bikini top and a pareo at the end. If you are going to have Kathy Ireland in a movie with little clothes, it will be better to be a bikini. Anyway, the movie was bad in all aspects and was skewered by MST3K. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if possible.
