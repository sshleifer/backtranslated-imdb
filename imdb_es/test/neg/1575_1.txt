Lower the film and back slowly. The performance rivals a secondary work, the plot is deteriorated and the production values ​​are slightly higher than the community theater. The fools are so abundant that they become more smiling. The rooms are changed, the dead are moved, the dogs are used for the wolves, the men shoot themselves in white with .45 caliber pistols, they can walk and ride in snowmobiles, with the button of the blouses and unbutton without touching the man ... this is a movie baaaaaaaaaddddddd. I almost fainted when I saw the average rating. On tastes there is no writing. By the way, there is no nudity.
