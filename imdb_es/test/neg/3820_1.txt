This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years. The plot has a potential that is never realized. The actors are a bad choice, but considering the writing of the screen, their talent is not wasted. I really wanted everyone to die as quickly as possible so I could go out and see something else. Unfortunately, I stayed until the end and laughed at the murmurs of people who complained about how horrible this was. There were no boos, after all, this is England, just soft moans about how much shit that was. Then, I look at IMDb and I see that 288 people have given it 10 out of 10. I really can not see how those people can give that score. They must be a public relations company working with the distributor. There is a hilarious problem towards the end of the film, when in the cemetery and Hick's attacks, observe the unreliable landscape that is seen when it is played (it is supposed to be a brick wall). As everyone is making a parody of horror except the Director.
