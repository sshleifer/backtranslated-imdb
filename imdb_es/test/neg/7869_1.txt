Dear film director: <br /> <br /> In the future, when you try to create a sense of urgency, it might be better for your hero * to run * instead of jogging / mixing. Especially if you're trying to reinforce a timeline. For example, if you're trying to convince the audience that the bad guy will actually kill the hostage if the hero does not find it, it's probably a good idea to convey the feeling that your hero believes it really can happen ... Let's face it though. Making a good movie obviously was not your goal. Your goal was to pump some trash that would generate more money than it would cost. Otherwise, you could have hired some actors. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Bored Viewer. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I can not say it's the worst, because I could finish it. It was bad, bad, bad though. Friend, where is my refund?
