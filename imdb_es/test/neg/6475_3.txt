Chris Ricci walks quietly through most of this, but then quickly acquires an air of boredom and disdain, as I did when I saw him. Without it, this would be nothing more than a movie for cheap children, but at least it adds an air of quality. There are few young actresses, if any, more striking and more charismatic in the business. <br /> <br /> There's not much of a problem with that as long as you accept it for what it is: a cheap Disney remake aimed at very undemanding kids. I could see Ricci all day, so I probably forget many of the shortcomings of the movie, but unless you're also a Ricci fan, a cat lover or a very young child, I doubt you'll find this very entertaining.
