The concept is excellent. The execution typifies the overall quality of the ABC network. <br /> <br /> Besides Peter Jones, it seems that the rest of the panel is composed of marketing executives. In place of true entrepreneurs. <br /> <br /> When I realized that Peter Jones was joining Simon Cowell, my initial thoughts were: wow, he is going to take the United States to the balls. But it seems that ABC has arrived and destroyed the concept. <br /> <br /> I was an absolute addict to the Dragons Den in the UK and was interested in seeing that Peter Jones had manipulated the concept that originated in Japan and developed his own show for the states. The result is neither inspiring nor informative. <br /> <br /> If you lack drama in your life, now you have a choice? Jerry Springer or the American inventor To summarize: a troubled musician who sells to a media mogul. <br /> <br /> Idea: Grab me! And I will produce a show worthy of the title.
