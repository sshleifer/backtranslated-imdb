Forget any documentary full of anguish! This movie is really a comedy about a 40-year-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing scrap-circuit party songs. The only problem? Colton Ford can not sing! And the movie cuts off when it seems ready to explode into a song. However, Ford and his equally insipid boyfriend, Blake Harper, complain and run in their tank tops, determined to make dreams come true. Even more funny is the "manager" Kyle who seems to have the I.Q. of a turnip and whose lips injected with collagen look like a bee that stung him. How can adult men be so self-delirious? Bwa ha ha! As for the documentary, the filmmakers do not seem to have any point of view and the film is poorly structured and extremely uneven. Very little background information is provided about the three drivers. Such an inclusion could have made all three seem like more than old West Hollywood stereotypes.
