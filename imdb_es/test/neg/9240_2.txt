I just saw this yesterday and wanted to read the scathing comments of other people, but I found some high marks. <br /> <br /> WHAT? This was probably the worst Asian horror movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * There were so many fundamental problems with the story. Many Asian spirits have the touch of spirits that try to help, but that only give fear (with notable exceptions: ringu and Ju-on). This is the case here, except that they are not scary. A pretty Asian woman who looks a little pale is not scary at all. The character of the "monk" explains everything as a perfectly natural life cycle; No fear there either. But the woman just does not understand it, would prefer to kill herself and her baby and let this poor ghost reincarnate. My friend and I were just laughing when she jumped from the building twice and the ghost waits until after the second time to tell her why he has been following her. That information would have been nice to know before she started jumping, but whatever. <br /> <br /> * That said, I liked a couple of parts right in the middle. First, take a taxi with a ghost (do the ghosts travel in a taxi?) That has a lot of extra hair, which is inexplicably creepy. Right after that, at the bus stop, you should see it as it is quite messy. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is a total bomb, I gave it an additional point just for those two scenes above. This is an Asian horror of poor quality that makes the ghosts that fly in the womb of women are almost beautiful while trying to scare you with the same images.
