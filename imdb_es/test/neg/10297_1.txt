This must be the worst thriller I've seen in a long time. The direction, acting and adaptation of the story leave what could probably have been a good plot in a waste of time without meaning. A few minutes after watching the movie, it was easy to discover the whole plot and then, from the beginning, there are more obvious clues that leave no mystery. I guessed this in the first few minutes and kept hoping that I was wrong and, to my dismay, no. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with two FBI agents driving to a remote city to investigate a killer. Party that has left three witnesses, a young woman, a drug addict and a policeman. They are interviewed separately under surveillance cameras and each one counts their day account. Everyone has something to hide about themselves and the day unfolds as they count their accounts. This part is probably the saving grace and if it had developed it could have improved this movie. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The whole story ends in that the FBI agents are the real murderers and the young lady is the only one who has thought this and so they have not been hurt by them. <br /> <br /> Why do you go through the whole charade of interviewing three witnesses and relating to the young woman if your idea was to kill them in the first place? How did they get away with pretending to be FBI agents (when you discover that the real FBI agents were killed and their badges were found on them)? How did they know how to install and use the surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so unconvincing from start to finish. Maybe the idea is to develop your characters for revelation at the end. Come on, they both look ridiculous, stupid and not sinister in the least. The character of the young woman is also potential wasted. Her actions have no meaning and neither does it make any sense with whom she prefers to bond in her ordeal. She does not seem distressed, but rather detached, which is also not explained <br /> <br /> Horrible movie in general.
