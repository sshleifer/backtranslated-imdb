A young man, named Danny, has run away from home and meets a bum, called Bix, who agrees to accompany Danny and take care of him ... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie, a shy and naive girl who works in her father's dining room. Bix begins to see Carrie, but plans to leave soon (because he's a bum, you see? It's not good! Do you understand?). Meanwhile, the city crawls, Jesse (played by a perfectly melted Jack Elam), still appearing in the restaurant and bothering Carrie. Danny inadvertently picks up the whores from left to right (because he's loaded with money, he has almost a hundred dollars!) Whom Bix has to constantly chase away (there are many ambiguous nuances between Danny and Bix in this movie). Finally, Bix and Danny decide to leave the city, but problems are brewing due to Jesse the creep. <br /> <br /> My review of the film itself: a terrible and dated "Youth in Trouble" movie of the 50s. <br /> <br /> My review of the MST3K version of the movie: I have to say that this is one of the best episodes of MST3K. The riffing is dead, all the time. Except for the somewhat depressing ending, this film is an easy material for Joel and the Bots, especially the constant problems with which Bix has to rescue him. The host segments are also quite good, especially the segment with 'Train Song'. Hopefully, Rhino launches this episode to a home video one day.
