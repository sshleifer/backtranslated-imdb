I'm not too old to remember that I laughed at Bobcat Goldthwait a couple of times. But in some of his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor and brain cells. <br /> <br /> From the moment this movie opens, you can not have any compassion or empathy for the female protagonist. Nor will you find anything remotely fun after listening to the opening line. Goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade himself to feel better, even if it is his own imaginary characters who degrade. <br /> <br /> If you ever saw Shakes the Clown, you know how little fun Bobcat was 15 years ago ... this movie is worse. It was not even funny by accident. It's sad, pathetic and a total waste of time. Goldthwaits hands may be paralyzed so he can not write another script. Stick out your tongue so you can not dictate another scene without grace. It is sad and pathetic and needs to leave room for a new talent to die to enter Hollywood.
