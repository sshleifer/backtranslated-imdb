While it is one of the two films of Tales of Voodoo Volume 1, it does not contain voodoo or anything supernatural! The box labels it as "Hell Hole" but the title of the screen is Escape from Hell Hole. The title is confusingly similar to Hell Hole's (1978), also known as "Escape from Women's Hell Hole." A group of women bathes in a river and, apparently, the worst thing they have to worry about is a furtively looking tom, whom they easily overcome. However, there are no nudes in this or any other scene. <br /> <br /> A woman named Cardena drives in a car and seems to be known and loved by all women. She invites Indri to come and live in the city with her and her uncle M.G. Once they get there, it is clear that M.G. He wants to take Indri's virginity. M.G. he runs some kind of a prostitution house, and either he is in charge of a corrupt branch of the army, or he runs a paramilitary group, or he prefers his guards to wear military-style uniforms. <br /> <br /> Women who reject it or otherwise cause problems to be imprisoned. Indri is sent there. The women are tortured and, on occasion, raped by the guards. <br /> <br /> Several failed escape or rescue attempts are made, but they inevitably fail despite the obvious advantages women have: they outnumber guards, and relatively few Guards have automatic weapons, most of them they have rifles or semiautomatic pistols. <br /> <br /> Enthusiasts of the WIP genre may like it, and the fact that it was made in the Philippines gives it something new, but otherwise .... Hey.
