Although it is better than most movies made for television, "Buried Alive" is nothing more than a tale of revenge. There are so many holes in the plot in this, that it makes you wonder why the writers did not go through a series of rewrites. The end has a good turn, but it is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> The performance of Jennifer Jason Leigh is fantastic, as always, but Tim Matheson is cheated with simple phrases that remind Jack. Nicholson in "The Shining." Do not bother with this.
