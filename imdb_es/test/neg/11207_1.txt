What crack are you smoking? This movie, although gloriously entertaining, is horrible! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are so obviously false that it's a bit sad. The colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. The ninja training camp is so fun that it's almost not worth mentioning. And when Joe puts the bucket on his head and hits the other guy in the army, I just piss. I could go on ... <br /> <br /> Entertaining, you could say yes. Well, not well done, certainly not. <br /> <br /> As a commentary on America as an empire, it is actually quite good. Joe, as a typical white conqueror, is not so surprising, especially in the context of American cinema in the mid-eighties.
