I love a good western movie, but this was more like watching a play on stage or an act at the local street carnival show. I could only hold 38 minutes hoping it would improve, but it got worse and I had to finish it. Each actor (s) declared the lines as if they read directly from the script or reference cards. There was too much predictability for lines and actions, not as if it were a natural event or a conversation. Rachel Kimsey's wig was obvious. Actresses who play Native American sisters might have played non-native parts and should have. The costumes for the Native Americans could have been better and a little more authentic. If I decide to see him with a friend in the future, I will do it, not with the expectation of seeing a good western, but with the expectation of seeing an amateur comedy production.
