Once I was a big fan of Olsen. I received this movie when I was six years old and I saw it almost non-stop until I was nine. Then it was on my shelf accumulating dust until yesterday. I'm speechless. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two twelve-year-olds who are sent to spend the spring break in Paris with their grandfather ambassador. Along the way, you will find, as you would expect, two cute French guys who show them the funniest side of Paris. I guess the two boys were fine, with fake French accents on one side. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable and the humor is superficial and corny. Mary-Kate and Ashley play two shallow girls with too much makeup on their faces. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you do not like Olsen twins or family movies.
