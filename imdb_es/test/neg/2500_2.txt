It's strange, while the movie features X-rated sex scenes and violent murders, it never feels as shocking as it should be. <br /> <br /> A group of scientists goes to an island in the Caribbean to investigate a radioactive. incident. Upon arrival, a mutated islander deals with the happy task of murdering men and having his way with women. Does not it seem like it always works that way? <br /> <br /> Among the most sordid acts we find some lesbian encounters, three ways with male prostitutes, a variety of heterosexual couples and the rape of a body already dead. . Although everything is totally explicit, it never manages to shake or shake as is supposed. As soon as sex becomes completely pornographic, it loses its advantage; the suspension of disbelief is broken and we realize that we are only seeing people who have sex. <br /> <br /> There is some blood and blood in the murders, but since this is a D'amato movie, it is really docile. For a much more complete experience, see the similar 'Erotic Nights of the Living Dead'. <br /> <br /> 2/10
