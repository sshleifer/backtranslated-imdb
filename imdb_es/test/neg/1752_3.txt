Some movies are not for everyone. This accurately describes the film by Igmar Bergaman, Skammen (Shame). With only 18 years, I still have what I guess you could call a minor form of ADD and well, I watch movies to entertain me. The shame was a film with a very interesting premise, trying to convey the effect of war on ordinary people, however, failed to achieve this for me. I do not know if it was the subtitles, the black and white filming, the duration of the film or the fact that it took me two hours to study for a huge chemistry exam, but I did not enjoy it. I understand that it is considered a great movie and very important in the history of cinema, however, I think that as my teacher pointed out, not everyone has liked or liked them. I guess I just wish he finished all his many side plots. Maybe the translation lost something, but I felt that there were countless shots that never came to a conclusion. You would meet with characters and you would never see them again, or you would really understand why they were included in the movie. My general recommendation for this film is that it's worth seeing, but only to form your own opinion about it. Whether you like it or not like it or not, it is necessary to respect the point you are trying to convey.
