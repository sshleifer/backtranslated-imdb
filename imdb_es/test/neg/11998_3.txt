Wow ... I suspected that this was bad ... But now I find myself speechless ... Honestly, none of my words can do justice to this movie ... <br /> <br /> I'll try to say something anyway ... <br /> <br /> This is truly a unique gem. One of the worst. <br /> <br /> Lash La Rue, given his trajectory as an actor, in a whip fight with a Toltec sorcerer-sorcerer during the climax of the movie ... ??? A real stroke of genius, without a doubt. <br /> <br /> It rarely happens that I laugh out loud when I see a single movie. It happened several times with this. <br /> <br /> The accents of the actors, the man, the accents ... And the dialogues I heard talking ... And the acting itself ... I just could not 'I can not believe what I was hearing . <br /> <br /> That fat guy who threw farts so hard (when walking to the house with his nephew) for no apparent reason ... <br /> <br /> Tits! Yes, there are tits! And the female ass! There's even a naked girl in the bathtub drinking a beer ... <br /> <br /> That one who "spreads her mouth over her face" was the bomb! A true highlight. <br /> <br /> The aspects of the comedy were totally crazy. I just could not believe what I was seeing and hearing. For a while, I even thought they were involuntary, shaking their heads in disbelief. But halfway through the movie, I started having a bigger picture. I guess I took half a movie to the middle of my brain to finally achieve it. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time believing this movie ... But I think it's good, really. I had a black chick walking towards a very small closet, opening it and then saying "Wooow, look at all the storage space!". And she said it as if she meant it. I mean, that's a good dialogue and a good performance, right? <br /> <br /> Oh, and perhaps needless to say: Lash La Rue's whip skills are a great disadvantage in THE DARK POWER. It is really sad and pathetic to contemplate. That's all part of the comedy, of course. Or wait, I could be wrong. No, yes, I'm wrong. Lash La Rue was amazing with the whip! It was the editor's fault. He ruined it, cutting his eyelashes together and everything. Or wait, I could have been the camera operator. He filmed from the wrong angles ... So, why did not Phil Smoot say anything? That's it, it's the director's fault. <br /> <br /> But it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I'm going to stop talking about that. I have nothing significant to say anyway, except for the fact that I hope my brain recovers from this experience ... soon.
