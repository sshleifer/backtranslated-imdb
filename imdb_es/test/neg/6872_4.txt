The jealous husband holds a car dealer hostage while Williams loads the viewer with his worn-out Mork trick at every step. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Pay channel grinding. An exceptionally bad script along with a bit less to convince Robin Williams as an ingenious Queens car dealer who finds himself stuck in a hostage situation in a workplace. The laughter is not there, the messages or the morals are wrong, and the film can never decide if it is a comedy or a drama. Fairly good deal everyone acting pretty bad. When a movie ages so quickly, you stink. There is not much more to say apart from perhaps, avoid at all costs. Mediocre textbook movies like this one are, in fact, more tedious and less pleasant than the top bombs.
