A coach who used to be good, but who had to move to a new area to get away from what he once did; a team of no hopers; the star player who has a line with the coach; the assistant coach with an alcohol problem, the little guy who is kicked around scoring the winning basket; the whole city against the coach (all except the protagonist). It's the old story: taken from British comics, where a team of geeks and specialized fans face the Brazilians in football and win. <br /> <br /> This film, certainly well organized, is full of these clichés. The only part I did not predict was when at the town meeting, the star player suddenly decided to side with the coach. No reason was ever given. It seemed a very strange thing to see that everything was going there. Maybe he just felt sorry for the poor man. <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays the Popey Doyle costume. I'm sure an actor of Dennis Hopper's caliber found nothing particularly challenging about his role. The same can be said of Barbara Hershey. <br /> <br /> In short, a film full of clichés that could have been made much better than it was.
