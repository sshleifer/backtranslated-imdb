This is more than a simple adaptation of Bond: it's a simple scam! With sketches of mediocre characters that Ian Fleming would not have approved, this film falls like the worst movie 007. A major Connery (even emaciated) tries to relive his last 12 years later. The result is a sticky and humorless version of the classic hero. Give me Roger Moore any day!
