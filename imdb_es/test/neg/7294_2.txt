I will not say much about this movie, because there is not much to say, because there is not much to talk about. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" are back. Some of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters, it has a horrible comedy, a horrible animation and James Arnold Taylor tries to copy the wonderful, unique and unique Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are transformed into something they never were, and should never be, an animation that has been degraded as far as possible, and finally, why did someone who made a wonderful voice off worked for Obi? -Wan Kenobi in "Clone Wars" wants to copy Michael J. Fox? I have an answer to this. Because they are the same person who thought he had to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II. Yes, unfortunately, it's true. <br /> <br />.
