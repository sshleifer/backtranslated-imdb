This movie is called "Solomon Kane". Which is not The main character wears a hat, but that's all he has in common with the character of Robert Howard, Solomon Kane, as he is known for the first pulp magazines and many publications since these days. It's a fantasy movie, it's not really that bad and it could easily have passed with a good review, if it had not been called Solomon Kane. The hero is a newly invented character that is definitely not SK. The story is not Robert Howard, either. <br /> <br /> As a fantasy film, it is a film that follows the traditions of the genre: simple story, poor CGI, poor actors, poor direction. However, it can be fun, you know: "the cheaper they are, the better they are". But since it's called Solomon Kane, I can not accept it. Imagine a movie of The Lord of the Rings with a hero Bilbo who fights against the black sorcerer Saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend Aragorn and the beautiful heroine Shadowfax. And with a final fight where the three use a magic ring to kill the evil sorcerer who has become the Gondorian dragon. Imagine that. This is exactly what this movie has done with the character of Robert Howard, Solomon Kane. <br /> <br /> I would give you a 4 star review if it was just another horror movie, but since it's called Solomon Kane, I can just rate it 3 stars.
