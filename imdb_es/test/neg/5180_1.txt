The Motion Picture Association of America has deemed it appropriate to advise potential viewers, and this is particularly useful for parents and guardians that this film entitled "Freeze" is awarded an "R" grade. The rating of "R" has specific information that allows anyone who does not know anything about a movie should know something about what this movie offers. The "R" was instituted for Sexual Content, including the Nude and Perverse dialogue, language, sense of humor and drug use. There is no reward in seeing such a movie, although it would be useful to know if this could be eliminated as a possibility at all, since this reviewer would eliminate such a possibility. This is a movie in which simply a 1 is not equal to a number since it does not qualify as a movie to be told, in fact, just as this purpose is with this movie, it should be in this place. This is an unhealthy and undesirable offer that should receive a much stricter interpretation because at no time is this behavior or language suitable for viewing and this type of film may want a blacklist rather than a stricter definition as to its content. It is suggested that the stricter definition allows it, so a criminal accusation is presented. regardless of its classification. This is an unpleasant world that would harm anyone who watches this movie, since its purpose is to commit a crime. It is a crime and it is offensive in its purpose. There is no sense of humor in the film, but a depraved and indifferent purpose in terms of its undesirable support. Without reservations, this is a list of not seeing and it may not be necessary to tell any adult you consider, but anyone whose interests refer to the environment in which the children grow, does not allow or provide any young person with visualization of this movie because it's not friendly. Society often sends an incorrect message when these types of problems are in the public domain, so it is not one of those moments.
