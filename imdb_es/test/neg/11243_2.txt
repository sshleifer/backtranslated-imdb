When this show started, it was quite interesting: we were able to see what the crab fishermen had to go through during the crab harvesting season. Soon after, however, he lost focus on fishing and focused almost entirely on the drama of the fisherman's life. The episodes did not become anything other than "the captain does not like the new rookie" (this happens too often), "someone is injured or is sick", "a fisherman finds out about a problem at home and feels frustrated for being stuck. " On a boat ', repeat. I do not know how people can see the newer seasons, since each episode seems to be essentially the same as the previous and the later. This program should be changed to a different channel and change its name to "Crab Boat Drama", or, better yet, it would have made a perfect single segment in Dirtiest Jobs. <br /> <br /> Should not the Discovery Channel have learned its lesson after American Choppers?
