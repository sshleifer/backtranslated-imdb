This seemed really similar to the CHILD'S PLAY movies, except it was much worse. A lawyer tries to save a criminal, who was convicted of killing his son, from execution. She fails The lawyer's daughter then finds a puppet that the murderer had buried with his son and is immediately credited. Then, after several people are seriously injured, they find that the girl secretly talks to the doll and tells her that she did not hurt anyone. Throughout this film I found myself wondering 'why do I see this cheeze?' and again. The ending was so bad that I went and saw the animated version of Disney right after and I slept with the light on.
