I have always liked horror movies. From some of the known as "The Exorcist" to some more underestimated as "Black Christmas" or "Just Before Dawn". But who are people cheating, even calling this garbage a b-movie? It is straight to the bottom of the Z-grade barrel. The performance is the worst of all in the movie. Actually, I've seen better in an episode of "Young and the Restless" ... SPOILER ... Look when the woman comes to tell you about the legend of Jack-o. Sometimes it stops briefly for a few seconds, as if someone were showing their cue cards and struggling to read their sentences. A REVOLT! <br /> <br /> Oh, and in addition to the bad acting, absolutely no gore or F / X. And Jack-o looked like a gourd lit plastic. Watch Linnea Quigley in "Night of the Demons", or "Silent Night, Deadly Night", very superior films.
