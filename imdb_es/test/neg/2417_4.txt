If you are not old enough to remember Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan, here is the summary: they are a couple of producers and financiers of Israeli films that created the Cannon film company in the early eighties. The only Israeli to have a press worse than these two was Menachim Begin. Begin probably deserved the bad press, but Globus and Golan were a god sent to the filmmakers because no matter how bad their script was: they would be happy to finance their film and would normally employ directors who could not direct and actors who could not act. In fact, you often had the impression that people were simply walking towards Yoram and Menahem asking them for some money and that they were satisfied without seeing the filmmaker's resume. If only the producers of today were so confident. <br /> <br /> THE YOUNG WARRIORS is not a Cannon movie, but Globus and Golan financed it and have their signature everywhere. It is misdirected, badly acted, poorly edited, but it is the script that jumps and attacks you with its horror. It starts with a group of high school athletes who get involved in all kinds of jokes, in fact, the first 20 minutes of the film are developed as a sex comedy and it is a shock when THE YOUNG WARRIORS becomes a vigilante movie. . But it's not just any kind of vigilante movie like EXTERMINATOR 2 or DEATH WISH 3. (You see a connection? Both are sequels and both are watchman movies made by Cannon movies), however, this is a ridiculously bad vigilante movie. about the pretty boy high school athletes and their poodle who go on a mission to end up with scum. This movie is proof that Globus and Golan were giving money to people regardless of their movie making skills, and you have to worry about people who seem to spend all their reservations making movies around vigilantes.
