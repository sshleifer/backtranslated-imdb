I would avoid any temptation to watch this movie, it's just boring. The characters are predictable and meaningless. The murderer is quite little enigmatic. No tension, fun, style or even a flash of originality in this train crash. And the hollywoodea clich√© tide is suffocating. Oh, and you have a movie that turns a hero into an IRA terrorist. Cute. And now I need to talk a little more to fill the ten lines. And a little more, is that enough? Not quite, how about now? No, much more confabulation should do the trick, but The Jackal really is not worth ten exposure lines. Although the original was great.
