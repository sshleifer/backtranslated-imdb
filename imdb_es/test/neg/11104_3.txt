Everything is my fault. Everyone told me that I should avoid watching this movie because I am a big fan of the old TV series. They were right. While the production values ​​are good and the actors themselves (including "do not look now"), Julie Christie is not so bad, the whole movie shows a brazenness and self-awareness that clearly has no justification. A comparison between Karloff "Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns 2000" comes to mind. In fact, Belphegore 2000 owes much more to the new Mummy films than to the old series. But then, the scripts are terrible, the speed does not exist and sometimes the movie is full of involuntary jokes (the first scene in the tomb seems stupid), with cats clearly thrown when they are supposed to jump (landing first with its hind legs)). Belphegore moves like a statue on wheels that does not impress or scare, and the psychological drama that developed in the old television series when the heroine had to learn that she is a villain is completely neglected. This movie is so UNPLAWNED (money wasted, wasted actors, waste of planes) that hurts. It's a stealing of moms below average that is only good for some laughter, but it has nothing to do with the classic Greco (She also has a small role in this movie, in the cemetery).
