OK, so I'm relaxing in my room when Mom knocks on the door. I open the door and what do I see in your hands? "SLEEPY HOLLOW HIGH". I think it has to be an older horror movie, because now there's someone who could be stupid enough to name a movie that after the blockbuster "Sleepy Hollow," starring Johnny Depp. But to my surprise, the film is at least two years older than the original. That alone should have prevented me from placing it in V.C.R. But I did not have to take a chance, I had to believe that this movie could have a small ray of hope. Little did I know that the rays could not be seen. <br /> <br /> Number one, the story is so ridiculous that it's probably true in a rural city. Two, the actors seem more real-life people who simply ask themselves on the set when the director screams. Three, almost any movie starring the director is always horrible. But the funny thing is that this is another film directed by Kevin Summerfield. I have returned to trust his film to bring me to the floor with divided laughter. <br /> <br /> Where to start in this movie? I know, let's start with the runner in the woods. The lighting in the camera was so bad that it made me believe that the corridor was still and the cameraman was running. I love how the woman stops to eat a candy bar. I mean, it's only about the darkness, or just about the light, who could say with the lighting of the camera. And she stops running to eat a chocolate bar, I mean a CARAMEL BAR THAT HELLS. So she ends up being the first victim because of the stupidity, and I'm ready to break the tape, find the director, burn her hands. <br /> <br /> Then, out of nowhere, some guys like to try to fix a car that probably broke some years ago. Then comes the fake Mack 10 and a very real prostitute, who is part of our main cast. <br /> <br /> Some of the films are about a group of children who get into trouble. And they are given the option to pick up trash at Sleepy Hollow Park or the front suspension forever. He was sent to the forest with one of the teachers (Mr.E or a.k.a Kevin Summfield) who is supposed to watch over them and make sure everything goes accordingly. The funniest thing is how underdeveloped the charters really are. I mean what happens with the fake Mack 10 guy and who has heard about Hacker trying to kill himself. And somehow, one of the students has had an affair with the teacher Mr. E, before all this shit came out of community service. However, the school still thought it was a good idea to let them go. There is also a student named J that his purpose in the film is to keep appearing upset from nothing, trying to make the audience jump, when all he really does is increase the cheapness of the movie. The sound was so horrible in this movie. I mean you saw one when two guys are fighting, and the guy hits the other guy in the stomach and, out of the TV, there's this sound effect that sounds like someone is hitting an old wooden box. It started horribly and ended dangerously stupid, even my taste. However, I will say this, the music in the background made the scenes seem somewhat tolerable. But not so tolerable. My conclusion is this: if you want to go to another movie in which Kevin Summfield took seriously the purchase of "Sleepy Hollow High". 10. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
