The howl of this decade of 1950 is so bad that inadvertently it is funny. Tom Conway plays Dr. Gerard, a scientist who is turning the natives into a monster using voodoo. His poor wife, played by Mary Ellen Kay, is captive to her crazy husband who has no time for her, but threatens to kill her if she abandons him. Next to her, Marla English is a greedy assassin who has already killed a man to find a treasure in the jungle. His idiot boyfriend, played by Lance Fuller, is on safari. They hire "Touch" Connors, (later renamed Mike Connors, of Mannix fame) as a guide. English is a terrible actress, but well, no one else in the cast was given to the winning performances of the academy awards. "Touch" (sorry, I can not even write the name without breaking it, I mean, what ...) gave the group only average decent performance and that's saying a lot. The monster is only seen briefly, and the ending is predictable to say the least. I would say that this film falls into the category of films "it's so bad, it's almost good". It's good on a rainy night when there's nothing else in the tube.
