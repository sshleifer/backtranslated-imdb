A day in the life of a silly taxi driver sometime around Christmas: The taxi driver picks up a fare ... they have a "very insightful" interlude ... leave the fare ... pick up another fare ... .other interlude ... and so on for 90 minutes ... nothing convincing (or interesting) even for a minute ... GO TO THAT!
