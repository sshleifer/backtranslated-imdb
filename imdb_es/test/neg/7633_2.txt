Rebecca De Mornay can be a beautiful and fascinating actress, but as for the parts she has to play, if she can not say something nice ... <br /> <br /> De Mornay portrays a woman who had terrible traumas when She was a father girl, she can hardly stand now that she is an adult and has, of course, become a brilliant shrinking. He has an affair with Banderas, who we suspect is (oh, how original!) A serial killer. -in the law the character of Tippi Hedren in "Marnie". But he would not count on it: Hitchcock died twenty-four years ago, and many regents try desperately to replace him. Here the director does everything possible to do. a thriller with an unexpected ending, but that ending is so unlikely that it is absolutely impossible to buy it. The film includes the obligatory "conversations with a serial killer" in the tradition of "silence of the lamb", murders (humans and cats), double personality and open end in case the crowds ask for more. Apparently, they did not, and they were right.
