There is no "fun" mocking the desperate situation of illegal immigrants! Or the desperate situation of owners of head shops, for that matter! The fact that Brian Glazer, richer than God, did not see the irony that the "heroes" did exactly what the villain does: steal honest and hardworking people the savings of his life, I'm not surprised! Hell, how do you think he became richer than God ?! <br /> <br /> In this supposed satire on greed, these mental dwarfs reveal their own hypocrisy: the McMansions, the McToys, the McChildren, the McIllegals who are paid peanuts to take care of the McMansions, the McToys and the McChildren! But the main problem (apart from rebellious bigotry) is the premise: as a former executive of a now infamous company, Dick would be the Big Scalp for every corporate talent scout in the country! There are no dining rooms for him! And, accumulating high figures of six, you would think you would not be surprised with a Gore / Lieberman poster!
