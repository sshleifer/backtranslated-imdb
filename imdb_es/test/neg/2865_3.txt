I have really enjoyed several films by GÃ©rard Depardieu and I hoped that I would like this movie much more than I did. The most important reason was that the film did not seem very interesting or fun, so I was not interested. Also, even though she DOES NOT sleep with her stubborn daughter, the idea that she lies when telling everyone that he is her much older lover is simply disgusting. Yes, I know there is no incest and I know that no one around him knows that he is really his father, but I discovered that any child who makes fun of his father because his sexual lover is too disgusting and prevents the movie is really fun. Also, I really did not like this little brat very much. Apart from her lies, she seemed very shameless and committed. I would have preferred it if somehow she had gotten her "improvement" and somehow I would have been punished, since I just did not like it.
