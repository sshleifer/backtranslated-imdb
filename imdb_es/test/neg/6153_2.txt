Wow !! I did not even know about this movie until I was looking for the name of another Mark Hamill classic (Time Runner). Some things are better left unknown. The role of Mark Hamill is quite ... limited. I would compare his appearance in this film with all those appearances of Vincent Price and Christopher Lee in those horror films of the 60s and 70s. In those films, they appeared in the first and last 5 minutes of the film. Mark's memorable performance with lines as big as "Do not try to run, you're under arrest." Did I mention that it says EXACT more than once? Bill Paxton fell into a spiral of Uzumaki-type drugs and drinking after Aliens, because he ended up in this film after waking up on the set after a binge session. THE HAIR .. THE HAIR !!! .. Bill invaluable. It really should have been Bill's "GAME" ... but somehow ... did he receive treatment ... and keep improving? films. This movie blows. It's more boring and boring than The Crazies. At least that movie was crazy ... this is just boring. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE SOBER.
