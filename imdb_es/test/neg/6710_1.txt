The authors do not know anything about Russian prisons, the film is absolutely disastrous, it has nothing in common with reality. Nor do they believe that foreign prisoners in Russia have a special prison, so foreigners NEVER live with Russian criminals. The uniforms in this movie look like they were stolen somewhere in Latin America. Prisoners in Russia do not work outside the prison either. Every murder in the Russian prison is a subject of investigation, so the prisoners kill each other only if there are some very important reasons. Playing football is also prohibited in prisons, contacts between prisoners are very restricted, there is no possibility of bloody battles, etc. So this movie has nothing to do with reality.
