Calling a boring movie is not something I would usually consider valid criticism. However, when a movie is made up of spare parts from other movies that were not so good to start with, and is slow as molasses without a real reward, I think it's fair to call spades a shovel. And The Ghost is a very boring movie. <br /> <br /> A film that is almost as original as its name, The Ghost tells the story of a young girl with amnesia who is being persecuted by a ghost who keeps the secret of her past. Only it is much more complicated and less interesting than one might think. <br /> <br /> The line of the plot is almost incomprehensible to most of the image and the hook, the element of amnesia, only makes things worse. It seems that nobody, including the scriptwriter and the director, have an idea of ​​what the hell is happening at any given moment. Instead, they chose to do what roughly equals the cinematic equivalent of a series of video clips. There are scenes taken directly from Ringu, Dark Water, Shutter, The Grudge series, and a little Pulse just in case. To make matters worse, half a dozen women leaders wear all their clothes and read their lines equally, so it is impossible to distinguish them. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to understand in this movie. The story is not so well thought out. The trick of amnesia is lazy. The mysterious element does not involve and is handled with little grace. The characters never deduct anything, all information is delivered through the leader remembering his past whenever it is convenient for the plot. <br /> <br /> The cinematography, full of reflections and water shots, at least try to add For the subtext, a thematic link with the amnesia and the final turn (which I will not reveal) is nice, but it is often overloaded . Even the score feels borrowed and clichéd. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the incitement to the action of the curse is not very interesting and the final turn is predictable and scarce. "Wait, you mean a character who has 15 minutes of screen time but seems to have nothing to do with the plot returns at the end? No!" Audiences are too smart for this type of guts. Anyone who has seen any of the movies that this scam will find very little to keep them awake with this feature. I used to think that Shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of garbage (redo his grudge movie no less than 5 times), but even his second class work as Reincarnation, a film that I could not even finish, is miles in front of this. <br /> <br /> For more comments, visit www.collider.com
