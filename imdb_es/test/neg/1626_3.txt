This movie has some of the worst production and editing values ​​I've seen. There are several cases of actors who stop while trying to remember their lines, actors who walk in front of actors who are talking, and a point where the film skips about seven frames. Not to mention that the heroine was shot in the chest, however, begins to limp! Oh, and what about the secret passage that is well lit and outdoors. Horrible. <br /> <br /> The plot does not exist, it has to do with a primitive nuclear bomb and it goes to the ends of the Earth and some kind of war of caverns. Ator takes out a hang glider at a given moment in the dumbest moment of the movie. The dialogue is stupid, it contains gems like "It's everything and nothing". and "I can feel it here." <br /> <br /> The film is a disaster, a confused and insipid disaster. Ator is a soft hero, the sword fights are absurd, and the plot progresses slowly. All in all, this is a movie to avoid.
