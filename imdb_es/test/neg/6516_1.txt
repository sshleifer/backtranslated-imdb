If you have never read the book and never intend to read it in the future, continue and watch the movie (6/10). It's a nice fantasy movie with CGI well done, good acting, a beautiful atmosphere and a fantasy story above average. <br /> <br /> If you've read the book like me about 10 times or more and I really love it, do not expect too much (or better: do not expect anything). The story is totally different from the original book. This may explain why the movie is voted 1/10 by people around 40 or more (like me) and much better by people who probably have never read the book before and, therefore, do not expect anything. <br /> <br /> Most of the differences between the film and the book are not really necessary and they change the configuration (in my opinion, much worse): <br /> <br /> - The magic in the Book works with rituals for classic magical effects. (Changing the climate, creating illusions, transforming into animals, ...) In the film, magic is more like "the Jedi school for the Middle Ages" (TM) (wooden sticks instead of lightsabers). That the devil looks like Emperor Palpatine (after part III) does not really make it better. <br /> <br /> - The mill in the book is not totally cut off from the world as in the movie. In the book, the story takes place near Dresden, that Krabat once visits his teacher and also visits some nearby villages to celebrate parties. (This part could have been changed to reduce costs). I also do not understand why in the film the mill is located in the hills, while the nearby cemetery is located in the high mountains. <br /> <br /> - The whole environment is the middle style of the medieval fantasy of the mill. Lots of mud everywhere, dirty faces, not an orderly kitchen, only very rough houses. The book never suggested such an environment. <br /> <br /> - In the book, the master tries to make Krabat his successor, but Krabat rejects it. Krabat is somewhere between admiration, distance and silent rejection. In the film, Krabat rejects the teacher openly as an obstinate schoolboy. <br /> <br /> - The film takes place in 1647 instead of around 1720. This makes it impossible for the teacher to tell some stories of his youth, probably around. 170x Okay, the stories are missing anyway in the movie. <br /> <br /> Also some explanations given in the book would have been useful and would not have cost so many minutes: <br /> <br /> - In the book all the work done during the day is easy and night work It's like normal work. This explanation is missing in the movie. Sometimes children sweat and other times they are happy. <br /> <br /> - The book explains why only some "Gesellen" try to confront the master: if the master dies for mundane reasons, the "Gesellen" are Free and retain their magical powers. If the teacher dies in confrontation, everyone will lose their power forever.
