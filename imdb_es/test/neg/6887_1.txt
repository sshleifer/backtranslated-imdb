I suppose that when people say that this is very well filmed, they are talking about the close-ups of the frogs and the kitchen of the meals. Certainly, it does not refer to the whole, which seems to be composed of approximately 3 rooms without external connections. In addition, everything is filmed very closely. <br /> <br /> I got tired of the little boy who keeps throwing farts in Miu or throwing hot wax on the ants ... also the Vietnamese spend all their time squatting? More or less disgusting at least in the way this movie describes it, one of the first would have been a lot, not a dozen or more. <br /> <br /> Then, finally, the second part comes ... a film for Vietnamese girls with the perfect handsome rich man who spends all day playing the piano (He is cultured). The beautiful maid steals it like the forbidden green mango fruit. Deep. <br /> <br /> With the exception of some close-ups, this movie is a failure. It's a kind of telenovela without dialogue. It is camouflaged. How is it beautiful? The set looks completely false. <br /> <br /> No, do not make the mistake I made and I rented it because someone recommended it. I expected beautiful photos of the coastal mountains of Vietnam or something like that when I heard it was a visual jewel. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie. I like foreign films, I even prefer them. But this movie is silent and boring. It will leave you irritated that something like this has won a lot of prizes.
