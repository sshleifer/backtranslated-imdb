I do not understand why this film received such good ratings from critics. I've seen dozens of documentaries (on television) about the world of wine that were much better when (yes) you see it, please, think of two very. Annoying aspects of Mondovino: first, the filming is horrible and terrible and annoying: for me, it seemed that the boy behind the camera only received the material and was playing with it: many zoom (with no other purpose than pressing the button in / out ) for example - I almost stopped to see it for that! Secondly, the interviewer (the director, I think) is not really relevant: he looks and asks questions like a boy scout, not like a journalist, even if the general idea and the subjects had been interesting, very bad conclusion: overrated documentary , maybe only for men who do not know anything about wine => not recommended at all (2/10)
