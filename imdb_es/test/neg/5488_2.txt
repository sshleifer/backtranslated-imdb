The story is: a troupe of actors from the beginning of the century, together with producers and owners of theaters, have very complicated relationships. A resident dramatist has written a psychological drama. He wants to get a good production on stage, but he can not do it unless he convinces a particular critic to revisit the production and give a positive review. If its production does not continue, the company will put The Doll House, recently written by Ibsen. Many different relationships among directors are explored; none of them interesting But the participation of the characters among themselves led to give a second chance to the play of the resident playwright. <br /> <br /> This movie is purely an excuse for the director and his friends to come together and make a movie. . The story lines are incoherent for anyone who is not a friend of one of the stars. The only reason why I did not leave the theater after about half an hour is that a fat woman was resting a full meal on her stomach at the end of my row.
