I have never understood this kind of fake movies. You get a serious / semi-serious movie that everyone knows and eliminates seriousness through immature jokes and so on. We have seen it many, many times, and it has never been really fun. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you do not understand, in my opinion. This seems to be one of the darkest and least liked of the genre, although honestly I do not see anything in this that is much worse than that of Spy Hard or Hot Shots. This film, as clearly understood from the title, focuses on making fun of Pulp Fiction. That's the main reason why I decided to watch it, since I discovered that the film was too forgiving of Tarantino's sick mind and was powerfully overrated. I had expected one or two good jokes, mocking the kind of excessively violent and pointless film that Pulp Fiction was in all aspects, in my (anything less) humble opinion. I was very disappointed. The plot is practically a scam of Tarantino's film, with some scenes that simulate others, often better, in the same childish way and without humor. The rhythm is deficient and, often, he will sit there, being able to guess the result of each scene, predicting each joke, often thinking of a better one in the place, bored of his mind. The acting is bad. The characters are cliches and stereotypes, and intentionally they are too thin to make fun of the characters they are based on ... the problem is that it does not work. It just makes the movie much harder to sit on. The humor is youthful and lame. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that they managed to find some actors who looked like the people they were supposed to be. The film is a terrible waste of the real actors involved. It might be a little entertaining for fans of typical fake movies of the same type. I recommend this only to people who really hate Pulp Fiction, or fans of Zucker's parody movies. All others: avoid. 1/10
