This movie was horrible. If it had never been done, the world would be a better place. Come on, a flying car? What were you thinking? This was a sub-par film with a horrible hook, and I would like a written apology from the studio that produced it, along with some cookies to help me pay me for the time I wasted on this crap fest I can never return. If you paid to see this movie, I'm sorry because I saw it on TV one Sunday afternoon when he had nothing better to do and almost ruined the whole week. ¿¡¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ ¿¿And is that supposed compensates for having a horrible mother who cares more about their own needs fucking your children? It's no wonder they do not have enough sense to tell someone who is hitting, his mother does not teach them anything but what she wants is before everything else. Absolutely horrible
