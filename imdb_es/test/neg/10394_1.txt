The movie started very well ... until now Isabelle's exorcism could be believed ... but later, my God! I did not know if it was a horror movie, a drama movie or a No-see! The possessed creature attacking the sheriff had no connection to the movie ... the makeup! Well, at first it seemed quite real, but in the end, the last part of the movie, makeup (especially the teeth and eyes) was very exaggerated. If you want a good "Exorcism", watch the movie "The exorcism of Emily Rose". <br /> <br /> Along with "Hard Candy" (Totally boring, pathetic and final argument), these two films are the worst. I've seen Lionsgate! But hey, the movie company has given horror movie fans great movies, but with this one, you'll want to never rent it! Fans of exorcism movies, just stay with two "The Exorcist" and "Emily Rose's Exorcism"
