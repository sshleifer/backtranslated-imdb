This movie is the worst I've ever seen. You might think you've seen some bad movies in your time, but if you have not seen this one, you do not know how terrible a movie can be. But wait, there's worse news! The studio will soon publish this masterpiece (I'm being ironic) for all to see! The only things worse than the plot of this film are the effects, the acting, the direction and the production. Bill Rebane, poor Ed Wood (although not the Ed Wood of a rich man) (although I like Ed Wood's films) manages to keep things moving at full speed throughout this film. It opens with the capture of a bigfoot baby (a Littlefoot - sorry, could not help it) by a couple of nasty hunters, who are killed by the father. This causes the whole city where the hunters lived to go on a Bigfoot hunting jihad. This is enough for the plot. Nothing remotely interesting happens, and we, the spectators, can never worry about any of the characters. If one is interested in Rebane's films, I would recommend almost any other about this. However, as I said, it will soon be released again by Troma in order to bore a new generation of viewers.
