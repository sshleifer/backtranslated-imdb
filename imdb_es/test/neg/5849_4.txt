This movie received a great article about the upcoming attraction of Blockbusters. I was looking forward to the release date, 07/08/02. The plot sounds reasonable, the cast should only have guaranteed a lateral separator, but whoa there; Apart from the "betting events outside the wall", this was quite boring. <br /> <br /> This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it has not helped John Cleese's good comedy reputation. Rowan Atkinson, now it was quite funny, in a way very similar to Rowan Atkinson!
