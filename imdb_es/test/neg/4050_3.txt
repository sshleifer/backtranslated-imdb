Skip all subjective criticism of "this is a great movie" and read the IMDB trailer or the back of the KINO videobox (which includes both versions of this movie) that I will paraphrase: "To the beat of George Antheil's science fiction score , the camera goes in a sleepwalker through the hell of B-Movie, all photographed by Will Thompson (who did 'Plan 9 from outer space' and 'Maniac') ". You do not know whether to laugh at the movie or with it. Therefore, if you like the actors and the non-wannabe effects of B-grade or C-own production with pretensions of surrealism, this could be for you! Otherwise, get a copy of "Screamplay," a modern, low-budget Expressionist masterpiece.
