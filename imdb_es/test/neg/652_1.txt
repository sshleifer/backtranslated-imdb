To summarize this film, it is LaBute taking his sadism to the realm of comic farce. The predictable result is that he constantly treads on all the jokes by insisting on surrounding them with bloody violence and extremely obnoxious characters. There is also evidence of his continuing efforts to insult and ridicule everything that is in view, but then to apologize for it with weak gestures to the PC. Basically, the film just does not work, its plot is beyond the devised, the characters are one-dimensional clichés, there is no coherence or development of anything, and the comedy (where it is not totally out of place) is the worst kind of concept drivel. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger are completely wasted on characters that look like parodies of studio-driven audiences, no matter what, make them pleasant, neutral (and neutral) and complete of moral clichés. Crispin Glover is here long enough to convince you that he no longer belongs to movies. Chris Rock actually has a negative chemistry with his partner the hitman Freeman, it's as if they were performing in different rooms, even when they are at a distance of two inches from each other. In effect, Chris Rock looks like a digital insert. At least it's not as annoying as Jar-Jar. <br /> <br /> The 15 minutes of LaBute can be ready for this moment. It seems that he has surpassed his welcome.
