** May contain spoilers ** Horrible. Just horrible I loved Stephen King's novel, and this is a horrible adaptation of it. They change the ending. They change the plot. Alan Pangborne's character changed from an afflicted husband to a happy fianc√©. If you are a fan of Stephen King's novel, get away. Even if you're not there, get away. <br /> <br /> The book was incredibly dark, even for Steve King. An 11-year-old boy is killed in the novel. In the novel there is a high school director with child pornography. This is not as good as the novel. <br /> <br /> This movie is my least favorite movie of all time. I hate this movie with a vengeance.
