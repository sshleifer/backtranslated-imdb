I've been a fan of classic terror all my life. Many nights lasted until the early hours of the morning watching Universal's films on "Horror Incorporated" and "Creature Feature Night." Unfortunately, I saw this movie in the early afternoon, and yet I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've seen an image of "horror" in which everything was so real. . Dr. Edelmann does not seem to believe in the supernatural, however, in a short time he is medically treating Dracula and is watching Larry Talbot transform into the Wolf Man without hardly blinking. He and Talbot discover the monster of Frankenstein as if it were something everyday. Edelmann is very excited for the monster to come back to life, but after Talbot, Miliza and Nina protest, he says "Aww, you're right, it's not a big problem". After realizing the betrayal of Dracula, he opens the coffin of the count in the sunlight and POOF! It's gone, just like that. <br /> <br /> The only person who did not seem to be simply calling in their lines was Jane Adams as Nina At the end of the movie, Frankenstein's monster bounced his reward in the back of his back in a pit .. And nobody tries to rescue her! She, Dr. Edelmann and the Monster perish, while Talbot and Miliza casually leave the castle. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the lowest point for Universal during its classic years of terror.
