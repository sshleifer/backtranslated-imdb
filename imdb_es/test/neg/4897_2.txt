Arguably the most unpleasant thing that has come out of Australia since Vegemite ... A predictably disgusting comedy with Barry Humphries in a double role as the bored Australian diplomat Les Patterson and covert agent Dame Edna! So many gags of body function that even the Farrelly brothers would have been sick, and several moments of disgust, especially the effects of the horrible H.E.L.P. virus. Only for fans of extreme bathroom humor. Oh, and that's the "Story that never ends", NOT the "Mad Max" George Miller, who directed ... * Â½ <br /> <br />
