I'm just going to write more because it's necessary. However, the summary that I put on top is too long for what this movie was. You almost know who is involved from the beginning. Despite their attempts to make twists and turns in the plot (an active "talent") that strives to have a look of shock and dismay when a turn occurs, it is not necessary to really ask "detective" in this " mystery". <br /> <br /> The more I write, the more I feel bad about having to write so much to have a comment, but the rules are the rules. I really feel bad for saying this, but I think it's the lowest I've rated in a movie. I wonder what I am saving the votes of 1 and 2 for. However, I thought that this movie deserved a 3, since I think there was some talent in the movie. Johanna Watts (or is Watson) did a pretty good job. I was crying and anguished in one part and I thought that she conveyed that emotion well. The man who played the character who was "the drummer" also did well, for his brief role. <br /> <br /> Many of the actors did a "good" job. But the main actor, David, forgot his last name (terrible with their names), it was bad enough. I think he must have thought he was doing dramatic performances for 'The Young and the Restless' or 'Days of Our Lives'. If you try, you can imagine it with a white lab coat, interpreting a doctor with several personalities in the "General Hospital". It does not help that the film is shot like a day soap. Although, I'm pretty sure I could shoot this same movie with a camcorder; although without the obvious and soapy sound editing. <br /> <br /> The first time I thought that the money to rent this movie was wasted. However, I would not see him again, unless they paid me a large sum of money.
