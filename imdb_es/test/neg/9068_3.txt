Do not worry, there are no spoilers here, I just say that there is a very predictable plot. A couple decides to live in their father's love nest so they can write a book / article / newsletter on their adventure with a famous Hollywood tragic star. All this production worked as a high school company doing an episode of "Murder She Wrote". The only performance in which they sold me was the old fog they interviewed to know the sources of the story. Apparently, the directors thought that the film was getting too long, so towards the end, they stopped pointing their camera to some kind of creepy image of the star and brought reinforcements of plot to wrap this thing. Do not waste your time, even the proven / failed horror / intrigue classics in this movie.
