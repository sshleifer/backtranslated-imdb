I rented this movie at the local video store one day, you know, the kind of box art movie that comes up and tells you to "rent me out". Well, if you see this boring movie in your video store, keep walking. Fight against the impulse, rent a porn movie, because this movie is BOOOoooorrrring. Despite the interesting opening, the film falls into repetitive murders and a tough cop stumbles, dealing with the usual problems (wife, bastard boss, etc.). Do you wonder if the fast-forward function on your VCR works? Rent this movie and put your concerns to the test.
