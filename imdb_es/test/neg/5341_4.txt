"Black Friday" made this plot much better, so it is remembered and "The Man With Two Lives" is just a forgotten pearl. "Shed No Tears" was his job title and it would have been better, since he was a completely evil character for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Philip Bennett is newly engaged when he is involved in an accident traffic. Dr. Clark (Edward Keene) has been involved in some experimental operations with animals, leading them back from death. His colleagues ask him to prove his operation on Phillip, who died. While it is operating, a dangerous criminal, Wolf Panino, goes to the electric chair and the trans migration of the soul takes place. When Phillip wakes up from the operation, he has Panino's soul. He is a changed person, he is rude to his family and he begins to haunt the old places of Panino. He takes over the old Wolf gang, his name is Philip Bennett, he's also the ex-girlfriend of the romance wolf, who smells a rat. Bennett, like Wolf, is determined to equalize the scores and begin to eliminate his enemies. The bodies are accumulated, including the bride and the police, then his own family begins to fall victim. <br /> <br /> But - HATE These "bad dream" movies: you always feel disappointed. This film would have been better if it had remained in the character of Panino and would have had a final shoot. Eleanor, his fiancee, would have ended up sadder but wiser with her brother. <br /> <br /> Edward Norris, the star, had a great career mainly in B movies. <br /> <br /> It really is not recommended.
