Like other films of the worst director in history, Ed Wood, this movie is very bad, but that's why it's also very funny. It may not be for everyone, but I laughed a lot. It's a strange thing when you enjoy a bad movie. How do you rate it? As a very low movie, as entertainment a little higher. <br /> <br /> The film tries to explain what a transvestite is and does it through a scientist (Bela Lugosi) and an inspector (Lyle Talbot) who talks to a doctor (Timothy Farrell) who knows about these things . The doctor tells the detective two stories and that is what we, and apparently the scientist, see. The doctor says these stories because he found a dead transvestite, a suicide and a headline in the newspaper about a change of sex. The first and longest story is about Glen (the same Ed Wood), who is in love and about to marry Barbara (Dolores Fuller), but has never told him that he likes to dress as a woman, when her name is Glenda. The movie says the same thing over and over again, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily a homosexual. The movie almost says that being a transvestite is not a bad thing, but being a homosexual is, since it keeps telling us that a transvestite is not a homosexual. The second story is about a transvestite who really wants a change of sex and not only wants to dress as a woman, but it is much shorter and less interesting. <br /> <br /> A couple of things make this movie very bad, and therefore laughable. The first thing that is presented is how the story is presented, the way in which the same things are said over and over again and the conclusion of all this are different. This is not where it ends. The acting is very bad, especially Dolores Fuller seems to be reading her lines directly from a small screen somewhere. Everything she says is funny. In fact, the whole dialogue gave me a lot of laughs. <br /> <br /> There is also a sequence in which someone enters a room. The door remains half open and we see something hanging on the wall, not completely straight. Then the door, in what seems to be the same shot, although we know it is not, is a little less open and, suddenly, the thing on the wall hangs straight. Ed Wood did not mind leaving this type of continuity errors in his film. It can be a good thing, because basically it's just another laugh for the modern audience. I think you understand that it's a bad movie and I think there's a good chance that you also laugh at ridiculous mistakes.
