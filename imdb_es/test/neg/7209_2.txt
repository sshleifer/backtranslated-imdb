SPOILERS: The original Road House is one of those films that I know is clich√© and unoriginal, but it's very good, I'm sad to admit that I really like it. It turns out that many of my friends, whose film views respect, think the same way. So, when they try to make a sequel and it's as if some high school kids who had the rights to make a sequel had written it, it's just bad; really, really bad. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Johnathon Schaech appears as one of the writers and I can only hope that his WGA membership will be revoked. The writing was simply bad and all the writers of this film should retire for complete lack of originality and some of the worst dialogues in this millennium. Schaech already seemed to be the king of the direct DVD sequel (8 mm 2, Poison Ivy 2) and now, after seeing this and 8 mm 2, I think his acting ability does not exist. He was horrible, just horrible. <br /> <br /> And it's not the terrible fight scenes that make this movie terrible, but take it, they're bad. Each fight scene is a blow delivered slowly (but still making the sound "wiff" in the air) which is then blocked by the opponent, who returns a blow that sends the first guy to the ground. This is repeated throughout the film, worse than any police show of the seventies. Or the fact that many of the people involved in the fights seem to have their mouth full of cherry help for some reason. And we're supposed to believe that Will Patton is a combat machine; Her fight scenes seem so incredibly false that she was genuinely ashamed to see them. <br /> <br /> It's the complete flaws of logic in this ridiculous movie that make it terrible. For example: the character of Johnathon Schaech is in the city for a day and already tells a girl who hardly knows who has no idea which side is "I'm with the federals, but do not tell anyone." The villain, who fights against the good girl in a fight scene with acrobatics that rival any superhero, is easy to push for Will Patton, the "old man", in another scene simply holding both hands while saying something ridiculous line ("stab me Once, the fault is yours, stabbing twice, it will not happen "hopefully, that's bad" and then the head hits it. The villain of Jake Busey shoots at the feds while he is trapped in the middle of a drug business, however, no DEA agent or anyone simply goes to his house and picks it up after, in fact, he just let it go because "This is the sheriff's territory." Busey wants the bar because he is "in an excellent location" for drug deals, but his own house seems to be just as good, apparently offering all the benefits that the bar is supposed to have. The character of Johnathon Schaech is supposed to be the son of the Patrick Swayze character in the original, but the surname of the character of Swayze is Dalton and that of Schaech (not even the supposed brother of the character of Swayze). And Johnathon Schaech looks like 50 in this movie. I looked for him, he's 17 years younger than Swayze, but he looks horrible. <br /> <br /> But my absolutely stupid favorite scene in this movie was the most common fight scene that ends in the movies: the villain is hit through a window on a second floor and as they move down I'm thinking "please, do not tell me you're impaled on something ..." and, indeed, my worst fears came true. <br /> <br /> Actually, I could continue for half an hour more on the things I hated about this movie. Suffice it to say that we are going to put an end to these ridiculous sequels of theatrical films, at least those of Johnathon Schaech.
