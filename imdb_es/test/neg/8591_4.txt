Beautiful images, propaganda and history as a toy. The ingredients of this film, good, interesting but with many shadows. Political shadows. Jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical America. It is a silhouette of a vision of life and society, an extraordinary thinker, a teacher of much of North America. In the movies only superman remains. The delicate outline of ideas is crushed. The subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten. And Jefferson is a basic instrument to create a good image of the American realities. The end, triumphant and false, romantic and heroic, is a suicide with a firearm of a story that can be high with more wisdom. And the war against "Avatar" is another gray spot. For someone who did not hear anything about Jefferson, the movie is a good start. For others - disappointment. It's like the precious silk of a tailor. But the tailor is fascinating with silk and clothing is just an ordinary cloth. So, a sad experience. Slices of beauty and boring lakes, patriotic lessons and falling in love with expectations. A movie that must be impressive. And the ashes of a story that could be magnificent.
