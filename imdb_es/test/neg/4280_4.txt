As an avid Disney fan, this film did not impress me at all, I certainly was not motivated enough to see it in theaters. However, I am so happy to have seen it on a DVD and seen the special functions. <br /> <br /> You MUST see the "Moose Commentary": the whole movie can be seen with comments from Rutt and Tuke The Comic Elk Relief Story, which are voiced by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. Two veterans of the famous comedy company Second City, ad-lib, in character, for an hour and a half about a movie they like a lot. I laughed all the time. The pleasure I got from this comment completely compensated for the timid reaction I had with the film itself. Do yourself a favor and listen to it!
