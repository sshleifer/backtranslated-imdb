With actors like Depardieu and Richard it's really a difficult task to make a boring movie. But Weber is a master at establishing a slow rhythm and making supposedly funny scenes without any intelligence and depth. This film is high in history but low in character. You never know any of the characters, except for superficial slapstick. Unfortunately, Weber has no idea what the slapstick is about. His style could be described to success and chance. Of course, some people laugh when they see someone slide on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor to this lot. It's a shame how bad the good talent uses. Many good French comedians have been wasted by mediocre directors.
