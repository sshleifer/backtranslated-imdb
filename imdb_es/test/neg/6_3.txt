A difficult sale: the British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical theater drama in a noisy and resounding film about the Shakespeare theater group of World War II which has an aged star, windy, bright but unreliable at the end of his tether . The actor's ephemeral assistant works diligently to make his teacher comfortable and disguised for a production of "King Lear" (during an air strike!), But both men are losing control of their situation. Based on the last years of the actor Donald Wolfit, whose dresser was Ronald Harwood, this acclaimed production seems to be a welcome refuge for spirits who chew landscapes. Unfortunately, Albert Finney (at this point in his career, not quite at all) seems too robust and quick to play the actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) can not modulate Sir's moods and coherence attacks in a way that makes sense to us, so that in one scene he stops a train with the dominant echo of his voice , and in the next one it is curiously torn apart. With such a disaster of a human being in the midst of health and fitness problems, one would assume that a dedicated assistant would do everything possible to protect his boss (and his future), but servant Tom Courtenay asks Edney to help him. handle. instead of resting. Courtenay, who played this part on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar along with Finney for Best Actor), is much more in tune with his role, and, finally, his orders and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film. These two, fortunately, do not peck at each other, and the screenwriter Harwood is careful not to fall into a pattern of hate to love (which could be perceived in the first act of the film); but, without a juxtaposition of servant versus celebrity, there is not much to see in this portrait, except for the deterioration of narcissism, the hint of what it once was. * 1/2 of ****
