Wow. I watched One Night at McCool's yesterday, and all I can say is: "Wow." <br /> <br /> Here I go. MAIN SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Would you like a summary of the plot, just to see how stupid and useless this movie is? He would never tell anyone to see him, unless he was going to inflict pain on them. Anyway, here is a look (or a large part) of the plot. <br /> <br /> Randy works for a bar, McCool. He meets a woman named Jewel who convinces him that, surprisingly, he has sex with him. Her ex-boyfriend ends up trying to steal them and is killed. Randy, his cousin and the detective at the crime scene fall in love with Jewel. She, being the pet of stupidity, uses each of these types to get what she wants, with a DVD player. Randy hires an assassin to kill her, and finally, the detective is killed by the ex-boyfriend's psycho brother and the hitman and Jewel take off. <br /> <br /> Seriously. That's. I left almost nothing, except for some more sex scenes and an almost pornographic scene of Liv Tyler as Jewel using a hose to flaunt her sexuality. <br /> <br /> What was the point of this movie? To be honest, I think it was that way so that the producers and directors could show their masculine impulses. Which I think is absolutely out of place and just stupid. When I see a movie, I want an argument. I want characters I do not care if the sexy woman flaunts everything she has. Something should happen in a movie, for God's sake. This is as bad as Fight Club. <br /> <br /> It gets even worse. John Goodman is the detective dedicated to being superior. I wondered myself why Goodman would play in something as unfortunate as this, but then I remembered that I was in Oh Brother, where are you? as well. Your reputation has just decreased in level. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler was an incredible actress in the series The Lord of the Rings. In this movie, she is just an unintelligent bitch who wants nothing more than her own way. Your reputation has dropped seven or eight levels, for me. <br /> <br /> I am amazed, simply INCREDIBLE that people would work so hard to do something so stupid. The music is absolutely bad (having "YMCA" music while the character of John Goodman is being murdered does not really fit), the characters are totally unpleasant, the plot is one of the stupidest ever conceived by man, and to top it off, It does not even fit in any genre. The closest you get is the pornographic comedy. If it was even supposed to be fun. Which was not <br /> <br /> I think I've finished ranting. But let me assure you that no one in their right mind would ever want to see this movie. Unless they want Liv Tyler as much as the characters do, that is.
