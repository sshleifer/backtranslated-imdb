Jessica is a young, virginal and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch. Jessica is also a powerful psychic, capable of radiesthesia, retro-cognition, precognition and esp. When the handsome young Gordon Hawthorne comes to visit him, he is instantly skeptical about Jessica's powers ... until his skills discover a lost wristwatch and discover an ancient treasure chest. However, the treasure chest has the severed head of a centuries-old satanist named Gideon Drew, whose powers are much stronger than Jessica's. Despite his warnings of evil in their midst, Drew manages to mentally enslave all the unfortunate of making eye contact with him. But Drew wants Jessica above all. He needs his dowsing skills to dig up his body, so he can rise from the dead and rule over the human race. Will Jessica's powerful fleur-de-lis, combined with Gordon's love, take away the old evil before she can destroy them all? <br /> <br /> This is not a very interesting movie. No doubt, it could have been: the basic story is interesting and imaginative, but acting is important and everything moves too slowly to maintain interest. Jessica is also too innocent, almost annoying, and Gordon, his love interest, is wooden, rigid and totally emotionless. None of the characters is very nice, and the low budget is painfully obvious. A hasty end does not help either. Avoid, unless it is the MST3K version.
