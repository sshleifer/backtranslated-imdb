This movie had horrible lighting and terrible camera movements. This movie is a horror movie without any meaning. The bars are totally false. It seems that a 17-year-old idiot wrote this movie and a 10-year-old boy filmed it. With the worst performance you can find. People are tired of knives. At least move to guns or shoot. It has almost exact lines of "When A Stranger Call". With gruesome murders, only the crazy would enjoy this movie. It is obvious that the writer has no children or even cares for them. I mean show some mercy. To summarize, this movie is a "B" movie and it stunk. Just for your own good, do not even think about wasting time watching this fucking movie.
