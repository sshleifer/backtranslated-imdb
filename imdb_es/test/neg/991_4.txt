Since his whole career was a pale imitation of The Beatles, it is not surprising that, shortly after the great fiasco of the Beatles' Beatles Mystery Tour, the Monkees continued with their own insipid and creative film from a movie called "Cabeza . " Both films are not so much a real story with a plot (although MMT tried to define a plot) as a lot of sketches and fragments, interspersed with music and songs and outputs. <br /> <br /> "Head" has no plot, other than the pre-fab-four that try to break free of "the box" they are in (ie, the type of "Monkees" and the surrounding commercialism ) and, nevertheless, they always find themselves. back in the box. Most parodies involve breaks on the "fourth wall" and crossing to other scenes, apparently unrelated. Filled with messages against the Vietnam War and the group's attempts to showcase their other talents, the film bounces randomly, also to be blamed on multiple directors. <br /> <br /> The film, like Magical Mystery Tour, is now excused by some fans as "wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements". Phooey. Like MMT, there are too many kids with access to too many drugs, all trying to do something artistic and making garbage. <br /> <br /> Like MMT, "Head" has some smart moments and offers some relatively unknown Monkees songs that are pretty decent. It develops a little more charm than the MMT and it's a bit easier to sit down, but it's not ironic not at all that, like everything the Monkees did, this was just an imitation of something the Beatles did first ... even when it comes to putting an egg.
