I've heard people compare this movie with Sideways. How this comparison was made, I will never guess because this movie was not comparable to Sideways. <br /> <br /> These 2 films were as different as Star Wars and Thornbirds. The only thing they had in common was that both had wine as their theme. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews in this documentary were semi-interesting, they were ruined by the worst camera work that has ever been ... tried. I have never seen the worst camera work in my life and I compare it with the home videos accidentally taken by children of 5 years old. <br /> <br /> I give these two stars, ONLY for the interesting interviews with the types of French wines. and for showing how aggressive and corrupt American wine companies are (Are not all companies aggressive and corrupt?) I would give you -10 stars (Yes, that is NEGATIVE 10) for the deplorable, terrible, horrible, horrible, VERTIGO. INDUCING, 5 years old, could make better camera mess.
