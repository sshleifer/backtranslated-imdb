Let me give you some tips, if you are going to watch this movie just to see how they kill a lot of unpleasant characters in a dozen different ways, then you will love this movie because they all die from a horrible death, however, beyond the blood cold There is not much more. <br /> <br /> where should I start: -the characters do not attract the audience, since there are no stories for any of them, because I did not feel connected to any of them. to them, in fact, I did not like any of them, and I was so fed up with them that at the end of the movie I was encouraging the disfigured creature to kill them all. (which he did by the way) <br /> <br /> -acting badly; I mean I did not understand it, I took the Asian tour guide, for example, first spoke perfect English, then, after his little tourist boat sank, somehow got an accent out of nothing, and then, later, He started speaking normal English. <br /> <br /> -one of the worst endings for a horror: (if you can call it that) after the mutant human monster kills almost everyone, is killed by the last two idiots, or so they thought! the monster / human thing is finally killed when the beauty and the geek put a stick through their heart / nick (it was difficult to say) and presumably died right in front of them (within arm's reach) but later returns and the kill (wtf) I want to say why he did not kill them when he was right next to them. Arghhhh! I mean it was too late, it was as if the writer did not know where he wanted the story to go (or was missing a few minutes for 80 minutes to pass, so he added some more delayed turns to the movie so that people could get 80 Trash minutes instead of 75 minutes. <br /> <br /> What I did not get was why they did not kill the damn thing while he was unconscious, instead they just walked away from her like idiots and left so that I could go back and kill them, the only reason I gave him a 4 was for the gore, which was really the only thing I saw this movie until the end, and to watch them kill everyone. (no, I mean it)
