Is there anything else on earth that is more attractive than learning what to expect from our frail bodies after, um, death? The Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (a twin soul of his German colleague Jörg Buttgereit) responds step by step to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables, scalpels, surgical saws, human entrails and deformed minds. . <br /> <br /> Welcome to the autopsy room! <br /> <br /> I do not know which facets of the film, apart from its notorious reputation, may have helped it acquire a sufficiently high rating. <br /> <br /> Storywise is quite simple and straightforward: a day in the life (actually, half an hour) of a forensic with problems (or, perhaps, assistant pathologist or whoever it is) who is fed up with your morbid routine Duty and discharge your psychological tension in a non-traditional way, right at your workplace. I am puzzled by what particular message the authors attempted to deliver with this one-note argument. I suspect that it may be inspired in some way in the peculiar behavior of Udo Kier's character in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​of the film are also questionable. It is difficult to evaluate the performance of actors who do not press a single word. Your emotions are hidden behind medical masks. There is also not enough space for a great camera work, basically, the full action takes place mainly within the four walls. <br /> <br /> Authenticity: the effects and makeup are impressive and the configuration seems very plausible, but only a handful of doctors. Forensic experts can judge how the dissection is performed here (if anyone cares). Honestly, I used to think that the autopsy is done to examine the state of certain organs and determine the cause of death. Now I know that the corpses are separated, raped and humiliated, the intestines are destroyed, the brains are removed from the head, they get into the abdomen and mix with the guts, then sutures and washes the body, nothing personal . And what are these poor boys expected to write later in their deceptive autopsy reports? <br /> <br /> Factor of shock and disgust: it is very unlikely that an unprepared spectator will discover, to his horror, that the disc he intended to watch with his wife and children next to a Christmas tree turns out to be a manual of graphic video about vivisection. This dark element is hardly available, is sought by people well acquainted with the subject and who are not easily offended. Therefore, it would be useless to warn someone to sabotage this movie. They are very aware of what they are seeing exactly and what they want to see. <br /> <br /> Cerdà is a really talented and elegant director, which is clearly obvious in at least two other parts of his "trilogy": the previous ones. The Awakening ', surprising short in black and white and' Genesis' of 30 minutes, a visually stunning and capricious piece with an out of rhythm and interesting concept. And I'm pretty sure that one day he will conquer the hearts of the spectators with his new material, more oriented to the mainstream. And, sooner or later, 'Aftermath' would become a rarity for the meticulous collectors of their 'early' warming-up jobs. <br /> <br /> But in the meantime, I'm afraid it can be strictly recommended For medical students or specialists who study mental disorders and sexual deviations.
