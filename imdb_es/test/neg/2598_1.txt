I have not seen many episodes of "Family Guy" and it is a pretty sure bet that I will not see too many in the future. Some people say that comparing this program with "The Simpsons" is unfair. I absolutely believe that this program would not exist if "The Simpsons" had not arrived first and I think it wants to be "The Simpsons". I do not understand what fun this show has. In the episodes that I have seen, I understood where they wanted to laugh, I understand that someone thinks that only a joke was said, but that the joke is not funny. I find that the whole program is lazy: the title, the "jokes", there is a complete lack of inspiration in everything. <br /> <br /> The best television programs (cartoon or not) are created like this: a The script is written, it goes through several rewrites, it removes what does not work, the inspiration is lit, good things are added , they rewrite more and then it is filmed. <br /> <br /> I imagine an episode "Family Guy" will be created like this: a script is written and filmed.
