While it is true that the film is interesting, the execution leaves much to be desired (like Blood Orgy of the Leather Girls, I Spit on Your Grave and Born in Flames, all superiors). I do not think it's not porn, but porn is in the eye of the beholder: if it works like a porn for someone, who am I to say that he / she is wrong? I was quite surprised by the assertion in Winkimation's generally thoughtful review ("What a shame") that "for once, we actually see faces of men when they arrive". A few years ago I did occasional independent reviews for an adult magazine and I remember seeing many faces of men when they arrived. I think this is probably more common when the movie has some of the few "stars" of male porn (and especially when that man is the director). Although, of course, I can not refer to any specific title, I know there are some cases in the work of Ron Jeremy, uh. I also do not know that I would agree that a man is necessarily showing vulnerability in his face when he comes.
