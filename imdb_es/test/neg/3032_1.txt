The words almost do not let me describe how terrible this project of Irish vanity really is (financed by Canadian taxpayers, both federal and Albertan). <br /> <br /> Suddenly a good-looking Canadian woman (Kathy Ranheim) suddenly appears. The real life was a star athlete in Alberta, for no other reason to secure the Canadian content. The credits also indicate that some Calgary pubs were helpful. <br /> <br /> Here everything is wrong filmed and at least third hand (the pieces of Trainspotting, Lock Stock, Snatch and Reservoir Dogs are the most obvious thefts). Avoid like the plague unless you fancy one of those nights "so bad that they are almost fun" in front of your TV.
