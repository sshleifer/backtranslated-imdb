There is nothing special to see here, the animation is outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era. This movie has an original story, but if it does not have a plot or original characters, in my opinion it's not worth seeing. I'm not saying that the movie was bad, it was just a typical anime story and I thought I had seen it a thousand times. So if you are looking for something original, see something else.
