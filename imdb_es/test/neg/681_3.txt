This documentary is full of problems. <br /> <br /> How arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own family? I understand that you think the topic is interesting. I was bored with that. This is not a fascinating story for me, and I do not know why you would think it was. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say anything, but I have to say: most people in this movie are just not attractive. And that's fine, not all are pretty. But his camera technique, sticking the lens on his face so he can not help but feel overwhelmed by his unpleasantness because he's filling his 47 "TV, is not nice, I had to raise my hand half the time to protect myself. of the warts, the wrinkles, the bags under the eyes and the yellow teeth ... Actually, I'm trying not to sound inhuman, but remove the camera so that it's not like strangers who breathe in my face. <br /> < The camera work in this "film" is amateur level, it is the kind of camera work that is seen by everyone with a camcorder in a family picnic, an uninteresting, unstable frame, even static shots are made of careless way, if you're going to do this to live. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not see what the problem is about.
