It's so bad, I can not tear myself up. I keep asking myself: "Why?" "Why?" with each scene. <br /> <br /> There is no continuity, but again if you want to make a very open homosexual movie with a fetish attitude towards all things Big, Big boats, Big boys, Big planes, then you do not have to worry about things as the plot or the character. I'm confused and very concerned that the CAG looks so much like Richard Pryor. It seems wrong to put an aspect of Pryor in such a terrible movie. But I can not tear myself up. This movie is the first movie I've reviewed. That's how bad and strange it is. It motivated me to join this site. I counted 50 main characters. Maybe if I was drugged, I could continue this, but as it is, I feel like I'm in a kind of endless dream, where it's always 1988, and we were the best fans on earth.
