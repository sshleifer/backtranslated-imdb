This movie was one of those movies that completely deceived me into believing that it was a cheesy slasher movie from the 80s, based on the cover, but it was not like that. Possibly it was one of the worst slasher movies I've seen. The image on the cover does not match any part or scene of the film; in fact it did not involve a chainsaw. Not even the tag line fits into the movie. The film is about a group of cheerleaders and two barns that escape to a desolate cabin in the cold forest for a weekend getaway. However, things get colder when they begin to be killed by an unknown murderer. At the same time, the local sheriff's department is chasing a dangerous killer. I will name the problems in a list. <br /> <br /> 1. The acting. Chico was cheap and horribly bad. It felt unnatural and it seemed like it was very well written. None of the actors seemed to have tried to act with good intentions and, therefore, seemed foolish and tired. All the characters in the film acted badly, so I will not point to specific people, but I will say that the drug addicts did a horrible job, as well as the police and the cheerleaders, which is not a surprise. br /> <br /> 2. The plot. This story had created a perfect plot for a good fashion movie, but instead it splashed out of plot holes, useless and unnecessary scenes and a stupid general story of the murderer's intentions. Were there big holes in the conspiracy, including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and yet he would still be in the girl group when it happened? The ex-convict practically had no purpose in the film, apart from being a useless plot device. There was random and unnecessary sex, and the nudity spread throughout the body, even for a B movie or for my taste it was too much. As for the intentions of the murderer, let's say it was stupid and that it does not make sense why he is killing the girls. In addition, there were also some very predictable murders that I saw coming about 30 miles away. <br /> <br /> 3. The technical side. The lighting was fine, it certainly was not the worst lighting I had seen in a movie, but there were spots where it was supposed to be dark, but it looked more like the afternoon. The house seemed darker with the lights on, then with the lights off. The work of the camera was normal, it did not have good shots of establishment, nor panoramic or incredible approaches, although it believed that it had finished the work, it was creating certain suspense with its framing. The sense of the plot, the development of the character and the performance, was a great disappointment and a waste of time. What I thought would have been a great slasher movie turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was really bad and wooden, it almost did not make sense in the plot and there was no emotion in this movie. However, the technical aspect of this movie saved me, because if the camera worked or the lighting was bad, I would have turned off the DVD player and something else would have appeared. I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy b movies, as well as those who follow cult classics, because this movie certainly is. I would partially recommend this movie for those who enjoy the movies of the 80s. But for me, this movie was unfortunate and absolutely horrible.
