Talk about being boring! <br /> <br /> I got this expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical Night in the Galactic Railroad. I expected to see crazy stories and madness of an eccentric man and discover his inspirations for such a strange material. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Spring and Chaos is mostly boring, with only sporadic moments of innovative animation. Certainly, it is not anything special or as good as NOTGR, which is something I suggest you see in its place. Leave this hole alone. If you MUST see it, then change it or find it somewhere cheap. Do not pay the top dollar.
