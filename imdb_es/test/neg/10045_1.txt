Yesterday I saw this movie and I thought it was horrible; It was useless and just stupid. The alleged conspiracy referred to a future boyfriend also trapped in the world's problems to relate to his girlfriend and the other people in his life. It disappears on your wedding day (in a suit no less) and gets hooked with a variety of weirdos. <br /> <br /> We saw it with a bus full of people on the way to Atlantic City and they all agreed. That was a terrible movie. I tried to be profound but I was not; It was stupid and offensive. If I was not on a bus, I would have left the movie. Anyone who is considering watching the movie or renting or buying the video that has been prevented.
