Although he had enjoyed THE SATANIC RITES OF Dracula (1974), he knew he should not expect too much from his even more defamed predecessor! Surely, the smallest of the Hammer Draculas (Marcus Hearn in the audio commentary of THE CREEPING FLESH [1973] even calls it the nadir of the studio!), The film really wobbles due to its total headlessness, and now with a Shame dated. the updating of the myth (the modern environment actually adapted better to the SATANIC RITES) ... even if, in fact, it is still much more advisable to play as Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)! <br /> <br /> Despite Christopher Lee's vociferous attacks on the film, he still cuts out an unarguably striking figure as the undead vampire (even if he appears very little and is inexplicably confined to a stage); In the same way, Peter Cushing delivers his usual committed commitment. The only other acting work worth mentioning in the film is the one Christopher Neame (son of director Ronald) gave him as Johnny Alucard (!), Even if that's just how incredibly amazing it is! Unfortunately, the two best-known female members of the cast (the two usual terrorists), Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro, can not overcome their physical attributes. <br /> <br /> The camera work is by Dick Bush (who had filmed THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW [1971] and, for Hammer, WHEN THE DINOSAURS REGULATED THE EARTH [1970] and TWINS OF EVIL [1971] - but perhaps he is best known for his long-standing relationship with Ken Russell), which handles some nice atmosphere everywhere, especially during three crucial sequences: the fight in the carriage at the start (properly Gothic); the hysterical sequence of the black mass, followed by the resuscitation of Dracula; and the final confrontation between Lee and Cushing's Van Helsing.
