The success of Anna Kokkinos with 'Head On' now seems to depend entirely on the script and the great performance of Alex Dimitriades. The degree to which the latter, "The book of revelation" is both derivative, pretentious and absolutely unoriginal (with the exception of the cinematography of Tristan Milani) seems to confirm it. . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there have already been quite a few Australian films dealing with these issues, some criticized for "sexism" (and / or explicit sex scenes) in the 70s and 80s and beyond and perhaps It is worth looking again after this fluff. Of course, setting everything up in the world of ballet and making it all very slow (and in your choreography, like an experimental number of the Dutch Ballet of the 1960s) suggests Great Art if you have not traveled much, and then only if you never it progressed beyond the Theory of Art 101. <br /> <br /> Add to the pretension, overwhelmingly the arc dialogue ("it will do what we command ...") and all the shebang falls on its well-financed face. Then there are the 'sexy' bits: directly from Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Given the charming but truncated performance of Colin Friels, how about an original thriller from the real city? <br /> <br /> Everything in Everyone, with 'The Book of Revelation', the feminist project was delayed a decade more, and with the voluntary and deeply imitative collaboration (of male writers like Henry Miller, William Burroughs, even Bukowski ) of some collective in Melbourne. Oz, suffering from a form of educational and ideological amnesia! No revelations await us here.
