Superhero Movie (2008) is the most recent in the long line about "parody" movies that I despise so much. I wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but I know it's not horrible enough to put the last nail in the coffin. <br /> <br /> If Meet the Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel When it comes to Hollywood movies, the superhero movie is probably at the top. Unfortunately, Meet the Spartans was really miles below the canyon, and this movie is just coming. <br /> <br /> Superhero Movie has a decent cast of celebrities from the C-list. It has Drake Bell (the child of Drake and Josh of Disney), Leslie Nielson (Airplane!), Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock), and some others scattered everywhere. Although it has the power of the star to light a 40-watt bulb, the film does not use any humor. <br /> <br /> This movie lasts approximately 80 minutes, most of which is devoted to following the plot of Spiderman, and not a single joke is fun. I did not laugh or chuckle or smile all the time. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie. Do not even think about it. For the love of cinema, just avoid it and maybe you will not go out with another one. <br /> <br /> ... oh, who am I cheating? They will probably go out with another one for the fall.
