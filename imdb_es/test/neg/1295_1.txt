Avoid this movie. If you are waiting for "The Poseidon Adventure" (1972), you may experience nothing more than a case of "curves". This movie does not offer more than two extremely long and prolonged hours of boredom. <br /> <br /> The cast members act as if they are angry at the irritation of a bathtub of water that overflows into a bed. Of the petunias of an insignificant. The script is totally unreal, and the movie does not even have the feeling of a disaster movie. In fact, everything about this movie is bad, with the exception of Tom Courtenay. It is unfortunate that such a fine actor has been dragged, by an avalanche of misrepresentations, to appear in such a wash. When this movie was made, the Poseidon must have overturned, in its watery tomb, in a sea of ​​shame. And, Shelley Winters will be resurrected, from the dead (directly from the Poseidon), to pursue anyone who dares to see this pathetic film. I rate this movie with 1 out of 10, but it really deserves a zero. This movie will make you want to avoid, or turn completely against the water. And, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth. It can even make you want to see "Jaws" (1975), and make friends with a great target.
