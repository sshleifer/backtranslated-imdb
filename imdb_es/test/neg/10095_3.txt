"In the sweltering summer of 1958, the Deuces, a gang of thugs from Brooklyn, find their territory threatened when the leader of a rival gang, the Vipers, is released from prison." Leon (Stephen Dorff), the leader of the Deuces He tries to guide his children through bloody fights to keep the Vipers away, but when his brother (Brad Renfro) falls into a sensual and dangerous relationship with Annie (Fairuza Balk), the sister of a Viper, and his own girlfriend is brutally attacked, "Leon and his gang are in a total war to save their brother, their girl, and their neighborhood!" According to the DVD case description, it is definitely not a "Basketball Diary". <br /> <br /> Think of it like "West Side Story" getting hit on the head with baseball bats and steel pipes, since the stickball left Brooklyn with the Dodgers. "Deuces Wild" has some great Hollywood sets, 1950s cars and band songs sound, and, in large part, is very well photographed by John A. Alonzo. History and direction never go beyond these strengths, allowing the film to peak during its first minutes and continue downhill. The cast looks good when you read the credits, but it translates into an old, flabby mess of fake pompadours, blood and Brylcreem. and a scary wig. A feeling of sadness and regret permeates production. <br /> <br /> *** Deuces Wild (5/3/02) Scott Kalvert ~ Stephen Dorff, Brad Renfro, Fairuza Balk, Frankie Muniz
