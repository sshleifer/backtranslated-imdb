"Cover Girl" is a mediocre musical of the Second World War that has nothing memorable, except for his song "Long Ago and Far Away". This movie came out before Gene Kelly really reached his artistic rhythm, and while there is evidence of his growing talent here, he is mostly Rita Hayworth's partner. And there is the problem. Rita Hayworth is beautiful, of that there is no doubt. But she simply is not a convincing presence on the screen. I've always found myself wanting to like it more than I really do, and this movie is no exception. She's just not a very good actress, and she's not even a very good dancer. With an aspect as attractive as her, there is something unusual about her, and this movie suffers for that. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
