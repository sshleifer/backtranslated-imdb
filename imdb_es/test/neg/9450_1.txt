Dreamland started moderately interesting, but never went anywhere except Tedium city. A matter of low rents without name actors and ridiculous effects, not recommended for any reason. The best that can be said is that it seems that they actually filmed it in the Nevada desert. That's it, I can not think of a good thing, besides that, in this stinking one. The ending is supposed to be some kind of revelation, but it falls like the rest. Oh, I thought of another positive point about this cheese, it is recorded in little more than an hour, although it is still exhausted long before that date. When the girl begins to walk through the desert at night, it seems to last forever and continues to get worse from there. Attempts at horror are not effective in the least. History is an attempt to feel the style of a twilight zone, but it fails badly. Check out "Retroactive" for a good science fiction movie B.
