A young couple decides to flee to sunny California. They never arrive at their destination when they decide to stop at the rest stop. <br /> <br /> After a fight with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow insists on stopping to stop. When she is ready to leave, she leaves the bathroom to find her missing boyfriend with her car, leaving her trapped on the back roads of Texas with only an abandoned caravan to keep her company. <br /> <br /> Rest Stop is one of those cheap and sticky horror movies that could become a cult classic. Can Rest Stop become a cult classic that you can ask? Well, the three elements you need to become a cult classic are merit, sex and artistic merit. The rest stop has a lot of gore, and while I do not want to reveal too much, it contains lots of unpleasant blood stains. This movie has everything from the bad boy who runs on a policeman's legs with his car several times until he uses a pneumatic drill on a girl's leg. Sometimes, it can be as bloody as a movie. It also has a free love scene and, however, quite intimate in the first few minutes of the movie. Therefore, sex is covered. Now the hard ?? Do you have any artistic merit? Do you never see the face of the bad boy? You see flashes, profiles, silhouettes of shadows. It is a faceless, implacable monster that only has a high score on the scale of artistic merit. Does the movie have very few characters apart from the main character? Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander). Since she spends a large part of the movie on her own, she can not reveal her thoughts in the course of a conversation, but she must say them out loud so that we, the audience, know what she is thinking. Sometimes, this can be a bit irritating; However, it is a brave step by the writer (John Shiban) and works for most of the movie. As the public knows, being completely alone and isolated from civilization is scary enough even when you are not being chased by psychotic killers. <br /> <br /> So, Rest Stop will become a cult classic? Probably it will because throughout the gore, sex and debatable artistic merit, it also has many chills, an interesting and inventive plot and leads to many screams on the screen since the main character does many things that you definitely should not do . When fleeing from a psychotic killer. (How fun are horror movies if you can not complain about the stupidity of the victims?)
