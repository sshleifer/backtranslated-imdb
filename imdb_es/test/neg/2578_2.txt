This is a known fact, Mr. Seagal can not smile, he can act, he can kick his butt, there are weak smiles, there are no real smiles, he does not laugh out loud and it does not make sense to see this confusing movie. We see an overweight Mr. Seagal like Dr. Wesley Maclaren, who desperately needs a haircut and his real daughter, Ayako, appeared as an assistant in his office. Story: Well, then Wesley lives in another damn interior with his sweet daughter Holly. They sit down and enjoy their tea with red flowers and tortillas and at the other end of the city, a leader of the overweight militia decides to make the whole city sick by spreading a virus that travels by air and kills in a matter of 2 days thinking who can survive as he had an antidote. Problem, there is no antidote and the one that exists only retains the virus for a while. They contacted the CIA and even they can not help and only one person is not sick, Wesley's daughter, Holly. Then they hunt her thinking that the cure is in her blood. Wesley manages to grab his daughter and take her with her grandfather, who is a native Indian. Together with his sister-in-law Ann, they go to a base where there is a hidden laboratory to find a cure, but even the soldiers are slowly dying and others will also die if they do not find the cure in time. And to shorten the moment, neither Ann nor Wesley are infected by the virus ... hmm. A scene of weak struggle. The terrible movie and all the men in it desperately need a ladder master.
