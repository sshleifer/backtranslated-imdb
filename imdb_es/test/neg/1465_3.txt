I found this on the shelf and fainted with joy! I danced to the counter, slapped my money and ran home. You know what?! I fell asleep less than half the way! I tried again the next day ... YAWN !! What the hell!? !! I could not see! I love all the other things he has done (I still have not seen the one that has the monster). What gives? It's me? Or the? Very sad. Boo hoo P.S, I liked the camera work.
