Porno legend Gregory Dark directs this corny horror movie that has Glen Jacobs (WWF / WWE Kane / as it is called today) in his film debut. He plays Jacob Goodknight, a blind serial killer who is strong, is taking his eyes off people. The plot, however, has a group of young people with problems that clean the historic hotel in which Goodnight resides and then is expelled by him. Hemmingway is not. It starts out like a funny dopey B movie, but soon it becomes too tedious to be fun. I'm glad I came in with low expectations, but even those were not met. How can you have a porn king directing and still suffer from lack of nudity? For shame. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Samantha Noble discovers her ass briefly
