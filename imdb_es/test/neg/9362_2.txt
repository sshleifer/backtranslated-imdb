This is a Toilet Pictures movie. If the name of the production company is an indication of how stinky a movie is, then this would be the case. I think I'm not really a fan of horror films, it's not that I'm a chicken, but this year alone I have not really been frightened by what is offered so far, whether it's from the West or from Asia. 9:56 is not different, it's a great premise, but it's a poor execution, and it's based on clich√© techniques (do I think these are the only tools available for trade?) To try to get some moments of palpitations. <br /> <br /> Se -jin (Ko So-young) is a lonely career woman, who one day realizes that some apartments in the block of flats opposite her, suffer blackouts simultaneously to the 9:56 pm every day. No, she's not a voyeurist, but a series of unexplained deaths in the neighborhood, including one that sits on a subway, begins to deepen the mystery surrounding these deaths. <br /> <br /> With horror In the movies, there is always a pseudological explanation within the film about how ghosts occur. That is the most interesting thing that happens in the film, the unraveling of the "Truth", although the most experienced film lovers will not find it hard to guess the plot halfway. Which, of course, makes it a very unsatisfying experience to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of characters like the girl in a wheelchair and the neighbors who take turns taking care of her, as well as a school detective. , a child with mental problems and a spooky passenger train. But following the formula of the genre, these people are usually there as fodder for death, or in this case, the senseless characters of the false trail whose sole objective is to fool the audience, no matter if they get tangled up, or they add little to advance the plot. br /> <br /> And do not make me start with the techniques used here. Quick cuts, sudden appearances, long haired ghouls (ahhhhhhhh, easter!) That can not move properly, plentiful amount of blood flowing down a mountain for free, and the list goes on. But I give credit to the sound engineers for creating some crunching sounds in the ears that are used every time the ghosts move, even though it looks like a trick of a single trick. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this, even if I'm a terror fanatic. It's a complete waste of a promising premise, and in the end, you feel like you've been taken for a walk. A very long and painful to endure. It is time for there to be some innovation in this genre, otherwise, one film will easily resemble another, with ugly monsters with long hair that move strangely but with the ability to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud sounds. Oh, and someone can grease those doors while they're on that, too.
