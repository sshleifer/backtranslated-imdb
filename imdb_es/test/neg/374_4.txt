Although the story is good and represents what I expected from Sam Elliot, my DVD copy contained almost unbearable synchronization problems. The dialogue was almost 3 seconds from the movement of the lips throughout the entire film. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I would be very careful when buying any DVD of the movie without verifying the problem. <br /> <br /> It would also follow the ratings of recommended censors, especially in relation to the use of drugs and language. <br /> <br /> This film could become a classic and silent police film and, with the previous warnings, I can recommend it to possible spectators
