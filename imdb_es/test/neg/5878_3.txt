Technically speaking, this movie stinks ... hahaha. However, it is also hilarious. Whether or not it is intentionally fun I do not know. Horrible in all aspects, it is also the only film I know that has 1) a fat child played by a thin actor with a fat suit (very obvious), 2) an attractive actress of 30 who plays a character that is supposed who must be over 60, and 3) the highest number of compliments for plastic margaritas. Do not take this movie seriously, just watch it to see laughter ... a great party movie.
