Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen! "The Beginning" was not the best either, but it was better than this one. This is not a good way to get to the original movie. It's just horrible! The CGI hyenas were so fake in both movies! Why not use real animals? I enjoyed the old Sinbad movies better than this. I was very disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this film waste is the cinematography and the clothes that really captured that era. I understand why this movie was remade as "The Beginning". It's so bad, in my opinion. Where does the money come from to waste it like that? Give me a multi-million dollar budget and I'll show you how to do it!
