Imagine what it must have been like for John Agar. One of the handsome men in Hollywood. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He is making movies like this. I remember it in "Tarantula" where it was not so bad. Unfortunately, there is nothing that recommends this movie. The monster is mute uninteresting and incompetent. The police is boring. The teenagers are boring. The plot is stupid. The people run around. There are events that do nothing to advance the plot. There are dances that go on and on, and then there is no attack. There is an idiotic love triangle that nobody cares about. It is not even rural or outrageous. It's just not worth anything. The agar could also have been a post. He has not given anything to do.
