I had high hopes for this movie, although I had not read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane together, they should be fine. But the film does not fulfill the promise. I kept waiting for more depth to the characters and there was not. I have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend to fall in love. That can happen. But we never got to know the characters. I would have liked to focus more on them. The movie reminded me of places in Bridges of Madison County, and that movie was much better. I felt a lot for the characters in that movie, and there was a chemistry (much more passion) between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep that did not exist between Gere and Lane. Each of them are very good actors in their own right. It just is not the right movie for them together.
