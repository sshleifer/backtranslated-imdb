I was really disappointed by this film for which I had high hopes. It seems that they rushed to take advantage of the success of the comedies of the rioters at that time (including the "Libeled Lady" of MGM, which featured two of the same stars) and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy. After three years of pairing, they were still attractive to see and filled with fire in their scenes together, but a weak script and a hasty premise destroy any possibility of it being a great follow-up to the "Libeled Lady" of the previous year and the Two Man "movies they had done before this." Double Wedding "tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer, Myrna Loy, who tries to dominate the life of her sister (Florence Rice), her future sister-in-law (John Beal) and his own servants (which include Sidney Toler and Mary Gordon) When the independent spirit William Powell enters his life, having distracted Rice and Beal from Loy's constant control, Loy meets his partner. Yes, an interesting premise falls short, it's sad to say, because the character of Loy is so one-dimensional that it's hard to even like it, let alone see Powell fall in love with it, which we know will soon happen. It is another attempt to put a woman with a career vocation in her place, changing her views on what kind of life she has been leading, something that Hollywood often did during her golden age. When Loy says he does not have time to run his business and have a man in his life, it's a growl. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, apart from Powell, there is a free spirit Jessie Ralph on board. A rich, salty older woman who helped Loy start her business, she meets Powell and can see right away through Loy's cold statements that she hates him. Rice and Beal are a boring couple, and the whole premise that Powell stands between them makes no sense. Then, an ex-wife of Powell appears, which is not really necessary at that late point in the story, and the final scene of the wedding (where a crowd of people tries to get into Powell's little trailer) is a weak attempt at achieve it Some farce (However, it is funny that Powell continues to be hit by elements that Loy hit with Edgar Kennedy, those giggles are welcome, as there are very few others). Powell and Loy would do better in two more recent comedies. Love You Again "and" Love Crazy ", which are sophisticated, witty and fun, this movie tries to be all three, but ends with a sophisticated boredom.
