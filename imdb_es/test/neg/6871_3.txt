And only one, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> That reason is Margaret Leighton. She is a wonderful actress, both on stage and on screen. Although we have little chance of seeing it. I think that is especially true in the United States. <br /> <br /> Here she plays a nice role. Not only that, but it is also very beautiful and is destined to be a kind of bomb. <br /> <br /> Walter Pigeon does not hold the tradition of the Drummond artists. It is always reliable but it is not very fun. He is not a scoundrel or a rascal. Consequently, this seemed like a huge effort with little action or suspense. But take a look at Leighton.
