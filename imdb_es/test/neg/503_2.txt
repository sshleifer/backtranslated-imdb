The operative rule in making this movie seems to have been "never do a 1 minute scene when you can do a 10 minute scene". This was a principle established from the beginning with an endlessly long representation of the graduation of the Harvard class of 1870. The point of that scene, I suppose, was to present some of the main figures in the story and give some background - which is somewhat effective when you compare the idealism of the Harvard graduation ceremony with the realism of life in Johnson County, Wyoming, but it goes on and on, and that sets the stage for a movie that features repeated stretches of mental numbness nothing, made even worse by the fact that I found that a large part of the dialogue was almost incoherent. In the end, I could not even see this in one session. I overcame half and had to put it aside for a couple of days before I could crawl to see how it turned out. <br /> <br /> My reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame. , because there are positive aspects here. The performances are generally of high caliber, especially Kris Kristofersson as Averill, Christopher Walken as Champion and Isabelle Huppert as Ella. The basic story, interspersed as such around the present mind-numbing nothingness, is potentially interesting, and focuses on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in Johnson County and the efforts of a local livestock enterprise to stop them by killing to several of them Collaboration with the government and the army. There are also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots. Having said that, everything could have been done frankly in half the time, and I should have done it. In the end, all those positive potentials are eliminated by, again, the nothingness that numbs the mind around which the film seems to spin. Seriously - 2/10.
