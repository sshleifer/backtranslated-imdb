Scott's collection of icons of the 80s can not save this teenage disaster. But then I guess that's why it was just a movie for television and not a great movie. William A. Schwartz (writer) comes up with something more like "Stewardess School", except that this movie is more boring. This movie is not really stupid, just boring and completely plotless. The only reason to see this could be to see Tina Yothers in a real role after Family Ties. After this movie and the same "Cruise Class" class, I guess Mr. Scott recovered and re-directed comedies, which was his best move so far. 4 out of 10
