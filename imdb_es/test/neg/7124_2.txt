The original GRUDGE (the original American remake) surprisingly achieved almost everything you could do well with a ghost movie. He had suspense, a dark and moody atmosphere, some good jolts and some genuinely spooky images. THE GRUDGE 2 tries all these techniques, but in the end it fails, it only shows us the same thing that we saw in the first movie, as well as a disorderly history that constantly changes from Tokyo to California. It begins in Tokyo with some schoolgirls entering the house, now heavily blocked by a strip of police tape. One of them is face to face with a ghost girl with wide eyes, while she is trapped in a closet. She goes out, screaming frantically and everyone gets out of there. Next, we head to America, where Karen's mother is sent by Japan to Japan to look for her and take her home. Finally, we find ourselves following a very familiar concept that involves a curious boy and girl who investigate the history of a mysterious house. From the beginning, we approach the girls who are disappearing one by one, as well as a child who hears strange noises in the next apartment at night, all of which leads to a very unsatisfactory ending. The scenes of "fear" are boring and ineffective. Like The Ring 2, avoid this terrible sequel to God ...
