Why do I hate this? Let me list the forms: <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Mary Pickford, but a 32-year-old woman who plays with a 12-year-old child is stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a fight scene in which children throw bricks at each other and it is considered fun --- and it lasts for 15 minutes <br /> <br /> It is strange how none of children is hurt even remotely <br /> <br /> The title cards contain a lot of racial and ethnic insults <br /> <br /> For a "family" movie the fights were too violent (I loved it when Pickford was hitting her with a small child!) and the humor was just stupid. <br /> <br /> Seriously, in 40 minutes I gave up and turned it off. Insults, racism and young children throwing bricks approached me. Nor was there any plot I could see. The only thing worth seeing in this film was William Haines, who was one of the most prominent men in the silent era. <br /> <br /> Simply painful. Avoid.
