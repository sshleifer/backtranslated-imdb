After watching this movie, I could not help noticing the parallels between this and another movie called America 3000. Both were very bad on celluloid in the mid-1980s, after the disasters of the apocalypse. Obviously, in both films there are fake sets, wooden performances and stupid monsters. About the only difference between the two is that the main villain here (played by Angelika Jager) has a very thick accent. Avoid this, unless you are watching the MST3K version. Joel and the bots barely save this turkey.
