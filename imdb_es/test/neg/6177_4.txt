Well, Killshot is not horrible, but it's coming. The production values ​​are decent and the main actors do a pretty good job (with the exception of Rosario Dawson in a lost role), but the story is just pathetic. I do not know if Elmore Leonard's book had such silly characters, since I have not read it, but I suppose the book was supposed to be at least a little comical. The movie does not have detectable humor. After the first twenty minutes, you will scream on the screen: "Oh come on! Nobody is SO stupid!" In short, and without any spoilers, all act in a convenient way for the plot, which anyway does not make sense. A very frustrating and unrealistic film, which may explain that it remains on the shelf all the time it did.
