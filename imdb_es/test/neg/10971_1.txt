This film takes many liberties with known historical facts. Even some small things like Flynn licking one seal after another, when he would almost certainly use a damp sponge, is one of the annoying things. Flynn was never tried for murder or murder. It is not known that he has caught his mother making love with another man, and it is not known that he had a homosexual relationship with anyone, and did not end up in the row of skates in Sydney. He did not get his role of two and a half pennies in In the Wake of the Bounty for imposture and this role did not make him a well-dressed movie star. <br /> <br /> This is just a mediocre movie in which the name Errol Flynn has been added just to sell more tickets and more videos.
