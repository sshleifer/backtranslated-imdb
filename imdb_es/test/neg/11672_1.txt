Every time I see this movie it gives me the same impression: some parts of it are so incredibly stupid / bad that they bother me, they are not intentional and there are many of them; the rest is simply bad, stupid and / or irrelevant. A film like Evil Dead is credited for being bad on its own because it is the desired result: it is stupid and corny because Sam Raimi was successful in what he was trying to do. This film does not have that excuse, it's stupid and corny because the filmmakers failed miserably. The result of shit accumulates on top of shit writing and shit interpretations to make it a pity that the lowest rating that can be given to a movie is a "horrible" watch this movie has the same effect as listening to an essay by Billy Madison: "Everyone in this room is now more stupid to have heard it." I should be able to give this movie something around a -5.
