I gave this 2 stars a maximum of 10 possible. <br /> <br /> I went into this without realizing what it was, and I discovered that it is apparently a kind of African musical, since people start singing every few minutes. <br /> <br /> None of the songs rhyme, most of them do not say anything sensible, and they all have the same non-existent melody, if you could call it "melody". <br /> Karmen is a tall young woman, spectacularly built, with the longest braids I have ever seen. [The actress looks as if she has made some model.] <br /> <br /> The movie starts in a prison for women, although not like any other prison I have seen or heard: the inmates use whatever. I wish - and it seems that a party is being held. <br /> <br /> Karmen dances frantically, and the woman director of the prison, Angelique, [a beautifully beautiful woman] is definitely interested erotically. She and Karmen dance together. Later, Karmen visits the director's room and they make love. Unfortunately, the scene is not detailed and is very brief, although there is some nudity. <br /> <br /> Karmen escapes from prison and then we watch her dance. Leading another group where a man, named Lamine, maybe a Colonel, was never really clear who he was, he watches her. He is with a young woman who does not like the seductive dance of Karmen and there is a dance between the two women. <br /> <br /> After that, the story [as it is] becomes even more confusing. <br /> <br /> With Lamine in jail, out of jail, and who knows where. <br /> <br /> Karmen may be involved with a group of smugglers or thieves. <br /> <br /> There is more singing. More dances and a scene from Angelique that obviously suffered a lack of love. <br /> <br /> The movie works its way to its end, and I let out a sigh of relief at being finished. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
