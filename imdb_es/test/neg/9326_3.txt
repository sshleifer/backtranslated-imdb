Once again, I have been fooled by seemingly intelligent critics who make apparently intelligent comments about an obviously horrible movie. In fact, I put on my shoes, got into my car, burned expensive gas and drove to the nearest rental place AFTER reading the reviews, I paid the 4 dollars needed and changed to rent this thing. I tell you that this is not worth it for the tiny kilos-calories expended in raising your index finger to change the channels of a TV remote control. <br /> <br /> I even gave him a few more minutes after seeing all the telltale signs of a dog-pile pedigree. These are presented as clinical symptoms of a director who is a. is senile or, b. he is only marginally interested in the film he is forced to create. I saw a similar deterioration with the chain of ridiculous caricatures of John Carpenter in recent years. <br /> <br /> Here are a couple of scenes as incriminating evidence. The priest is having a disturbing dream ... supposedly a harbinger of the evil to come, as he seems intent on opening the archaeological feature that harbors the devil. The dream is a ridiculous collage of disconnected images that come out of the Twilight Zone stock images. A tick of the clock moves through the darkness of the dream landscape, which implies, what?, The unfathomable mystery of Time? ... Big Deal! A disembodied head, painted in demon traits with store-quality Halloween makeup, blinks from side to side in a convulsive frenzy. Every time I see this effect, a big scam on Jacob's Ladder bothers me. This, in itself, almost instantly discredits a movie. <br /> <br /> The whole accumulation of the archaeological dig itself is ridiculous. Everything is so obvious ... so tired and overloaded ... the only possible answer is boredom. In a moment of the excavation, the priest comments that the statues of the angels surround a sarcophagus ... they all point towards the crypt with their weapons. He asks "Look at these surrounding statues ... It's like they're holding ... something ... down!" This is supposed to create tension ... critical mass ... but it's not even close! How can there be suspense if you treat the audience as a group of idiots who have to EXPLAIN the suspense as it goes? The image has been finished in the first place, but the added comments only add insults to the injuries in my opinion. Soon after, the tomb is "decorated" with the remains of the soldiers stationed there to protect the main atrium (another blatant scam from The Keep, by the way). Who, by shouting out loud, did the make-up effects for this movie? The blood actually had that pink quality that can be seen in the films of Tromaville of the 70. At this point, I almost convinced myself that they simply forgot the makeup and had to go to Wal-Mart for the sake of time and money. <br /> <br /> DO NOT listen to brilliant comments about this one! I'll be keeping an eye on Schrader, too. It looks like it might be time to hang up your gloves. Perhaps a close friend offers a mild warning to resign while there is still dignity in the memory of the films that have passed.
