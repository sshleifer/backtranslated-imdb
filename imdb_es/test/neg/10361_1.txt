I mean, it's okay, 5 stupid kids are going to Oklahoma to find a magical marijuana forest ... this could have been fun, if it had not been for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogues were not even half an inch of fun. The only thing I almost showed my teeth was when the dumb cops stopped the teenagers in Oklahoma or Kansas ... The plot could have been fun, if it had not been for an abysmal interpretation. If you even think about watching this fucking movie, do not do it. What a fool it is for the guy to get away from the police by telling them he is gay, as his friend did (only he was not pretending ...) and that there is a joke about the various meanings of the word "gay". "I'm laughing without hair ....... NO ....... Anyway ... THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN !!
