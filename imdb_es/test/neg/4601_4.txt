This movie has some good lines, but seeing the imitation of Rourke, less than masterful, Dillon, just left me wanting to see the original. I like Marisa Tomei, but it's not Faye Dunaway. <br /> <br /> Also, in my opinion, the number one rule of the movies is to make the main character someone you care about. You may NOT LOVE the character, but you should worry about what happens to him. This is achieved in Barfly with the funny gag of running over the fights with Eddie the bartender. The main fight in Factotum is when, without any provocation, he approaches the character of Lily Taylor in a bar, hits her on the floor and calls her a whore. <br /> <br /> All this simply did not work. Again, some great lines, some funny laughs, but as a movie in general it's a failure. Mediocre attempt to reinvent something that was brilliant, and you can not overcome that. Following? We're going to redo Breakfast at Tiffany with Kate Hudson.
