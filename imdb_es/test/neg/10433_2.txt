When I think of a movie from the 1970s, it's not what I think. I do not want a soundtrack of Robin Trower monotonous and of a single song; I want a soundtrack punctuated with the 40 best chewing gum songs of the day that personified the 70's. The generic karaoke disco music during the graduation party scene was especially annoying. The performance (if you can call it that) was very rigid, and seemed simply read from the script in monotone. The quality of the film and the work of the camera was horrible; the dialogue was murky, the script seemed to come together without much thought and the plot was thin, if not nonexistent. I can not believe that people give him the high marks I have read here. Basically, a poor and forgettable attempt to recreate a beloved era of the past. Two stars is all I can do. I'm sorry guys.
