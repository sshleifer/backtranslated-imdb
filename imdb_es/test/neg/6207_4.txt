This is another new version of Bollywood from a Hollywood movie. Hitch ... If I'm right. <br /> <br /> The movie has some great moments that will make you laugh out loud, which frankly only come from Govinda, who has become a legend in Indian cinema and will always bring his A game in terms of comedies. Another advantage is Rajpal Yadav; that is hilarious as the gangster who imitates "Don", an Indian icon of the cinema. Lara Dutta is an advantage ... I know I look superficial but it's mainly because I have a weakness for her, she tries to be funny but seems to be forced. Her performance is weak ... but she still shines. Salman Khan is atrocious, tries to bring the cool and charming depths, but fails miserably, acts in excess and screams for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> 'That's not a partner that acts, that's called being mentally challenged.' <br /> <br /> Katrina Kaif is just plain bad ... she's not very good at anything. Without charisma, without talent ... and I do not see why people consider her beautiful ... The plot was outlandish and I found it hard to believe that the character of Katrina was attracted to Govinda. The only good thing is that the music ... "Eres mi amor" was the best on the soundtrack.
