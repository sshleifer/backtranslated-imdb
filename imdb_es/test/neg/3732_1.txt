J.J. Jameson (from Spiderman 2) Quote ... Shit, shit, ... <br /> <br /> Mega-Shit It pretends to be a tribute (an / intentional) to the Coen brothers ... done wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no real mystery in the plot. <br /> <br /> Diaz's performance has no inspiration. <br /> <br /> The extravagant characters do not really work. <br /> <br /> There are many "duh" moments. <br /> <br /> I love black comedy, but this movie is not fun. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was not worth the electricity. <br /> <br /> There are many movies in this genre that are much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> I hope you find this review useful.
