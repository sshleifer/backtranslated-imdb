God, I hated this movie! I saw it in a preview 13 years ago, and I STILL have bad flashbacks. It was, without a doubt, the WORST movie I paid to see. It was poorly written, misdirected and (surprisingly considering the cast) badly performed. I'd rather be pulled from a roof to sharp ends, and then skin my skin before I sit through it. Can you guess that I did not enjoy it?
