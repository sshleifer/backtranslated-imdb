What a waste of great acting talent. This is a shame because with Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Devos, Chiara Mastroianni and Melvil Poupaud (not to mention others less known in the United States), there is a lot of talent as an actor to lose. This movie by Arnaud Desplech was a terrible disappointment. After having enjoyed their "Kings and Queens", this movie left me completely bored and frustrated to the point where I left before the movie ended. The film wandered through its central story (involving the illness of Catherine Deneuve) and was diverted by each peripheral story and secondary character that appeared on the screen. The film also gave us very little character development to understand why the different characters did not like it that much (this was a story of family dysfunction), so the lack of coherent narrative became even more critical. Finally, the soundtrack (ranging from hip hop to Bach to Mendelhson's Midsummer Night's Dream) was at odds with the emotional temperature of the film and further obscured any emotion that the viewer should have felt at that moment . Photography (the director often started scenes with a mainly dark screen, where our only view is through a small opening, making us feel that we are looking through a peephole, which then expands) was also pretentious and inscrutable.
