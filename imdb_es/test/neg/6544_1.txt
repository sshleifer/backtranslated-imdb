This low budget independent film redefines the word "blah". It will surprise more than this word is actually in the dictionary, defined as "meaningless ... without interest, boring, lifeless". The film redefines the word because I would have to add to those four words: "Crap de PC", "pretentious at a pathetic level" and "meaningless". <br /> <br /> The film tries to be so difficult "hip" and "in contact" with the behavior and "thought" of the beautiful people who fight for the "je-ne-sais-quoi" (? think?). There is almost no plot to talk about, although you have to sleep. The most false and politically correct things about this are how a white woman is a great friend of a young black stallion, the black saxophone player with a penchant for wise advice and advice, and the fat black psychic. Is not it beautiful how you can take the races after all? ... Ahhh ... In the end, the woman reads "poetry", which is just one of her boring notes of "dear diary". She receives a standing ovation (!!!), although in real life her listeners would have been more likely not to fall asleep. But this movie has little to do with real life, although that's where it's supposed to be happening. In real life, his reading of "poetry" would have had standing ovations only if he had had the good sense to include the sexual and juicy details. "And then I rubbed his huge penis against my little pink vagina, sweaty and impatient ..." Cheers! What's worse, the main actress has a dozen scenes in which she bathes or fucks with someone, however, they never have the good sense to show their breasts, which was clearly the only thing left to save this disaster. <br /> <br /> The black guy and the blonde, who are separated by about a meter in height, get hooked: they seem like a cheap variant of Rodman and Madonna (as if the last two were no longer a combination enough cheap). Nicole Eggert, mentioned by Howard Stern in her book "Miss America," is the blonde. Stern writes to Eggert that he removed the implants. However, I think that when the implants were removed, they also extracted the meat from the flesh and muscles by mistake, because it is starved here. <br /> <br /> In one scene, the saxophonist develops like an angel. wings; It looks like Al Roker announcing angel food cakes.
