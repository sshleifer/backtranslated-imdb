Ed Wood mounts again. The fact that this film has been made should give hope to any young filmmaker. Any script you may have thought to use <br /> <br /> align a sandbox or a birdcage should not seem so bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching this movie <br /> <br /> made me realize that Boa vs. Python was not so bad after all. It would probably have been better to make this film in Claymation since at least that way no actor would have had to be attributed for being in this movie. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases. There is a positive side to seeing this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips, then you can leave the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you, allowing you to <br /> <br /> Come to the cocoon of cheese from your television that surrounds it.
