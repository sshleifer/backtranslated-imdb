Resentment 2 ... Let's see. Do not get me wrong, I'm not a Japanese horror movie or a horror or resentment movie. I loved the first one and the Original Ju-On. I feel that much more justice could have been done for this. Aubrey only existed to complete what had to be "discovered" at the end (that if you had already seen Ju-On before this, you already knew the whole movie) it was really a complete remake of Ju-On, just more closely than The Grudge . Although everyone thought that arriving in the United States was a bit interesting, it was expected that the house would burn at the end of The Grudge and leave the second hunger for a new plot. <br /> <br /> Save your $ 6.50 and wait for it to appear on DVD, arrange it, see it and then decide if you want to buy it. This movie is good for sleeping at 2 in the morning. But in general, I would say 4 out of 10. I'm sorry, Grudge fans, it's just ... They just failed at this.
