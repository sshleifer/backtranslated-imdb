There are movies that are so bad, that they are good. Then there are movies like Rest Stop that should never have been done because they are simply appalling. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, unpleasant characters, predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural turn that adds nothing to the story are all the keys. flaws Some decent half-special effects are the only thing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> I can not even write a plot of the plot because all I really want to do here is to warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favor and do not bother at all with this movie. It is an hour and a half of your life that you will never return. <br /> <br /> 1/10
