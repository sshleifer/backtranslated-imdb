What a truly stupid movie, all I can say is that the writer must be very fond of magic mushrooms and LSD because this must be the result of one of his "trips". <br /> <br /> You follow the whole movie thinking. Well, this is very strange, but I am sure that in the end there will be a perfectly good explanation for all this ... Just to be disappointed to find that there is no explanation and the turn at the end makes it even more confusing. At the end of the movie, you probably have the same facial expression as if you were in one that pays for your groceries and the merchant told you it would be 11.95, please, and I elbowed you in the balls so you would not show up. reason. There are so many factors in this film that are not explained and I think that leaves the imagination of the viewer in a totally strange way. Do not get me wrong. I like rare movies, 'The Cell' could easily be described as weird and twisted, but in my opinion it's a brilliant movie (despite having chosen J-Lo, who I do not like the most, that I did not get) . influence my opinion). This is not one of those movies, and I think you should consider the characters from whom you praise this movie. I can tell you that they are probably the kind of people who would go to an art exhibit, see a lot of pigeon droppings on a white board and say "Oooooh, that's a masterpiece, the artist has really found a unique way to portray the eternity "when in fact, all that is, is bird droppings on a blackboard. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind the latter when you see this movie, <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading!
