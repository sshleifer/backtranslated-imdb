There were two things he hated about WASTED: the direction and the script. I know I'm opening up to ridicule, but Stephen T Kay's address is too much like ... like ... well, like an MTV pop video. It is filmed (I think) in digital video against an intrusive soundtrack, often out of focus and often with fast cuts. If you are not a teenager, you will find many DISPOSED segments that can not be seen due to the stylistic approach. As bad as the address was the script that pulled my chain. The story is told through Samantha, a poor and rich girl who spends much of the film talking through the voiceover (It's strange that the voice-over never seems idiosyncratic enough to come from the same character) , she talks about the pressure of her exams, the pressure of home life, her social loneliness and all this is what led her to take drugs. It is for similar reasons, such as the breakup of parents, that their two male friends (did I think they were supposed to be alone?) To start using drugs. Oh, poor Sammi in your beautiful house and your problems, how my heart bled for you and your friends. DO NOT. What WASTED does not mention is that it does not matter which person is addicted, whether it is drink, drugs, nicotine or chocolate, that person has to work to become an addict, is not a victim of external forces, is committing a crime. act of free will. Both TRAFFIC and TRAINSPOTTING made this point very well, people become addicted because they want to. Representing them as victims in any way is a bad example and, possibly, very dangerous. <br /> <br /> By the way, if MTV is anti-drug, will they stop playing videos of stars that freely admit to taking drugs?
