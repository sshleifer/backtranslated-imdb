Okay, if you like the monsters of your monsters, surly, stiff, starchy and tremendously bored, but with many limitations, then go right to "Lady Frankenstein", a shrewd walker of Italian corpses. Joseph Cotten ("Citizen Kane") plays the old crusty baron, and must have really needed to pay the condo. The sexy Sarah Bay, who has played in European B-vacancies, usually as Rosabla Neri, including "Hercules Against the Moon Men," plays her ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a frilly party dress. Cotten becomes an ugly, big-headed monster (can it really be a great effort to make a nice one ??), who immediately strangles Cotten (who took her royalty check and ran), and wanders around all those who are in sight. Tania (Bay) decides to change the brain of her lover (who is old and wrinkled) with the brain of a younger man (who is "beautiful", but stupid), to make ANOTHER monster to strangle the first monster that Cotten did. , who is wandering around strangling people. Well, after a lot of exposure and a bit of acceleration, the two monsters accelerate each other for a while, Tania stabs the first monster in the back, and then has sex in the flames ruins of her mansion with the second monster, just to have it aside, your! Doh! There are so many restrictions underway that it almost overlooks the fact that the film is as exciting as a dead carp and moves just as quickly. The version of Alpha Video that I saw for this review was edited to a large extent, and one wonders if many people of nekkid were eliminated, not that it would have improved the movie much. Director von Theurmer previously directed a variety of European grade Z garbage, including "Jungle Warriors," "Island of the Dead" (as Mel Wells) and "The Crucified Girls of San Ramon." The MooCow says: avoid this corpse of a movie, and find something that moves to the moore of a ... accelerator. <br /> <br />; = 8)
