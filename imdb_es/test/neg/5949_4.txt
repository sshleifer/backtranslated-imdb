Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren are absolutely beautiful in this ca. 1840 "Western". That alone, however, does not help a ridiculous story, with innumerable historically incorrect elements. <br /> <br /> Byrl Ives is convincing as the tyrannical patriarch of 70 years, an egomaniac who swears to see his hundredth birthday. Her wild dancing at a party she gives to her neighbors will make everyone notice (is this guy SEVETY SIX?). Always muttering verses from the Bible, he demands respect, while distancing his children and friends with his own criticisms and emotional cruelties. <br /> <br /> The love story between Perkins and Loren at first seems absurd, but it becomes believable near the end. There is a lot of drama, but not enough to feel good. Clearly written for the stage, this story was dated even when it was filmed. Perkins whistles "My Bonnie" in the 1840s, although the song was not composed until 1882. <br /> <br /> The critics who hit Sophia Lorens "command of the English language" are quite petty. I found his English impeccable and completely audible. As a Neapolitan, Loren speaks a different dialect that often had to be dubbed the "proper Italian". His "accent", however, hardly affects how he speaks English. As a first generation American German, I can appreciate the efforts of those who learn English as a second or even third or fourth language. <br /> <br /> "Desire Under The Elms" is a drama (or even a tragedy). ) in the classical sense. For my enjoyment, a logical history and a general "payment" for the time invested were missing. The fans of the stars will not want to miss it, others, however, tune in under their responsibility!
