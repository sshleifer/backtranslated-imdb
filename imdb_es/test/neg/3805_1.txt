Being stuck in bed with the flu and feeling too hard to get up to find the remote control, I really observed this abomination from beginning to end (how many people can say that? And for anyone who can, what is their excuse?). My God, has there ever been such a total disaster launched by an important study? There is not a second of genuine tension in a supposed "thriller"; the script is inept and ridiculous; the sets seem to be remnants of a low-budget TV movie; and the cast ... WHAT WAS THINKING? !!! Sally Field offers, without a doubt, the worst and most shameful performance of any Academy Award winner in history. His irritating nasal moan and his stupidly cheerful behavior in what is supposed to be a life-threatening situation are truly asinines. It is a miracle that he did not use all his future profits to buy and destroy all the impressions of this turkey. Michael Caine, who now pontificates tirelessly in the art of acting on the screen, even directing master classes for possible aspiring theater, must be expelled and shot (preferably by one of Telly Savalas' henchmen). Angela Cartwright, an actress that I usually like (and whose name does not even appear in the opening credits, poor soul), is ten years old for her role, and her horrible yellow graduation dress must pursue her nightmares until the day of today. Speaking of which are Karl Malden and Shirley Knight; We hope you have put together a large payment package to mitigate your participation. The whole movie is a series of bad scenes, but one that occurs to me especially is the explosion that causes the "roof" (if the deck of an upside down boat can be described as such) collapsing and a load of empty cardboard boxes . That falls through! Oh that fear! Really, really, terrible.
