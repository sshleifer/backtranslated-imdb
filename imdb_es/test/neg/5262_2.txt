This movie has a really strange mix of genres: toilet humor and action in one. It really does not, it should have been limited to one genre. The best I can say about the movie is that the dog that accompanies it is cute. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the film when Moses (Sandler) and Carter (Wayans) decide to stop. In a hunting / motel pavilion. I'm not sure what the point of this sequence is: it seems extremely free in the extreme. The owner of the hunting lodge ("Charlie") is a very nerdy guy. For some reason, Moses starts a conversation with Charlie about porn, jacking off, homosexual sex, sex in a threesome ... Charlie's photo of his "wife" seems to be Charlie dressed in clothes. There is no reason for this dialogue and really youthful scene. Anyway, the whole scene seems to be directed to the moment when a naked Moses ends up with Carter's gun on his butt and Charlie sees them through the window. Everything stinks of school humor about homosexuality, horrified and excited at the same time, which does not seem at all funny. <br /> <br /> I have a friend who is always counting Adam Sandler movies. This is the first I've seen. After this, I'm not sure I want to see again. By the way, this is my husband's account: he has seen Happy Gilmore and he says it's pretty good, maybe I should give Sandler one more chance. <br /> <br /> Countess Skogg
