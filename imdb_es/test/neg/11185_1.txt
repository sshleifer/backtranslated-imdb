How do I describe the horrors? !!! First, some points: first, this review should be taken with a grain of salt: I saw it more than 20 years ago, as a child, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I am giving away some scenes and plot points. However, it does not have much plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, I do not enjoy this kind of artistic films anyway. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by the proto-author Luis Bunuel. He was a surrealist and dadaist. These were popular modernist themes or movements in the 1920s and early 1930s. Surealism was the art school that made hyperrealistic things, but often had Freudian symbolism. Dadaism is based on what is supposedly the first word made by an infant: Dada or father. <br /> <br /> Made in black and white, so did a band of communists (or as they preferred the term, socialists). Bunuel and his group of fellow filmmakers and artists had been working on a series of symbolic ideas and problems in Spain and France between the world wars. <br /> <br /> Dadaism and Surrealism influenced many artists. Police (Doo doo doo da), the poet Arthur Rambaud, Edvard Munch (The Scream), Rene Magritte (hats floating in space), Salvador Dali (fusion watches) and even Hitchcock (Psycho). Not Norman Rockwell. <br /> <br /> This is what I remember most about this movie: a girl meets a cow; his eye is cut by a razor; Clown men are raised in a meadow. There is not, as I said, much of a plot, but, again, that must be the point. <br /> <br /> This was attacked as porn at the time, and would be again today. One of the trademarks of Surrealism is an important anti-feminism.
