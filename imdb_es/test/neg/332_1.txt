I met Brad Linaweaver at Florida State U in the early 70s when he was an inspiring and inventive writer who I thought was heading towards greater glory. <br /> <br /> And that's why I rented this video. Well, well, well, the time has not been kind to Mr. Linaweaver. I suppose that the pressures of earning a living mean that the highest aspirations are dispensable. Another flower whose flowering has come and gone unnoticed in the summer breeze. Amen. There is nothing more to say. And nothing more to add. A sad epitaph to a flourishing career as previously stated. But it is the price paid for chasing the shadows without a firm foundation or goals for oneself in life. Because this movie has no purpose or purpose, and I repeated to myself, what happened to the creativity of Brad, his genius that once shone? Gone are, years of neglect have deteriorated his previously brilliant mind.
