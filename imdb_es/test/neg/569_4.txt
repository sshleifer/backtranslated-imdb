I liked most of the dialogue, I liked the cast, I thought it was well acted. I particularly enjoyed the perfect perfect interpretation of Ellen DeGeneres. <br /> <br /> What did not work for me was: (1) the long affair with the younger man (too long, too seemingly out of place for Helen), (2) the seemingly endless film clichés, in mostly visual but including endless voices about re-readings of the love letter itself (its content must have a mystery); (3) a young feminist-scholar and, ironically, a fireworks scene (it's no wonder that this reminded me of that horrible movie of How to Make an American Quilt); (4) the clumsy "gotcha" cop who smells "drug" everywhere (there's no cliché there either!); and (5) a small city environment, romantically nauseating. <br /> <br /> I would have preferred the film to explore more persuasively the source of (or even glorify) Helen's bitterness, for having included much more of the character of DeGeneres, to have eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational devices, and be a little less critical of the lives of small towns. <br /> <br /> If it had developed as a play first, those criticisms could have been addressed before committing the material to this film, which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre.
