Bette Midler is the best of this movie. He is a POOR second to the original of 1962 with Natalie Wood as Gypsy. The songs were made much better in the original and the costumes were better. Bette's voice was great and looked better in most of the costumes compared to Cynthia Gibb. Only someone who has not seen the original would think that this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> There was not enough change between the ugly duckling and the beautiful girl. When Natalie Wood was a gypsy, she only looked beautiful when she put on her dress with her gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show. When she has her hair down and then magically, everything is arranged very well and looks so elegant, it is an important aspect of the film because it is also the first time that Gypsy sees herself as something special and that it could really be a star. , not just a poor substitute for his sister. And the scenes where she gradually becomes more famous were hurried. It was an important part of the movie and they killed her. It is essential to show that you feel more comfortable with your future as a stripper and the costumes are incredible in these scenes in the original. It was a great disappointment to see him develop in this movie. I felt completely disappointed and if it had not been for Bette Midler I would have turned off the movie.
