I caught this on HBO under his "Guilty Pleasures" category, and I would agree that I felt guilty (and pleased) watching him. One, it's garbage, and really lewd garbage. Two, the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn "who did it", you think: "So what?". However, I must admit that I am enough of a macho pig to want to sit through what is obviously a bad movie, if only to see Peta Wilson undress several times. Do I feel dirty for having seen it? Yes. I'm sorry I saw it? No. Therefore, there is the contradiction between being a lover of good movies and a lover of female anatomy, even when you are in a bad movie. Sigh!
