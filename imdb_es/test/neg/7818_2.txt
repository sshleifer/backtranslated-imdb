For years I hesitated watching this movie. Now, I know why. It was even worse than I expected. Ashton Kutcher commits the worst cinematic mistake of his career, since "Dude, Where's My Car?" Tara Reid co-stars as Ashton's dream girl, who asks her to take care of her father's (and boss's) owls for the weekend. The rules: 1. There are no shoes in the house. 2. There are no people in the house. 3. The boss's son stays out of the house. 4. Do not touch the furniture. <br /> <br /> Well, you can guess at the end of the first twenty minutes, how the rest of the movie will look. <br /> <br /> You know, there are movies like "Meet The Parents", where bad things happen to someone, but it's entertaining to watch and delivered in a way that you can not wait to see what happens next. This is not one of those movies. You know from the beginning that bad things will happen, and for the most part they are stupid things that would never happen. It's an extremely frustrating movie to watch, and there were about three times when I almost turned it off, because it was so bad. But I paid the rental fee and I thought I had to see it now. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid was good, and I would like to see her in more movies. However, it does not surprise me that this has affected his career. <br /> <br /> The end result is a happy ending ... but, of course, with the kind of movie it is, I would not expect anything. less than that. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it. You will truly regret it!
