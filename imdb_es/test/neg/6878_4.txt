I never intended to see Venom, but I caught him on the wire. It has good elements. The atmosphere of the swamp of Louisiana, for example, is something that unfortunately we will not see in the movies due to Hurricane Katrina. It is based on an interesting concept, a normal man imbued with the evil spirits. His confrontation with his son could have been interesting, like a lot of the movie. But as often happens in Hollywood, an interesting idea follows a familiar direction: <br /> <br /> Kill all the characters, save the good girl, starting with the blacks. I'm a fan of Agnes Bruckner, but the other characters, the son of the aforementioned villain, CeCe, who must become a voodoo priestess, are more interesting. And for the love of God, only once I would like to see them kill the virgin. We all like the easy girl, why can not she live? In this case it was Bijou Phillips, and we love her. <br /> <br /> The ending made no sense considering what had been established about the invincibility of the villain. All the butchery and the environment, and it does not lead to anything.
