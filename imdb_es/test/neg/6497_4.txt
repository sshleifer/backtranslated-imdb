I saw this "effort" centered on the ego to achieve an "epic" status movie in the company of several members of the native Russian family. Five people gave 5 different reactions, from the worship of Mikhalkov to my cynicism. <br /> <br /> I saw a movie that looked like Mikhalkov took a lot of money from "Canal +", put some of that in his (and other) pockets and handed the project to a group of film students. I counted at least 4 different "styles" in the movie. There is no way that the same director is responsible for these different scenes. Contrast these for you: <br /> <br /> · Cadets who clean their shoes with a dog. <br /> <br /> · Scene from the train station (saying goodbye to Andrei). <br /> <br /> · Outdoor panoramic shots. <br /> <br /> · Ormond speaks through the keyhole. <br /> <br /> · Initial attempt at the Grand Duke and later chase scenes for Andrei to sing again in Figaro. <br /> <br /> · Fencing sequence <br /> <br /> Julia Ormond is faster than Superman. Upon hearing of her transfer late, she goes around Moscow in a minute to say goodbye to Andrei. <br /> <br /> The Russian natives felt that the impression given of Russian life was "caricature" and not history. They called it a "tourist postcard" from Russia. <br /> <br /> Everyone was proud that a Russian director / producer / repairman managed to get into the "big time" and be able to waste more than 30 million dollars from other people's money, while he might get A little in the local pockets during filming. <br /> <br /> If you want to "think", you have seen Russia go to see this movie. Have a coffee before leaving.
