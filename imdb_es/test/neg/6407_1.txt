The movie starts well, has something in its favor. Around 1/3 in the movie things go downhill. Carrey begins to become obsessed with the number 23 because he sees it everywhere. And that? That's no reason to go crazy and start writing things all over your body and on the walls. <br /> <br /> The performance of whoever plays your child is bad. From the first moment, as soon as he finds out about his parents' obsession, he gets on the car and becomes hysterical about it. Totally awesome. I hope I'll never see this guy again in another movie. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time to watch this movie. Grab another. Piece boring of ... well. Is the number killing him? Give me a break. I will not ruin the end for you, but let's say it is equally disappointing. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
