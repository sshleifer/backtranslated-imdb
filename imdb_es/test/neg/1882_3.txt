Unlike Terms of Endearment and Steel Magnolia's, I left the movie theater feeling VERY disappointed. I started getting into the characters and their complex mother / daughter and father / daughter relationships at the beginning. I even cried. But he had no sympathy for the characters with the ending. The final act did not seem in line with the character of the mother at all. So, even though the performance was pretty good, I thought the movie in general was disappointing.
