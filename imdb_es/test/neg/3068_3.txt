Recognizing the image of the dinner on the cover of the DVD made me realize that it was a local movie. The word Detroit in the title fostered my suspicions and I made some inquiries about things and yes, it was a local movie. <br /> <br /> So I learned it. Someone I know knew some of the producers / directors (I do not remember which one) and said that the producers / directors made people PAY to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> Brilliant! What a good idea. The filmmakers get some capital to make the film with them, thanks to their cast and crew. Then the investors (cast, team, others) get some of the profits, I'm imagining. <br /> <br /> Benefits! <br /> <br /> Um anyway. This movie totally disappointed me. Special effects were special, as in special children who ride small buses to school. The performance was very funny, although not intentionally. There is a great phrase in which a man says "good? This bone is not going to smoke alone!" as a collection line. Unfortunately that's the only fun part of the whole movie. The history? Well, somehow I followed it about 3/5 of the entrance, then everything stopped making sense and, while we were sitting watching it, it suddenly ended. I mean, as in ... there is no resolution of anything ... as if they had run out of time. "Sorry, people, out of time, good night!" <br /> <br /> We sat there baffled and booed, and we released another movie. Then, about 20 minutes later, a neighbor of mine appeared ... with one of the guys in the movie! We released it again and he (the actor) gave us a continuous comment, it was amazing because he ripped the movie! <br /> <br /> What else can you ask for? <br /> <br /> The most absurd scene for me was a motorcycle chase scene where it was so dark that it literally could have been a guy running by with a flashlight and not a motorcycle. That and the fall of the jaw in your face, the sudden end is enough to make you howl. In pain! The zombies seemed less zombie than my co-workers. And I do not work in the morgue either. <br /> <br /> So, I recommend seeing this if you can get someone from the movie to come and give you a continuous comment about all the things that happened behind the scenes and make sure this person hates the movie because that is adds to the fun. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, give a pass to it. Rent something like Feeders if you want your jaw to fall so badly in a funny movie ...
