It seems to be common in the 90s to play with clichés. Some manage to do it with great talent. Hervé Hadmar does not do it. However, on paper, the film seemed interesting: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, black humor and a very "décalé" style. Director Hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. Every joke is shameful because no one reacts in the theater. The movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they are doing in this ridiculous masquerade. What could have been an elegant and meaningless comedy, ends up being a cathedral of boredom.
