Demon Wind is as fun as breaking your legs. It is definitely a terrible example of a movie. So horrible in fact that I do not even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. One thing that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of videotapes in my friend's house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do, so we decided to watch some corny horror movies (unfortunately, we chose this one). Well, during the 90 minutes that we heard this we ended up laughing so hard that we almost vomited. . The thing is literally useless in every sense of the word. It's just a cheap, poorly made Evil Dead scam. The whole "story" does not seem to be more than a guy who wants to cheat his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting the demons break them to pieces. I bet the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed. I've seen horror movies before (Hands, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS!) (Shuddering) I must say that Demon Wind could definitely deal with each and every one of these movies in terms of sheer stupidity. Watch it only if you enjoy laughing at the stupid movies. <br /> <br /> Fun fact: This movie is like a steroid cockroach! Like the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems to reappear mysteriously. Kind of fear huh?
