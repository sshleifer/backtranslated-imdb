The motto of the film is "You think you know who you are, you have no idea". I reject both the suggested idea that I have no idea who I am and the inferred suggestion that this movie tells me who the people really are. If people in real life really are like that, then we're screwed. <br /> <br /> A bilious film in which I arrived late and left prematurely. A film that is so wrapped up in its goal of becoming the career film of all time that it loses sight of the tools a movie should use. <br /> <br /> Hollywood rules are such: if it shows something In the first half, it should be used in the second half. Therefore, the weapon that the daughter cares about buying her father will somehow find its way into history in the second half. The rules of Hollywood are to make the dialogue "real", a concept that changes with each decade. Is this "real dialogue" somehow less ridiculous than Kevin Smith's "real dialogue" ten years ago? The rules of Hollywood establish that we set the scene and, as the action increases, the camera gets closer to the faces, in this film mainly so that we can see the supposed shame, humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. The cords increase, the frame rate slows down and our heart is bound to break. <br /> <br /> This movie is as ridiculously manipulative as it is insipid. I have my own prejudices against L.A., which I freely admit, so to combat this prejudice I will not say that this is a natural situation that derives from the location, but rather from the author and the director. The writer, Paul Haggis, already showed a taste for the polemics about humanity in his Million Dollar Baby, which at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film get the best of the ideas of a script. Now that Paul Haggis has his own hands in the camera, it becomes obvious that not only does he not know how to write a true and natural human drama, but he also does not know how to photograph or direct it. Paul Haggis comes from the land of television, let's not forget: the land of diminished expectations. <br /> <br /> Everything is as obvious as a television movie, simply presented to simple minds: Haggis raids us. and again, that while on the surface people may seem horrible, they have hidden secret pains. This is a good idea, but so well presented that the whole juxtaposition of bad / well has a feeling of fondness. Structurally, the film is divided into the tradition of Magnolia and other previous films. The editing is as typical and conventionally "cinematic" as it could be: if there is a dramatic movement, such as the opening of a door or the passage of a car between the subject and the camera, the editors use that extreme movement to give the cut that It occurs there. A more kinetic quality. The problem is that, apart from the impulse to keep things moving, there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts: everything is saved in the books. The puppets of this horrible racial outbreak and Judy are handled with ineptitude, but even the curtains open and rise with incompetence. <br /> <br /> The movie tries desperately to present reality, but there is simply no talent at all. Some of the actors are good, others are bad, and all the acting is confused, demolished by the low and low aesthetics of the film. We have a photograph that is technically clear: we can see the scene, we have a clear understanding of what is happening. However, not only the cinematography is not remarkable, but it is a camera work and an unreflective framing what he believes is actually inspired. The result is a little stylistic style that is recognized but adds nothing to the drama or pathos. For example, and this is a spoiler, as a father holds his dying son (the father could also be shot, I did not stay to find out) the camera sees his face and gives us the famous track / zoom Vertigo. The vertigo shot !!! It was at this point that the movie went hysterical and I had to leave. I had to leave because it was so bad. I left because I was in the middle of a theater full of people, and I wanted to express to the audience that I was fed up with the "art" of Hollywood with empty heads, which is full of sound and fury, but that means nothing (in the words of own Bardo). I hate to waste such good Shakespearian references on something so badly bad.
