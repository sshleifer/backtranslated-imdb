The idea of ​​nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip sounds pretty good for a movie. Especially because it's meant to be fun and I guess it's touching in some strange way. The problem is that the film was rarely funny and that it often seemed useless and pointless. It was as if jokes or interesting scenes were created again and again, but nobody bothered to finish any of them, there was simply no reward. In addition, the film had no brain and criminals meandered all over Japan, although they left many victims of crimes alive that it is impossible to believe that they had not been captured almost immediately, especially because they continued using the same stolen caravan. and days And when it comes to being nasty, I just did not need to see scene after scene after scene of guys urinating along the side of the road. Also, believe it or not, there is a scene where four of the boys are raping sheep. <br /> <br /> In general, I really hated this movie. And it's a shame, because I almost always love Japanese movies, but not the bad ones and the uninteresting ones like this one.
