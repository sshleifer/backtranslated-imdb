The acclaimed Argentinian director of terror Emilio Vierya directs a screenplay by Jack Curtis and Antonio Ross. Cheesy and ridiculous are in the mix for the method of madness. The son of a doctor approaches his untimely death, until his desperate father transplants the heart of a monkey in his chest. As expected, things will get weird; When this young man becomes a mask that carries a monster and travels the beaches exploring the good girls who seek to make their slaves. When heroin is injected, its beauties turn into zombies. The monster summons its stunned henchmen with strange organ music. So bad ... well ... it's just bad. In the cast: Jos√© E. Moreno, Alberto Caneau, Mauricio De Ferraris, Gloria Prat and Gina Moret.
