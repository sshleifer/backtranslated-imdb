I was very excited when I saw this film in competition at the Montreal Film Festival. Along with Elephant and a few others, I thought the subject of American violence / culture with the weapon would be treated intelligently and convincingly for moviegoers. The press release promised (in a few words) a "red violin" for the crowd of violent people with firearms, something that makes us reflect on our shoot-em-up mentality of the NRA in this country. <br /> <br /> After waiting until after 9:15 to be seated for a screening at 9 AM (the technical difficulties they would have encountered surpasses me), they finally let us in to see the movie in DV (where was the 35MM print announced?). I think I just answered my first question. <br /> <br /> The result is an abominable disaster. We get the "gun", in a vignette with the most unrealistic "biker" I've seen (and I know more than a few). The film then falls into an irrelevant "character development" just because the characters are a. stereotyped, b. losers, c. stereotyped losers and / or d. racial cartoons. It takes another 30 minutes to get to the plot movement, and once we are there, we want the inane conversations between the couples and / or cyclists and pawn brokers. <br /> <br /> The film finds its conclusion, but not without leaving a clich√© unproven. I was not interested in the white trash characters that came into contact with the weapon and the description of the minority characters should have the NAACP on the verge of crying immediately. All of these people SHOULD pursue a weapon, because they are at the bottom of society's trash, and they will look for an opportunity wherever they may be. It would have at least provided some search for consciousness on the part of the characters. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the unfulfilled promise. The scheme of the plot was great. In the hands of a P.T. Anderson or Gus Van Zandt, could have been a powerful piece. But due to a bad script, the address or both, the thing is an unmitigated mess that must be ignored at all costs. <br /> <br /> My most important question is who in the MFP thought that this was competition material. Better to bury this on Showtime at 3AM. <br /> <br /> Art Blose
