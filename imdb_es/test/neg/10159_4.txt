Well, now I know where all those boring police / homicide television shows come from. I think you can go back to this movie. "Scene Of The Crime" feels more like a television episode or an episode of a series. Complete with characters and common situations: the policeman who collides with his superiors ... the elderly policeman who does not want a desk job, despite the lack of vision ... the reckless novice ... the lady of the double crossing, etc. <br /> <br /> I like a lot of the actors here, and they do a good job, but overall it seems to me that this movie is boring since I'm not a fan of the genre. I kept disconnected when they discussed the case ... something about bookmakers and informants. And, oh yes, there was a stripper, played by the once healthy Gloria DeHaven. What I want to know is: Why did she keep calling Van Johnson "Uncle Wiggly"? Was not Uncle Wiggly a rabbit? A character from a children's book? What the hell does that have to do with anything? I guess I do not understand some lingo of the Film Noir-ish type. <br /> <br /> In fact, much of the dialogue made me mumble "nobody talks like that!" However, I could relate to a scene in which the wife of the police officer (Arlene Dahl), who worries every time she goes to work, realizes that maybe she should not have turned her husband into the center of her life . Yes, I know that feeling of loving someone so much, of being so dependent on him, that there is a constant fear for his safety. So there are moments of truth in this film, under the stylized dialogue and atmosphere, which so consciously tries to be stark and REAL, that in reality it seems unreal to me. <br /> <br /> A Little Bit of History: This movie was made when Dore Schary took over MGM from Louis B. Mayer, and began putting an end to the healthy musicals that made MGM so great. Dore Schary was determined to bring more "realism" to the movies. I hate Dore Schary a little. Maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious and somber films that are being made today, wallowing in the ugly "truths" of life, focusing on (and, in my opinion, helping to perpetuate) the worst of humanity instead of best. We are no longer motivated by the way classic films were designed: to provide a necessary distraction during the Great Depression and World War II. <br /> <br /> Well, damn it, we still need that kind of distraction today! There is still a lot of depression and a lot of war. And what are people addressing today when they want to escape? Garbage, the brain of lethal reality TV. Thank you very much, Dore!
