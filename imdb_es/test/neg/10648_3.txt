After the failure of "Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth," the chapter that served as a kind of "death blow" to the franchise, another embarrassing cash bonus was not a surprise. An abysmal attempt to explain each of the mysteries of Pinhead and the puzzle box, which literally spans centuries of history, in a film that lasts less than 90 minutes ... On the screen is shown a misinterpretation, an interpretation of a miserable movie B special effects, and an absurd and insulting attempt at black humor, while STILL tries to keep the whole project in earnest. I wonder, how many cursed directors did this thing have? Poor Pinhead has SO much screen time, that all the mystery and the threat that this iconic character has is completely lost. After an hour of listening to long speeches and dramatic postures, we simply want to tell the boy to shut up. Slightly entertaining in some places, especially in the first segment, this mess starts to look and feel like a cheap and ugly TV splash movie made after a while, and ends in the most ridiculous way you can imagine: Pinhead, together with your pet, the Cenobite dog, killing a bunch of idiots ... in outer space! I'm sorry, but any true fan of the first two movies in the series, which gave this abortion of a movie more than 3 stars, should be ashamed. On a side note, the movie that follows; "Hellraiser: Inferno" is actually a very surprisingly intelligent and stylish black film piece, which brilliantly restores 'Pinhead' as a master of illusion and cruelty, and brings back the concept of evil inherent in the human class . Central piece of the original film, and the whole point of the story. For any enthusiastic fan of terror, see Hellraiser I and II, omit the lousy III and this, and continue with 'Hell'. You will not miss anything jumping this garbage ...
