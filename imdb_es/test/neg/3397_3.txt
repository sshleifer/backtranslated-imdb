I have read many of the comments here about how this film adheres to the book ... I do not think any of them really read it. Edgar Rice wrote about a dangerous African forest and the apes were killers and hunters. Now we know differently and this film portrays the monkeys in a more modern vision. I have never seen a Tarzan movie that comes close to Edgar's vision. Maybe one day Hollywood with confidence talented and respected writers to tell the story. So, if you've never read the book and you enjoy a good story about feelings and a fluffy bunny view of wild animals, maybe a good cry, watch the movie. I hope John Carter of Mars gets more respect than Tarzan. We miss you, Edgar!
