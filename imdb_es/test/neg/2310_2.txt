I would really have to rate "Sex is Comedy" as one of the worst pieces of dreck I've seen. The film inadvertently shows those who are the worst aspects of the French, or at least how they are stereotyped, narcissism, snobbery and pseudo-intellectualism. I myself am French-Canadian and I feel a little embarrassed that the creators of this film are of the same culture as me, that should give you an idea of ​​how bad this movie really was! One does not see this movie so much as if it is tortured, there was a lack of total humor, and I thought that the whole movie was a documentary that interviewed people who were neither famous nor talented, as if to celebrate. something that has never happened to begin with. On the other hand, why not watch Auberge Espagnole, Happenstance or Je t'aime ... a la folie, three fantastic modern French films?
