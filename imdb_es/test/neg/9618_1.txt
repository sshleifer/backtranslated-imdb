The DVD version released by Crash Cinema was very badly done. The mastering engineer must have been drunk, asleep or not even in the room while it was being done. It seems that it was mastered from a copy of the tenth generation and in the middle of the movie, the audio synchronization disappears. The dialogue is about 10 or 15 seconds from the audio. If you are thinking of buying this DVD, save your money. I remember seeing this movie in the theater in 1973. Also, the VHS copy of this film under the title "When Taekwondo hits" looks better than the DVD, but the remaining minutes of the film are missing. Where is the original negative camera?
