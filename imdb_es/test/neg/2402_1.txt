SPOILER - This movie gives points of the plot and discusses the ending. I hated this movie, mainly for political reasons, but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. Politically, this film glorifies war and military technology, exploiting things really well. They encourage us to cheer as the music swells and the Afghans use our weapons to destroy the Ruskies. And no soldier in the United States risks their lives, so it's a fun war. Aesthetically, there is not a touch of real human emotion in the film, only presumed, the privileged people are sarcastic, they feel superior and do what they want regardless of the consequences. And speaking of consequences, the film only makes some small successes in what really took to arm the Afghans. I had read an earlier draft of this script and it ended on September 11; Charlie Wilson realized that things had gone terribly wrong. But that would not leave the audience feeling good. This is a good movie about how to kill the Ruskies. And it made me sick.
