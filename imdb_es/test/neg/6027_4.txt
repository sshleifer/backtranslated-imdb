In fact, parts of it I liked a lot. It had some interesting twists. But I just left a state there, seen that feeling after all the SAW movies. Okay, the ending was different from a typical Saw, but let's be honest ... a group of guys, unknown to each other (or so they think) grouped in an abandoned chemical factory ... <br /> <br /> But then lose something. There is no intensity, there is a poor group dynamics, there is no sense of urgency. <br /> <br /> Some nice turns at the end, and it's definitely worth seeing if there's nothing else on your plate, but it just left me empty. ... time passed, but it did not satisfy.
