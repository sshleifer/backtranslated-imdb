I rented this movie because the DVD cover looked like it was going to be a ridiculous college comedy like Van Wilder or Animal House. I took it to my friend's house to see the movie night. We ended up stopping him 15 minutes into the movie, and we saw Copper Mountain instead. I do not know if any of you have seen Copper Mountain, but it is not great either. However, I would have to say that Alan Thick Duo Jim Carrey made it into a nicer watch. <br /> <br /> Later I finished the Puddle Cruiser. This movie was slow and the humor forced. This movie reminded me of some stinky ones I saw in some of my previous college production classes. I kept wondering "was this the movie that allowed Broken Lizard to make Supertroopers?" Also, how could this movie be so bad? Supertroopers was good and Club Dread was decent. I do not see this movie!
