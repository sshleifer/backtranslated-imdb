Police officer Michael (Tomas Arana, "The Church") has his hands full while investigating a serial killer who has been leaving part of the bodies of people he has been murdering in the house of a widow recently, Tracy ( Joanna Pacula). Mike has to find a way to keep bodies from accumulating, while he may find love in the process. <br /> <br /> A feeling of the 'giallo' movies of yesteryear prevails in this movie, although we know who the killer is from the first moment, and the film contains some good pieces (a scene later in the film set in a school for the blind is particularly memorable), but it does not make much sense when everything is said and done either. In general, it is not as good as the previous "Macabre" by Bava or its first two "Demons" films, but it is nice enough to forgive the rather scandalous plot twists towards the end of the film. A pity that the DVD of Image Entertainment lacked extras of any kind, since I would have interested in some. <br /> <br /> My rating: C-
