This was a movie that could have been great if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies and if the actors had been chosen or invented to look a little more like real people (not very difficult). Sissi did not go to Mayerling to see her dead son, nor did she die in the street; They took her to the boat and then back to the hotel, which was much more dramatic. I'm not sure about the wedding night, but it seems to me exaggerated that a bridesmaid would undress the empress and leave her completely naked (and in the 1850s) or that the emperor would proudly announce "yes, I finally put her "to the gathered court. As far as I know, this was done immediately the first night and nobody rewarded her as if she were a prostitute. The salvation of the film is really Stephane Audran, excellent actress and faithful to the character.
