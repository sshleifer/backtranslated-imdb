This was done in 2004 for the love of God, what happened to the special effects of our state of the art? What happened to our rudimentary but still good actors? The actors in this movie were incredibly horrible, there were one or two who were not bad, but the rest, with the bigger thumbs down. I could not bear to hear the badly written dialogue, I mean, who the hell wrote that script? Please, do not write again! Special effects? I do not even mean special effects. Surely they could have found green light balls better than completely false in the eye sockets. He looks so old and ... frankly! Even the easiest thing to make them look real ... the teeth, they looked so fake and stupid that I almost cleaned a tear of discomfort. Come on, I can not believe this has been shown to the public.
