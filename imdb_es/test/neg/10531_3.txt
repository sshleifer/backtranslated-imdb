Steven Segal has done some horrible movies, but this is probably one of the best since his career was submerged about ten years ago. The cast is better than usual, and although the story and the plot are a total joke, at least most of the action scenes look pretty good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably one of the worst in the history of cinema. Is someone being executed because he stole some money? Do some mercenary types kidnap a Supreme Court judge? Is your goal to change the judge for the prisoner so they can find out where you have the money? Meanwhile, the execution chamber is full of false traps and floors and looks like a set of one of the Circus of the Sun Circus shows. <br /> <br /> Then there is the prison problem. Here, the Guardian is a Homie, played by Tony Plana. All the prisoners have their colors and signs of gangs, and the guards are there to serve the meals and keep the prison clean. Nothing like a group of prisoners fighting and beating some guards while the Guardian is watching. What happens? The Guardian gives them a stern talk. I could punish them next time. <br /> <br /> There are many moments in this movie that are good for laughing. However, Nia Peeples looks pretty good, and Ja Rule tries to be an action hero. Much fun to see the prisoners who "do the right thing" and arm themselves so they can free the Supreme Court Judge from their captors. Regardless of how bad Half Past Dead can be, when you see it, keep in mind that it is easily the best film that Steven Segal has starred in from Under Siege in 1992.
