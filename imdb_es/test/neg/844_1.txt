A horrible farce of Greek resistance. Miss Cruz, misinterpreted as a Greek cephalic girl (there are a lot of attractive and good Greek actresses who speak English, why choose a Spanish lady for one of the main roles and with an English actor like her father, supposedly a Greek doctor of the cast are well-known actors and actresses of the Greek theater and television series.The only foreign actor, as far as I know, who has successfully interpreted a Greek was Anthony Quinn (as the Macedonian lignite miner Zorba in Zorba , the Greek, as the Greek shipowner, and the Greek colonel of Guns of Navarone. <br /> <br /> There is some historical truth reflected in the film.People who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands are of I agree that the Italians did not roughly, unlike the Germans who succeeded them, and also Mussolini's forces, as insinuated in the film, had been defeated by the Greek army in the Albanian campaign It can occupy certain parts of Greece, so the refusal of the local government to surrender to the Italian forces, instead of the Germans. As shown in the movie it's quite plausible, although I'm not sure this has really happened.
