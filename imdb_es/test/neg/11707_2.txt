The Other Boleyn Girl: not to be confused with the book in which it says to be based. This movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand them changing or elaborating on some things. The book is not perfect, but it was well written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make this a little more true to what really happened, who was really Anne Boleyn, but it's not even close to being historically accurate. It's just fluff. No sense, fluff invented. A real shame. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the writer and the director seemed to think it was a good idea to set the story as if it were a reality TV show. Seriously. They have the Boleyns sitting in front of the camera, confessing how they REALLY feel about what is happening in their lives. Anne Boleyn sits in a confessional (not the kind of church, the real world) and chooses what she wants to say and what she wants to just sit down and smile at. It seems stupid to have to use such a modern cinematographic device in a film set in the seventeenth century. It's "The real world: Tudor England!" <br /> <br /> Jodhi May is a very good actress and after 'The Aristocrats' and 'A Turn of the Screw' I was becoming a true fan of her. But she should never have been chosen as Anne. Actually I think she would have been a better Mary. Natascha McElhone was a bad choice. She is a good actress, of course, but she has very modern characteristics and does not seem convincing in period costumes. (Honestly, I spent the first half of the movie trying to figure out if she was "that girl" on "The Truman Show." It was). She is also too old to play Mary, a teenager who is for some unknown reason. He made Mary the eldest of the sisters. It does not make sense, I know. It's as if the BBC seems to forget that these people really lived. They are twisting the story and inventing things from left to right. I feel ridiculous to have to correct the BBC about historical inaccuracies, but REALLY! <br /> <br /> Apart from the two sisters, the rest of the cast was actually very well chosen. Steven Mackintosh seemed like a brilliant option for George, and his casting was the real reason why I decided to look for this movie. Big mistake. He does a great job, of course, but he is not in this. How can anyone pretend that he is adapting The Other Boleyn Girl and just mention George Boleyn? That is simply absurd. Philip Glenister was another very good launch decision, but, once again, it was almost not in the final product. <br /> <br /> The real problem with this is the script. There is simply no way to avoid that. It is bad. It is really very bad. It is too melodramatic and not attractive. Anne is portrayed as a hollowhead, Mary as a ringleader and George as a follower. As soon as Mary's first husband is mentioned, his relationship with the king is never explained; they just do not tell the story Phillippa Gregory wrote. Everything is presented as a big big waste. I do not feel like seeing this for the second time. I guess I'll have to re-read the book and I hope that Natalie Portman's version that will come out next year is much better. <br /> <br /> * Note: As of this writing, the only way to obtain this is the miniseries in the United States is in the last disc of the miniseries "The Six Wives of Henry VIII". That's a great miniseries, but it can cost between $ 50 and $ 60 and there's a lot you can spend if you're just looking for this piece of junk.
