I saw this film at the Edinburgh International Film Festival 2005. <br /> <br /> This movie was compared in the EIFF program with Sideways, which I liked, so I was eager to see this movie. I also liked Garden State, Napoleon Dynamite, etc. ... so I've had good recent experiences with somewhat strange American indy movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found that Puffy Chair does not compare favorably with any of these movies. <br /> <br /> I sat for 35 minutes waiting for something funny, witty, insightful or even interesting to happen. He did not, and the unsteady video camera was making me sick, so I left. <br /> <br /> This is just the second movie I've come out of (the first was "Showgirls") which is slightly disappointing. It probably could have lasted the duration had it not been for the nauseating effects of the shaky picture, but nothing in the first 35 minutes gave me the impression that I would be missing something. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
