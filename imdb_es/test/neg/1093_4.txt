I do not know if this exceptionally boring movie was thought of as an unofficial sequel to 'The French Connection', but it has many of the same drawbacks: the script is so confusing that the viewer does not get involved and feels excluded from the image., And the direction is so cold, that it lacks energy, that even the great chase sequence can not animate things. (* 1/2)
