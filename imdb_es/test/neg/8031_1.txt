Maybe I'm just a simple person, but I prefer movies that somehow make me worry about the people that contain them. I could not care less about anyone in this movie. Was this supposed to be a comedy? Maybe the humor was too subtle for me (up to the nano level). What happens is that many things were lost. There were characters that could have been fun, but they were not. There were characters that you might have liked, but you did not. For example, the boy who thought the Beatles stole his songs. There was so much potential there, but all he did was talk like a Beatle and complain about how he was cheated. LOL. And the previous poster spoke of the scene 'I am the walrus' as if it were special. What? He played "I am the Walrus" on an old piano and sang out of tune. Is there an internal joke there? Surely it reeked of nominal value. This movie seems like a movie that people say they like because it sounds 'intellectual' or 'hip' to say that you like it, that you receive all the metaphysical message of art / trash that the artist expresses. If you want to be entertained, stay away.
