The brief conjugal infidelity returns to pursue his beloved wife Grace Needham (played by the always sexy Nastassja Kinski). <br /> <br /> He had left the city and his depressing husband to embark on a trip to sunny Miami, where he was pursued and finally seduced by Julian Grant, a generously evil and manipulative business executive, whom William Baldwin portrays very well (Why do all the Baldwin brothers play wicked people so damn good?) <br /> <br /> Grace's seduction took place as the two drank champagne on a deserted beach that they arrived in private on a sailboat. Grace admitted that she drank too much for her own good and revealed the many problems in her marriage. Julian gained his trust by stating that he would never allow such problems to happen, if he had a relationship with Grace. Julian's manipulation continued as he described a "lost at sea" fantasy that involved the now uninhibited Grace, who sat nearby, listening to every word and committing more and more to her romantic dream. <br /> <br /> Her manipulation paid Off when a few subtle shoves led to Grace's soft kisses, they stopped momentarily when she recoiled as if she suddenly thought to herself: What am I doing? I am a wife I am a mother I have a real life. Real responsibilities Sure, we both talked about being together, lost at sea, but that's just a fantasy. Look what we are doing here. The consequences are real. We are really alone on a lonely beach. Am I going to let this fantasy really happen? <br /> <br /> She succumbs to the dream, as her kisses became more passionate. The once-Grace, who used to respond to men's propositions by saying "I'm married," enjoyed watching Julian unbutton his shirt, leading to more kisses, body caresses, and climbing into Julian's lap. She smiles, kisses, moans, laughs and often looks towards the sun through what, unfortunately, was a brief scene of love in which everyone seemed to have most of their clothes on. <br /> <br /> Although I really enjoyed the In the face of Grace, a look of illicit passion when the once devout wife was completely satisfied having sex with a man who clearly enjoys manipulating others, I will say that In general, the scene did not deserve the "R" rating of the film. <br /> <br /> Julian returned home to find her husband rejuvenated for getting a well-paying job, and she is excited to be able to return to a normal life where she can once again be a loving wife and mother loving. <br /> <br /> But the evil Julian Grant comes back on the scene and is not willing to surrender so easily to Grace. Grace has a plan to rid her life of Julian, but will it work? <br /> <br /> Obviously, I do not want to ruin the remaining story for you. However, I will say that I always enjoy movies that involve the sexual pretense of a wife (especially when she exhibits uninhibited attraction and behavior that are normally reserved for her husband) but in reality, she is seeking revenge against the antagonist. This movie would have been much, much better if the film had included more of that in the story line. My feelings are if the movie mentions it, then the movie should end it. And this movie definitely mentioned it. Unfortunately, certain restrictions in the story line prevented this from being followed significantly. There are many other movies available that are successful with that point, and I will include your titles in the "recommendations" section of this section. I am also open to receiving suggestions sent by email from other movies that contain a good story line about sexual simulation by a seemingly devoted wife. <br /> <br /> In general, Nastassja Kinski and William Baldwin are very good. The movie is not.
