Derek Jarman has shown us time and again that dialogue is not his forte. He is a painter, and he paints what he does. His films are almost always visually splendid, but as exciting to see as the painting that is already dry. Watch your movies in fast forward, really fast setup that you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest, Jarman does very little with the script or the characters, using them simply as a lattice to hang a very long and well-constructed cinematographic frame. It even goes so far as to contradict the original Shakespeare script to achieve these terribly slow and lifeless scenes. There is nothing of the romance, the magic, the deception or the urgency that the script demands, little spontaneity, and the character of Caliban in particular is reduced to a kind of trembling and demented idiot, similar to Gaveston in Jarman's Edward II. It's a shame that this is the only movie version of The Tempest available.
