I like Christophe Lambert as an actor. He has played in several good movies (Highlander, Subway, Greystoke, ...). But I can not even think I played in that movie. The story is almost nothing, the special effects are very bad and the actors too. To resume the film, I only have one thing to say: it's the first time I'm going to see a movie and I want to leave after 10 minutes.
