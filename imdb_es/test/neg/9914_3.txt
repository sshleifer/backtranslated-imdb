If you thought that the day after tomorrow would be unbelievable, wait to see this. <br /> <br /> Well, then the premise of most disaster films is usually a 1 in a billion event that occurs, aggravated by other circumstances. In this case, the pair is the union of two enormous systems of storms. Fair enough until now. Oh, but wait, no, the "event" is sabotage and the subsequent destruction of the electrical network. <br /> <br /> Next, add a lot of elements of human interest, in this case an unfaithful husband, a psychotic weapon. wielding her boyfriend, a rebellious daughter, a hacker with a point to prove, a senator trying to impose an agenda, a journalist trying to put himself against "the man" and a pregnant woman trapped in a lift. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a handful of test events to add excitement. <br /> <br /> My God, if the director tried to fit into a more meaningless plot, there would have been less time for the actual disaster, which, given the unfortunate state of computer graphics, was almost certainly , the intention. <br /> <br /> My God, if you can not even model a truck convincingly, you really should not take tornadoes, exploding power plants, Las Vegas. destroying me, or destroying oil stations. <br /> <br /> In case you have not seen how terrible this film is, let me add that three bad guys are murdered separately, and in totally implausible and implausible ways, which stank more to the moralization of good creation of movies. <br /> <br /> I do not have any problem with first-month students writing jaded, hackneyed, scripts steeped in clich√©s, but for God's sake, that does not mean anyone has to turn them into movies! <br /> <br /> He manages to make Apocalypse 10.0 abysmally not seem so terrible. Avoid them both.
