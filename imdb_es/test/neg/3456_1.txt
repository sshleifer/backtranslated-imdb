For me, it's amazing that the best version of this incredible story is still a cartoon made by Walt Disney in the 1940s, but it's true. In this case, another clumsy attempt generates confusions and alienations would be spectators with an admirable effectiveness and we will successfully antagonize those of us who have read the story. Irving's original work is brief in any way and making a feature film will be a challenge. One can completely rewrite the story to Tim Burton, which is a discussion for another time, or fill in the bust line of the older girl with involuntary details. The last thing is what is tried here, and if I can say, unfortunately. New unimaginative and completely modern facets for personalities of characters such as religious fanaticism in Crane or Wanderlust in the old Bram Bones spoil the intention of the story and reveal a serious lack of talent of the filmmakers. When the famous climax of the story approached, he had completely lost interest. It's the kind of movie where you expect to see a stage in the background smoking.
