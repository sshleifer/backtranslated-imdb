This is absolutely the stupidest film ever produced in front of a camera. I can not believe I was skilled enough to rent this piece of scrap metal. I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this takes the cake ... Ice cream and Chips Too. Omg, I still can not forget how bad this was. The acting was a joke ... The plot did not exist ... and the work of the camera had to be done by a 3-year-old boy. I've never seen a movie take so long to go anywhere. I mean, the whole movie could have been shot in less than 30 minutes. I guess this guy had a little extra time on his hands ... (like 3 hours). And an additional $ 60 in his wallet, and he decided one night ... (Hey ... We're going to make the stupidest movie ever made.) And they did just that. Give me a break. Right now I'm going back to the video store to get my money back from Demand. Any other person who has seen this piece of garbage should do the same.
