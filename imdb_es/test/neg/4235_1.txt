The director infuses this film with false depth repeating a trick throughout the film. EVERY single shot in this movie is 3 times longer than it should be. You could cut 1.5 hours of this movie of 2.5 hours agonizing without eliminating: a word of dialogue, an image, an event or movement. <br /> <br /> This was one of the most free movie wastes I've ever seen. Other reviewers have called it pretentious, which is an understatement. L'Humanite is a pseudo-intellectual garbage designed to be anti-Hollywood, so that the Cannes judges can affirm their independence from the Oscars. <br /> <br /> The IMDb critic says: "Unlike Hollywood movies, which generally force the audience into full motion: this forces the audience to slow down and observe in great detail some of the smaller and more mundane characteristics of life ". You would have to be catatonic to look at some of these images for so long and move slowly towards these characters. This is not real life unless you are very medicated. <br /> <br /> Finally, I felt that Schott√©'s performance was a sad scam of the masterful "Chauncy Gardner" by Peter Sellers. Use the same facial expressions and postures. Even the gardens! In many ways, there are parallels between these two films. The main difference is that "being there" progresses and does not trust the shock and tricks to create a meaningful experience while questioning several things that we take for granted in life.
