When I saw 6.0 on IMDb, I was quite impressed and excited to see this movie, since a 6 for a horror movie should be quite entertaining. At first I thought it would be a perverse, invisible and disturbing force (not having read the book) to terrorize the audience, but it turns out to be something quite mundane: killer plants. In any case, I'm a pretty open person when it comes to movies, so I thought maybe the movie would bring some kind of revolutionary twist on carnivorous vines. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations due to excessive cliché quantities and lack of originality. To make matters worse, the main female character continues to bother you with her stupidity. Unless the movie is intentionally a bad B-rated movie that is entertained by the hilarity of evil, no movie should have a main character that will irritate you if you expect the audience to care about the character. These roles must be reserved for secondary characters. The characters were not developed, the monsters (the plants in this case) were left unexplained, and clichés dripped everywhere. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is slightly effective are some of the bloody / bloody scenes, although the gale pales. Compared to movies like High Tension or Ichi The Killer. Logically consistently failed (for example, why a character who does not look at the top of a rope during a second attempt to descend to the ruins when it simply breaks and almost kills someone), even if it is of little importance, adds up and continues to enrage the audience? The movie could have been saved using characters or some kind of story device to repress or "trade" idiotic characters who simply did something stupid (or at least allow the character to recognize or regret his own mistakes). But continuing to let idiocy preside will cause the audience to give up all attention for the character and, in turn, eliminate the horror of the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a bad movie. An example of a well-made movie involving the killing of the beautiful twenty-year-old is the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (and the prequel as well) that certainly instilled fear and had far fewer flaws of logic. In short, if you have a lot of time to kill, go see it if there is nothing else. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this inferior movie and go see something really scary and highly satisfying like the remake of The Hills Have Eyes.
