For the uninitiated, almost any Andy Milligan movie is a shock, but despite the fact that I have seen many of his films, he still takes the cake for sheer quality. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, the Milligan shot of Sweeney Todd's story, made with period costumes (but not necessarily vintage hairstyles, in some cases) and the usual camera work and grainy quality that cause headaches. As for the gore, well, the version I saw may have been cut, because there is not much, for a movie with "thirsty for blood" in the title. The best hint of making subversive films here is a meat pie that consists only of the title of a poor victim. <br /> <br /> So, although I will still treasure this work from my video shelf, it's definitely a bit disappointing in terms of content. Recommended only for the reckless and morbidly curious. 3 out of 10
