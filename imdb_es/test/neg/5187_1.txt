I suppose if you like snowboarding, you can enjoy watching a beautiful landscape and some tricks. But that's all the movie has to offer. the story line does not exist, and any joke that might have been in the movie was not funny, not even on a level of sympathy. I also disliked the characters, the main actor (Adam Grimes) did his best, and for a comedy like this it does not have to be much, but when he's surrounded by so many other bad actors, he had no hope of making this movie out good . but I should not be too harsh with them, so I know they may have great skill, but with a script that I could have written in ten minutes, whatever skill they had they ran and hid for fear of appearing in this movie. My advice is to not see it, I wish I never would!
