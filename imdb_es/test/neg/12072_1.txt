Well, I think I've finally seen my last Woody Allen movie! I read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good experience with Woody Allen (as I have done many times in the past). Well, that was not the case. This movie has nothing to offer. Even with the wonderful performance of the talented Sean Penn, this film failed. One of the characteristics of his other films is that of several characters: variety, witty dialogue. This film consisted basically of a single character, very one-dimensional. I almost did not have laughs. It probably looked good on paper! I think the only special thing was the performance of Samantha Morton. Now I will be looking for your films in the future. So, in conclusion, this movie was a big disappointment. >
