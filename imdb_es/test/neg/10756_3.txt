"Opposing Force [1986]" was not as good as "Dr. Strangelove" and was not as good as "The Bridge on the River Kwai". Hell, it was not even as good as "GI Jane," which is pretty sad. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a basic ethical problem: in a simulated prisoner of war situation, how far do you go before you start breaking the law? What exactly is the law in such a situation? How can you simulate someone's torture without torturing someone? Can you inflict pain intentionally? What about breaking the bones? Simulations of executions? Sexual abuse? Severe blood loss? Real weapons with bullets? Death? Somewhere between these there is a really diffuse line that divides "acceptable" from "atrocious". <br /> <br /> Now, what could you do if you were in a training program of this type and the lines between simulation and reality start to disappear? ? What could you do? This movie tries to show this dilemma. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in "resistance training". I have a brother who went through the USAF POW training program. According to him, technically he was quite close to the brand. <br /> <br /> The movie has a pretty good premise, but it does not have a particularly good story. I wondered if it could be based on some real event, but it became quite evident that it was not when the explosions started. They must have changed the screenwriters three quarters in the film, since it takes an extreme turn and becomes a somewhat useless shooting game with many explosions that distract attention. <br /> <br /> I found that it had a rather unsatisfactory ending; again, something meaningless. I kept wondering what this was all about. I'm starting to suspect that it just was not one. It could have been much better with just a little more history along with the fireworks.
