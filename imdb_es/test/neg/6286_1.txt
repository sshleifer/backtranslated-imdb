Wow ... <br /> <br /> As I read these comments, I see a remarkable socio-cultural shock issue emerging between the United States and ... the Dutch! The United States P.o.V. It seems that this is a good little movie, Parker is a nice hero, the story is a happy version of what could be a glorified form of reality. <br /> <br /> The three Dutch critics see the world Through a pair of completely different glasses it seems. Categorically and in strikingly similar terms they agree that the movie is a disaster. <br /> <br /> Far from taking sides in what seems to be a dispute between cultures, on this subject as separate as the ocean that separates them geographically. Still, based on objective observation, I saw the film with my own eyes, I suspect that the Dutch are not too far from the brand: <br /> <br /> "Parker Kane" is badly done, it's absolutely boring and It really is not worth the celluloid that was undoubtedly wasted in its creation.
