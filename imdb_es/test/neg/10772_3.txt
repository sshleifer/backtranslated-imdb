Having read the books and seen the version of Seymour, Anthony Andrews / Jane <br /> <br /> 1982, I must say that this is not good at all. <br /> <br /> According to the books, Percy is supposed to be an aristocrat apparently <br /> <br /> when he is being Percy, and witty and intelligent <br /> <br /> when he is being the Pimpernel, but here it just looks boring like <br /> Percy and it means like the Pimpernel. Marguerite is supposed to be <br /> <br /> the most beautiful woman in Europe, not a tired and disheveled-looking midwife (she looks middle-aged, probably because of bad makeup). Richard E. Grant has done much better things, and <br /> <br /> Elizabeth McGovern's performance has no inspiration and is flat. The ingenuity and brushstrokes of books and the film Andrews / Seymour are replaced here <br /> <br /> by a striking and striking edition that simply does not make the cut. <br /> <br /> I could add that to a person who has not seen any previous version or read the book, it would probably look good.
