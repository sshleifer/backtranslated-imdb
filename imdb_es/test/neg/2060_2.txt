This film is of interest to fans of the famous rock group "The Band" in which the singer / keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in several scenes. I think the film could have been shot some years before the age of 75, judging by Richard's appearance. Interestingly, Jones would later act with The Band's Levon in a considerably better movie "Coal Miner's Daughter." Anyway, you really need a special reason to survive this hard-to-see art movie. Unfortunately, the famous sensitive Manuel would commit suicide. I've never heard how it ended up in a movie. Four of the five members of the band would appear in another bad movie, "Man Outside".
