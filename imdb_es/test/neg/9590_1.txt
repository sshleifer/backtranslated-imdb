When King Kong stripped her of her top in the new 1976 version, I was breathless. I do not know how many times I went back to see those movies with the hope of seeing more. Jessica Lange was not a great actress at the time (she became one), but she was very good! I went to see "Sweet Dreams" when it was published because, by then, Ms. Lange had become a great actress. It seemed like a wonderful story. And it's always exciting to see. <br /> <br /> I never left a movie faster. My wife agreed. <br /> <br /> When we got in the car, I turned to her and said: "If you had told me that I would get bored watching Jessica Lange take off her clothes, I would have told you how crazy I got bored watching Jessice Lange take off clothes ". How bad is that?
