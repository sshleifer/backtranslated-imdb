This movie would be a great piece of the story if in fact it were a real movie of the Kennedy assassination. There are too many mistakes in this movie for him to point them out. It's a movie of the Kennedy assassination, but many of the important facts have been altered. Missing scenes, and many of the scenes, after the president's limousine passes the poster, do not fit. Both Kennedy move noticeably slower than the other four people in front of them. The next time you watch this movie, look for things that do not fit, like the governor of Texas and yours, along with the SS men in the front, lashes forward, but you can see that the limousine does not stop or diminish the speed. in fact it is accelerating. This movie is clearly an attempt to cover up.
