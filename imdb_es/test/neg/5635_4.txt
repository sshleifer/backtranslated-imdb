The fact that this film was distributed free with a certain national newspaper that I do not care, to a certain extent, made me desist from seeing it, but as I had found a copy that a local charity store was giving away. I felt I could see him with a clear conscience. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments, the evocation of the location of Thameside is very well done, but it suffers, I think, from too many faults. First of all, Vinnie Jones is simply not convincing as a journalist. While Vinnie himself is an interesting character, the truth is that he simply does not have the ability to act to achieve a role like this. <br /> <br /> Secondly, who would carry with them a lost manuscript that they have been informed of is "priceless"? It seemed that Mr. Jones was everywhere with this manuscript! Third, Dickens's whole aspect of history, while it seems to be important, interferes with what could have been an interesting corruption film in high places. Maybe it's just a little thick, but I really could not see the point of the story in Dickens style. This did not add anything to the movie, and only served to confuse things when things started to be interesting within the line of modern history. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I will give to the filmmakers is that at least they tried something a little different. I am in favor of independent British films that try to be 'off the field', but this is not a 'Red Road' or 'This is England'. What it is is a bit messy and too long. Yes, it entertains in part, but in the end it felt as if two films merged to form a whole and failed to do so. (Also, I can not help thinking that I've seen something similar recently done on television by Ian Banks, set in Edinburgh with a story about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes).
