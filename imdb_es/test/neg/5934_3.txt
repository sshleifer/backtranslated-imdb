As with most of the viewers of this movie, I am an avid reader of the books. The first 2 films have Buck, Ray and Chloe as the main characters, but in this second sequel they play a secondary role in the presidential effort of Louis Gossett JR. World at War is based on the meeting he had with Buck in the book series. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this movie is as horrible as the first two. Amanda appears out of nowhere and suddenly has an important role to play (I will not reveal it in case someone has not read the series). Other characteristics of the illogical parts. I really want Cloud 10 to be a good Left Behind movie, but unfortunately this is similar in all bad aspects to the first 2.
