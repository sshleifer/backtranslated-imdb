Not to be confused with the 1943 film by George Zucco, "The Mad Ghoul", "The Mad Monster" is a film that Zucco appeared the year before. In this matter of painting by numbers, Zucco perfects a way to turn his little hands, Petro, into a wolf / man hybrid by injecting wolf blood, and then loses little time in sending the transformed fool to kill the Former colleagues who had mocked their experiments. It's a very simple plot, really, and a very low budget production. Glenn Strange, who plays the man / wolf here, will soon reach a greater fame as Franky's monster in films like "House of Frankenstein" (1944) and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948). The make-up work on him here is pretty lame, and it only makes him look like a hippie with bad teeth (like the "Teenage Monster" of 1957). The sets in this film, moreover, are quite non-existent, and the outcome is abrupt and unconvincing. I have given the film 4 very generous stars, partly because I have a lasting love for the horror films of the 1940s, but the truth is that most of the objective viewers will probably consider it a ridiculous shit, and I suppose that yes. It's certainly not a well-crafted universal subject or a Val Lewton masterpiece, that's for sure! Still, Zucco is always fun to watch, even in an undemanding hairstyle like this. If you can devote 72 minutes of your life, I suppose you could do worse than "The Mad Monster" (not too bad, of course!). Oh ... another thing. This DVD is from Alpha Video, and you know what that means: blurry images, lousy sound (in fact, the worst sound of any Alpha Video DVD that I have found so far) and no extras. You have been warned!
