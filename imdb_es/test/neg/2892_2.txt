Honestly, this movie is one of the best movies of all time ... if you suffer from insomnia. It is an infallible way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. As the film progresses slowly, the audience slides into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of whatever plot the movie may contain. This effect was surely created due to the lack of sweet action / sweet babies. <br /> <br /> In addition, Mr. Eisenstein obviously could not master the art of montage. A good example of this is the scene on the Odessa steps. For no apparent reason, an event that in real life would have taken a matter of seconds turns into a seven-minute nightmare for any healthy viewer. This editing flaw tarnishes any kind of realism throughout the film. Honestly, I've seen more realistic cartoon editions. <br /> <br /> Some people who have commented on this title have considered Battleship Potemkin as: "One of the best movies of all time" and "Truly a masterpiece". Well, I am writing this comment to persuade readers not to watch this movie at all costs. My best guess is that my fellow Potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. Surely what they wanted to say was: "One of the best sleeper festivals of all time" and, "Truly an epic flaw". <br /> <br /> In conclusion, do not waste your time. If you are interested in watching a movie of superior quality, go to www.youtube.com and watch a Halo 3 montage. If I played the movie "Battleship Potemkin" in a killer game in the guardian, I would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then the tea bag and his corpse. PEACE!
