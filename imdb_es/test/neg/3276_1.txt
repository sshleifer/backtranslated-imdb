I saw this for sale - NEW - at my local store for $ 6 and I said "Hey! An action movie with that guy from Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon, run by the guy that Enter the Dragon did - and it's cheap! " So I bought it. Ups! This is possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life, and I've seen a few dozen. <br /> <br /> Do you know how movies that are intentionally popular, like Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive, are AWESOME? Do you know how movies that are supposed to be serious but that are so horrible that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again, like Lionheart (an old Van Damme movie) or John Carpenter Vampires, are pretty good? This movie, Ironheart, manages to be NONE of those. I do not know what the filmmakers thought, but it seems that this film was made without time to film, without a budget for anything and without a script to talk about. (While I'm in the script, I must point out that Bolo Yeung does not have LINES in this film, the only reason he receives the first bill in the box is the fact that he is the only actor in the film that once recognized (Unless you're a fan of Jackie Chan, in which case you'll recognize the bad guy, and you'll want to call him Giancarlo!). <br /> <br /> What's also sad is that this movie is from '92. moment, T2: the day of the trial ended, so you know that the 80s campaign was over ... but not quite, after this, you will think that Chuck Norris movies from the 80s, school comedies Secondary and the sequels of Jason / Freddy were works of an absolute genius. <br /> <br /> Things you should know: <br /> <br /> 1) No one in this movie can act for the beans. The closest you can get is Richard Norton, who looks very rich and arrogant, and Bolo Yeung looks appropriately bad ... and arrogant. Everything else is frightening. <br /> <br /> 2) The scenes of martial arts are forgettable: only many cases of white men with many muscles taking off their shirts, shouting, running to Britton Lee, being expelled by Britton Lee. being hit by Britton Lee, then falling. Even the final showdown against Bolo is disappointingly short, and as creative as the design of my running socks (and equally stinky). <br /> <br /> 3) The rest of the action is also pathetic: the guns look as if they came from the toy department at K-Mart, and in fact, they are fired at the sound of a gun. When someone is shot, they bounce a little, then stand still with brownish red liquid stains on their clothes. Apparently, Britton Lee gets shot in the side, but he does not see it at all, and later that day he sees the wound ... I've had paper cuts that were worse than that! <br /> <br /> 4) Of course, then the girl dresses the wound, then they kiss, and the next thing they know is that they are lying down talking after sex. Eh what? The credible development of the love interest, as well as any kind of character development, is completely overlooked in this film. Do you remember that Bruce Lee's characters did not need to have sex with anyone to be cool? <br /> <br /> 5) The car chase is, by far, the worst I've ever seen. It seems that the director was sitting on the sidewalk with a handheld camera while the two cars were moving down the road doing, oh I do not know, about 30 miles per hour? Do not try this at home, children, these people are professionals! Hah! <br /> <br /> 6) Very badly written. Here's a scene for you: Lee is being followed, so the girl follows the followers to "warn" Lee, but her car is too slow. So when she catches up, Lee and the bad guys have left their cars and there's a shooting in progress. Lee has killed two bad guys, but the third is to shoot Lee when the girl almost runs over him, so the bad guy runs away. (Huh?) Then the girl's car stops and she can not pull it off. She tells Lee that she is involved now and that she is with him. He points out to her that they can not leave their car there because the bad guys will track him down. She somehow convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem, so he shoots the gas tank and blows up his car. (And remember, later that same night they have sex). Hey?!? <br /> <br /> 7) If you look carefully, in more than half of the nightclub shots, the dancers are not synchronized with the music. The dancers are also too coordinated with each other (apparently, in the 80s all the people in the dance clubs took dance lessons). There's a girl in the DJ booth with a microphone, but she never does anything except dance. Gorillas tell people who are struggling to "take it outside," without moving their lips. In one scene, the only goalkeepers who pass by Lee and Stevo are right inside the entrance, but with their backs! Also, apparently, if you are an important character in the movie, you can go directly to the beginning of the line. <br /> <br /> 8) Lee realizes the first time they follow him, but he does not. Note the second time, even if it's the same guy in the same car. The girl, however, realizes. The bad guys are followed twice, but they never realize it. <br /> <br /> 9) Lee is worried that the bad guys will give the car back to the girl, although they have already seen him appear where he works twice. The girl proceeds to leave her son at work, in the care of a friend, while she is not having sex with Lee. DO NOT learn the upbringing of this movie's children! <br /> <br /> I can not think of more complaints at this moment ... you understand the idea ... Ironheart is so bad, it's not even funny, it's a shame
