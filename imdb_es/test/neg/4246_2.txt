Hope Floats with Sandra Bullock is a real disappointment. The story starts well. Her husband cheats on her and she finds out on national television. So she has to rebuild her life. Here it could have become interesting or built into a story, but you get so bored with that. She moves in with her parents and Harry Connick Jr., who plays Justin, begins to beat her. The two do not have real chemistry, but you're supposed to have the impression that Justin is in love with her. The movie ends the way you think it will be, but I wish it had not ended like any other guy like this. They had a good start with this movie and could have made it visible, but instead it's a movie that you'll definitely want to miss.
