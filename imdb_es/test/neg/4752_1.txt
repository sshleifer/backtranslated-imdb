The production value of AvP2 can be described by an adjective: AWFUL <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous, even in the fictional area of ​​AvP: What are the caricatists for in the Predator ship? Why is the Predator cleaning up all the signs of his influence and wasting precious time with evisceration and even presenting the body of an insignificant human policeman? Why is the Predator alone? Why is the Predator equipping itself only on earth but on its home planet? Why does the Predator make his job so uncomfortable by hunting the Aliens instead of bombarding the entire field as humans do at the end? Why does the Predator drop more and more of its few weapons instead of collecting them to keep them together after using one? In the end, even his armor is falling before fighting with the Predalien in hand-to-hand combat: what a bad plagiarism in the first final fight of the predators between Arny and the Predator. The Predator's gestures are so exaggerated that he is moving more like a Japanese sumo than a highly skilled alien safari hunter. As you can see immediately, the whole story is a mess. But it gets even worse because this failed job is filled with a boring mosaic of meaningless interludes, such as a long episode of pizza orders or detailed information about the criminal past of the two brothers (Dallas and Ricky). The Sheriff is, of course, the friend of these two criminals that he regularly puts behind bars. (It is not convincing and absolutely superfluous for the plot). <br /> <br /> Also, the cast of actors is horrible. Compared to the upper class of directors and actors of the old movies of Aliens or Predator, AvP2 is a shit shamefully bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, the action of the movie is really bad. There is not a single action combat scene in which the public can see the whole set. Each and every one of the fights are filmed in short and trembling bursts with near approach in almost total darkness. This translates into a heinous experience for the public because, for the most part, you can not see anything but a dark and shaky screen. <br /> <br /> I suggest to the two brothers Strause leaders that they buy a stable camera and learn a lesson in modern CG so that the next film contains a visible action of visible figures and may not have to disguise their bad skills of direction that way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend to anyone (even AvP fans) not to watch this movie: I prefer The First or the original Aliens or the original Predator movies, but avoid disappointment by losing your valuable time in this failure.
