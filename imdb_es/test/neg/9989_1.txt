It is a rare feeling to find yourself with such an embarrassing movie that you feel the need to get away from the screen. But when you see a noble actor like Sir John Gielgud surrounded by naked and copulated couples, that's what you want to do. Add to that Peter O'Toole as Emperor Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell, asphyxiated with syphilis, sticking his finger in the anus of a male victim, and begins to appreciate that Caligula is of interest only to addicts to the sick / scandalous movies. <br /> <br /> The film shows the life of the notorious Roman emperor Caligula (McDowell), a highly disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, beheadings, betrayals, murders, incestuous relationships and scenes of lesbian sex <br /> <br /> Although Caligula was totally angry in real life, and probably succumbed to his basic instincts most of the time, the film remains an inexcusable rubbish. Sex in the film is not used as an aspect in a multi-layered story: sex IS history. After a while, all the nudity, the thrust of the hip and the suction of the nipple become tedious due to pure repetition. The performances are totally undisciplined, particularly McDowell, who throws caution to the wind and gives a performance that is a wild-eyed posture. O'Toole seems to be treating the script with the disdain it deserves (surely he's in it just for the money ?!). Rumors abound that additional pornographic scenes were added without the director's consent during post-production, but in reality there is not a single minute in Caligula that is worthy or well done. It is doubtful that this amount of time, talent and money will be thrown back into a porn movie, so, in that sense, Caligula is a unique experience ... on the other hand, it is so terribly terrible that perhaps the fact that be "one of a kind" is a blessing in disguise.
