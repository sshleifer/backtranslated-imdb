Go to any movie fan and ask them the title of the film that was directed by Robert Wise, with second unit direction by Yakima Canutt and Sergio Leone, was designed by Ken Adam and marked by Max Steiner, starring Sir Stanley Baker, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Brigitte Bardot, were filmed in color, range and stereo, in Cinecitta in 1955, with a thousand extras, and they will tell you to go and stop being silly. <br /> <br /> I tell you that there is no such movie. That the names you have quoted NEVER worked together, were not even contemporaries. And you just choose the names of a random movie publication and you're trying to confuse them. <br /> <br /> At that time you can direct them to IMDb and show them the cast and crew of "Helen De Troya". They will be amazed! This lesser-known epic sword and sandal has ALL these names and more: Niall MacGinnis, Janette Scott and the good old Harry Andrews. <br /> <br /> And it's certainly a rarity. After the war, 1,000 Italian extras cost around $ 25 per day and toga dramas were a staple of Italian cinema. The scenes of the orgy were shot twice: one with tops, the other without (you can guess which version obtained Great Britain and the United States). I think that even La Sof√≠a is an extra in this case. <br /> <br /> Either way, the names HIGHLIGHT the mind. But in reality it's just a coincidence. All the mentioned names were reaching the end of their careers (Canutt, Steiner) or starting with them (all others). <br /> <br /> Only Robert Wise and Niall MacGinnis were in the middle of their careers. <Br /> <br /> For the record, Leone had not been accredited and was learning his trade. Adam still had to invent the falling circle on the roof of the games (a mark he had put on all the first bonuses). Baker had yet to star and help produce "Zulu" and "Robo," and run a Welsh television company called Harlech, then die tragically young. <br /> <br /> While Harry Andrews would continue to become one of Britain's favorite character actors: Janette Scott (Thora Hird's daughter) would never be the best, but who can forget her in "Day Of The Triffids" "(although his part was added later) because of the filling and a happy ending. ) Or "Crack In The World"? <br /> <br /> Sir Cedric was theater, but he knew how to act in the film, and Bardot ... it was BARDOT, by surprise! <br /> <br /> But what were these star people doing in this camp of old nonsense? Do not ask me The two main stars were nameless Italians: Helen had a mustache and Paris was pretty, while the British only supported. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I think you can mark this as a MAIN FLUKE. In stereo. To be honest, if I had not seen it, I would not believe it ANYTHING!
