Okay, I gave it a "3" because obviously they did not have money to make this movie, but I think it could deserve the "2.3" rating I had when I got here. Actually, I am helping to raise your score, despite being bored for the last hour and a half. I will keep the "1" and the "2" for the pieces of highest trash budget. At least the creators of "Rise of the Undead" did not waste so much money. They managed to lose 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The movie is too claustrophobic for me. The entire film takes place in the same building, in dark rooms and hallways. With an environment like this, there should have been more action or development of the character, but there is a lot of meaningless conversation. I did not get to know any of the characters. There is a schoolgirl and a goth girl, but we never discovered much more about them. None of the characters seems really nice. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie made with zero budget. There are no special effects of fear. There is no suspense. There's really nothing interesting here, friends. I admit that I downloaded this from the network. It was free, but I'm pulling it. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the filmmakers. Better luck next time. This is more like a soap opera than a zombie movie.
