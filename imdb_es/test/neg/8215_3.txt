** May contain Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The main character, a noble named Fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so crazy and lethal that he could have been better drowned. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced "dee-SAYd") speaks with his own hallucinations and sees all the intruders on the island as invading pirates. He routinely beats the dumb servant Anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. The involuntary laughter is provided by the "Nubian" slave giant Mantis, who speaks with a deep South accent and helps Sade hunt the intruders in the style of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. De Sade's crazed wife, ravaged by leprosy, provides some truly frightening moments as she walks through the dungeon and hugs a chained prisoner helplessly. (This scene was seen on television late at night by many children who carried the memory to adulthood.) The only person almost normal in sight is Cassandra, who self-discovers a science. ("I used to be a nurse, now I do not have much of anything"). She and Fallon plan their escape and finally meet a more fearsome enemy than De Sade and Mantis combined. <br /> <br /> This film was shot in San Antonio and was directed by a more competent man to draw horror comics than to make horror films. (I'll say a lot for Mr. Boyette: he shows his correction with the contagion here, as he did in his comics). It's more like a melodrama by Andy Milligan without the meat cleavers. Period costumes, library music, abuse of the disabled and general misanthropy make one wonder if Andy was not called as a consultant. However, Milligan made better costumes and wrote better dialogues. The technical errors are too numerous to list here, but you know that this movie is in trouble when you see the opening wreck, which seems to have been fired in a fish tank. Also, a movie made in Texas should have had spiders and real snakes instead of rubber ones. The glorious Eastmancolor gives this melodrama the striking appearance it so deserves. The initial meeting of Fallon with the leprous Countess is really horrifying, as is the farewell shot of the film. If the rest had been half heartbreaking, THE HARROW DUNGEON would have been a horror classic. Instead, it's a fun piece of mess garbage lovers will love, for all the wrong reasons.
