OK ... so ... I really like Kris Kristofferson and his usual ease of delivering lines in his films. Age has helped him with his smooth, low-energy style and will steal a scene effortlessly. But, the disappearance is its false step. Holy Moly, this was a bad movie! <br /> <br /> I must congratulate the cinematography and the actors, including Kris, for trying to give their best sense to this silly and confusing story! None of that made sense and Kris probably did not understand it either and he was just repeating the movements waiting for someone to come up and tell him what it was about! <br /> <br /> I do not care if everyone in this movie was doing it for the love of the project, or for some nonsense ... I've seen low budget movies that had a plot for God's sake! This had nothing, zilcho, nothing, zippo, without reason ... a complete waste of good talent, landscapes and celluloid! <br /> <br /> I rented this piece of garbage for a dollar, and I want to get my money back! I want my 2 hours back! I have invested in this Grade F waste of my time! Do not watch this movie, or lose a minute of your valuable time as it passes through a room where it is playing, or even open the case containing the DVD! Believe me, you will thank me for the advice!
