I've never been a big fan of Larry Clark, but somehow, I've been dragged into almost every one of his films. Now, I like independent films, and I grew a lot in punk rock, and I would like to say that this film is disappointing for both audiences. Not all punk songs incorporate "Oi!" in their choirs, as they do in this particular movie. <br /> <br /> But the real problem with this film is that it changes moods every fifteen minutes approximately and does not have any kind of cohesion. Clark has made a living pretending that his fictional stories are "what children really are", and as such, he will allow ten-minute scenes of stupid dialogues that will not go anywhere, because that is the sensation of cinema that he feels . However, when filming a ridiculous death scene (choose any of them, except for the initial drive-by), the too stylized attempts of what I assume is black humor are completely out of context, ridiculously filmed (in most cases, much worse than a student movie) and absolutely ridiculous in terms of the story. John Cassavettes and "Date Movie" are poor bedmates, since the incursions in this last style take you out of any kind of reality to remind you that you are watching a movie, a very, very bad one.
