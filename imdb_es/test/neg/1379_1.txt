Carlos Mencia is not funny. From his stand up specials to this train crash of a television series, Carlos Mencia is not funny. I've been trying to convince people for two years that he steals the jokes of other comedians and, in regards to his comedy material, is a regular "Johnny-come-lately" with far less than mediocre results. Jokes of psycho astronaut? Britney Spears breaks pranks? I hope this is just a programming error, but in Carlos and Comedy Central, those themes, and many others, have covered the full range of opening monologues of television presenters, Saturday Night Live, Mad TV and many, many more . Ethnic and racial strokes in the use of the lamp? Comedy has no chance to evolve with Carlos Mencia. Maybe people, especially the viewers and executives of Comedy Central will get the point since this week's issue of the magazine "New York" accurately labeled it: "Carlos Mencia, a repentant prankster".
