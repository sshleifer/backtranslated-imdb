He would be one of the few people who own a copy of this classic. But not only do I have 1, I'm actually 2. It's THAT's good. <br /> <br /> Well, when I say it right, I want to say badly. But I will try to do a thorough review. I even observed 'born a ninja' that one of the other people mentioned here mentioned, to compare it to this. And being born a ninja is really worse, but not so fun. <br /> <br /> And this is always fun. EVERYTHING about this movie is poor. ALL. The plot is absolutely full (keep in mind that 'he will have to keep me alive if he wants to know where to find his wife'). EACH sequence of action is also filled. Our hero danton is more than a hero; You can stab people with twigs, take 3 bullets in the heart at 50 cm distance without even bleeding, and tie a rope to a tree that, when an enemy steps on it, ties a knot around the enemy's leg, raise, and throw it 50 meters into a pile of barbs. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that it is impossible to comment, but it should make you roll, especially when the dantons jump off the ground and growl. The bad boy'. Oh, yes, and the bad ones: somehow, it seems that they are resurrected 5 times each in the movie. Maybe it's just that there were not enough actors, but in a movie of this caliber? I doubt that. <br /> <br /> The 'plot' is about how Danton was a soldier in the Vietnam War, and now his Colonel is hunting real people to train his mercenaries. By chance, the colonel takes Danton and then Danton defends himself. This is just the excuse for a rambo clone, with most of the movie being soldiers killing Danton. And I really can not explain the plot anymore because there is nothing else in the movie. However, it's still amazing. <br /> <br /> What else could be wrong if you ask? Do not get me started. Hand grenades that really shoot at the feet of the actors because the explosion is the size of a match. Scenes where there are 5 people chasing Danton, then the camera moves away and comes back and there are 7. The way in which each time Danton charges the grenade launcher is in the same context, although it is in completely different places. And the worst part is when Danton pushes the plastic rocks over the enemies, and one of them is completely intact with the rocks, so he does not know what to do, so he almost dies without even being touched. It's ridiculous! <br /> <br /> But fun. Very very funny. This is one of the few movies that I can recommend to everyone, because if you do not find it funny, you are 1 in a million. And for the rest of us it's magic.
