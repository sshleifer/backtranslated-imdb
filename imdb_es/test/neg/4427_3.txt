The first Jackie Chan movie where there are no signs of the Chan person we know. This is Chan in a traditional revenge tale of the kind that was cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios throughout Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. It's a very serious story that does not show the humor and warmth that would catapult Jackie Chan to stardom. It is also clear to see this that if he had not reinvented himself, it is likely that we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short. Like a movie on its own merits, this is an attractive but quite interesting movie. I was watching it, in the middle of a marathon of martial arts movies that lasted all day and would have mixed with all the other movies I saw that day if I had not noticed Jackie in the movie. Honestly, I do not think it's worth bothering with the movie (there are many other better variations), except if you're interested in seeing where Jackie Chan started.
