Everyone loves to see a really bad movie at some point. You look at it, you laugh and forget it in the next half hour. But this is not one of those. It is the worst thing that will appear before your eyes for a while. <br /> <br /> I would like to see someone take responsibility for Dante. He's really the stupidest villain you can think of: a guy in leather pants who speaks with voice-over and have a victory. Laugh like a Dracula of the 50. How can someone come up with this boy? And the hero ... "The Dragon" or whatever ... my cereal box has better acting skills than him (maybe more than all of them), it's amazing. But the worst are the fight scenes in which you would think there might be something. They are so lame, it is beyond any description. There is no shame, I just can not believe how this movie was allowed by any studio. But I'm glad it was. Seeing this is a pleasure that self-mutilates. Watch this only if you are in a pain search for the movie, and in that case, this is a sure winner.
