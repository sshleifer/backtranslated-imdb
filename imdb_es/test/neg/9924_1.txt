This contains some information about spoiler, but the movie is not worth seeing anyway ... <br /> <br /> Why Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson agreed to be part of this debacle of writer and director Damian Harris, surpasses me. The story is full of unrealistic police investigation techniques, which include going to a party with a suspect and inviting that suspect to their house and getting intimate with them. The story also features a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female clients, and he sleeps with all of them. <br /> <br /> Even more exaggerated is the notion that women are victims of a horrific S / The crime belongs to a large but secret group of lesbian executives S / M. <br /> <br / > Filled with editing and continuity errors, the film is sterile in all its luxurious locations, including the detective salary department of Barkin. . And the lame dialogue is in a position to put one to sleep. <br /> <br /> Damian is a bad writer and a bad director. He tried and failed miserably to create a noir atmosphere at times. Also, he could not get Ellen Barkin to give him 110%. I firmly believe that she realized that the movie was pathetic and stopped trying. <br /> <br /> Outstanding were Peta Wilson, who lost time studying with a Dominatrix for the role. Marshall Bell gave the best of himself as always. <br /> <br /> And as Damian could not meet at any level, it was difficult to feel emotion for any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The most important thing is that you do not know much about the real world of BDSM and chose to create the typical "Hollywood Reality" of beautiful, perverted and dangerous men and women. <br /> <br /> Save your time, money and weights and pass this one.
