Do not rent this movie. I ended up buying the "previously seen" tape of this for $ 4.00. That was close to the price of a rental, so I thought, I should buy it. I'm pulling it after finishing this review. The film, starring Lowe, is a music video with few lines of dialogue, slow-moving shots and bad editing. I thought I would be watching a meaningless action movie, which is what I wanted to see, I did not even understand that. This film is an exercise in shots in slow motion, without a script, close-ups, terrible editions and an undeveloped plot. I can not believe that it really ends with a scene in which they believe that the audience cares about the characters. At the end of the movie, we still do not even know who they are. Create the drum, stay away.
