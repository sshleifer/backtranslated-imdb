I like a good novelty song. No, I'm retiring that. I love a good novelty song. Absolutely I despise GGROBAR on the other hand, and I have since the first note I heard. When I discovered that someone had made a caricature based on her, my head almost exploded. Now that I've seen it because my children begged me, I wish my head had exploded. I would have been saved from the unbearable misery that was this cr @ pfest. First, making a one-hour presentation based on a three-minute novelty song is a ridiculous idea. To stretch a song like this, that had to be crazy just to be so long, in a whole hour, is even more ridiculous. This was poorly written, cheaply animated, badly acted ... the list goes on and on. Dear God, is this always bad?
