This movie is dated in many ways, it is sensational. You can laugh or shake your fists with fury. <br /> <br /> This movie deals with many problems of the history of the United States, but with white-male-Christian-American paternalism: the main character is one of those who can do everything that I have and that You have to love for my kind of person. It is so pompous and should not be taken seriously at any time. What a horrible creature! His wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the film and, in the end, a character still very tearful but stronger. Too bad she still forgives her arrogant ways after I've left her a second time. It's sad that the character has not changed at all. Although she is supposed to represent a strong and independent woman in the end, she is worried about her husband looking for adventures. So 2 out of 10 points of feminists among us (and those are just for good intentions ...)! The problem of the suppression of the Indians is treated fairly well, but there is that paternalistic story again. And the fact that all African-American characters are typical stereotypes makes the movie even more hypocritical. I was so enraged most of the time! Then, a point (to try) of the movement for civil rights. <br /> <br /> I know that the movie was made at a different time. I love old movies and I have a lot of patience with some of those dated points of view. But this was just disgusting! <br /> <br /> What keeps this movie are the parts without the main character. Mr. Dix's performance is exaggerated and conceited. Maybe that's why his character is so unpleasant ... I liked Mrs. Dunne's performance, even though her character sometimes infuriated me. <br /> <br /> But I must say that the famous scene of the race for the land was incredibly done. And the way the Oklahoma settlement was portrayed made the movie worthwhile. It is amazing how civilization arose from the earth and dust of the 19th century. And I do not understand the problem that some have with the church scene. I thought it was pretty funny and fun. Maybe it was not supposed to be, but I liked it. Then, 9 points for those scenes and the impressive narrative of the development of the state of Oklahoma. That makes about 4 points in total!
