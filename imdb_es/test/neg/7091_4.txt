In trying to keep pace with the youth audiences as the 70s approached, OaCD, YCSF was the strangest and weirdest material product selected for music. Here is the regression of past life, ESP and hypnotherapy ... pretty crazy! The real problem with the concept (music or not) are the extraordinarily low dramatic stakes; Where can a movie go and what can happen when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl who can not stand? He can not go anywhere new, but in a strange way, he can not even go to any old place! In fact, if it could, the audiences still would not have interest in the union of Yves Montand (interpreting a much older and arrogant French ass) and Streisand. (a much younger girl). We never get involved in them, their situations or results. Montand is evil and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligible. <br /> <br /> He has been given a superficial sheet from the 60s that makes it completely disposable; Despite Minelli's efforts here and there that are respectable. It has not even adapted from a non-musical story that met with any previous success ... that's too much past! Streisand occasionally has some fun business to offer, such as when she tries not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance. But she relies too much on her crazy and attractive Jewish girl (translation: irritating). However, it can sing very well, both in the "soft" and "powerful" ends of the range. In the midst of a score of musical scum, he gets 3 or 4 incredible songs * of a caliber much higher than what Fanny or Dolly had to offer. 'He is not you' is a bit sweet, as sublime as 'My Funny Valentine' by Lorenz Hart, but the film is not able to perceive any impact of it; because the lyrics do not seem to refer to anything in the movie, and nothing remotely suggests that a great love between Chabot and Melinda is flourishing. <br /> <br /> The only cut we can see is a bad ax work from a much bigger movie. Solid research shows a more extensive film, better explained and more decorative, but not necessarily better: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure there will be more Babs in that version, but more importantly, there will be more serious work by Minelli. <br /> <br /> In the end, Montand sends Babs to sing the title song, after he discovers that he is a total cock that feeds her with a homily of self-esteem to get carried away. And she takes the bait. So, uh ... hurray about that. <br /> <br /> (* Hurry, it's beautiful up here, love with all the trimmings, He's not you, and the title song)
