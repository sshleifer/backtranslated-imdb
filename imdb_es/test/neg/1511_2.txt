(As a note, I would like to say that I saw this film in my annual church camp, where the whole group of young people laughed at it. I bought it when I saw it on a shelf a year later, if only for the humor Derivé de a bad attempt to make an evangelical film.) <br /> <br /> Lay it Down does not meet the expectations of many movie fans in several different planes. Most problems are found within impersonal performance. Regardless of the good cars in the movie, or the truth in Christ's sacrifice for you, such as a movie and a tool to witness, Lay it Down barely complies. <br /> <br /> Most of the good opinions of the films are supported by Christians who agree with the message. While it is easy for a Christian to agree with the points cast, the public almost never witnesses life outside of a cliché. The fight scene between Ben and his brother is horribly bent. And there are at least three flagrant typographical errors in the subtitles. <br /> <br /> I encourage anyone who sees the movie a second time with the director's comment. It really helps you understand why the movie was written how it was. The director's views on secular society are practically opposed to what would cover the needs of a movie buff: he shows a pedantic understanding of non-Christians, as well as some points of religious conflict; most of the edition, he admits, was hasty, but "satisfactory"; he thought that the transitions and the topics used in excess were effective; And I was completely happy with the performance. <br /> <br /> He also inserted reasons of which he was quite proud: -All (read: most) of the names are significant. Ben Destin = "Been Destined", Gus Pelman = "Gospel Man", Nicky D = Nicodemus. -The car that makes donuts is a symbol of the nothing that surrounds a life without Christ. -When Ben leaves on Pete's motorcycle, he crosses his crutches to form a "cross". <br /> <br /> I'm not inventing any of that. He throws things like this while saying that street runners and things like that "explode their brains with weapons," and how "God is in control when you are born and when you die." Yes, that was not a typo. He really says that. <br /> <br /> I have (small) forgiveness reserved for this movie. The "great cars" and the "good message" do nothing to make this film good. However, the film was made from a group of non-professionals with a budget less than a hundredth of "The Fast and the Furious's", and the time limit was relentless. With that in mind, I give it a score of 2/10, instead of the 1/10 that I think it deserves.
