I just can not understand how any Who fanatic, or just someone could find this horrible, lazy, badly written, even remotely funny abomination. It is so shamefully below average that it qualifies as a real tragedy. The potential for this was enormous, it could have been great. What a shame that all that acting talent, the sets, the accessories, the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burned. and quality control here. Just like those Hollywood movies (crazy crazy world, real casino) where the stars are only getting stuck and "having a great time", which basically means collecting a check for doing nothing. I could have written a better one who will send in my dream. In fact I have it, although awake. I did it in year 10 in high school and did it with a group of classmates. It was better, I look at it now and the gags are more fun. Steven Moffat YOU ARE NOT A BUM TALENT! What a waste, what a wasted opportunity. It makes me want to cry ...
