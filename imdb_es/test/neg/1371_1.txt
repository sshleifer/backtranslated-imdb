I'm sorry but this guy is not funny. I swear I have heard that 4 year olds come up with better jokes than some of their own. "Dee dee dee," for example, is possibly the worst sentence I've heard. Lacks creativity, and making fun of people with mental disabilities when you have reached the level of having your own program is incredibly stupid by Mencia. <br /> <br /> Although everyone compares this fool To Chappelle, there is no contest. First of all they had very different shows. I think that, in general, Menica's show on average only had 2 short 5-minute skits between their 10-minute slides on God knows what. The Chappelles show was developed more as a sketch comedy, with 2-4 skits that occupied the entire show. Everything Chappelle did was a brief summary of each sketch before and after each one. This is where Mencia fails even more. What would make Mencia think that having a program that consists of the same stand-up comedy that she talks about in her standup specials would be a good idea? Does anyone really want to listen a little to George Lopez, a pioneer years before Mencia, but simply dragged beyond belief to the point where he is dead? The Snowflake opportunity in hell. <br /> <br /> What I mean is that although most people hate this guy for his mischief, I can not resist him for his incompetence. Comedy Central was looking for a minority that could qualify as "controversial" and then let it follow the path of Chappelles. The problem is that this guy made it very clear that he does not want to be Chappelle. So, instead, he drives his shit show like a hot landing gear directly on the ground. Does anyone want to see a weekly standup on the same things every Thursday? I'm sure not. <br /> <br /> I can not express my gratitude to Comedy Central. This idiot show is done. Personally, after watching your standup, I do not know how you got your own program in the first place. There are many more comics that they deserve, like Jim Gafigan, Zach Galifinakis, etc ... In fact, anyone is better than this fool.
