If it were not for Colin Firth, the movie would be ready for the dustbin! So foreseeable, so stupid and so badly acted! Only Colin Firth, as always, shines through this mess as a single light at the end of the tunnel !! <br /> <br /> The worst was Jennifer Rubin's performance, for sure! Maybe it was because of this script (did they really write one or just invented "on the road"?). <br /> <br /> To shorten a story that is too long: <br /> <br /> It's a must-see just for Colin Firth Fanatics (like me), as it is incredibly sexy and has a good performance (fight with force against this "mentally challenged" script). These minutes of Colin-Screen-Time make up a large part of this film. <br /> <br /> However, do not spend a lot of money on it. Try to see it or get it as cheap as possible (an auction or something) and then stick to the scenes of Colin Firth. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie can be dangerous to anyone's mental health.
