I had high hopes for this production, being one of my favorite works. <br /> <br /> In fact, many of them are reasonable: Helen Baxendale is not a bad Lady Macbeth, but lacks the ability of the original character. infused with. Many of the minor characters do it well, and the Scottish configuration is excellent. <br /> <br /> The big disappointment to me is Jason Connery in the title role: he seems to be reading his lines on a card with the wrong name. Glasses - surely for the first time, too. He can do much better. Any production compared to the sublime Ian McKellen (Macbeth, 1979), who in my opinion gave the performance of the gold standard, will have difficulty to be appreciated, but I actually fell asleep and had to rewind this before I could get over it . a great signal. <br /> <br /> Honestly, one to avoid.
