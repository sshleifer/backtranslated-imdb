I do not understand the many good reviews, here. The photography and the landscape seemed beautiful to me, and the two main actors are attractive, but there is little else here to recommend this film. The most annoying are the false Southern accents and the badly written dialogue. These do not seem like real people to me. Although it is refreshing to show men who explore various forms of sexuality without the usual labeling and stereotyped character traits, most of the story has no motivation or logic. The only thing that makes much sense is the responsibility that Griffith feels towards his mentally ill aunt, exaggerated by Karen Black. Lee is an interesting character who would have been more convincing if the dialogue that made him speak was more natural and his motivations clearer. Yes, I understand that he is a vagabond, but his actions as the film come to a hasty conclusion do not make any sense at all. It is worth seeing this movie, mainly because it has a pleasant atmosphere, but it is slow and deeply flawed. A serious rewrite and a better edition could have saved it, since the premise and the outline of the story are promising.
