I am a big fan of Amy Adams and I have been for many years. I'm also a big fan of musicals. That said, this is not a good movie at any level. It's pretty boring and the acting in general is very poor. Amy Adams is uncomfortable to see acting with Scott G. Anderson because she is in another league when it comes to acting. All the performances come out as very amateur. The musical performances are nice, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Scott G. Anderson is just a bad actor! I assumed that they put him in this movie because he has a great voice, but it's not like that. He has an average voice and sings in code, but that's it. <br /> <br /> I guess I can see why Amy Adams made this movie with the singing element, I wish I had not. I could rant about other poor elements of this movie, but I'll leave it at that.
