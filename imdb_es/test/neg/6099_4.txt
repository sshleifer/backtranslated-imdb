The Three Stooges are possibly the best comedy team in the history of cinema. For that reason alone, they deserved a much better finish at Columbia than they did with this short film. <br /> <br /> "Sappy Bullfighters" is not good. Of course, this is not all Joe Besser's fault. Personally, I think some of his shorts are funny enough, simply because of the deviation from the usual Stooges fanfare they contain, and the fact that Larry is sometimes shown more. However, this short simply does not work. And the fact that it is known that it is the last short film that was shown, well, adds to the general disgust. <br /> <br /> This movie simply summarizes how the short subjects were in their last sigh of death during this time. And how little effort he put into making them. This short is so neglected. It's a simple reshaping of a short Curly, "What is the Matador?", Filmed years before. As if this fact were not bad enough, the study actually included images of Moe and Larry from the original (which was filmed almost 20 years ago). Are these things not obvious? Laughter or sad? You are the judge. <br /> <br /> Another part of this short that makes him miserable is the fact that it's basically a showcase for Joe Besser, and shows that all he is (at least in this movie) is a Curly-wanna -be-gone-completely-wrong! Moe and Larry have little to do in this short. As a Larry fan, I must also say that I feel it is a bit embarrassing that Besser uses the joke that Larry originally popularized in the short "Ants In The Pantry." To see Besser say "I can not see, I can not see". and that Larry says that the simple "Why can not you see?", while Besser says "I have my eyes closed", it is wrong at all levels. <br /> <br /> The two brave soldiers who got stuck During all those years, Howard and Fine have very little to do in this short film. There are almost no funny bits with them. The only thing that qualifies is Larry hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, trying to be "Pepe", his dog. <br /> <br /> One can not blame the dynamic duo. Larry and Moe give everything. No matter how ridiculous things may be (and I'm sure they had their opinions at this point in their careers), Howard and Fine never gave anything less than the best. His efforts do not pale from 1934 to 1959. <br /> <br /> I often enjoy many shorts that some will consider horrible. I am in favor of his more "experimental", unusual shorts. At least those contain new ideas. However, this summary, I think everyone can agree, it's just not good. <br /> <br /> Thank God, the television discovered the boys after the closure of the shorts department. If they had been forced to leave this way, well, that would have been a serious injustice for all the years that they invested in making the audience laugh.
