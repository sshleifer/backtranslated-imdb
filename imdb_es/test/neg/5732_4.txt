Sometimes, intentionally countryside, other times involuntarily stupid (as in the opening scene, where a woman is "informed" that she has been raped and that her family has been murdered, just for the sake of the exhibition), this film does not It is not at all funny enough nor competent enough (like a direct adventure story) to be really nice. I'll leave them to decide what the highlight may be, but the lowest point is probably the fight with a silly metallic dragon. Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for Sonja, with her face fresh and her body firm and slightly muscled (and I think her dark red hair fits perfectly), but Schwarzenegger offers one of his few colorless performances as Calidor.
