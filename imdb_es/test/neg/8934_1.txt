This movie is too stupid for words. Even if you consider it a parody in the making of films, if you consider it a complete camp, even when you are wasting your time watching it, because you have seen it hundreds of times before. But maybe you're a big fan of the girl voices that scream loudly, you still love Barbie and Ken and you can stand this background noise typical of the electric guitar of the 80s ... Well, you'll have the chance.
