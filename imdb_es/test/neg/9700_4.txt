While the new Pride & Prejudice movie is beautiful to watch, and the soundtrack is beautiful, we're not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. For some reason, the film dates back to the early 1790s, instead of the Regency period where the novel develops, as scholars have shown. The Bennets estate in Longbourn is chained and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. However, the Bennets in the novel are gentry; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor the manure farm, and the chicken droppings are contiguous to the house. The scenes are readjusted from the novel, and so that we do not forget, Jane Austen placed scenes in certain places for a reason. For example, the film places the big scene of Darcy's proposal outside in a storm in front of a neoclassical temple, instead of inside the parish house of Collins: Why did Jane Austen put him in the parsonage? Because while Lizzy and Darcy talk honestly with each other in this scene, the Collins have never shared an honest word. Why the rain and the external proposal? It seems that Jane Eyre meets Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks through a windy field to stand on a cliff and see the panorama, one waits for her to cry, "Heathcliffe" at any moment! Austen has been Bronteized! Judy Dench is a BIG actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. Little Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor: but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, suggesting that his terrible dance with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another of my favorites from MI-5 at A & E; in P & P, however, is more the young Heathcliffe, who never smiles, although Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles a lot at Lizzy, and realizes when she sees his wonderful smiling portrait in Pemberley, a portrait that in this film is by some reason replaced by a sculpted marble bust. And much of Austen's dialogue has been changed to modern speech. Mr. Bingley has become a clown who wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and listen to, it deviates so much from Jane Austen's novel that any student who saw it, thinking it could replace reading by reading, would fail!
