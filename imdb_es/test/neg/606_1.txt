There is not a single character in this comedy with redeeming qualities. All of them are egocentric, hateful or two-dimensional. My husband looks at him saying that nothing else is on, but I would prefer not to see anything. <br /> <br /> The only situation comedy I can think of that was worse was Yes, dear. At least that did not have 9 seasons. <br /> <br /> Being overweight is not a comedic genius, and Kevin James does not have the talent of John Goodman, Jackie Gleason or John Belushi. Leah Remini may have talent, but if so, she is wasted on the cunning wife. Jerry Stiller is convincing as an annoying old man. Maybe there's a reason for that. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect example of why they make fun of situation comedies.
