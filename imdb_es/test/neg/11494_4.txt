I just finished reading the Forsyth novel 'Icon'. I thought it was one of the deepest, most detailed and flashy books I've ever read, definitely among my top 10. I purchased a DVD version of the book starring Mr. Swayze. Well, first let me point out that it would not have been possible to adapt a decent adaptation of the novel to the 2.5 hour film time, so I understand that the reason for the teams is to rely on the book version and differ. However, when I say "different", what I really should say is "take the characters from the book, add some, leave some, remove the plot from the book, add a new modern plot, add the name of Frederick Forsyth somewhere" . I'm not saying that this is a bad image, much less, some of the effects were first class and the performance was not so bad. History sucked and did not depend on logic or reality. Forsyth's novel was so good and real and altered the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them. This could have been much more if he had taken his time and turned it into a 10-part series. If you have not read the book, wait for a decent television movie with a good acting cast. If you have read the book, try to forget it when you see it.
