I have not seen this movie in years, the last time I did I was really drunk after 5 pints of tenant at my local Witherspoon's, but even then I thought it was pretty horrible. This movie is pretty terrible compared to the other creatures movies, the first two were pretty good, 3 was pretty horrible but miles much better than this. The story takes place 53 years after 3 Critter, where Charlie, the bounty hunter of the previous films, is floating in a capsule in outer space by a team of some kind of space miner, people and people on board. Once aboard, the last critter eggs left in the galaxy that Charlie has brought from Earth are opened and then we have creatures aboard the spacecraft, giving us an obvious scam of "Alien" and many terrible effects and much more . have this movie in a few words The only good thing is that when we return to introduce ourselves to UG (or at least that leads us to believe) he is now a villain and wants to preserve the bugs instead of destroying them.
