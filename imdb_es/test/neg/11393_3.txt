This film was disturbing, not because of the theme but because of the way it was handled. The extremely fat mother (Angela) did not even appear on the cover of the video case when most of the rest of the cast did. This is not fair but it is a statement in itself. I also realize that his picture does not appear in IMDb (perhaps his own choice) and it seems that this is his only film. The language in this movie was raw beyond necessity. I saw him with my 10-year-old son because he was rated PG in Canada and the language that came out of their mouths was disgraceful and disgusting. I never appreciated Shirley Maclain as many others seem. <br /> <br /> LOVE Kathy Bates and always will. The part of Sinese was annoying. <br /> <br /> Little boy Alex is a great little actor. I'll have to see what else he's been doing lately ...
