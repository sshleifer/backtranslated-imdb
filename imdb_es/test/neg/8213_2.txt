The buyer be careful. The launch of Alpha Video uses an impression that defies description. The film was filmed in color, but you would not know it for the first 25 minutes or so. The print that is used is so discolored and decrepit that it looks almost sepia. After 30 minutes, some color seeps back into the print, but from there to the conclusion, the color comes and goes. Keep in mind, even at its best the color is pale and washed. It seems that the print was recorded on a television that did not have the best reception. Added to this parody is the most laborious delivery lines I can remember. Even the voice over the narrative is inducing stupor. Each line is delivered in this irritating and laborious behavior. I found myself wishing they would hurry and let the words come out. For this reason I could not wait for this movie to end. It's one of those bad movies that are good, but I wish someone would find a half decent impression.
