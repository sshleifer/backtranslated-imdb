Star Trek V definitely wins the dubious distinction of being the weakest movie in the Star Trek series. Despite the good acting efforts of the actors, he suffered a general lack of funds from Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures was not excited about this movie at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the Enterprise team enjoying their extended ground license as a new word to save Earth from the total ecological disaster. Your ground permit is interrupted when a disturbance occurs on Nimbus III, the Planet of Intergalactic Peace. Captain Kirk and the Enterprise arrive at Nimbus III only to have Sycook, Spock's half-brother, kidnap his ship. Sybok brainwashes the crew of the Enterprise and puts him on a suicide mission to meet "God" right after the Great Barrier in the center of our galaxy. Captain Kirk must then find a way to regain control of his ship and defend himself against the Klignon pursuers of the Enterprise. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the movie is the acting and direction. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Laurence Luckinbill and the rest of the cast give good results. William Shatner also does a good job directing this movie. <br /> <br /> However, the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding. First, the part of Sybok was initially offered to Sean Connery, but he refused. Then, Laurence Luckinbill got the part. Second, many of the special effects were severely reduced ... reducing the entertainment potential of the movies. Third, the scene that represents the arrival to the Great Barrier left much to be desired. Finally, the romance between Scotty and Uhura in this movie did not make much sense ... considering that there had never been such a romance before this point in the Star Trek universe and it was never explained how such a romance could suddenly materialize between Star Treks IV and V. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very weak movie. You should probably skip this movie and move on to Star Trek VI. After all, the cast and crew had Star Trek VI rescued in part after their debacle with Star Trek V.
