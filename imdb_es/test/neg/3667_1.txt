<br /> <br /> In Japan and other parts of Europe, the new technology is allowing filmmakers to bypass the closed mainstream Hollywood store and avoid Ed Wood as visible low-budget production values ​​to produce convincing movies. What a pity that in the UK we can find examples like 'Avatar' (name of many video games) in which attempts are made to imitate so many movies and console games loved by teenage girls without girlfriend, which are cheap photocopies of clichés abound like kangaroos fed testosterone. Take a look at the synopsis: <br /> <br /> "Located in the futuristic London, 2024, tells the story of a Virtual Reality Virus Exterminators Team confronting the latest Internet virus". <br /> <br /> Go back and read that quote again, avoid laughter, and try to find a single original idea in it. This should have seemed a tired and sad concept in 1993, it does not matter in 2003. Ah, but there is more: the 'definitive virus' has already caused the plane crash, it has infected the air traffic control center, etc. It has been developed by a 'child genius' and manifests itself as an imitator of Lara Croft with a slight discount, athletic and with large breast movements, which makes a great line of grunts and cod. Martial arts come directly from the playground: the living product of teenage fantasy. Oh, and she's accompanied by sound effects like 'Predator' to emphasize her remarkable powers. <br /> <br /> Everything has a 'futuristic' vision of amazing originality: the Lloyds building leaked with AfterEffects to look a little green. The budget really shows, that in this day and age should not. In general, a useless pile of cheese, ham and cliché that Roger Corman would have left on the floor of the cutting room in his most embarrassing and desperate moments. It's a pity that an alleged love job delivers nine minutes of wasted celluloid. <br /> <br />
