In the early 1990s, "Step-by-Step" came about as a tedious combination of the ultra-cheesy "Full House" and the classic classic "The Brady Bunch." The differences between "Step-by-Step" and the two programs mentioned above were, of course, better writing, an excellent comic timing of almost all of its actors, and much more fun situations that were not as great as they were extremely popular. predecessors. However, it must be admitted that, even with the big increases in the basic dynamics of the program and all that, it was not exactly spectacular yet, it was not even so memorable in the long line of family programming! It could be said that it was a much better pastime, compared to the "Full House" that induces migraine and that, coincidentally, ran neck and neck with "Step-by-Step" during that period of time in terms of popularity in general. The program, now in syndication obviously, is certainly suitable for the family, but make sure you do not wait much longer to see it.
