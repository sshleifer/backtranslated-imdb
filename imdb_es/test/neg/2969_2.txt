It seems that some of the previous reviewers have seen another movie that I saw tonight ... Actually, this is the reason why I registered in IMDb. Of course Bobbie Phillips can "fight" and that's why I give this movie a 2, but the rest of this movie is pure shit ... The acting is bad, the plot is bad, the camera angles are bad and the effects are bad. Of course the actors are in good physical shape, but they can not act! Sometimes I enjoy watching bad movies for laughter, but this movie had no charm and after watching this movie, I regretted having seen it. Sure, if you'd like to see mediocre fights without anything else, then this movie is for you. If not, get away from this movie! PS: Sorry for the spelling mistakes ... I'm tired as a cause of this movie!
