Hulk Hogan and Zeus are horrible fighters and horrible actors. For some reason, Hogan was popular enough to get a movie contract, I'll never know why. If it was not for Vince McMahon's money, this stupid movie would never have been made. Maybe someday someone will make a good movie about the professional fight. No Holds Barred is not that movie.
