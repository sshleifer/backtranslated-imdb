Why was not voted for the Best Film of 1998? This has to be the best movie of all. It makes something like Citzen Kane look like shit, come on, Citzen Kane was not even colored! I love this movie, it has to be the best movie I've ever put money in. I'm still surprised that he has not been nominated for ANYTHING! <br /> <br /> If 10 is the highest you can give, I give you 20!
