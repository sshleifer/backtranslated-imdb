I like Bam Margera, so I was curious. <br /> <br /> But watching a homemade production with someone else's friends and family, with a decent camera and a kind of sound, is just not a good movie. <br /> <br /> Writing, directing, acting and editing is abysmal at best. But I sat through half of it. And because? <br /> <br /> This film offers perfect examples of what not to do, it is a film student's dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process. Turn it into film school curiculums throughout the articulation! <br /> <br /> So thank you, Bam! Now I know that Jackass is really, because you are not looking to win an Oscar, friend :)
