This movie was so horrible, so boring, so badly written, that it took a lot of work to turn what should have been a sure thing into such a farce. I love Lucille Ball, but she absolutely stunned in this movie. Too old, I could not sing, it sounded like a truck throwing dirt even when I was NOT singing, and the biggest sin of all, SHE WAS NOT FUNNY. AT LEAST A LITTLE. The studio shot itself with this, and for ruining what should have been a fabulous on-screen version of a fabulous stage musical, some other parts of the body also deserve injuries, or maybe they already lacked those parts. That could explain it. But Lucy thought she was right for a part that required CANTAR, well, that's the saddest thing of all. It is very good to know your limitations. Even a legend can not come out of a stench like this and still smell like a rose.
