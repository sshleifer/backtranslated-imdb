the worst movie I've seen, I did not even see it all, I just sent it to Burt's bits and then to the end. It's the only reason to see this !! I have to admit that I own a copy, since I am a HUGE fan of Burt (to laugh) and I needed it for my collection, I would not mind when this movie came out, I had a nightmare of renting since my local store only had 2 copies. Fans of all the stars always beat me there, imagine my disappointment when I sat down and saw this movie! NO QUALITIES OF CHANGE ON THIS MOVIE! !! Absolutely NOTHING THAT I NEVER LIKE THIS MOVIE! This movie became a joke between the worst of my partner and Burt! The worst hour of Rob Lowe The worst hour and half of my life
