Nobody expects Star Trek movies to be a great art, but fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this film had an implausible and implausible plot that simply left me shaking: this is by far the worst of the nine films (so far). Even the chance to see familiar characters interact in another movie can not save this movie, including the fun scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy in Yosemite. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie is not worth it. However, for the true fan who needs to watch all the movies, renting this movie is the only way to see it, even cable channels avoid this movie.
