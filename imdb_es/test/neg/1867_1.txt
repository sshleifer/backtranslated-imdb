All movies that contain "dumb sound effects" must be filmed. If there is one thing that I hate, it should be the use of a "whoop whoop whoo" when someone gets hit in the head. The only movies I've seen to do this are Ghoulies IV and Hobgoblins when they're at the bar, and Pixie is hitting the guy in the red suit with a bottle of beer ... or rather, fanning him with a bottle of beer, because she He never really hits him with that. Yes Ghoulies IV sucks. But I have to wonder, did they mean that they did not move the mouths of the so-called "Ghoulies" when they supposedly spoke? Their faces are almost as static as the masks used in Trolls 2. Hell, I can make a better mask with construction paper, some rubber cement and a little bit of shine. This sucks
