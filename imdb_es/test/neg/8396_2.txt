I entered here right after watching this movie, feeling it was so horrible that at least their reviews could be entertaining. But it seems that all evildoers like it. And so, since I want the work to be done well ... <br /> <br /> From the first moment, the film establishes its contempt for the attention of the audience by showing a totally irreproachable image of an irrelevant bridge by A long time. long time. Then he goes to a slow-motion skating, which is at least a bit great, but then compensates for that spark of emotion by superimposing the most repellent soundtrack song I've heard. A girl was shouting in a French whisper about what sounds like sheets of plywood banging together. Whoever has decided that I needed to be there has never mounted a skateboard, I guarantee it. He seemed to be there to test the limits of the audience's patience. <br /> <br /> From there, the movie is about 50 percent slow motion. Do you know what is worse than a free slow motion shot? A free slow motion shot of * nothing happened. * Here is a man walking on a path. Here is a boy sitting. Here is a boy looking around. Here is a boy looking at another boy. After a while I started watching the film at double speed, lowering it every time people appeared on the screen participating in a real dialogue, which was rare. Once, surprisingly, I slowed down the film to discover what a girl was saying, only to discover that the camera was showing her talking to her, but the sound was another horrible and horrible song and her real voice was not audible. <br /> <br /> This reminds me of a great tip I once heard about writing: if you have nothing to say, do not use sophisticated tricks to pretend that you have it. Go back to work and think of something to say. All these camera tricks, such as slow motion and strange lighting, lenses and strange music, are how the absence of content looks and sounds. Apparently, a lot of people have bought it and they perceive emotional gravity and deep meaning, but I think they are projecting it into a movie that did not do any of the work involved in its creation.
