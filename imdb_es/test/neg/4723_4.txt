Dr. Krellman wants to save his son Julio, who is dying of heart disease. He decides that a heart transplant with an ape will cure his son (no, I'm not kidding). He does the transplant and (somehow) his son goes from being a frail man to a muscular man with a storehouse of pennies that (in a way) looks like a monkey. Naturally, he goes out, kills men, rips women's clothes and wreaks havoc. All this is related to the boring romance of the police. Arturo Mart√≠nez and the wrestler Lucy Ossorio. We also get meaningless female strings that do not add anything to the plot. Everything ends by copying the end of "King Kong"! This is (obviously) a pretty stupid movie. The plot does not make much sense, there is free female nudity (a basic element of any exploitation film) and a VERY graphic gore that seems ridiculously false (except for the open heart transplant). This still has merit. The whole cast takes everything seriously and they are not really as bad as actors. Also the dub in the dialogue was (for a movie like this) well done and interesting with a surprisingly good dubbing. I also saw an excellent DVD printing with strong and bright colors (which helps). We are not talking about a classic here, but about an OK exploitation film.
