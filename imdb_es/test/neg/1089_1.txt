We have given this movie a horrible star, however, it really depends on how you look at it. We are currently watching this on Channel 5 at 3.30 am, and we have not stopped laughing, so maybe we can give it a 10, just for the value of the entertainment. From the beginning, with the 'manic' thoughts that the stalker transmitted comically, we laughed. Is it me or that girl from Knott's Landing looks like one of the characters in the Dark Crystal? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to ruin it for you, however, you should be stupid enough to see it coming, I do not think I'm smart enough to do double bluffs. <br /> <br /> This has to be the worst / best movie we've seen, if we had been playing 'clich√©' drinking game, then we'll be wasted.
