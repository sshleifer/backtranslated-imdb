What was Wes thinking doing this drip? It does not fit well with any of his other jobs, but again seemed to fall in a slight fall after having done an A Nightmare On Elm Street. This can be seen in their follow-ups 1.Invatation to Hell 2.Chiller 3.Hills Have Eyes II 4.Deadly Friend 5.Serpant and the Rainbow 6. Shocker all these films were mediocre, our shit was not up to People Under The stairs that He gained his momentum again and started kicking his butt again. Chiller Itelf does not have any of Craven's regular customers and neither does his suspense. The only good scene in which the old man suffers a heart attack on the stairs after looking for his work.
