There is no doubt that the Kokoda Path represents a truly great event in Australian military history, the valiant defense of Australia against the cruel, barbaric Japanese army. However, this film does not take into account the history of the "Fuzzy Wuzzy's" or the natives of New Guinea. that the Australians used to help them carry out military operations there. The film also does not give a credible account of the Australian soldier and his behavior in this event. It is more like a disinformed contemporary vision than it was. <br /> <br /> Once again, the Australian film industry has not given this important chapter of Australian history the film it deserved. This is the worst of the film with arbitrary cinematography, bad writing and dialogue, without character development and clich√© scenes of war in the jungle. <br /> <br /> It fails to permeate the audience in a meaningful perspective other than that the Japanese Army was ruthless and cruel murderers of a group of poorly equipped and poorly trained Australians fighting in a jungle. <br /> <br /> The film failed like most Australian films to attract an important Australian audience, in fact, they stayed away en masse. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to join the usual parish trash to say it's cool because it's an Australian movie. I say do a good job or just leave it to someone who knows how. This government-funded film is just another failure of Australia's rich and spoiled children. <br /> <br /> I give it zero stars because it is an insult to the descendants of these truly great Australians and their enormous sacrifice. What a shame and disrespect, and I know that this revision will cause more negativity of the Movie Show team and most of the critics, but I have a right to my opinion and that is what the Australians fought for OUR FREEDOM and that includes the freedom of expression and the right to express an opinion.
