Just to save you time and money, I'll tell you that this movie is not worth the phosphorus or the gas it would take to burn it. Do not waste your time. In fact, it would be better if he forgot that he ever thought of seeing it. Seriously, I've seen better B movies in a language I can not understand. Whoever has given permission to do this needs to be sewn. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that with a new script and the director and the right actors could be a great story. Let me break it down; A virgin becomes pregnant with a demon, the baby, while it is inside its belly, wants to feed on people. They try to compensate for the fact that this is possibly the worst movie ever made with a curse and meaningless nudity. In general, it is not worth the dollar that cost me to rent it.
