Seriously, I can not imagine how anyone could find a single flattering thing to say about this movie, much less find it on its own to write the brilliant compliments in this comments section. How many methamphetamines was Bogdonovitch during the filming of this movie? Was he giving a bonus to the actor who spat his lines with the greatest speed and the least inflection or thought? The dialogue is bad, the plot atrocious, even for a comedy of "games of balls", and affirms that the film is a tribute to the comedy of classic films and deals with the most insane thing that I have heard. The cinematography is below the quality and innovation of the one exhibited by the worst movies for television, the performance is horrible (although I have the feeling that the fault of that is directly in the director's lap), and speaking of that, Did I mention that the direction is so random and inscrutable that it defies the definition of the word? All this is terribly without grace (even in the harassed world of the bad-tempered clunkers), sucking your soul, losing two hours of your life that you will never return. Be afraid, very afraid ...
