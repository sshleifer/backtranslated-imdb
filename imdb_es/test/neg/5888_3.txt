I'm at a loss. This whole movie does not make any sense. It was like watching a Soderburg movie for football. The cutting chamber, the rhythm, all copied. I thought that the subject was not too serious to be treated as it was. Yes, we all know southerners like soccer and beauty pageants. Should we be inundated with this as an audience? I looked for Lee and Jay. I expected young talents gathered in the style of Dead Poet's Society or similar to Remember the Titans. The movie discouraged me completely. You did not get the characters. It was driven by character, but for the most part you did not understand anyone's motivations or actions. The only child who is a mom is obsessed with his being a soccer player. Why is he so quiet? What is your deal? Did we really need the scene with him to "prove" his heterosexuality? Why should we care? The film gave us an idea of ​​the lives of these children and offered no benefits to take care of them. It just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> And why show a movie about a team that lost? I know it's real life, but who makes movies about the losers? Give us some reward for these guys who work as hard as they did with all their "conceivable" problems, damn it. We do not have anything. At the end of the movie, we had a little problem in telling us that Mojo won the following year with the 3rd stringer (Lee). Why did not you follow that story? What would we get out of this? The movie guided you, but it did not take you anywhere. I felt something was missing. It felt like a bad genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least those two movies took you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a losing team that lost its star player at the beginning of the movie. The actor who played it was great. You were completely annoyed by him, that was the point, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood, but he could not play, so why make sure we have his problems? <br /> <br /> And the other team in the play-offs ... are we going to believe that those are high school teenagers? These men looked like college students or professional players in their 30s. Who were they trying to cheat? I know the other team looked intimidating, but that was crossing the line a bit. I liked the gritty element of them when negotiating with the black team, but again, how does this fit into the overall theme of the film? Nothing coupled. The characters knew more about each other than us, and that gets weird with me. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but it was displayed. Everything was a disaster. It's not worth a movie ticket or a rental fee.
