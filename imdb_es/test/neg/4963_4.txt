Think of this movie as a service for fans, a wet dream for the admirer of the slasher genre. We start with a bloody prologue that is not related to the rest of the movie. Fast forward nine months and begins the plot of the plot: the virgin Mandy Lane is coveted by all athletes in their school, and is invited to spend a weekend at a ranch with three guys who think they may be lucky, and Two Bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size. So ... you have a group of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night, who do not want to do anything but have sex, consume drugs and drink alcohol. The only other company is a disgusting rancher who may or may not be suffering from the Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm ... potential suspect in the future maybe? <br /> <br /> Then, as you probably have already checked, all the guests of the house end up being massacred in various bloody ways, and for a change, the black man is not the first to die. However, there are some conventions that are still valid, such as the baby with little clothes who is chased by a car in a field. Or the lights go off mysteriously in the night when our 'heroes' unwisely separate to address the problem. Even until the so-called shocking spin at the end, the movie is like an old horror of the 80's updated for the newbies, and in this sense it succeeds. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it also inherits a large part of the problems of the films of that era as well, namely the fine characters such as the paper and the predictability of the entire company. People are cut, shot, mistreated, etc., but because of their innate hatred of the public and the stupidity of putting themselves in these situations, it is difficult to worry because the bodies pile up. Someone is killed, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone, BANG are wholemeal bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe one day we get a script with plausible, intelligent and nice characters that make rational decisions but end up being overcome by a murderous genius. Until then, we have to tolerate adolescents with the I.Q of pond life being eliminated by a disorganized sweatshirt. Oh well .. 4/10
