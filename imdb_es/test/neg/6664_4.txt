Hey, it's not really as good as the other Dragonballs. The villains are actually a scam from other Z villains such as Cell, Frieza and even Majin Buu. With Baby being the clone of Frieza, Super 17 being the clone of Cell, and the Dragons of the Shadow being the clone of Buu. The story is also very bad, since it deals with the reduction of Goku. CONTRACTION!! It's about SHRINKING liking the size of an eight-year-old child to make it work. Let's not forget how weak the characters become. Gohan can no longer become mystical and is even weaker than Pan. (It's sad, I know). Speaking of Pan, she was so cute at the end of Z, now she has lost all that tenderness and has become a tearful and irritating girl whose only purpose in this series is to hinder. Goten does not even have a purpose in the series and Trunks ... well, I do not know what to say about Trunks. GT is just an attempt to milk the popular Dragonball franchise. If you really like Dragonball, then avoid this series. It does not even feel like Dragonball. However, I will be fair, since the end was really good and it is actually quite sad (at least for me) and the thematic songs that end and open are better (Japanese, not American). It could have been better if Toriyama san worked on that.
