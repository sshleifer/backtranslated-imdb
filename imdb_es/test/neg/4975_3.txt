This movie was a boring movie. It was a not moving story that definitely does not make you think about anything other than where all the poignant material that other critics say about the movie is. The 3 main actors are good, and there is some laughter, but once again it becomes other. Movie that you keep watching with the hope that it will improve and simply not. Last night I saw this movie and wished I had not lost our precious time (while the baby is sleeping) watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I plan not to recommend this to my family and friends, as well as, obviously, to anyone who wants to rent it. I was not very impressed with everything related to this movie.
