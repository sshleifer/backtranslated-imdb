This is a bad excuse for a movie. A black cinema made by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First, let's forget about the plot, a truly simple version of a cynical and hard guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde. Yechh So what makes you despise him and love him? Together with a group of other boys, he helps to prevent a child from drowning, since they all swim in a water tower and try to survive while the water is diverted, trapping them. It's not exactly heroic, but suddenly she's in love. It is really painful to see Claude Rains trying to portray a tough cop, who talks hard and noir. A crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool, along with a gruff voice. Most of his energy seems to be trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. I will never understand how he was spoken to take this job. Enjoy it, if you can, for some details of the time, old cars and gas stations, but do not expect a decent cinematic experience. It is wasted 1-1 / 12 hours of my life.
