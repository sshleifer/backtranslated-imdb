This movie is fun if you are the gentleman who was sitting three rows behind me (repeating each punch line, laughing when there were no jokes on the screen and emitting a serious "haaaa" in every scene involving a computer or mobile device ). <br /> <br /> For everyone else, it is a mean and perverse "comedy". The film follows strictly the formula of the later films of "Scary Movie", as well as "Epic Movie" and "Meet the Spartans", although without the avalanche of soulless pop culture references that made the latter two so irritating. However, the fact that intellectuals and peacemakers are produced around the world makes it clear that the film knows its audience: people who envy the intellectual capacity. "Superhero Movie" is particularly unpleasant for Stephen Hawking, presenting him as a sex-hungry drug addict and using his disability as a vehicle for slapstick. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on "Spider-Man" with "Batman Begins" and "X-Men" released just to offer some physical comedy. Much of the movie is slapstick, but not in a stimulating or interesting way. The longest joke is a stingy joke, and from the beginning the writers seem to believe that the fact that the main character is thrown into the conspicuous piles of fake animal poop automatically fuels an otherwise uninspired repetition of the scene of the "Spider-Man" spider bite. Perhaps the only redeeming characteristic of this characteristic is the energy in it, notably absent in other recent parodies. The filmmakers act as if they are doing something new, and the audience can feel the influence in the way the actors bounce on the screen. An extremely abbreviated duration (around one hour and fifteen minutes) and the enthusiasm of the presentation makes "Superhero Movie" more tolerable than horrible.
