This production of four-hour miniseries is approximately two hours longer than necessary, mainly because the filmmakers seemed to have no clear idea of ​​how to adapt a novel to the screen. They seemed not to know what should be maintained and what could be left without danger. The film begins with Sir Walter reading from the book Peerage which is his main consolation in his problems. This presents the family, all of which we can know intimately during the next four hours anyway, but has no other purpose. Similarly, the scenes where the Musgroves lament "poor Richard" have no purpose other than dragging the story down. Part of the real dialogue of Austen is assigned to different characters and part of its narrative is recycled as a dialogue that falls awkwardly from the languages ​​of the characters. There is also a filling dialog, and this is uniformly terrible. The scene in which Charles Hayter bored Henrietta with his concern for obtaining Dr. Shirley's cure was hardly interesting as a narrative in the book; As a scene in this production, it's stupid. The scene in the Cobb, when Louisa falls down and is "left without life", is completely without urgency, and I wondered if the Wentworth line "Is there anyone to help me?" It could have been addressed to the writers, as well as to the other actors. <br /> <br /> This production often looks and feels like a work that has been filmed, rather than a real movie, and this is more evident in acting, which is the opposite of the subtle: the boom lines, exaggerated gestures and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands, feet or faces when they are not talking their lines. Charles Musgrove is standing in his living room, his feet shoulder-width apart, and he seems to be projected onto the balcony (if there was one) when he talks to the other people in the room with him. The face of Louisa Musgrove, when she is not actively laughing or laughing, seems to be at rest confused. Louisa is a dizzy creature, smiling and cheerful, and I did not believe for a moment that Wentworth was interested in her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are a mixed group, but mostly horrible, and Anne Elliot's green tartan dress is possibly the supposedly most horrible era costume ever devised. They give us the dates at the beginning of the show, that is, in the late 1790s or perhaps very early in the 1800s, and yet many of the costumes seem to be Victorian in design, and are therefore 60 years too soon! The hair is so bad that I will not even mention it here. Except say I will not mention it. :-) <br /> <br /> However, this production does some things well. Mrs. Smith receives the importance that corresponds to her, and her story with Mr. Elliot, his dissipation and intrigues, are fully addressed. I was also pleased to see at the end the scenes of "reconciliation" with Anne and Frederick, which are a valuable reward for the reader, but which were overlooked in the 1995 production. <br /> <br /> If you love the book Persuasion, and even vaguely like the 1995 movie, does not waste a moment (or a dime) on this production; You will find it very lacking.
