This movie is TERRIBLE! He proposes to dislike you and make you laugh, but he fails horribly. Obviously, the director does not have the feeling of having a slap in the comedy, and the actors do not look like anything he's ever seen, lacking both talent and talent for comedy. Even his attempt to languish in English is really sad, and in fact the peculiar quirky Swedish accent, in which incoherent dialogue is spoken, is probably the most comical and enjoyable thing about this movie. Even the gore is horrible and unconvincing. If you fancy a bloody comedy, I suggest you go to the classic meals, such as the dead dead series or even brain dead if necessary. We all enjoy a good laugh, but this is ridiculous!
