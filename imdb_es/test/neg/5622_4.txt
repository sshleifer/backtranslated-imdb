Another movie to punish us for the crime of enjoying "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> If you like to see people who die with machine-gun fire for an hour and a half, this probably fits what we have. Fans of the debut episode of "Aeon Flux", in which the title character literally kills thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers alone, will really do it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's not exactly a smart movie. In fact, all that is is an excuse for a group of young people to act rudely and shoot people. Sometimes a whole scene happens, and the only thing that happens is that you guessed it. someone is shot. Or, to spice things up, twenty people are shot. First, they are sitting there, the next minute, they are dead. Yahoo! <br /> <br /> Plot in the rough: a young American girl goes to Paris (an American in Paris, understand it?), Hires a prostitute (the ethereal Julie Delpy), gets in touch with some old French friends, One of them has AIDS, they plan and try a bank robbery. Of course, the cinematographic convention establishes that bank robberies are not made in the cinema without any problem, and this coupling takes about three quarters of the execution time (it's like "Dog Day Afternoon" without the wit, the patience or the humanity of Sidney Lumet). While at the bank, things go wrong (surprise!), And the Parisian with AIDS, goes crazy with his Uzi several times. There are no spoilers here, but it is enough to say that you are at such an emotional distance from these characters that you probably do not care who lives and who dies at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Some have called it with style. Maybe it is, but it's someone else's style, it's a movie that has already been made, and "Killing Zoe" is stuck in a convention. Nowhere in the course of the film, the director (Roger Avary, co-winner of the Oscar script of "Pulp Fiction") does something really original, elegant, extravagant or outrageous. Unless you consider the fact that no film that has taken place inside a bank has had such a high count of bodies, there is nothing else to differentiate it from the crowd.
