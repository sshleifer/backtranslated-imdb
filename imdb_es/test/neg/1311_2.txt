Current? Certainly. Entertainment? Probably, but only by eliminating any fragment of the common sense of the viewer. Reality? Only to the extent that it was done on this planet. <br /> <br /> How it was supposed that thousands of people would have died as a result of a wall of water of 5 meters in a city full of buildings in abundance. 25 meters of height exceeds me enough. Carlyle's line to the effect of "How could someone survive that?" When the shot shows forests of buildings with several floors above the water is completely ridiculous. Also, if someone commits to an area (under water) where an air cylinder is not enough (that is, they will die), why not use the simple resource of taking more than one cylinder? Clearly, the writer thinks that people in stressful situations can not count beyond one (a cylinder, a floor). <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing this gut, I would be more informed and entertained by pulling the DVD and reading. The price information on the cellophane outer wrapper. <br /> <br /> Sorry, truly regrettable, and a terrible waste of on-screen talent. <br /> <br /> Regarding the sexist propaganda that suggests that only women can see through the problems to illuminate the solutions to be effected by the expendable men: even more PC 'tosh'. No wonder that First Blood, Delta Force, Navy Seals and other similar films of little or no merit always have followers, while this squat with a clear political motivation is sold.
