I do not understand why people are praising this movie. I did not like at all. I see it with several people. Neither of them cared for him either. First of all. It is clear that another low-budget study is trying to capitalize on a well-known story. The current filming looks like a live TV interview. The makeup is bad. When you watch the movie along with the DVD extras. You will see that there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it. There is no talent. There are facts that appear in the book. The facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and the dramas that are added to it. I have read several books and have seen several shows in this story. What I have always grasped of all the material on this is that it was a serious horror story. I really wish that someone could really make a good movie in this case. It has always fascinated me. The bad acting really ruined the story. The situation of young children really prevented it even more. When you see this movie The little boy and his problem is what you and your friends will remember and laugh at. It did not make any sense why his brothers laughed at what had happened to him. It was as if the witch was supposed to be so threatening, but it was okay to throw a little brother. It's an incredible story with him and his little problem. I still can not stop saying to the girl that she says: "Mom said that tobacco will rot your teeth". Frank Fox's statement and facial expression is so bad. The scene in the courtyard where he gets food is pretty stupid. The sound of parts of him seems to be from the movie psycho. In addition, the girl hovering over the bed and her small "bladder control problem" are from The Exorcist. This film lacks the talent of creativity. We put the movie for a couple of minutes and knew immediately that it was a pain. I also noticed that there were flaws in the quality of the film. Some parts looked like what a person could shoot on a home video camera. I noticed that many of the people in the credits had many multiple jobs. This is probably how this movie was put. Someone said that I like this story. I will get all my friends and I will make a movie with a video camera and a computer. It does not matter if we do not know how to act. As long as we have it in the movie and let's say it's good. We gather the family and prepare the food. Then he sat down and watched this failed attempt to make a movie.
