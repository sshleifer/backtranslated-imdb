This experimental silent film, made in Switzerland by an independent British film company, is best remembered as Paul Robeson's first film. It's very artistic, with shots that often seem meaningless to the story, which is hard to understand anyway due to the lack of enough intertitles. From what I've collected, Robeson's wife, Adah, is in an interracial love relationship with a white man named Thorne. It does not bother the owner of the bar / hotel where Thorne lives (and she seems to be having a lesbian relationship with a waitress), but an old woman expresses the point of view of the city in an intertitle: "If I had my way, we would not allow the blacks here. " Thorne is also called "lover of blacks" by someone at the bar. Adah tries a reconciliation with Pete (Robeson), but finally abandons him. Thorne's wife, Astrid, comes out of the deep end, wields a knife, cuts Thorne's arm and cheek and, somehow, dies. Thorne must have been charged with murder because we found out he was acquitted. As for Pete, he receives a letter from the mayor telling him that it is better for everyone to leave the city. So the film is more about racism than anything else, but on a rising note, the owner tells Pete, "The sad thing is they think they're right, that's the way we are." The meaning of the title is a mystery. It may refer to Adah being fair-skinned (a black on the limit) or to the behavior of the limit of the main characters.
