Director Michael Ritchie and actor Robert Redford's second documentary-style drama, 'The Candidate', is a political satire that still looks fresh and pertinent today. So it's a pity that 'Downhill Racer', done a little before, seems so outdated. The music is ugly, and perhaps innovative ski sequences are now standard in the television coverage of this sport. The world of skiing seems strangely amateur (probably accurately, given the time when the film was made, but it is difficult to relate to the professional world of today), and the theme of Americans in Europe also seems to be more extensive in an era in which the trips are increasingly easy. Perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plot, centered on the arrogant but enigmatic hero; unfortunately, it is a sad performance by Redford, who offers us little information about his concerns or motivations. And a movie directed by a character without much of a character is never a good bet. I expected a lot, but unfortunately this is a boring movie.
