I have been reading comments on IMDb for some time. An average of 8.3 for this movie just makes me nervous. I do not intend to remove one of those "I registered in an account to be able to publish in this movie" bits ... but I just did it. The only issue that you will come out of this movie is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed. <br /> <br /> Now, I realize that a lot of people love this movie; However, it is crap. What REALLY affects me is the fact that the director expects you to have sympathy for the "villain" in the movie. If you have sex with your sister, you should probably be an outcast from society. Only my personal feelings, I suppose. However, I sat through 2 hours of this * explosive * waiting for some really deep reasoning behind Dae-Soo's imprisonment. <br /> <br /> I tend to like many foreign films, but this is my first encounter with a Korean Flick and he has put them at the end of my book. Oh ... I feel better after a little ventilation.
