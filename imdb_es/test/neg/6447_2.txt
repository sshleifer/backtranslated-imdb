I rated this better than horrible because I liked watching Buffy's Jonathon on something again, even if it was the same role. <br /> <br /> First, the concept is pretty nice for short, but not an entire movie. The writing was forced and artificial. I have the feeling that the film suffered more during the editing. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Amanda Bynes always seems that her eyes are crossed, even when she is not trying to do it. She is not funny She always plays a maladjusted girl who triumphs by being herself: ironic, considering that Amanda always seems to be a caricature. I would really like to see her in something serious. I really want to give her a chance, but she's always chosen in these trivial roles where she moves and grimaces and somehow that's a good thing? <br /> <br /> Finally, everything "I'm a Dork" The segment was ripped from Revenge of the Nerds. There was nothing in this movie that was unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Shame, embarrassment, shame.
