The first time I saw this was when I was with a date, and she thought it was an amazing movie. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> The second time I saw this was on television last night. It still stinks. <br /> <br /> Like a love story, this sucks. Like having Julia represent a street prostitute, this is repulsive. For me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. She did not have a hard shell for her. She was not tortured, anguished, enraged, hungry or anything else. His character "HOOKER" had many flaws, as if he were comparing a cubic zircon with a diamond. The two simply do not fit, no matter how they look. <br /> <br /> The ONLY cast that I felt was worth seeing was the 2 malicious vendors, who were excellently chosen. They did such a good job that I hated them for the few seconds they were on screen. They had real definition, for minor roles. Well, then the movie was not all rubbish ... the two ignorant vendors saved the movie. <br /> <br /> Apart from those two saleswomen, the rest of the cast ... including the big names was just shit. Or, they were all addicted to kissing or they had absolutely no reason to fill a dialogue in the film, apart from congratulating Julia Roberts or kissing Richard Gere's butt. <br /> <br /> This was a movie about how when you walk in high heels and a tight skirt in Beverly Hills, people look at you with gusto and those who work in hotels are left speechless as if they had been hit in the face with a baseball bat. <br /> <br /> Although in reality, the women who dress up to the nines in Beverly Hills are prostitutes and prostitutes to a higher degree, but since they do not wear the flashy Madonna jewelry or patent leather boots, they may despise to the others who do it. <br /> <br /> The cast of the hotel was terribly sad to watch, and anyone who had a real character had less than a minute of screen time. <br /> <br /> This is an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas and even to prostitutes who face rich clients on a daily basis with the hope that their lives will be perfect. <br /> <br /> The story is about Julie Roberts is PIMPED (yes PIMPED) by a billionaire in a business suit and a limousine. <br /> <br /> It is still your property, you are still told how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. It is more controlling than a street pimp, but the people of Disney / good sight manages to make it easier to swallow. <br /> <br /> If Richard Gere had been a black man with a gold tooth and an AK-47 at his side instead of an aggregate case, this film would deal with how a woman has to fight to escape from the hardness of prostitution. In the same story, the different characters will have a very different perspective. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, change the white man for a black or Asian or Spanish man, change the business of the land for a weapons or narcotics business and the whole concept of romantic comedy is discarded. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, Pretty Woman is still garbage, dressed in ribbons and ribbons. <br /> <br /> I did not do it. I liked it 15 years ago, when I did not understand it and I was guided by the hype of Hollywood. I hate now that I can see beyond the beautiful decorations that are called "love". <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT a romantic comedy. It's a story about how to control a woman as long as she has the means and income to do so. <br /> <br /> This is an insult for strong women, weak women and women in general, as well as for my television screen. <br /> <br /> I hate it? Yes. Does it stink? Yes Would you recommend it? NO ... well, maybe if I really hated you. <br /> <br /> Will this review be published? We'll see. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's all for now.
