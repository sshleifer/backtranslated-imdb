I admit a secret admiration of the original Love Thy Neighbor television shows, mainly because they show the kind of exuberant brazenness and bad taste, synonymous with so many programs of their time, but I would be lying under my breath (very uncomfortable position) if I pretend that this Large screen spin-off is not an abomination. The initial scenes of vicious vandalism are not only useless but also disconcerting: it is never explained why the film starts with a follow-up image of people who destroy the homes of others, and nothing improves from there. When the film discovers the oldest joke in the book, the horrible dragon of a mother-in-law appears unexpectedly to stay, followed by the revelation that she is developing a weakness for the father of the black neighbor, moving her. Intolerant son to ever greater depths of ignorant and unjust anger, most of the most demanding viewers will have gone off. Take it as a warning, unless you're interested in lowskate spin-offs with terrible acting, static direction and the general comic style of a burning orphanage.
