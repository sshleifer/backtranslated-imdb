Despite a totally misleading advertising campaign, this film turns out to be an irritating cliché, a sub-pair of haunted houses with a totally implausible ending. Track n. ° 1 for all who consider seeing this turkey: Sam Raimi did not direct it. Even though the commercials for the film show their participation, it is actually one of the four producers. It's a pity that someone as talented as Raimi has allowed his name to be used along with such a poor movie. I do not think I've ever run something like this; that task was left in the hands of the Pang brothers. <br /> <br /> The script of this film seems to have been improvised among many other "horror" movies, so you will find totally original content in "The Messengers". "What we get is a scene here and there that was taken directly from" Pulse ", a couple that could have come from" The Birds ", one or two from" The Others ", etc. Almost all the scenes, almost all the lines of dialogue, it is one that has been raised from any number of other films.All this makes for a film so predictable that almost anyone will be able to discover the "surprise ending" long before it arrives. <br /> <br /> Just here would be a good time to point out that advertising The campaign, centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this movie.In fact, everyone can see the ghosts. and the characters of the mother certainly see them, even very early in the film, I'm sure that whoever was in charge of marketing created this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have some box office appeal, which is otherwise total Absentminded mind Now you know, so do not be fooled! Perhaps what this film lacks most is something similar to the chemistry between the actors. It just is not there. All interactions are uncomfortably forced. Along with the hackneyed story and the ridiculous holes in the plot (what is a man doing who murdered his entire family still hanging around the small town where the murder happened, anyway? Nobody thought about arresting him?) It all adds up to a deeply unsatisfying ghost movie that only manages to surprise anyone over ten years old with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes and anything other than a figure with sheets jumping out of a closet and shouting "Boo ! " All we get on our own this time is another badly made movie about spirits that try to warn people who are walking away from a house. If there is any message that "The Messengers" issues, it is "Do not waste your time in this movie".
