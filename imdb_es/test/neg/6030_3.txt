I do not think this movie had the effect on my intention: seeing the American soldiers shooting wounded soldiers from the other side, and beating the wounded prisoners in their wounds to torture them and making them speak, encouraged me to the other side. It certainly made the United States forces look something like "the good guys". Was this supposed to be acceptable?
