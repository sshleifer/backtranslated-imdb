Have you ever had one of those sneezes that seems to accumulate forever? Surprise and convulse and take the closest paper product in preparation for the best handkerchief in the world ... and then it becomes inflamed. "Frankenhooker" was the cinematic equivalent of that lost sneeze. Now, I really like B movies, and I always look the other way when a mics boom appears on the screen or when an actor speaks his phrases with all the enthusiasm of Gerald Ford, but this really disappointed me. The cover of the video, for example, IS the label line of the entire film. Using parts of the murdered New York prostitutes, Dr. Franken reconstructs his deceased fianc√©e, only to be left in Manhattan crazy as a kind of superprostitute with a bad attitude. After an hour and a half of accumulation, these ten pretty fun minutes seemed a little anti-climatic.
