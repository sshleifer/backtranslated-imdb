What were you thinking when they made this film truly TERRIBLE? <br /> <br /> Arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the 20th century, had a fascinating and dramatic life. What did anyone have to make this film, to explain their unique artistic vision, as a result of an (imaginary) adventure with a grotesque and charismatic furry monster (played by Downey)? , Arbus broke a traditional marriage and the role of women to express themselves. In this film, Arbus is an ultra-sad Nicole Kidman whose inspiration is attributed to the devotion "Beauty and the Beast" to an interesting man. <br /> <br /> For this reinvention, the film is truly shameful. Regardless of that, it is also simply silly and boring.
