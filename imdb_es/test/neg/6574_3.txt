I suppose that after Leonard Nimoy had succeeded in directing "The Search for Spock" and "The Journey Home," William Shatner thought he could also direct. Although he is a competent actor, here he shows that he is not a good director. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie is solid evidence to support the Trekkies arguments that William Shatner is an arrogant egotist. Although despite the fact that his character, Captain James Kirk, was always the most important role in the original "Star Trek", in this film it seems that he is the heart of the film, the other two most important characters, Captain Spock and Dr. Leonard. McCoy, they're just there to support him, and the other characters are just there to add comic relief. <br /> <br /> The plot is that an eminent emotional Vulcan named Sybok is confused with people and releasing the bottled pain inside them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever. Grateful, they join him in his quest to make the whole world free of pain and, therefore, at peace. Sybok and his followers command the building in which a peace conference takes place between a human, Klingon and Romulan diplomat. This attracts the company that is still being built there, since none of the other Starfleet ships have "experienced commanders" (honestly, with the way Starfleet is run, the Klingons and Romulans should have conquered them. years ago). Sybok adds the crew of the Enterprise, except for Spock (revealed to be secret brothers with Sybok), McCoy and Kirk. Sybok orders the Company to take off to the "center of the universe" to meet "God", to whom apparently all races have a word. However, it turns out that this is only a minor entity when it demands the use of the Company and Kirk asks, "what does God need with a spaceship?" The entity is destroyed, but not before Sybok realizes that he has been lied to for years, sacrifices his life and earns Spock's respect in death after the Company's photon torpedoes destroy the entity and , in an inexplicable way, also to Sybok. <br /> <br /> OK Science fiction movies are not known for realism, but at some point rationality must be imposed. Why do people follow Sybok just to release his pain? Why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? I have certainly led a life free of trauma. Why does not Kirk test his crew for riot and betrayal after joining Sybok? What was the point of Sybok's sacrifice when the torpedoes were going to kill the entity anyway? <br /> <br /> Then the plot is weak. Another problem is that Sybok, although played well by Lawrence Luckinbill, is poorly represented. Just because he is an emotional Vulcan does not mean he should act exactly like a religious human fanatic. Shatner (who was co-writer and director) could have developed at least a suitable dialogue for an emotional Vulcan. I suppose he feels that any emotional being speaks like us. Wow, I guess that means the Klingons should say "it's not" and "not" more often than "it's not" and "not." And the Cardassians should not prolong their prayers because they like to talk (yes, I know it's sad that I know). Please ... every ST race uses a unique dialogue. Why is Sybok the exception? <br /> <br /> The only thing you do not have to complain about is acting. I've always known that "Star Trek" has great actors, and this movie is no exception. Cudos also addresses Leonard Nimoy, since it had to be difficult to play the dispassionate Spock in his old age. <br /> <br /> Some other things that I did not like: <br /> <br /> Shatner and The late DeForrest Kelly shows twice what bad singers are by singing "Row, Row, Row your Boat" in this movie. I suppose Shatner wished to silence his detractors of his ability to sing. What he did was to demonstrate his point of view. <br /> <br /> Uhura dances with a fan without using anything other than tree bark to lure some men into an explosive trap. After all, the dreams of all of us, men, are full of images of plump middle-aged women dancing naked. <br /> <br /> The comedy is fine, as long as it does not affect the nature of "Star Trek". Too much, but when Scotty runs into an object on the Enterprise and KOs himself, it's a bit of an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Kirk is the only member of the crew who can reject Sybok's offer to release his inner pain and see through the deceitfulness of the impostor of God. Can not Spock handle any of these? Perhaps these scenes were characters of Shatner to his character, as many suspect. <br /> <br /> The concept of an entity posing as God had been used in "Star Trek" before this movie more than once. Be creative, Shatner. <br /> <br /> Speaking of lack of creativity, I was not interested purely in the music of "Star Trek: the new generation". <br /> <br /> Everything in Everything, pretty bad movie "Trek". If you are a Trekkie, look at it once because it is "Star Trek". Otherwise, look at "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan." It's much better
