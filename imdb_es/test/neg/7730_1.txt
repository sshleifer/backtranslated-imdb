This movie is up there, with The Oscar and Moment by Moment, as one of the unwitting and funny movies of all time. <br /> <br /> It's worth renting for a tremendously great laugh. <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely absurd. Nothing in life would happen this way. It is so amazing. the way James Woods tries and crushes the heavy hitters, who give this supposed two-bit scammer a job 3000 miles away in Los Angeles, what a joke <br /> <br /> I love the old bug VW to indicate how low are I received in life due to all the 'tootski's'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sean Young is as incredibly bad as the "I'll love you forever, no matter what, wife" you'll see sometime. It was not so funny that you vomited at the sweet sweetness that Young tries to project herself. And as bad as you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> James Wood comments throughout the film and is extremely good. Funny and very lightly, he just can not believe it, Woods looks like a parody of a cocaine demon on Saturday Night Live. But seeing Woods in 'ludes' is worth the rental price. <br /> <br /> I love it when Woods tells the guy he wants to give him more 'ludes' that he does not do those things, just before that, Woods only made three giant lines of coca. <br /> <br /> This is something very funny. <br /> <br /> The ending is very funny, but it's on par with the rest of the movie.
