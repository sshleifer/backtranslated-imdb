Stay Alive has a story very similar to some Asian horror movies that include technology in the story. Some of these Asian horror movies are One Missed Call, Ringu and Pulse. Therefore, the idea of ​​Stay Alive is very cliché and obvious, but the filmmakers are behind it. I did not know how to put something new or interesting to the clichés in Stay Alive. This movie is totally crap. But it's a very big shit. All elements of Stay Alive belong to the worst kind of "horror" movies: shallow. characters, no suspense, stupid '' horror '' that makes laughter and violence mild. It is easy to notice that the "director" is incapable of creating something original or disturbing. I do not want to waste any more time writing about this pathetic movie. I just give you one piece of advice: do not watch this movie. I really hated it.
