This movie is stupid. There is no way to avoid it. But so is the fool and the fool. Mind you, Dumb and Dumber is much more fun than this. However, on the one hand I love watching stupid movies (Tail Sting) and laughing with a group of good friends because of how bad it is. Call me insensitive, but watch this movie and you will find that the only way to laugh is if you laugh at her instead of her.
