This is the worst movie in the world. the only reason I gave him a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a "is this really?" A kind of way It was so cheap and low budget ... they should not have bothered. there was nudity and violence for the simple fact of having nakedness and violence, and the effects were so bad that I would not believe it (think ketchup like blood and cabbages for severed heads). Do not rent this!
