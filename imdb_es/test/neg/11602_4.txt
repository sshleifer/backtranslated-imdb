This was Hitchcock's third feature in Hollywood, and it seems that it has not yet been established in a pattern of consistency, going from the faithful adaptation of the classic novel in Rebecca to the espionage thriller in foreign Correspondent, and now this romantic comedy in the "screw ball" mold pictures from the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, had already adapted to something consistent, so much so that he could not (or at least he did not want to) deviate from him. It was not prudent for him to come out of his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate. In Rebecca it was really great to see Hitchcock restrained by his producer and the source text, forced to turn his technique into a heavy Gothic drama, but for Mr. and Mrs. Smith there is a big discrepancy between form and content. In other words, Hitchcock was not Ernst Lubitsch. <br /> <br /> First, let's look at the romantic angle. The best love scenes in Hitchcock's films were wild, passionate and slightly dangerous. The "ever in love with someone you should not have done?" situation, and he was great at representing that. This is something that makes a much older film, Rich and Strange, one of the few non-thrillers of Hitchcock that really works. However, the coupling is not so good when it comes to a softer and more familiar love story. It requires a gentle and tender touch and Hitch does not. <br /> <br /> Second, take the comedy. Of course, Hitchcock movies could be fun? The lady disappears is probably the best example? But only when the jokes spread throughout the story. The suspense master is simply not enough as a comedy director to create a movie that has funny bones. Cut scenes as you would in a thriller? Do the opposite angles of the people who speak, the first inserted planes of the hands and feet, take them in the point of view? but it does not allow comic timing or focus on gags. For example, the business with the dress of Carole Lombard bursting into view is shown with a couple of close-ups, but these are timed more as if revealing a crucial point of the plot, and have no comic impact. From time to time, does Hitchcock's style coincide roughly with comedy? for example, the disposition of the characters in the club scene, where Robert Montgomery tries to make it look like he is with the attractive and sophisticated woman at the next table. but those moments are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Even the cast of Mr. and Mrs. Smith are not up to the task. I'm not sure this was the strength of Robert Montgomery, and he's boring here. This was, of course, exactly where the strength of "Queen of Screwball" Carole Lombard was, and yet, while she is acting clearly fine, the scenes are simply not designed to capture comedy performances. Even Jack Carson, who could be very funny when he was really allowed to release her before the camera, fails to animate things. Of course, none of these good comedy actors get help from the script, which in the first place is not full of laughter, even if the basic story is a pretty good premise. <br /> <br /> The only complete one - In the comedy that Hitchcock did after this was the problem with Harry, and that worked because he played with his familiar suspense. However, it was only when history could exist independently of humor, when the basic framework was suspense. How is it in The Lady Vanishes or Family Plot? That Hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well.
