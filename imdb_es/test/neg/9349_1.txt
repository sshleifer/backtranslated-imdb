I like the series "Star Wars". I also like a good and cheap science fiction movie from time to time. Hell, I even like Nickel employees and ten cents produced by Roger Corman. <br /> <br /> I do not like "The Ice Pirates", however. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it seems too cheap, you know? For a movie that is supposed to take place in outer space, it feels cramped and locked up as if it were being filmed in the front seat of someone's Mazda. And the special effects, although appropriately cheesy, seem more like nothing like foam rubber painted metallic gray. <br /> <br /> Usually, I do not let those things bother me, especially if the story and the characters are valuable. <br /> <br /> They are not. <br /> <br /> The whole story, about these space pirates who never do anything and who decide to find a planet loaded with ice that they can melt and sell like water (a hot product in the future, I suppose) is almost as original as jokes, which is not a compliment. <br /> <br /> The humor appears at the level of the crotch (like the gelding). machine you'll see from the beginning), and they all seem to have a bad mood. And who told John Matuzak that he was funny? Who did it, ashamed of them. The good old Robert Urich tries, but he is a reliable actor aboard a ship that sinks badly (or starship, in this case). <br /> <br /> I saw it three times and ended up feeling the same way every time: shanghaied. <br /> <br /> There are no stars. Despite the presence of Huston (one year before "Prizzi's Honor") and Carradine (at the end of a career that was once high), these "Pirates" must walk on the board.
