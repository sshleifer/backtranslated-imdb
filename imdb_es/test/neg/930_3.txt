He borrowed scenes from LOTR, Matrix, Star Wars, etc. The humor is so dry, artificial and cheesy, that you can not help laughing from time to time about its inanity and the fact that you are seeing it. Exactly what you would expect from an HK comedy. The average person would enter with an IQ of 100 and would go with less than 80. Stephen Chow is an obvious omission of this movie. The humor would have worked better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this film is not as good as the original Cantonese one. The graphics are poor compared to their Hollywood counterparts. There is an excessive dependence on low quality CG. My biggest complaint is its end. The origin of the white horse is described so clearly in the "Journey to the West" (JW), that this alternative explanation does not work well with the storyline. Despite its many shortcomings, this film has much more entertainment value than the other film starring Nicholas Tse: The Promise.
