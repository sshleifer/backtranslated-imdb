I am really disappointed by this work. It's quiet shallow, it repeats itself, it's mostly not exact and, sometimes, it's about to go wrong. I think it's made for elementary school, especially because it repeats itself over and over and leaves big gaps. A young child could really enjoy it and learn from it, but a better way to make a child appreciate theoretical physics are books like "A Brief History of Time" or "The Tao of Physics." If you are familiar with the subject at a very basic level, you will not get any new information or views from this series. Do not waste your time with that. Good eye candy though.
