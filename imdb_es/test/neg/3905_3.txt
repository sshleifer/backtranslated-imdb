Hypothetical situations abound, the only director Harry Ralston gives us the last post-apocalyptic vision with the dead world, left in the streets, in the stores and in the whole landscape, without means in the middle of a forgotten desert. A single survivor, trying to rekindle his sanity, brings the food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. Alone, he expects more, but with no one around, he is left with white underwear and a passion for a local Indian tribe. until the discovery of a camera that opens new doors and breaks the barriers of human coexistence. Alan, a man from the book, stays on Earth after an unknown disaster. Thinking that you are alone, start living life your way? until, Jeri Ryan, appears (as he would in any dream) out of the forest, disheveled and unhappy to find the final man alive to be ... well ... like Alan. Anyway, they try to coexist, fail, get drunk and, before creating the definitive dystopia, they meet Redneck Raphael (played by the newcomer, Dan Montgomery Jr.). The bonds are broken, confusion is established, a couple becomes a third wheel and the battle between a physically inept nerd and a brainless athlete. Even when no one is left on the planet, it becomes a truth that even the darkest human nature will emerge. <br /> <br /> Using a variable film technique, Ralston gives us a mediocre story based on another movie titled "The Quiet Earth" (which I'll see below) in a strange way, to which he never gives credit. With a borrowed story, I guess it does a decent job of reinterpreting it. His blow seems to be missing at the beginning, while Ralston tries to find his way, borrowing once again from the techniques of other film directors to try to find his. It opens the movie in a very interesting way, but it does not answer any direct response. Of course, the last days have arrived, but there could be a concise answer as to "how" or, even better, "why" these selected few survived. A more spooky start would have taken us stronger to a comic movie. The juxtaposition would have been like "Shawn of the Dead", but instead it made us feel like we were watching a "made for TV" show. Listening to the audio commentary, I respect Ralston because he worked diligently to film this movie, and his passion almost sold it, but you can tell by his interaction with the cast that he was not so happy with his overall final product. There were mistakes, some that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out. While this translates to a performance of decent independent films, it sometimes feels cheap, and in Ralston's case, it was the latter. I must admit that David Artrt's portrait of David hooked me. He played very well as a fool, school nerd, adult. It was fun both to see and to listen, and that's why he became a sympathetic viewer. He was a key player to keep the film together, unfortunately, I can not say the same for the rest. This was Dan Montgomery's first film, and was it obvious? I mean ?? really very obvious There were scenes in which I thought that the reference card was about to appear and read the lines, perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance, but, unfortunately, it was not the case. Then there was Jeri Ryan. He stopped at his character near the end of the film, which for me was the culmination of the entire work of art. It goes from being an unknown stranger to a bitter and crazy crazy girlfriend at the end. Confused? Once again, she fell into her character at the end, giving us a glimpse of what she probably could have done while her performance matured. Even though the comment progressed, all she contributed was a laugh, giggle, or "ohhh, look at that color" at the time. While their beauty can sell tickets, one may want to consider that knowledge is just as beautiful. This was his first film, so can I be too hard? <br /> <br /> In general, this movie seemed to lack something. I thought the idea was strong? the premise that even with only a trickle of people who remain on Earth, the evil of human nature still exists. Jealousy can not be eliminated by bacteria or bombs (perhaps because they are consumed by zinc?) And we, as a race, will always want what we can not have. Ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are defective and are used previously, but he knows how to make a low budget comedy. I think our idea of ​​"funny" is different, that's why I could not laugh at many of the fragments that he found "hysterical". His actors provided the necessary level of performance for this film, which was below average. His film was loose, which means that there were elements that were never explained or addressed at all (ie, something with wings survived?!?), Which in general damaged the intensity of the film. This was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much more fun. For those who think that Roger Avery was a huge element in this movie, as we learned from his comments, all he was there was for money? He was essentially the bank for "The Last Man." Do not give yourself any illusions for any classic Avery moment. <br /> <br /> Do not expect more from Ralston? and that's how I'll finish it. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of *****
