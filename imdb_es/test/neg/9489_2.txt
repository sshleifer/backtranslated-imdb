One night I saw him at my in-laws' house when he appeared on television and my mother-in-law said it was one of his favorite movies. Well, she can have it. <br /> <br /> Look, I can enjoy a movie for girls from time to time, as long as it's good. But this one is extrafable, unreal and predictable, despite some decent performances by Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. It's amazing how quickly a woman can accept being taken out of sight. Oh, well, they say that love is blind ... <br /> <br /> The little end, clean and tidy, almost made me puke too. And how often do we need Otto Kruger to repeat the title? It did not happen once, not twice, but THREE times!
