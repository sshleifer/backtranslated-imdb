The history of the bridal fair is entertaining and attractive, and it is a credit to the filmmaker who intends to portray rural minnesotans with the same respect normally reserved for the inhabitants of the coast. It is strange, however, to find an independent film, a creation of a single person, that is as unambitious and full of cliches as a Hollywood potboiler drawn up by the committee. <br /> <br /> The portrait of the rural people is destined I think to be affectionate, but these characters do not sound good to me. I have had enough meals in diners from small cities, but I never heard a debate about the merits of different English novelists of the 19th century. It could be suggested that the writer / director Semans has no more experience with rural culture than the Coen brothers, and much less satirical enthusiasm.
