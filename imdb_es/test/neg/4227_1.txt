Although this film has a slow, almost dreamy, almost fascinating pace, and an interesting, though possibly not entirely accurate, description of the practices and criminal investigation staff of a rural French police force, it seems to me that, ultimately, It is impossible to recommend. I think that this film is simply a piece of preparation to advance in a person, that of the director, it is supposed, the dislike of heterosexuality. Certainly, human sexuality in all its forms can have its moments of disgust, it can not be denied! But choosing the wrong thing uniformly at the expense of the good, as this film does at every step, suggests a distorted sensitivity in the work. In short, if you like to see homoeroticism disguised as compassion and the representation of heterosexual love and feminine form in a horrible and degrading light, then this film is for you. I did not, and it was not.
