There is a lot of evil with this movie. Greico with a wig of girls, an old scientist who fixes the time machine, a tough guy Jones who stays behind with a shotgun that has three shots, spider people with hands of tentacles and bad teeth, etc. The makeup was so bad and they only had a few. spider people visible on the screen at the same time (the Aliens Cameron technique could have been used) instead they chose to dress each spider person in the same way ... wrong. The good thing about Greico's performance is that he says he has every syllable as if he counted how many words he speaks in the script. I'm surprised that with all the information in the DVD comments, there are still people like this who make movies. This movie could have been worse, as I do not know. Oh, and one last thing. I'm going to go hunting for an SCI-FI movie. The people who manage that channel should not be allowed to procreate to continue with the nepotism that exists in film and television.
