I will not lie and say that I do not see the program, I do it. BUT it has a lot, and many failures. 1) The boarding school is perfect. The drama is minimal. Everyone is so kind to each other, you know. We're going to give that a reality check. It is IMPOSSIBLE for ANY school to be perfect as a PCA. Free laptops for everyone. Large bedrooms Mini refrigerators. If there was a school like that in real life, almost no one would have a virgin for one. Two, they're all so rich, and it's strange that nobody has stolen anything yet. 2) Really unreal characters. First things first, who in their right mind speak as they do. They talk like a perfect teenager would. Second, Logan Reese (Matthew Underwood) is an extremely rich and "hot" teenager. My question is, why are there almost never girls in that school above him? He is rich and "hot" nowadays, all those girls would be behind him, even if he were an imbecile. Also, Chase is the stupidest person in history. It is this shy teenager who says he is not in love with Zoey, and overreacts to everything that involves Zoey. She must be BLIND to not see him in love with her. <br /> <br /> Come on, Nick. I know you can do better than that. Please..
