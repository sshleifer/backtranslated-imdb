Great performance, great production values, good direction. <br /> <br /> But the script starts with great rhythm and interest in the first half and then crumbles in the second half. We have clear character and motivation for the first half, but then the second part leaves many questions unanswered. <br /> <br /> The conflicts raised are convincing, but the follow-up is weak. For example, we are very clear that Rudyard Kipling is in favor of war, but we do not know if that philosophical position changes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of image that makes me I want to look up the facts in the history books. I do not think I can trust the film to have a clear idea. <br /> <br /> The description of the war itself is very accurate, although women's lack of enthusiasm does not reflect the hysteria of war. That swept Britain at that time. Perhaps this is historically accurate; I like it a lot in this movie, I just do not know.
