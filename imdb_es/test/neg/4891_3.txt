With the look and sound of a cheap movie without sex, this is the first of an impressive series of smells from the producer (or, in this case, the director) Geoffrey Reeve. <br /> <br /> And it's amazing. He laughs on almost every level. <br /> <br /> Some government agents (I believe) are "professionally murdered" in Amsterdam and an Interpol agent from the block of wood considerably less than charismatic (whom I assure you is not named Louis Salinger) is sent to investigate by walking a lot to ensure that the financiers of the tax farce get the value of their money for the plane tickets to shoot on the spot. <br /> <br /> Attitudes toward drugs and the description of prostitution must have seemed ridiculously outdated even before the celluloid dried up, but at least the script is very accommodating, as it explains exactly what is happening regularly in a horribly contrived directory ("Did they follow him? Oh, of course not.) Nobody outside of Washington knows you're here!" However, despite this, the plot remains confused. sinister Priest of Vladimir Putin (no less than Kronsteen from From Russia with Love) haggle to his pulpit to deliver a sermon that your brain will have turned off, which is unfortunate because you will miss our hero terrain during a fight - struggling to reach a table of wood only to later realize that he is actually sitting in a loaded gun, and he shouting "Enough!" on the murdered corpse of his friend, and on the goat-bound moustachioed boys No leather, the dance of morris and the sequence of hilarious torture - all of which provides laughter. Only the climatic chase of the ship impresses. It's an exciting and well-directed sequence that really does not take place in this movie. Such an obvious anomaly is explained when the credits accumulate: Reeve had nothing to do with that sequence! Fortunately, everything goes back to work as usual for the ridiculous turn, spit your drink and the shooting in the warehouse. <br /> <br /> Unless there is such a miserable thing as a Geoffrey Reeve completist, and you are one of them, I would not bother with this forgettable nonsense at once.
