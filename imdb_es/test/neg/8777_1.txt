Although I guess it was not the filmmaker's fault. The film underwent the unimaginable stupid decision to tell Clayton Moore (who had made the role in the 1950s and it was the old Lone Ranger we grew up with), that he could not wear the mask in public. Now, look, the poor man was not making that much money doing that, and it was not like he was going to take anything away from this movie, but it all seemed ... free. <br /> <The other thing that the film suffered (besides a prominent man whose voice was so horrible that they had to overdub it) was the fact that westerns were not that modern in 1981. John Wayne was dead and we had just been subjected to a liberal trip of guilt for a decade about how the West was built on the genocide of Native Americans. (That and Blazing Saddles sent the whole genre! The fire scene is enough!) Hollywood moved away from the westerns, because science fiction was COOL then. <br /> <br /> The only scene that underlined him was when, after rescuing drunken President Grant (and, seriously, he would have let Grant stay with the bad guys.) The country would have fared better!) Grant He asks Tonto what his reward should be: "Honor your treaties with my people." Yes, of course, as if that would happen!
