The best thing about this movie is that it seems that they used many things from the Pearl Harbor attack on Tora Tora Tora. My favorite was the shot of the P-40 hitting the row of P-40 parked but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane. Unfortunately, it only gets worse from there. <br /> <br /> There are two black men and two white men as American prisoners of war, as well as some Filipino prisoners of war and Japanese guards. The POW rating of the Americans is a white naval lieutenant, which of course is an O-3 in the navy. In any case, he needs a haircut, badly, distractedly badly. Hockey hair does not belong to a World War II movie. Oh, and he's a racist. He does not want to share rooms with the 'blacks'. Of course, in real life, I would not want to share the rooms with the white enlisted man either. I think that the Geneva Convention has a clause on the accommodation of officers and enlists, but that was not the point here. Oh, well, I think the plot is secondary to other problems in this movie. It is put in its place and practically the rest of the film is passed as a look and it works with the air pump for the divers. <br /> <br /> But once you start, it's not a bad story. The japs ​​want the divers to lift the silver thrown by the Americans before the Corrigator fell. The Filipino resistance wants them to take their time. And the prisoners of war do everything they can to help. A potentially good story and not so badly made, I suppose. A bit unbelievable when prisoners of war use camps that take breaths to swim between the prisoner of war camp and the Filipino people, every night. Maybe I'm not that demanding when I know that this is not a successful movie. I guess that's why it comes in a war movie collection of 20 packages for five dollars. <br /> <br /> The music of the 70s did not belong to this movie or to any of the films of the Second World War. It is quite annoying to say the least. The performance was not so bad. It's probably better than I could do. <br /> <br /> Not being a football fan, at least I discovered that Jim Brown is a real person and not someone Richard Pryor invented. That in itself was worth the 25 ¢ that I paid for this movie. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing in TCM or paying a quarter. <br /> <br /> A star for being a war movie, another for being World War II and another one because I feel generous.
