What a waste of film once again, the film industry does not trust to make a film that could have been only about the ideas of man. there is virtually nothing in his theories or evolution, instead, the most boring story of home life and the relationship with a daughter, a heavy script, great freedoms taken with Darwin's life, a dialogue given to his character that I find hard to believe that he had expressed. Darwin never abandoned his belief in a higher power, he may not have rightly believed in the Christian idea of ​​God, but he was not an atheist. what this film implies. What would have been a fascinating and much better film would have been if they had started with the publication of The Origin of Species and had built a story of the great revolution that it entailed, and of an incredible cast of characters involved on all sides. Instead, we received a heavy and boring drama, mostly invented, a great injustice.
