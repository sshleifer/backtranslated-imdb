This Spanish-Italian co-production tells an interesting and strange story about Dr. Bannister, a woman who not only has the best years behind her, but also has a face full of scars that makes her look like a phenomenon. But in Madrid, a teacher she knows has done some experiments on animals with a substance that regenerates the cells. The experiments were successful, but the animals became aggressive. Because the professor will not allow Dr. Bannister to be the first human guinea pig, she kills him and consumes the substance. She becomes a beautiful young woman, but also a vicious murderer when it comes to keeping her secret a secret. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is very funny, but Piero Vivarelli did not have enough skills or money to do it. A good movie out of this. In addition, the film becomes boring after a good start and fails to recover a fast pace despite the fact that the film's execution time does not exceed 83 minutes. And as the configuration changes to the Swiss city of Geneva for the last third of the film, sometimes it even looks like a holiday movie, since we see how beautiful Geneva is (which it is, but it does not help to boost the plot). ..). Then, with a more talented director, better actors and a bigger budget, "Satanik" could have become an obscure Italian classic. But, as it is, it's just a dull and boring crime movie that really is not worth looking for. Score: 3 of 10.
