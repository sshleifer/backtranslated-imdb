I would have given this movie the vote of a star had it not been for the laughter it caused me. Some of the dialogues were so simple that they make you laugh! How could someone have spoken like that? Not to mention the fact that the Bodyguard Majors (Antonio Sabato Jr.) flew a 747 like a professional and Michael Pare's whining team could dig a ditch full of gasoline and fly a big rock at the last moment. Did anyone notice the tribute to "Fantasy Island" with the guy who says "Boss, the plane!" to Michael Pare just when the 747 appears in plain sight. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved was the pretty girls and even the prettiest kidnappers. Not to mention that the main kidnapper deserved to die for the death he did for being such a prankster! Imagine escaping from being tied only to shoot with a "crossbow." Hi. <br /> <br /> The poor pilot probably died on the plane while everyone ate steak and ate rum! Just to laugh, they must make a sequel to show us how they spend the night in the middle of a Category 3 hurricane on the Neptune Atoll. Did I hear Michael Pare calling him "the best honeymoon resort in the Pacific"? Now that would make an interesting movie !!
