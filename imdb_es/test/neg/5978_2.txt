This movie was one of the worst movies I've seen. This movie goes on again and again and I almost put it out, but I gave it a shot. I did not expect anything good, but I expected more than this. The good thing is that I work in a video store and I saw this for free, because I would not spend a dime on this movie. I gave this movie a 2, just because I've seen worse things. If I were you, I would stay away from this, far away.
