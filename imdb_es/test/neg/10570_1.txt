This movie shows somehow 6.2 stars. It seems inconceivable that the director has so many relationships. I can not explain this. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. You only have a certain number of hours on Earth, do not waste 1 and 2 of them on this pile of delayed steam guano! <br /> <br /> There is no story, since apparently the director "wrote" (and I suppose with a blunt orange pencil) the script of the following day at the end of the filming of the day. The "history" has been called capricious, it does not make sense, maybe there is enough "history" to fill a commercial. Do not you hate ads? <br /> <br /> Now, while both potential clients can act, they obviously decided not to do it. And in a similar way, the writer / director can actually write and direct, as evidenced by his next work "Toy Love". <br /> <br /> So, to recap, even if you get this movie for free, even if you get paid for Look at it, avoid it. <br /> <br /> Paraphrasing Monty Python's The Search for the Holy Grail, "Run, run!"
