Evil is about a big house where a bad spirit is stupidly released to torture everyone inside. What a wash of a movie! There is not a single scene of fear. Not one! Richard Crenna exaggerates a role of nothing. There are some animated ghosts, a disfigurement caused by an electric saw and a ghost violation. After nothing special happens for most of the movie, The Evil is personified in ... Victor Buono. Cool! Where did the filmmakers get the idea that Buono is scary? It looks like he was in the ass for a guest star paycheck to pay his liquor bill. By then it's too late to turn it off, because the damn thing is over. I wanted to throw the video cassette out the window. Please, avoid this garbage! With luck you will never see the light of the DVD and it will vanish in the dark.
