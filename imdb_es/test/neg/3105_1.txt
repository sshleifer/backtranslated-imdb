Actually, I am too exhausted to write this review (bad movies always do that to me), but I feel obligated, as if it were my civic duty, to warn anyone who is considering buying or seeing this disastrous disaster. -a picture. Please, please, just take my word: this is one from which you will want to stay away. It's so boring and boring, so insipid and uninspired, a poor excuse to gather any family talent. Burt Reynolds? Wasted (despite your best efforts). Ice-T is hardly in the film, and when it appears on the screen, its interpretation is so quiet and silent that it becomes so clear that the director, perhaps intimidated by Ice's intense gaze, did not know what to do with it. Rob Lowe, as the title character, has never shown so little charisma on the screen. Mario Van Peebles should be ashamed of himself; His performance is, in the saddest possible sense, a joke. Surely, Satan himself signed Mario's check for this movie. The plot is as weak, half-hearted and annoying as all the music involved (the completely boring club song seems to continue, literally, during the first third of the movie). The look of the film will make one seriously wonder if the Director of Photography was also forced, as one of the most forgettable female characters in the film, to smoke a crack in a tube stuck to his mouth. And if you're looking for, at least, stylized, shoot-type violence, you will not get any here. This movie, I assure you, I promise you, it has absolutely no redemption! Please, I beg you, avoid this movie! Do not put it on and let yourself be fooled into thinking that your pace will accelerate, improve and evolve towards a decent outcome. It will not Do it It does not Can not What it sucks Now, they have been warned and now I can go to bed (it is 3 am, forgive any resulting error that may contain this warning). Knowing that my conscience is clear, because I have fulfilled my civic duty for my neighbor!
