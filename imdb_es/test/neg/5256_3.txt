This movie was highly recommended, but I'm not sure why. However, I am not really a fan of Adam Sandler, other than at 50 First Dates, where he retires from his usual routine of angry man. Damon Wayans is an undercover cop and Adam Sandler is the guy with whom he pretended to be a friend for a year to arrest him. Naturally, Sandler is quite angry about this betrayal. Cue angry cries and silly facials from the king of variety. They end up running away and, of course, they become friends after a big misunderstanding (involving Sandler shooting the Wayans in the head, he survives, so it's bulletproof). Do I need to continue? You will work on what will happen if you see it anyway. When our DVD player stopped (was it $ 80 from the supermarket, okay?) It was commented that the player knew that the movie was boring and refused to reproduce it.
