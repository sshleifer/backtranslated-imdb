If you're like me and occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies (I think it's like slowing down in a car accident), you can not do better than this! The plot is inane, the special effects are fun and the performance is one of the worst you'll see. 4 INCHES DOWN! WOOOHOOOOOOOO !!! Seriously, I have no idea how the director and the "actors" can sleep at night. It is painful and yet hysterically funny to see it, and I highly recommend it to those who want to be punished for something. If you can see this shit without making a face, you're a better man than ever! I wonder if the producer of this garbage had any idea what he was getting himself into (and his money)!
