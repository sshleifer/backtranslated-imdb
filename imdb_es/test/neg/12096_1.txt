This is perhaps the worst movie I've seen, and I've seen more than 300 movies in my life. The atrocious performance, the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical dexterity of the female cast members. After watching this movie, it is suggested that the viewer does not operate heavy machinery or drive for a period of at least 24 hours. They would also recommend a bottle of Valium so you do not feel so bad about the 100 wasted minutes of your life. The plot is nothing original, the dialogue unbearable, and even the weapons seem to be below average. Do yourself a favor and go to your local Blockbuster and burn any copies of this horrible movie.
