As a geology student, this film shows the ignorance of Hollywood. In the scene where the dog takes the bone inside the burning house, it is less than a foot of lava that has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is observed again when "Stan" is going to save the meter. 4. His shoes are melting on the subway floor, while the rest of the team is standing only a few feet away from the flowing lava. And to end this monstrosity of a film, the most illogical solution occurs: stop the flow of lava with cement rails K. At the beginning of the film, you can hear a reporter's voice saying that nothing can stop the flow of firefighters who have tried the cars and the CEMENT. Common sense dictates that this film is an absurd and absurd underestimation of human knowledge.
