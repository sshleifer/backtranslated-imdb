This movie is strictly for the fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. <br /> <br /> I get angry with TCM for showing this disaster more often than Bachelor Mother, the charming original. I still get mad because some Hollywood tits thought it would be a good idea to remake Bachelor Mother, filling her with some boring songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of a beautiful comedy. Instead, Hollywood could have spent the time, money, energy and talent wasted in this horrible remake to give us something new and original: wow, what a concept! <br /> <br /> Bachelor Mother (the original), with Ginger Rogers and David Niven are a spicy stew, simmering with sexuality. It's a nod from the 1930s in Hays's office. Bundle of Joy (the remake), with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher is strictly milk and cookies. It's a 1950 handshake with Eisenhower. <br /> <br /> Which cast would you prefer to see: Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou, or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, each cast member in the original version is much better than its counterpart in the remake. <br /> <br /> In the original, a beautiful young Ginger Rogers is in full swing. David Niven performs perfectly as a somewhat pampered, sophisticated and, at the same time, stunned descendant of a wealthy department store magnate. And I always love to see Charles Coburn in a movie. In Bachelor Mother, he has no price, as the desperate aspirant to be his grandfather. <br /> <br /> In Bundle of Joy, Debbie Reynolds is her usual personality. She is fine in this role, although her performance (along with Fisher's) completely changes the tone of the story. As an actor, Eddie Fisher has no choice. It completely lacks screen in "presence". Here he is too healthy for this story. His performance is completely bland and clueless. In the same way, his singing is so smooth and uncomplicated that it has been completely forgotten by the world in general. The only time he is not completely in pain is in Butterfield 8, where, by the way, he does not sing. Here, Fisher's poor performance is enough to ruin this movie. Adolphe Menjou, a favorite character actor, offers a competent performance, but not one of the best. He is more ferocious than sending. He and Fisher are not convincing as father and son. <br /> <br /> Do you see a musical for music, being the story merely incidental? Or do you see a musical for a story, with good music (hopefully) used for seasoning? If it's the first, you might like this lame remake. Otherwise, you'll be much better off watching the non-musical original by Ginger Rogers, Bachelor Mother.
