Shakespeare would have been outraged. The writers mutilated the incredible work of Shakespeare. Ariel is the only credible acting performance. African voodoo, the isolated swamp and the character of "Gator Man" make the film a mockery of Shakespeare's real tempest. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your eyes on this movie.
