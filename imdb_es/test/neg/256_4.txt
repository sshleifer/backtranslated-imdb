On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood, he landed his first male lead role in this love film B Love. The first thing you should realize is that this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two new later versions. None of those movies is half of what it is. <br /> <br /> In fact, Bogey is the second billed Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who discovers that she has been living her extravagant lifestyle thanks to her deceased father's best friend and financial adviser. Hale Hamilton. It's a shock to Mackaill. She considers a career in show business as a way to earn an income. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and is designing a definitive aircraft engine and is looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do it, plus she likes what she sees in Bogey. <br /> <br /> Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later made a specialty, it is a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and honest character. In Love Affair. The part does not get along with him. <br /> <br /> Love Affair is the second feature of your average B program, nothing terribly special.
