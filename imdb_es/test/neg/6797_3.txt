This was a huge spectacle. In short, it was a boy named Doug who blamed himself a lot for guilt. Seriously, he could feel guilty for killing a fly and feeling guilty for feeling guilty for killing the fly and all that. The animation was heartbreaking and unpleasant and the cheap jokes. <br /> <br /> It was broadcast here in Sweden as part of the "Disney time" program and I remember that I liked something, but then I turned 13 years old. <br /> <br /> I never understood why some of the characters were also green and purple. What happened to that? <br /> <br /> Truly a horrible sight. Apparently, it generated a movie that I had never seen, but I do not have great expectations for that either.
