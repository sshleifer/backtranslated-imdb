At least it is with this episode. Here we have a time traveler, the Gilligan Island teacher, no less, dating back to 1865. What does one do? Why try to save Lincoln, of course? No really interesting variations are heard on this old subject. As another critic said, this episode is particularly monotonous and lacking in style, with little to suggest that "the Professor" really came back in the 1860s. Budget constraints are evident, and the direction is firm. John Wilkes Booth adds a spark, but it's still a very flat production. Very often we feel that we are in scenarios, waiting for something intelligent to happen. There is a small turn at the end, but I emphasize minor.
