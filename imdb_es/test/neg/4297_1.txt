As a fan of war movies and flights, this is at the bottom of my list. It is historically completely inaccurate and the cast sounds and acts as if they had just come out of a high school play. The acting, script, direction, production standards and casting are garbage. The only saving grace are some of the flight sequences. If the people they portray were fictional, I could qualify it as 2, but if there's one thing that bothers me more than anything else in the movies, it's pretending that this is history and that the great people trying to be, actually, I did this ! It is almost as if they were trying to write in the greatest possible number of notable personalities of the First World War. There are many good flying movies of the First World War and this is NOT one of them.
