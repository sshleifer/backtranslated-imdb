When I read the other two comments, I had to wonder if I had seen the same movie! <br /> <br /> Life may be radically different in Australia, but, wow, call it science fiction or fantasy, but people just do not do it. I do not act in this way. <br /> <br /> I could not pass up this review without commenting on it myself. It gets better after the first half hour, but I doubt most can go that far. <br /> <br /> Yikes.
