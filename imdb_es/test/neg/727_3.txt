The first time I saw this series, the impression I had was that the characters were charming and funny, Lorelai and Rory in particular were witty and intelligent talkers, although a little too talkative. However, after seeing it for some time, my opinion changed. <br /> <br /> The main characters slowly revealed themselves as egocentric and selfish narcissists, who treated small wounds in their pride as the worst insults in their lives. existence. For example, Rory did not talk to her mother for months when Lorelai did not consult her about her impulsive marriage, while Lorelai abandoned Luke for simply wanting a little time to adjust to the new circumstances of her life. These people are shallow, they see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else must behave exactly according to their own rigid rules and, if they do not, they will hold grudges against them for an eternity. They do not want to see other people's problems and treat the milder ones as the most serious offense. Most of the characters seem to lack the ability to behave in an adult manner. They think that they should do what they want and that everyone else be condemned. <br /> <br /> The series is based on characters, so when the main characters became so unpleasant, the show also became impossible to see. I still have the rest of the series, but I doubt I'll ever see them again. I will also hold anyone who thinks that the show and its horrible characters have the greatest suspicion: they must be as horrible as Lorelai et al.
