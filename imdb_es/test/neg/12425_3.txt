Some friends and I have the strange fondness to look for horror films that are really horrendous and absolutely dark (for a good reason) and then observe them under the influence of consumer goods that open the mind like alcohol and / or soft drugs. Surely many people do this, but they watch movies like the new version of "Godzilla", while we torment our eyes and brain with things like "The Loch Ness Horror". And, eureka, this is a bad prototypical movie! We opened traditionally, with music from stock pipes during the opening credits. This is, of course, to emphasize more to us the stupid bystanders who are supposed to take the story in the highlights of Scotland and not in the birthplace of Texas, director Larry Buchanan. For the same reason, the cast members are also instructed to overreact tremendously and speak with atrocious accents. The US marine biologist, Professor George Sanderson, arrives at Loch Ness with a new and highly sophisticated sonar team to track the whereabouts of the legendary monster on the lake. Meanwhile, there are many other parties around the lake, like a group of children in a science camp (what a boring way to spend their vacations), retired army generals looking for a Luftwaffe plane that crashed into the lake during World War II and a lot of thieves and failed scientists who are hardening the monster's egg. You would think that these numerous subplots bring some diversity and emotion into the plot, but unfortunately that is not the case. "Loch Ness Horror" is a boring movie in general with only a couple of notable elements. The monster itself, for example, is a deliciously cheesy creation with cute eyes and a breath full of smoke. His teeth also glow in the dark, which is very useful when you're foolish enough to go for a boat ride in the middle of the night. Near the end of the film, the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe plane than in the monster, so it was time to wrap it up. "Loch Ness Horror" is recommended carefully in case you're a fan of the bad B movies of the '80s, but keep in mind that it contains a lot of meaningless dialogues and a strangely hasty ending that makes it look like the movie appeared suddenly. Off budget.
