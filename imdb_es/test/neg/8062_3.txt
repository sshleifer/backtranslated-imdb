Like any other person who bought this, I was tricked by the "20 pieces of extreme blood" and "banned in 20 countries" or whatever it says on the box. I must admit that I am a big fan of the gore and it always surprises me when the films can be thicker and seem convincing when doing it. Tom Savini, Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are some of the best in the business. The effects of makeup revolutionized in the 80s. Nowadays, you do not need them, since everything is done on the computer. But computers can not be compared to the visual magic that these three men could conjure up. But I'm rambling. <br /> <br /> When you watch fantastically bloody movies like Fulci's Gates to Hell or even Savini's achievement on Friday the 13th of the Final Chapter, you can appreciate all that is involved in making an incredibly bloody movie. You can not tell the difference between reality and magic. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine another reason why someone would see Cannibal Ferox, but the blood that is ostensibly omnipotent in this movie. If that is the reason you are looking for this movie, you are wasting your money. As many other reviewers have noted here, most gore are a consequence. You do not see the torture, nor the shedding of blood that occurs, you see what seems to be something later. <br /> <br /> The gore? Well, it's here, but not as much as one might expect, or wait. A man is castrated and the woman is hanged by her breasts, but apart from those two scenes, and one involving a scalping; There's nothing really much more in this movie. The gore scenes even in these three mentioned, are still quite tame compared to what you expected. Maybe it's just me and my sick and twisted experience in the genre of horror and gore, but I expected a little more. Call me sick or twisted, but is not that the only reason why people are watching this movie in the first place? Honestly, I found myself bored in many places. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox is just another movie that tries to capitalize on the madness of a superior movie. While the Cannibal Holocaust is not exactly a great movie, it is much better than this gut. If you go out of your way to buy this for $ 20.00, you will feel cheated. <br /> <br /> 3/10
