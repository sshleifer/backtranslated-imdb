This movie was very bad. First, they did not even follow the facts for that. Half of the film was invented and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of the victims of Ed Gein. The acting was horrible, except for the guy who plays Ed Gein, but it's not hard to ruin a weird guy. Although I think it was horrible, I gave it a three because they started with real crime photos. That was the best part of the movie. As soon as the introduction of the film was finished, the movie went downhill. The writer of this film tried to spice it up, but it did not have to be. The story of Ed Gein is interesting enough not to distort information.
