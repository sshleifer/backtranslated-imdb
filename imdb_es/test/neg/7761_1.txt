I look at issues of family, coronation and eastern ends in uktv every night family matters are by far the worst, the bad plots, the bad sequences and the worst performance of any soapie, even worse than the Americans and that is say something. <br /> I find it very frustrating that all these programs in uktv Australia "are far behind the UK and when one tries to figure out the reason for this, they simply trick you with a story that will show double episodes to catch it. Needless to say that this never happens, I am very happy that family matters are going to make room for something of better quality, but at the same time I would like to know the underlying reasons, did they finally realize how bad it was? stopped watching it? Whatever it is you should not leave us in suspense. Why do you feel you have to keep everything secret for your fans? Or is it that you simply do not care? I firmly believe that I should try to keep your audience up to date. Family matters are known only if their characters disappear and reappear for apparent reasons, we get involved with people and enjoy following their lives. \ <br /> <br /> I can understand why family matters would have to end, although we are far behind here in Australia, it is easy to see that writers are running out of ideas for new plots, they are repeating themselves many plots and the old episodes come back. I have also noticed that as new characters are introduced, many of them are really bad actors, as if you were scraping the bottom of the canyon and ending with the drek greetings Vince
