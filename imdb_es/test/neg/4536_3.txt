Directed by the same Jin Ishimoto who put Neoedision and flixer.com (an online movie community that was once promising) temporarily out of business and out of the network because of his directional style and cinematic method in his next movie GIRL'S BEST FRIEND. <br /> <br /> THE HOLE suffers from this style of cinema "look at me, I am a filmmaker" that is becoming the next standard in today's Hollywood, to the detriment of the content. <br /> <br /> The HOLE really starts with a unique concept, but that concept and the promise of captivating the content will soon be destroyed by the cinema's "mirame" style of direction. <br /> <br /> There are some funny moments that still shine through the pretense, but it's a painful short to watch. <br /> <br /> How sad it is when the new generation of "filmmakers" chooses not to be a servant of history, but to try to dominate on the screen and outside of it. Hell, they do not care, as long as they get their study contract, house on the beach and a new car, content and presentation are secondary problems. <br /> <br /> The saddest part of all this is Hollywood It embraces both the "look at me" attitude that is changing the whole aesthetics of cinema. Instead of presenting a story in a direct way that puts history first, today's directors are becoming "experimental," that is, "look at me." <br /> <br /> Is it me or am I the only one who really put on? off for the first minutes of Sena from SWORDFISH. That film was elevated above the attempts of Sena in the direction of "Mirame" making movies, Unfortunately, this short film by Mr. Ishimoto does not. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 Elec Tv ratings.
