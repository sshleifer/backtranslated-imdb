What the hell was this? I admit that there were some scenes that caught my attention, like the nonsense 23 where the protagonist sees or calculates the number 23 wherever he goes, but that was the movie in a few words ?! To scream out loud, it was supposed to be a thriller and to be called a psychological thriller. I hoped it had at least some catastrophic effect on the mind, but what did we get? We just received something as horrible as a type of animal control that is in the midst of a midlife crisis and its journey to redemption. A bit like an old man movie if you ask me. I probably should have rented Wild Hogs, it would not have made a difference. I mean who we're cheating, they should have turned someone else into that girl's killer. By juxtaposing Sparrow with the protagonist of that book, the number 23, they were practically distributing the film to the spectators by insinuating that he was the murderer all the time. How would it have shaken our heads? What a shame for all the voters who chose to show some generosity towards this unfortunate job that they call film and congratulations to the majority of the critics that coincided with my reaction.
