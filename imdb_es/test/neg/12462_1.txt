As a general rule, I try to find as many movies as I can to enjoy them. I did not make exceptions with "Tart", doing my best to appreciate it for what it was. But no effort, no matter how big, could redeem this sorry excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> Failed for several reasons. First, cinematography lacked direction and ineffective. Secondly, the script reached depths of "poor" who took it well and truly beyond the category of "so bad that it's good". Third, the act of acting left hallucinating quantities to be desired: it was frightening, it really was. Anyone who has seen Mischa Barton (seen here as the extraordinarily terrible Grace, a character so poorly invented and realized that Ja Ja Binks does not seem so bad) as Devon in John Duigan's "Lawn Dogs" will wonder what went wrong between that moment and now. Maybe, if they had given him a character worth bothering about, and a minimum of direction, he could at least have given this film a redeeming trait. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Finally, the film seemed to have no meaning, without expressing anything, without achieving anything. Actually, I wonder why Christina Wayne got upset. <br /> <br /> "Tarta" made a weak attempt to be something and failed. The result: a movie, sadly, so bad that it is very, very bad. Do not bother, it's really not worth it.
