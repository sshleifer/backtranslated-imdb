The director Jeremiah Checheck, who brought us big budget debacle as "The Avengers" and the remake of "Diabolique", has directed this scam Die Hard concept, made in the budget of Blair Witch. <br /> <br /> A nuclear reactor in California is overtaken by Arab terrorists. But are you ready? - the terrorists are not Arabs; They are really disgruntled American soldiers posing as Arabs! We discovered that they do not really intend to exploit the reactor, they just make a statement. We are not sure what the statement is, but it does not matter. So there really is no threat. But then one of the terrorists decides to go alone and exploit the plant because he is a little crazy. So maybe there is a threat after all. But the army enters and all the bad ones are killed. So there was no threat. Oh, and a good boy is killed too. Let it be a lesson for all. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds confusing and like a waste of time, then you have the idea of ​​what it is like to watch Meltdown. <br /> <br /> The script never bothers to present the characters or even give personal details that can develop them or emotionally involve the audience. So we are left with one-dimensional characters: the expert that nobody will listen to; the trigger-happy-sergeant; the-politicians-muddy the-dweeby-Engineers. The story jumps from one cliché incident to another in a formula composed of virtually every action movie you've seen. But almost at every step, just when we think something may be at stake, the script shudders and we discover that there really is nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> Like Die Hard, there is a police officer who is in, Unknown to the bad guys. The big twist is that the policeman here is ... A WOMAN! Oh, and she's hurt too. But it's not so bad, enough to make her shiver a couple of times. Oh, and instead of the walkie talkie that Bruce Willis had, this cop has a magic phone that works everywhere ... even underground! When he's not yelling at everyone else, Bruce Greenwood, his jaw made of granite, tries to calm her down with the walkie talkie. He even makes a joke once, but we fear his face will crack. After all, this is a serious matter. <br /> <br /> But mostly it's scene after scene of people arguing: the military expert is arguing to wait (his reasoning does not seem particularly solid but he's supposed to be the smart guy in this movie so okaaaay); the people in the White House argue with him; the army sergeant also discusses with him; The sympathetic Pakistani nuclear engineer argues with the main terrorist. The dialogue is absolutely B Movie all the way and lines like, "Stop the transmission! STOP THE TRANSMISSION!" You may be on the couch while you wonder if the characters are really referring to this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Perhaps to compensate for the lack of production quality, the camera work remains nervous in that fake documentary 21 The style of the grams that is supposed to lend immediacy and energy to the scenes, but the way they are applied indiscriminately and in an amateur way here is very annoying; even pretentious. Additional attempts are made to increase the pace with the inclusion of meaningless black and white images that are randomly interspersed with the main action. But this, too, is pretentious and annoying in the sense of Blair Witch. In short, the stylistic attempts seem very amateurish. <br /> <br /> Music is at the height of the visual: it is synthetic and sounds cheap. Something like a porn movie but with less melody and many more sounds of heartbeats. The graphic treatment is also quite bad: the cheesy graphics in a large red font shout "9:28 pm" as if the time clock really made some kind of difference. <br /> <br /> Meltdown can work as a marketing concept But it is clear that the script was a second thought. FX - part of Fox - put together this cheese production and dropped several million dollars. Now that's what I call a collapse!
