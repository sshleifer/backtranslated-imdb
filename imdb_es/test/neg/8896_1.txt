Hey, I know that Angel is not the kind of program that gives people a happy ending, and I know they could not do everything perfect, but I could not believe the end for Angel. I love the show, it is possibly the best show of all time. However, I really hated this ending, as well as throughout the second half of Angel's season 5 (similar to Buffy's season 7). The deaths of my favorite characters were quite useless and did nothing for the plot. Cordelia was one of the best characters in the show, and once she and Angel finally met, she became a demon and became a demon. I was so eager to have her back, do not get me wrong, the episode in which Cordelia returns is fantastic, but I was still really mad at her disappearance. So, on earth did Fred end up dying, right after he finally joined Wesley? There was no sacrifice, it was useless, it did nothing for the plot, and the blue haired demon girl is a horrible and useless character. They spent too much of the end centered around her. Another big problem is that they did not connect the elements well enough. I know that those guys in that black spine wanted to provoke the apocalypse, but there was not even a set date for when it was supposed to happen. The apocalypse should have been made and discovered throughout the season, instead of just mentioning that there are some evil guys one hour before the end of the season. One of the biggest problems is that every character that matters to the audience is dead or does not have to live. My three favorite characters died, and Angel, Spike and Gunn (of whom I'm not even sure I survive) have no office, have not even returned to help the helpless, are in the middle of a great battle and have lost. everyone who cares about Angel and Spike are never redeemed, they lose the girl they care about, and almost everyone is dead, and they still have to fight against this strange evil army. I understand that you never stop fighting, but it was stupid to end up in the middle. There could not have been any redemption, knowing that there would always be many more battles to come. I do not understand why this episode has such a high rating, because I think Buffy's ending was 10 times better, and I was not even a fan of that. Why did they have to slip at the end, season 3 and 4 and the first half of five were so incredible that they ruined the show?
