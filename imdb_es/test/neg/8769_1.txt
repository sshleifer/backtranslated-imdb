As an avid fan of the Christian film, and a person who tries to keep an eye out for improvements in the field of Christian filmmaking, I was excited to have the opportunity to watch this movie. I was ready to see something that would make a new brand in quality films. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The initial scene is excellent, although a small scam by Leon - The Professional in the corner, shows a great cinematography in the beginning ... everything after that was practically downhill. <br /> <br /> I could barely sit through it, I was tempted several times to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The performance, although possibly it was sincere, was incredibly horrible But, again, the kernel of the problem was the script itself. The dialogue was worse than anything I've seen, and even my amateur script "The Awakening" (soon to be an independent film) looked like a Hitchcock thriller next to this. (Which does not say much). The positive side of this film is that it was filmed on Sony's new high-definition 900 cameras that were shot in 24P. This movie and Star Wars: Attack of the Clones were the first films to use these new technology cameras that year. Unfortunately, the performance of the camera seemed to have been wasted with poor lighting, poor angles and awkward handling. <br /> <br /> The only good feeling I got from watching this movie was how good my novice indie movie will look by his side; ) 4/10
