The first comment of the movie! I'll start by saying "Come on! Was not it that bad ... was it?" ... No, it was not so bad really. I laughed and giggled a lot through the movie, so I can not say with my hand in my heart that it was garbage. <br /> <br /> It's completely different, this and Epic Movie (Epic Movie sucked badly ... doh!). "How is that?" People would ask. I'll tell you how. This movie is not so useless, not to mention that stupidity (and I say stupidity because it is, but being stupid makes it funny) the things that happen around and with the characters are really nice in this movie. It is not the best, but hey ... what are you waiting for, look at the poster! Some people said it was stupid, it seems to me that when writing a comment one should be more objective (my opinion) but yes, of course it was stupid, it's a movie about "stupid"! Look, I'm not telling you to go watch the movie now or you missed the century event. What I'm saying is that if you see the movie somewhere, do not look at the opening credits. See what it's about: who knows, you might like it a little. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 for not being so bad and making me laugh and some unexpectedly good jokes related to sex.
