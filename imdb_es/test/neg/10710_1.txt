Warning: This could ruin your movie. Look at it, see if you agree. <br /> <br /> Think that as human beings we can not learn from the past. Futurist society portrayed with glamor what Hitler believed, destroying a race of people (in this case, men) for the benefit of society. It made me sick to my stomach. Also the plausibility of a Y bomb is crazy. Even in war, our instinct for self-preservation will prevent the extinction of humanity. We made mistakes in the past, that is: Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki in '45, but because of that, we avoided a bigger mistake in '63 during the missile crisis in Cuba
