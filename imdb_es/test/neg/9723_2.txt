Most of the criticism in this movie has been quite accurate. It's an hour and a half of waste of time, after a group of very nice high school students complain and cry for life. There are about twenty minutes of magic, and absolutely no moment of fear or emotion. Our actress is treated like an ass, and seems to be perfectly happy with her position. The main characters, these children of ipsmith are walking in poster for any pop culture clothing store. You can not relate to them, demons, you can barely understand them. The story advances by itself and when it finally reaches the final battle, it is nothing more than a volleyball game that does not last long enough to compensate with this script destroyed and violated by the O.C.
