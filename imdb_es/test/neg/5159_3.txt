Honestly, the people who gave ten to this movie would have given 100 per pulp fiction. This is the level with which we are dealing here. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad, but by no means is it like "OMG, the best movie since Pulp Fiction!". Some people have incredibly low expectations for movies, even those of indie variety. Personally, I found that my interest in the movie decreased after half an hour. The plot challenges logic and belief. You have to listen to the part about why the wife did what she did to "save her husband". Yeah sure. I guarantee that you would leave the theater thinking, "hmm, now that does not make any sense". This is a movie in which you really need to suspend all logic and belief. <br /> <br /> Those who said that the music is good, they were probably listening to their MP3 players. Absolutely killed the movie in some parts. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, watch the movie only if you have nothing in particular to do. I give it a three because there is a long sequence of sex in the motel that is decent.
