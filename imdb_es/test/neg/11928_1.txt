If you are a fan of the original series, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I should have been skeptical of the previews when Aeon expresses his motives for murder. In the series, Aeon had no family or motive for his adventures, except selfish interests. Obviously, the chimpanzee in charge felt that the film needed to address the demographics of "bad grrl" by making the character mortal, but he has a good reason to kill people. <br /> <br /> You would not have thought it possible, but the film is more two-dimensional than the cartoon. All characters are represented as intrinsically good, with some conflict of interest that eventually resolves. All dogs go to heaven, and the same goes for every character that dies in this movie. <br /> <br /> The selfish, twisted, perverted and dominant people of Aeon and Trevor are not in sight. In the end, literally, they become a cute couple wing Annie Hall. The only character that remained faithful to the show was the Relicle, the floating machine in the sky. I suppose if you ever thought "gee, I like Aeon Flux, but I wish it was more like any other Hollywood faceless sci-fi movie", then a surprise awaits you. <br /> <br /> They did not even get the right look. I guess a black metal bikini was too much to ask, but everything is wrong. 400 years in the future for sure they look like 30 years in the past. Instead of a clearly post-apocalyptic urban world, the viewer's eyes are offended by a fruitful of 70s-year-old mannequin squads of egg-shaped furniture, wood-paneled walls, earth tones and many plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not an utopia. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Bregna, that is the only city in the world according to the movie. The show is clear that there are two cities, Bregna and Monica, that used to be one. In the movie, the "monicans" are just fighters for the freedom of Hollywood storybooks. They also have as much technology as the Bregnan, which is not the case with the program. <br /> <br /> The only possible conclusion is that the real writer of this movie was a high school kid, and that he wrote it. The previous day was due to studio executives, and he has never seen a full Aeon Flow to the end. The large amount of inconsistencies with the caricature is disconcerting. Beyond using certain names such as Aeon Flux, Trevor Goodchild and Bregna, the film is nothing like the show. <br /> <br /> Most of the film seems to try to mix the colorful green diagrams borrowed by soy. the blade broker, Logan's career and the grave robber, who came out of a dark brown mess.
