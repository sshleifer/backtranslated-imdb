A young woman nicknamed "T.N.T." For being a virtual dynamite in a fight and a knockout in terms of looks to boot, he goes to the most illegal part of Hong Kong in search of his missing brother Stag Jackson. When he learns that he has been murdered, he decides that he will bring the murderer to justice in a way that only she can. <br /> <br /> Sounds good, is not it? Well, there's really nothing wrong with the basic premise as the starting point for a martial arts / blaxploitation action thriller, which is what it pretends to be. The tracks are also quite good, since Jeanne Bell fits perfectly in the role of "T.N.T." and Stan Shaw is fine as the ambitious and hungry Charlie. Where this fails miserably is in terms of the fighting action it offers. The fight scenes are totally and completely unconvincing and / or, at times, so exaggerated that they reach the point of ridiculousness that does not help at all when the basic focus of your film is a hero of Kung Fu action. In addition, poor lighting, accented sports accents make them difficult to understand, confusing camera work and sometimes poor sound do not help this obvious under budget to make an effort. This is delivered in an area that can delight some fans, offers a lot of T in "T & A", in fact, virtually every fight scene in the movie is produced by some kind of nude scene and Jeanne Bell really has an extended fight scene in which she is completely topless. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is not something you want to revisit because the fight scenes are pathetically, laughter bad.
