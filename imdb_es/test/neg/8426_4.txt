That's all I can say about this movie. It's DBZ ... like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, really ... it does not fit the timeline of the show, even though it's supposed to be right before the start of the TV series. The action is quite nice in general. The plot has a pretty nice base, with a good background that establishes why these guys hate each other and everything. Quite good in general, there ... The problem is ... there are many really strange things. I mean, really strange things. Like The World's Strongest, there is a really, very strange song in this song that could only have been created in a drug-induced haze ... the unsettling fact is that Gohan, while singing, is quite drugged. Horrifying. The villains are strange and quite funny ... more than the usual DBZ type: it seems rather that it was made like a Dragon Ball movie instead of a Dragon Ball Z movie. In general, it's quite entertaining, but ... just ... weird.
