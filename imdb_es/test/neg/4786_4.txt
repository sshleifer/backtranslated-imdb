It seems that people are attracted to shows that show pathetic lives that have no purpose at all. I give my sincerity to NBC for their great efforts to make new changes in television, making free laugh shows. It seems that they always find great success, like The Office. When I started looking for the first time, it seemed to me that I could have the potential to be a huge success. But after a couple of episodes, I really felt the urge to go to church and donate every penny in my entire bank to pathetic people who show up in these low-life, poor and shameful areas. And at the end where they show Earl and brother in bed together, it seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life, like street beggars or people struggling to pay rent and have no idea what What do they do. The real world of normal people in society are like. It seems that I always feel disgusted when I see the filth in which people live in this show. It's like Venice Beach in California, beautiful but with so many hobos. Believe me, I'm not a rich, middle-class guy, and I'm not a fanatic either, a little careless, but it seems to me that the show does not seem to get away from all the frightening, imbecile people that have a leg. I just wish they showed a little more Class, not all the filth and poverty and the trailers, and just short of the average life, it just seems to depress me. For me, this show is just a showcase of what should not be done in life, what should not be. It also shows me that education is the most important thing you can have because, apparently, these two do not have a shred of intelligence. This is a schmuck-u-mentary.
