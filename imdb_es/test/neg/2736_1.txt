This movie was so horrible that I do not even know where to start ... The only positive thing I can say is that Luke Perry had a good performance. The whole movie was everywhere, there was no explanation about the cause (just the theories) of the eruptions, or the rationals of their solutions or why it would work. It was ridiculous! All the characters and the relationship between them was so corny, you just want to laugh! There simply was no record of any of them. The "love" relationship seemed to have been added to the script, it was so uncomfortable. There is an army man; great black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth, with the "AaarrrGH! I am the Man!" Attitude, such a pathetic bad guy. The two companions, who are supposed to be geniuses, act like two 16-year-old fraternity boys. And then, to create some action, they decide to drop a stone on someone's shoulder and, for the rest of the movie, cough like they're dying of pneumonia or something ... and then play a hero ( The funniest scene of all!) To help the plan that is to make who knows what ... it's never a good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of THE dramatic scene ... in a few words; do not waste your time
