Sideshow is a good example of a basically interesting idea that came out very, very badly. With regard to horror films, and especially with the arrival of movies for teenagers at the moment, a film based on a group of teenagers who attend a mysterious show is something that they could have a lot of fun with. <br /> <br /> However, the writer decided to make a very direct, very boring and very simple story about five teenagers who become part of the show when the enraged dwarf Abbot Graves transforms them into monsters using a pathetic machine that he mutates them into beasts. <br /> <br /> The five teenagers are eliminated one by one until the last man is left, his "punishment" is that he can not join his friends and, therefore, "be alone". What a lot of garbage! <br /> <br /> The 'actors' are very poor, this movie has no comedy (and it could have been so fun!), no gore (and it could have been so bloody!), no action or horror . (And I could have had both of them!) <br /> <br /> The director did not do his duty to try to make this a bit interesting to watch. His soft-core experience has obviously disabled any creativity he may have had, since all the shots are the same, with very few editions and little movement. In general, the quality is bad. <br /> <br /> In general, the nudity in the movies does not affect me, but believe me the only important point in this movie was a pair of breasts.
