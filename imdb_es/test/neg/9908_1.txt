What I hate the most about this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the filmmakers and network executives who put this nonsense in the audience because they really think that the audience is so stupid, so unworthy, so insipid as to deserve this kind of cons. There is an inherent entertainment to watching disaster films and with the magic of today's CGI effects, artists receive powerful tools to explore what they had previously been denied. With that charm we sat down to observe chaos and destruction. Well, guess what, the only chaos that we saw was in the ads that promoted the episode next Wednesday. What a disappointment! But wait, there was even a bigger one. The script itself was the biggest disaster! And then there was the direction and the flaccid performance of everyone involved in this turkey. But we knew this before, right? We knew that the effects alone are not a creation of entertainment, but even so the fans of the network who accepted in this television movie did not mind that because in their mantra is the eternal line "never underestimate how stupid the viewers are " These guys must live according to this motto, and I'm fed up with that. No wonder the public has left the American drama en masse and launched their camp in reality shows. At least in those programs nobody tries to make it look like something other than what it is: intellectual pornography. Well, Category 6 is worse than that because it is supposed to be different and "original". Yes, this was a disaster movie, but disasters are not what they announced!
