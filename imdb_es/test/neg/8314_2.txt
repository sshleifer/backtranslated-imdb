"Death Machines" takes a pretty decent premise for an action movie (unstoppable martial arts killing machines sent to eliminate the opponents of a crime boss) and turns it into an uncontrollable disaster. I have rarely seen such an impressive combination of small budget, bad acting and incoherent script released as a so-called "movie". It is easily the worst action-oriented film of the martial arts that I have seen in years, eclipsing even "Ninja Holocaust" (which at least had some energetic battle scenes). <br /> <br /> The real "star" of the movie is the white "Death Machine" (it's basically your vehicle), so it appears in many more scenes than its two cohorts. He is in good shape and does not look bad, but as an actor he is hardly there. Think of Chuck Norris in "The Octagon", only without energy or emotion. Obviously, this is a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and the director. ..but you have to be Arnold to achieve this kind of thing, and this guy is not Arnold. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film (and the director) did not find the time (or the budget)) to film the scenes that would have answered the basic questions that he originally posed, such as: Who was the shadowy figure? Who gave orders to the Asian lady with a marble mouth? How did the "gang war" end? Why did the Asian woman with a mouth full of mushrooms decide to kill her zombie killers? And what the hell happened that left her assistant dead and her wielding a katana like a broomstick? <br /> <br /> However, find the time to film a strange bar fight in which a sailor (well, it looked like Popeye) destroys a bar because the juke box did not work. It only relates to the rest of the film because in the process KO is also the "hero" of the film, a waiter / student of karate who was the victim of the first important task of "Machines of Death" (they cut off his hand while they were killing their teacher). Follow this with one of the most unknown "love scenes" between the hero and his girlfriend that I've seen. The relationship does not make sense: at the end of the bar fight, she is grimacing over her limp body, and the next is a "tasteful" montage of sex and love that seems to come from a Hallmark card. By the way, we never see the sailor again. <br /> <br /> And wait until you see the confrontation between the homicide detective and his captain. It is played as if the director and the screenwriter had never seen a scene from a movie inside a police station, but they had heard about them. And I decided to include some without really knowing how they worked. <br /> <br /> The film is a textbook case of poor actors at the level of theater and community theater that are debated without a decent direction. The three "Machines of Death" appear as lumps; the "hero" knows his lines but can not take the film, since his character is an ineffective puppet; His girlfriend is a void of charisma. and all the other minor parts are barely visible. All this makes it a pretty bad movie, but the "dragon lady" does more than drag the movie into an underground and smelly territory than anything else. She looks ridiculous her small, expressionless face is overcome by her toned skyscraper wig, she wears her red silk dress like a bathrobe, and speaks with a terrible delivery that says "it takes time with a dialogue coach " Poor lady: she was obviously out of her element and, as far as I know, she never appeared in a movie again. <br /> <br /> Add to this a low synthesizer soundtrack of a single synthesizer that never closes and never plays anything appropriate or interesting; shit film material and lighting; Fight against choreography that is strictly hunger. and a general dream and a lack of energy in the blockade and the business of the scenarios ... and you have only one movie. <br /> <br /> I got this as part of a DVD compilation of 50 movies, so it probably costs me about 50 cents to watch it. It was not worth it. Feh
