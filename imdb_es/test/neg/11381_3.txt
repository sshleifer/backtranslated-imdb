"Ghost Son" is Lamberto Bava's best film and, at the same time, also his worst movie. I suppose that statement requires a slight clarification. It is the best because it is well directed, ambitious, accessible and very elegant, but it is the worst because it is a boring, unoriginal film and undoubtedly a great disappointment for all true fans of Bava's past efforts. Let's face it: many fans, undoubtedly myself included, would not have been interested in this movie judging by the plot, the famous names that are attributed to it and even the boring title that it sounds. The only motivation here was Lamberto Bava, who in the past brought us large amounts of complicated Gialli movies and fun. "Ghost Son" is a bit of his return movie, along with "The Torturer", and although the latter is definitely not a good movie, at least it lives up to the expectations of its fans, with excessive amounts of sleaze and blood. and sadism. "Ghost Son" is a weak and intolerably soft horror movie, even speaking in terms of conventional ghost stories. The emphasis is too much on sentimentality, and this seriously affects the already limited number of terrible and terrifyingly terrifying moments. The basic premise could include one or two potentially good ideas, but the film is generally boring and too clich√©. John Hannah and Laura Harring act as a happy couple, live on a remote ranch in South Africa and raise horses for a living. Joy and happiness could not improve, so naturally, something tragic has to happen, and it does. Mark dies in a car accident, but the inconsolable Stacey remains on the ranch where he is in constant contact with the spirit of Mark. She even gets pregnant with her son, but soon after the birth of the baby Martin mysterious events begin to occur. It seems as if Mark's restless and selfish ghost 'possessed' the baby and used it to encourage Stacy to commit suicide. With all the focus on the relationship of the couple, many of the events and subgroups are underdeveloped and / or remain unexplained, like the whole background of the young servant Thandi. There is very little action and the only real moments of fear are too obviously taken from classic films like "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby" (green vomits, furniture that moves by themselves). Speaking purely in terms of horrible entertainment, "Ghost Son" is a painful fire failure, but it must be said, it is a beautiful and charming failure. The cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are really inventive and suggestive. The grumpy note sometimes even manages to create an ominous atmosphere even though nothing significant happens on the screen. There are several beautiful images of the South African wildlife to admire, but if that interests you, I suppose it is better that you are watching National Geographic. There is not much to recommend here. Fans of ghost stories driven by the atmosphere have much better options to choose from and it is recommended that Bava fans (re) watch "Demons", "Macabre" or "Blade in the Dark".
