Steve Martin has always had my respect for being a very funny comedian and a very good actor, and I loved "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and "Bowfinger", but "Going home" is definitely not one of Martin's. the funniest works, and they do not even seem to be trying to be, which is just sad ... <br /> <br /> I do not know; maybe I did not like this movie because of the fact that I rented it together with "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" and "Phone Booth", which are excellent movies, or maybe because I'm used to that much better on the part of Martin, or maybe just because I'm in a bad mood today ... Despite that, this movie was not very funny or entertaining, and I never achieved more than a smile or a laugh. The gags of the movie, which is really a shame, since the advances of this comedy were so promising. I expected "Bringing Down the House" to be a great comedy, and I certainly expected more slapstick comedy and interracial laughter from Martin. Instead, we 'try' to see Queen Latifah shaking all over the screen, trying to do everything possible with her totally boring character. Eugene Levy, the funniest thing about this clunker, is that he does not even have the screen time he deserves. <br /> <br /> I really would have liked to enjoy "Download the house", but I did not. I do not think it's too hard to recommend it to anyone other than Steve Martin's staunchest fans. Skip this and rent "Planes, trains and cars" instead ... <br /> <br /> You will have a much better time.
