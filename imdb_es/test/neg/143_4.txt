I saw this movie on VHS some time ago (January 27, 2003), just by the name of Paul Rudd on the cover. I really liked his performance in `The Object of My Affection 'and really expected a good job. However, I found this movie a complete disaster. The story has a very confusing script and the characters are not well developed. Also, low-budget special effects do not help much. I do not know the previous generation of Gen-Y Cops, but this next generation is not good. I do not remember exactly why I gave this rating (and I do not intend to see this movie again), but my vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Gen-Y Cops To Nova Geração '(` Gen-Y Cops The Next Generation')
