I could not help but laugh when I saw what the audience might think was an email in 1996. Apparently, email is an interactive discussion (similar to a chat) with unconvincing voice synthesis that reads each comment aloud. And some of the other "technological" aspects are also fun to laugh. I would swear that the "high tech" communications center he has actually has a few Commodore 64 monitors. Almost like watching the movie Hackers today, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that in most of the film the main actress takes away the illusion of being disabled, the final part of the film has an inexplicable use of Her legs that somehow does not I can ignore. I mean, why include something so stupid? <br /> <br /> Anyway, to summarize: the plot is quite predictable, the bad performance, the killer quite successful. But I suppose it can be fun in a Mystery Science Theater 3000.
