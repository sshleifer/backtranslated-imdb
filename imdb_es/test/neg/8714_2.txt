A terrible disappointment: a controversial film, winner of the Teddy in Berlin 2003, A Thousand Clouds of Peace turned out to be a fiasco. All the actors are reciting (well, they are not exactly actors); The movie tried to be a high bet, but ended up being a dubious bet: it remains in the superficiality of two kissing guys and a guy whose lover has left; It has no purpose: nothing to do with the homo-sexuality presented in other films (for example, Before Night Falls (2000) by Julian Schnabel). Technically, the only thing that works is photography; otherwise, the camera is placed at odd angles (to make it more 'art-film') and the whole film takes place in a black and white atmosphere. The movie is so pretentious that it bothers. I mean, it's good to be pretentious when you have the talent to support it. Or maybe it's so art-film that it's incomprehensible. The story flows slowly, slowly, slowly. For me, more form than essence. Excellent edition? It was good. Magnificent address? I do not think so: the movie is weak. It was an interesting project. It is a pity. Is a deffect. One star in four.
