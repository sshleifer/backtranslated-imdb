Please, forget about this. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson and the rest of the cast have had some terrible performances. The show is flat, flat, flat. <br /> <br /> I do not know how Michael Madison could have allowed this on his plate. He almost seemed to know that this was not going to work and his performance was quite mediocre, which is why all Madison fans miss it.
