This movie is terribly bad. Kevin Spacey is really a great actor, he shines in LA Confidential, American Beauty, Usual Suspects, 7, etc. But this is really silly, I did not even have a decent Irish accent, maybe I should have practiced with Kate Hudson while she was doing About Adam. For the Irish, this movie is ridiculous and, what is worse, it is quite annoying for several scenes. I think the producers made this film with the hope that the target audience (not from Europe) would never have seen or heard about the "General" or Martin Cahill and would be captivated by an intriguing and entertaining story. Total Crud !!
