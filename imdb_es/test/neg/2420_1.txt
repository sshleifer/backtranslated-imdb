Horrible movie Terrible acting, cheesy, totally unreal, shameful for anyone who has played the game. For starters, that guy is not a prostitute, he would split in two. As for '' Score, that's my job '', well, no, it's not. For the uneducated American audience, it might seem like a good movie. For me, well, those are some hours of my life that I will never return. I read the reviews and found one in which the boy sounded like he knew what he was talking about. Then I read: <br /> <br /> '' And while American rugby may never reach the level of talent that New Zealand or South Africa has, third place in the world is nothing I can think of either '' > <br /> All I can say is, LMFAO! <br /> <br /> Keep playing football and baseball, leave real sports to the big ones.
