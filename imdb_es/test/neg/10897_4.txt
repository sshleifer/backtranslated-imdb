A young woman, Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander), and her boyfriend, Jess (Joey Mendicino) become targets of a deranged serial killer after stopping for a 'comfort break' at a rest stop on a remote road. <br /> <br /> What might have been an effectively frightening cooler in more competent hands, turns out to be a confusing and ill-considered mess under the careless guidance of John Shiban (who also wrote the script). There is a lot of juicy violence, a bit of nudity and trustworthy performances from the cast, but the stupid script leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions that one can not help but feel disappointed. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the film unfolds like a 'killer-in-the-loose' movie, loaded with clich√©s, but Shiban (a former writer of the X files) introduces some subtle supernatural elements They suggest that their goal was something else entirely: a ghost story, with the rest it stops acting as the home of a vengeful specter to punish sinners. <br /> <br /> When reading about the film, review the theories of the viewers here in IMDb, and see the Extras in the DVD, certain elements of the plot begin to make a bit more sense (although, even with the advantage of the additional information, many questions remain unanswered). In my opinion, any film that requires so much research to be understood (only partially) is not particularly good.
