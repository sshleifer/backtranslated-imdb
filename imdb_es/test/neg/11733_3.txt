Honestly, how hard can it be to make a good remake? Obviously hard enough! I was so excited to see this because I loved the original, and my friends see it and they tell me it really sucks. Well, finally I see it and it disappointed me very much. Ok, the shower scene was more realistic ... that's why I gave it a 3. Otherwise, it was crap. Vince Vaughn does a terrible job playing Norman, he's too dense or something. I do not know, it was terrible. Do not see it!
