I had seen Rik Mayall in Blackadder and The New Statesman, so I thought about trying out this movie. <br /> <br /> Around 4 pm I bought it, around 8 pm I started watching, around 8.15pm I quickly moved the remaining film to see if there was something visible for a human being with a brain ... but there was not Around 8.45pm I threw the DVD in the trash can. And that's where this "movie" belongs. <br /> <br /> What happened to British humor? The humor so fine and witty, intelligent and cunning you find in Yes, Minister, Blackadder, Vicar of Dibley, Fawlty Towers or The Fast Show? The black humor for which Britain is so famous? I do not want to insult anyone, but I suppose even stupid children would not find it funny. They deserve a more intelligent diversion. And Rik Mayall, you can do better, so please, do it.
