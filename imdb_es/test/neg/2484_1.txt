Here we go another pop star entering the great land of television and my observations of his directors of racing pop saying yes, your great gwen, you could be a true star. Maybe one day you'll be on the A-movie list, they would do anything. to expand the show, there is not a pretty face, but they also have an acting capacity almost overnight. Gwen has somehow discovered the ability to act to see actors like James Dean or Clint to the east. Please, give the real people in the world who have to sit behind that box and have to suffer the effort of pop stars to try to act. Please, stick to your beautiful pop videos with your japan gang and do not insult the British with your efforts as an actress. Anyway, I go back to my working class job and I think, my God, I could do that. but yes, remember that I will be working until I am 65 years old if I live so much and if it raises the feet of the girl with her royalties every three months, pah gets married with the right money xxx
