The first time I saw this movie I was ten years old. I thought it was bad then, and at that age I had no cinematic taste. I saw this movie in Cinemax about 3 days ago and they reminded me why I hated the movie in the first place. Madonna's character, Nikki, is annoying and unpleasant. There is no way for the main character to fall in love with her. The jokes were cheesy and the dialogue was worse than a t.v. soap opera!! I'm glad I did not see this movie at the movies, or if I had rented it. I feel bad for my parents who had to endure looking at me! Madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role she is represented as a complete idiot.
