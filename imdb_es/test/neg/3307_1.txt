OK, then she does not have caller ID. When you are being harassed, you get it! And there's no cell phone? When he is being harassed, he GETS ONE if he is one of the few full-time parents who is the head of the family who does not yet have one. This mom gets a big ZERO in the parenting department. So her mother is in the hospital and decides that a shopping trip will help her. Only a stupid movie. I'm glad to have Tivo and an FF button on the remote control. And what is with the minimum of 10 lines, I do not have much to say about such a bad movie. I suppose I can ask why he keeps opening packages because he has no idea who they are. The son really did not add much to the movie either. The cops were a great old man too. Now go to the nearest Verizon and get the damn cell phone. @@
