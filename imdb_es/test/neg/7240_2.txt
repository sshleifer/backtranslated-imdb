The Salena incident is by far the director, the best Dustin Rikert movie, which does not say much. In his past films (and use the term "movies" loosely), the director takes ideas from Hollywood blockbusters and marginalizes them severely. The Salena incident is no different. The film is basically Con Con Air Meet Aliens made with the appearance of the average production of a film school. The film is full of unfocused shots and is riddled with special effects that would have trouble competing with most of the high school computer animation classes. For example, almost all screen explosions have the same effect of fire on the screen. <br /> <br /> Weak effects and production value are only compromised by a faulty plot and a rocky dialogue. In a sentence, the story comes together as an exhibition of abused Hollywood clich√©s. The film begins with the worst extraterrestrial CGI ship that has ever hit the worst CGI land ever created and a team of armies that will investigate. Next, a prison transport bus, which transports the worst of the worst in the state, is overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their blonde brides armed with silicone implants. The prisoners escape and run to the city of Salena, where they meet the aliens who ... SHOCK ... have escaped from an extraterrestrial prison that transports the worst of the worst in the entire galaxy. The prisoners, and their captive police, armed with weapons and sad word games, have to fight against the aliens and escape the city before the International Space Alliance * drops its eyes * bombard the city to oblivion. <br /> <br /> The only real thing The nice parts of the movie are when the actors (who are clearly undermined by the script) have the freedom to improvise and also when they fight against the smaller alien creatures in a wave of shots of weapons. Apart from that, the movie really is not worth anyone's time, much less the plastic with which the DVD is made. How horrible was it? Let's say that the Secretary of Defense is approximately 90 years old, works in a room that is almost like a high-tech real estate office in 1950 and wears a Looney Tunes tie. Yes, if that was not clear enough before, THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE PENTAGON CARRIES A TIE WITH THE RABBITS AND THE ROAD CORRIDOR IN IT. Basically, the film ends (HAHAHahhaaaa I climax ...) with the last remaining soldier running towards the group of prisoners and guards and the new team formed struggling to get away from the fierce aliens, which for some strange reason brings them Directly to the alien ship? yes ... <br /> <br /> The movie has a heart, but it is riddled with horrible directions and even worse from the camera. Someone seriously needed to slap the DP and tell him that there is more in the cinematography than you take repetitive, stagnant and at chest level. This movie really is not worth renting (if it ever gets that far), since it's not as horribly bad as the last movies made by the director, which reduces the capacity for laughter, but it's not so much cinema visible.
