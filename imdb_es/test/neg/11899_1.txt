After watching the movie, I must say that this is one of the worst movies I've seen. This takes away my prize for the worst Komodo movie, which is not an easy feat. It is neither a porn movie nor a legitimate movie and it gives both of them a bad name. The acting, the camera work, the plot, the script and the sound are horrible. My favorite part of the movie is the duck that asks the bartender if he has grapes. Why was a joke like this put on the movie? The director was thinking; "I need a funny scene to balance the great performance, so I'll use a little joke that I read on a Laffy Taffy wrapper." Another part delayed is when Norman spills the invisibility potion on himself when he tries to prevent it from spilling. Why did they bother to give the film a grade of NC-17, they hoped to get the largest audience possible? At least, if it were rated with X, it would be more sexual and, therefore, keep spectators from low overall quality. I pray for someone who has worked on this waste of a movie to respond.
