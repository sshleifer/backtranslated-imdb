In another miserable attempt to make a quick charge in Hollywood of one of the best television masterpieces, Peter Segal has created a monster. Out of context, if you did not know Brooks' work before you saw it, the movie would be an unconvincing big-budget movie that is not sure if it wants to be a fat joke and a stupid comedy, or just an ordinary action movie without nothing to do. move on. However, as a young generation that just spent two months obsessed with the five seasons of Get Smart, the television show of the 60s, this movie hurt me from the moment I walked in and saw Steve Carell meddling. The background stories, the agent 99 who underwent a plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was previously morbidly obese, embarrass the complexity of the original duo and paint a flat and boring re-evaluation of them. It seems that the writers, unable to be truly entertaining both in the dialogue and in the situation, settled into the bad lines of the famous Don Adams lines, the flashbacks to fat camp, the references to Carell's part in the office in the interview style that the camera angles have. and a female chauvinism that falls flat on its face. <br /> <br /> For those who have seen the original, the writers of this film thought they would include some memories. They mention Herbie, Fang (now a worthless little hairy dog ​​that Carell covets), the shoe phone, the cone of silence, and his classic red car and the doors and the telephone that introduced the show. Classical music is back, but now everything is updated, generally for the worse. Cone of silence is now a strange blue telekinetic force field, the central control offices are right below a museum that preserves Control's past. The film lacks creative random technology, and replaces it with crossbows on Swiss knives. Much of the "humor" in the film is that Carrel hurts himself, or hurts another character, whether Carrel spends two minutes accidentally shooting himself with the crossbow, or being hit by security guards, or throwing up in airplanes. In the original, Smart would insult a great enemy, attack him without success and try to make friends with him before being pulverized. In this, he attacks unsuccessfully and is beaten. It seems that the writers did not understand that humor was established with dialogue and not with violence without meaning. It's as if they took the names of the program and eliminated everything that made it good in the first place. <br /> <br /> The poster hides Carell's face beyond Hathaway's. The movie in the same way, away from anything that can make it good. They intertwine classical music with dramatic action and romantic music in big-budget films. While the original was fueled by a country feel, it replaces quality with massive doses of CGI explosions and sound effects. I really wanted to do this, since I finished the original series only two months ago and it was in my five best shows of all time. However, this was a massive disappointment. The credits say they collaborated with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in all the things I've read on the Internet, they were largely out of the writing process. In conclusion, if you want to spend your money in a cash inflow with little value and without respect to your namesake, do it. But be prepared that the trip is not as you remembered it. <br /> <br /> PS: I almost forgot George Bush's humor. They mention "Nuculor", they fall asleep in art, the president works for his vice president and they appreciate the tricks to solve real problems. If you like to listen to the same jokes you heard 3-4 years ago in the form of a big budget movie, throw your money here.
