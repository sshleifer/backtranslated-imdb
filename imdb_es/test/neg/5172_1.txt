Oh, my God, just what we need is another Essex garbage effort - Cockney that narrates the emergence of the hooligan / gangster delirium of the United Kingdom that, of course, followed West'am (East Londan / Essex style). No one told you they won the world cap !? And then, of course, the inevitable decline in the underworld of the UK's rave culture. Bla bla bla. Why and who would want to finance a movie like this? I do not know, but let's pray that it's from the private financiers (let's see former drug dealers, merchant bankers, we all know what to call them and the rest of the mockneys). instead of means financed with public funds. Let's hope that with the recession we do not see something like that again. If we do, we'll call the death sentence for the British films and, of course, we'll all be able to blame the number one British, the Wannabee mobster, the Mockney Country gentleman, Guy Ritchie.
