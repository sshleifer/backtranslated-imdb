In this film, Gary Oldman plays a defense attorney, who was previously a prosecutor. He's a bit tormented, but he's pretty much playing a normal guy instead of some kind of figurative or literal monster. The funny thing is that he does not succeed. I guess you can not get to normal from there. Kevin Bacon was scary enough. The scene in the park was too long with too many false scares. And the strange sex scene with Oldman and Karen Young seemed to come from a different movie, although the rest of the time Miss Young did it right. This movie suffers from oddities trying to cover up predictability. And failing. Do not bother yourself
