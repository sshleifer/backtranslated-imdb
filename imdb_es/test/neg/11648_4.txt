The plot was not good. <br /> <br /> Special effects were not. <br /> <br /> The performance was ... nothing good. <br /> <br /> I like others, I felt there were numerous holes in the plot where you could fly, well, a space shuttle through. <br /> <br /> I thought the ending was pretty incredible. Guys, about the "blowtorch in space." <br /> <br /> Torches have their own oxygen supply (hence the name "oxy-acetylene torch"). Two hoses come out of the torch: one to an acetylene bottle and another to an oxygen bottle. <br /> <br /> Therefore, a "blowing torch" would work well in space.
