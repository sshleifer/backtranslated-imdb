Boyle Heights, Los Angeles: the legendary South American goat-sucking vampire, El Chupacabra, is on the loose, feeding on anyone unfortunate enough to cross his path. Animal control officer Navarro (Eric Alegria) and the Chupacabra expert / writer Starlina Divide (Elina Madison) try to track the creature, but their progress is hampered by a pair of stupid cops, money hungry locals ready to capture to the beast to get a great reward, and a couple of evil scientists who want the monster for their experiments. <br /> <br /> Stinking more than a two-week taco, The Chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that even incredibly bad horror movie fans might have trouble sitting on. With his terrible script, a horrible direction (not for one, but for two untalented pirouettes, Brennon Jones and Paul Wynne), a laughable dialogue and some of the worst performances on this side of a porn movie, I recommend this movie as much as I do . Drink tap water in Mexico. <br /> <br /> While Navarro and Starlina continue their investigations, the spectators receive an incredibly weak gore, the worst-designed book jacket in history, the most unconvincing dead person I have ever seen. seen from the blinking corpse in Dr. Butcher MD, and a high-tech computerized security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a pole. <br /> <br /> To be fair, for a guy in a rubber suit, the monster itself is pretty spooky (hairy, with big claws and a face like a particularly ugly bat), but its appearances are few and distant from each other, with more screen time dedicated to the tedious tests and tribulations of agent Navarro than in the murderous antics. of the titular creature (how many times it is necessary to see Navarro h And in the paperwork to his lazy boss?). <br /> <br /> If, like me, you make the mistake of spending your hard earned money in this terrible Latin basin (in my case, it was a total of 50p), consider using the disk as a roller coaster for your tequila instead of really seeing it.
