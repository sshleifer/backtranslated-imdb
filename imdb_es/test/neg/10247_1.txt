This image came to movie screens on June 6, 1980, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratton. The image begins with the infinite space of the police looking for the criminals, I suppose. There the ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown spacecraft. Enter Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to discover who the unknown ship belongs to. When they fail, they call Captain Comelius, who orders his crew to defend themselves. Enter the beautiful Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina, which is a robot made by man. A few now thoughts about this photo. This movie was a stupid plan and it's one of the reasons why I do not get into science fiction. If you like science fiction, you may have noticed that the laser sound effects were taken from a science fiction movie called Battlestar Galactica that aired in theaters in 1978. Many of the sounds of the doors you hear in this movie come from another sci-fi movie that aired in 1966 entitled Star Trek. Now for the reason that I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is beautiful in her one piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this image and she should never have been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have also been wasted. Only in the picture I give this movie 1 star weasel and in Dorothy Stratton I give it 10 stars weasel although it did not deserve to be put in a trash movie like this.
