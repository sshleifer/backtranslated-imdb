It's definitely not a good movie, but nowhere as bad as some would paint it. Nightmare in Wax tells the story of a man, after having disfigured his face in a typical flashback scene, to take revenge on those responsible directly and indirectly for the losses in his life, especially the love and companionship of a beautiful young woman actress. Cameron Mitchell plays the artist with his typical style, although limited. Actually, I thought he gave one of his best performances. What does that mean exactly? Mitchell wears an eye patch, smokes cigarettes incessantly, wears a motley tunic and talks about his creations in wax. They are not their ordinary wax mannequins, but people who are still alive, controlled by some serum that makes them lose control of all neurological functions. They become zombies indeed. I thought the premise here was inventive if nothing else. It has a ridiculous explanation, but it serves the plot. This is a movie from the 60s to be safe with psychedelic camera work by Bud Townsend and company. The acting is mediocre, but Mitchell, Scott Brady and Barry Kroeger give interesting turns. The wax figures of the past Hollywood era are very effective and most of the shots in the place were very credible. The end of the film is dissipated in something that is not entirely real, either another example of cultural cinema of the 60s or the end of the screenwriter's creativity. I'm betting on the latter. Despite its many flaws, I enjoyed the movie. The initial scene in which an actor with needles was shown was effectively performed, as was a police pursuit on the coast.
