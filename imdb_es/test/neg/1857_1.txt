When I say worse, I mean less entertaining. Todd Sheets seems to have learned some stupid camera tricks since the last Zombie Bloodbath, which makes the film even less tolerable. In the last film there were no special effects of the camera, where in this, we dealt with an unstable camera and a constant change of black and white. Also, this is called Zombie Bloodbath, despite the fact that the zombies are barely in this one. The film begins in 1945, where some Satanists kill a violent thief and raise him like a scarecrow. In modern times, some children have a problem with the car and go to a house, the same house where the Satanist murder occurred. Some want people to try to rape children (or something like that), and they give back to the scarecrow thief, who comes back with some zombies and now talks like Darth Vader. Mr. Sheets expanded the language and reduced the violence. If you want to see what a bad movie is, look at this! <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 96 minutes Not qualified, it contains violence and language.
