The first time I saw Kindred in 1987 along with another movie called Devouring Waves. I remember that at that time I hated them both and had never bothered to see them again. <br /> <br /> However, recently I have started a crusade to collect so many horror titles from the 80s in their original boxed form, which have been eliminated for some time. I have a pretty proud collection with many more titles on my list. <br /> <br /> The Kindred, although I still do not have a copy, is a priority like all the old movies that I did not like at the time. , Now I am the owner and now I have seen them again and I think they are brilliant and the fragments that I remember of the Kindred are now urging me to want to get a copy as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Hurray for the 80s and long live the horror!
