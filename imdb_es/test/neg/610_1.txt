This program uses a pretty tired comedy formula from the fat blue-collar idiot with the pretty (and sometimes cunning-looking) wife and the crazy (s). With this program, it is the comedian Kevin James, who is a fat and without grace, like Doug Hefferman, who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service. He has a beautiful wife, Carrie (Leah Remini), who works as a paralegal, and a senile father-in-law, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in the basement of his daughter and son-in-law. Doug James, Kevin, is your typical beer drinker, sports lover, who sees television as a steer of a comedy that prefers to watch the subway rather than deal with his marital problems. He also has a couple of idiotic friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by the couple in this program. Beyond the few laughs provided by the character of Jerry Stiller's old fool, this show was generally not fun. The imbecile behavior of Kevin James generally caused the problems of the program that his wife usually solved. This program continued a series of comedies with the fat and stupid father / husband and his beautiful wives who all seemed to be in ABC for some reason.
