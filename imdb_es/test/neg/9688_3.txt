I just wanted to say that I was very disappointed to see this movie! I expected a biblical story visualized with a great special fx, etc., but during the film I discovered that this was an absolute disaster ... it was not biblical at all ... only the boat and the animals were similar to the stories ... If you want a visual 'translation' of the biblical version of Noah, DO NOT go see this movie!
