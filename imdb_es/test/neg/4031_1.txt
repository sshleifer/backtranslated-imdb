This was so poor that I had to turn it off at the end. I've never seen such a pathetic movie. I love B movies and I expected more of the same, but unfortunately I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> This has the worst performance / argument / direction / writing, etc ... of anything I've seen seen in my life! <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone thinking or seeing / buying / renting, do not go there!
