I LOVE Sandra Bullock, she is one of my favorite actresses of all time, but this is a movie that I should have paid a long time ago to be canned. I realize that she is almost 20 years old, but my dead grandmother can act better than these people. Beware, it's not even worth the $ 5.50 WalMart support ... You know when the performance sucks so much that it's not worth a couple of dollars, the sound quality is horrible, there are no subtitles to hear the horrible dialogue. and it looks like it was filmed with a budget of $ 1.98. I thought I would like to see Sandra in a first role to see how she evolved as an actress, but YIKES is a word too friendly to use ...
