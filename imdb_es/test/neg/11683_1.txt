OK, this movie was not good at all. Video games are not something that I would boast about if I was more than 15 years old. Great to play, but writing a comment about video game players may like you for this movie, it's weird. Just play a video game, do not invent a sorry story about getting stuck in one. I use my cell phone, I hope not to lose my girlfriend in that. That fat is the worst of all? Granted, Grease has a very well thought story as well as being a musical. Even if you do not like musicals, anyone would say that Grease is good. My brother plays video games all the time and he saw it 30 minutes and he left because it was so horrible. I feel numb.
