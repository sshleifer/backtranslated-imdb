Oy vey ... Jurrasic Park was made of Corman. As usual, the plot is thin as a wafer, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave larger prints than they are, to inexplicable science that uses lasers to keep dinosaurs and bird trucks at bay of farmyard that have loose chickens in cages big enough for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks that are all in cages the size of shoe boxes). And everything that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a movie. All male actors are imbeciles (think that a gray could be loose in the desert, constantly releasing objects for the raptor to be easy to kill) and all the female actors seem to have come out of a Hollywood Fredrick photo shoot. The raptor in itself is the worst since the Hobgoblins (from the film of the same name), it seems that they had a puppet hand version and a plastic model for the shots in "movement". If you want a good movie to sit and annoy the MST3K style, this is gold. If you want to make a competent film and act well ... do not watch a Roger Corman movie. The performance gets a 4 out of 10, some of the players in this stage tried it. The story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storyteller session that has gone bad. Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
