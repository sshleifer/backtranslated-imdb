Why is it that Instant Noodles are not instant? This was the disconcerting problem that I put in the lap of the angry Sherpa; he replied angrily that the noodles were not his bag, I also answered "What bag?" He seemed more perplexed. <br /> <br /> Some of you may be wondering why the Sherpa has only one lower appendix. <br /> <br /> The Sherpa, whom we will call Sherpa 5, for data protection reasons, injured the toe. "How!?!" I hear them asking, I will continue, as we have learned from the review of Donkey Punch (2002) Irene through sly slides and winks, etc. I tried in vain to teach the little peculiarities of the ladies to all the angry Sherpas. Sherpa 5, known only for its violent defeats against democratic principles during the postrevolutionary years of the current United States of America and its consequent effect on the mind of its population in the postmodern empire that exists now, through the invasions of the countries Smaller than him, he let himself be carried away by a river of violence due to his lack of understanding of the ladies. According to an eyewitness, he threw himself like an irresponsible banjo string in Mardi gras wielding a stick with a nail through it, after the fight that followed 5 flames, each lost his left testes, 3 Sherpas were discovered spooning under a currant. Bush and Sherpa 5 nailed the nail in the big toe. <br /> <br /> The Sherpa lifestyle is as modest as that of the nuns, with only rudimentary health care facilities at 15,000 feet above sea level. Consequently, when the first aid cabin was opened, only one IOU was found for an unwanted mail can, and some crotchless panties were found. Sherpa 5 jumped like a darkness on a rope in agony, until Irene exploded like a rooster in a chicken coop and suggested that she soak her illness in flame saliva. Sherpa 5 accepted the procedure, to sedate him, there was a Glenfiditch bottle of 100 years, some say he was left by an angry Scot, who is believed to be an ancestor of the angry Sherpas. Once under the influence, the toe was bathed until it cradled, dressed with Irenes diaphragm a little dirty and some blue tack. Some of you may feel that this procedure would do no good to the Sherpa and you would be fully vindicated for maintaining that opinion. Only four days later, the gangrene placed it and a week later, the leg was removed by the use of even tighter elastic bands.
