A group of friends discover gold inside an old mine. But by taking the gold and thinking that they have hit it big, they wake up a dead miner long ago who is very focused on protecting his treasure. "The Massacre of Miner" is a bdint horror movie in the extreme. You have all your family clich√©s, your group of adolescents with intellectual disabilities, characters who go on their own to investigate strange noises, some tremors, the mysterious sheriff, the old woman who everyone thinks is crazy (played above) thought Karen Black nothing less, and so on. However, it is done in a fun and non-pretentious way that makes the film entertaining without thinking in a "so bad, it's good" way. The characters and the dialogue are what you would expect from this kind of family movie, routine and not original. However, all the actors do a decent job, considering that I've actually seen bigger budget movies of their type with worse acting (I know what you did last summer, anyone?) And adds a bit of credibility to the movie in yes. The villain in this film (The 49'er) obviously derives from the creeper of Jeepers Creepers, up to the brown coat, the hat and the long white hair. Like the creeper, he never speaks, and is very ugly to pluck. The gore is somewhat disappointing in my opinion. There are a couple of pretty gruesome moments, but too far off the screen and the scenes of death are often ridiculous (Spoiler ahead!). There is a truly hilarious moment in which a villain beheads a girl, and to achieve this "effect", the filmmakers hid the body of the actress under the villain's coat, with his head poking and putting some fake blood on his neck . Seriously, you could see the outline of his shoulders! I think they could have done a little better there, even if the budget was low (and I'm sure it was, but still?). Special effects are cheap but effective enough and, for the most part, moderately well done for a low budget movie. Either the effects guys or the director seem to have a thing for explosions and fire. Almost all the scenes towards the end of the film have at least a couple of characters being burned to death (always filmed in slow motion) or SOMETHING that explodes, be it a car or an old mine cave. Seriously, nobody has heard the term; "Stop, drop and roll"!?!?!? <br /> <br /> <br /> "Miners' Massacre" (or "The Forty-Nine Curse", whatever you want to call it) is cheesy and silly, though entertaining, and as long as you do not have expectations through the roof, you'll be sufficiently entertained. <br /> <br /> I feel generous, so I will give you a 4/10.
