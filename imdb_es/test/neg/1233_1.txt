I just saw Lonesome Dove, Return to Lonesome Dove, Streets Of Laredo and Dead Man's Walk. Everything excellent This unfortunate piece of scrap is done cheaply and has a bad performance. <br /> <br /> In the previous series, Captain Call and Gus McCrae distinguish themselves as respectable cowboys. Despite the fact that Caption Call is played by a different actor every time I win quickly. In Dead Man's Walk, children are credible as the younger versions of the experienced Texas Rangers. In Comanche Moon they are just a couple of thick rednecks. I had to stop seeing. <br /> <br /> I suspect that many of the enthusiastic reviews of this program were written by the people who made this stinking pile. It's a sad end to a great franchise.
