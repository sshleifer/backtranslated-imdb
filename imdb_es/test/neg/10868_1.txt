That's what I was wondering while watching this movie. I mean, the amount of nudity and sex was one thing, but another part of the movie that gave its genre to the adult industry was its lack of history. I really just wanted to get up and leave throughout the movie, but I persisted. I persisted in the hope that maybe the story would improve, that there might be a good turn at the end. However, I could not have been more wrong. In the end I persisted because I thought I could write a bad review if I had seen it after having seen it. <br /> <br /> I mean, do not get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with beautiful, attractive and vibrant women, but when the director just shows that along with a shitty story, thinking that's what the viewer wants see, He insults us all. To think that we are all so superficial that we only want to see burlesques of great players in the film industry is absurd. My advice: hire a different movie.
