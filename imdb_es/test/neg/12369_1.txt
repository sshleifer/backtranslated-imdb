San Franpyscho: 1 out of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But his budget is non-existent, his camera crew is old and his stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges of Different Strokes. There are probably ways to extract at least one visible movie. The Quiroz brothers have no idea. <br /> <br /> First of all, a lot of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like actors of the Oscar caliber. How difficult is it to play a priest or a dominant mother? Certainly, a city the size of San Francisco has some professional actors willing to work for a few dollars and a screen credit. Clearly, Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger, who play these roles, have other talents, as landscaper or waitress, they should be about to tune. <br /> <br /> Joe Rosete as the murderer (yes, the serial killer is simply known as "The murderer" "It is also quite horrible in a mentally ill method, but I am almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt since his character is written with zero style or personality, a boring almost laughable serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the Quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as a Family ABC's movie of the week There are no nudity or violence to speak of and the R rating is clearly for the adult style rhythm This movement meanders like an 85 year old woman driving with wrapped sunglasses and her signal The only occasional horror comes from illuminating Est√©vez's face with a glow that makes it look like his lower jaw has been removed. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a great movie when I rented San Franpy scho but I did not expect Mind the numbness of boredom either.
