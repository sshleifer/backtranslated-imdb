The word honor must be erased from the vocabularies of all nations. It aggravates male stupidity and is responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent people. Anyone who does not agree should not continue reading this comment. <br /> <br /> As you can expect from these writers, Yakuza is an exciting thriller and crime film with a lot of respect for the ethnicity it is in. Acted The friends of blood and violence will not be disappointed either, but especially towards the end, the violence becomes somewhat useless, redundant and completely foolish. Contrary to other criticisms, Robert Mitchum's performance is not very good. This is an actor that definitely did not improve with age. He looks like a tired janitor (he does not do very well with the part), and his air of detachment that made him so impressive on screen in previous years manifests as confusion or lack of interest. Ken Takakura and Richard Jordan are very good as men of honor and young, intelligent and with feelings of thugs respectively. <br /> <br /> The best way to handle this movie is to see it as a tragic comedy. Things get moving when the character of Mitchum asks Takakura's character for a favor based on wrong assumptions. The error becomes evident quickly, but the sense of honor demands that they should not retreat. So they begin to hide, shooting in all directions, wielding swords and destroying the artistic apartment of their friends (although the man begs them "enough, please" during the whole fight). The bodies begin to accumulate and the story ends with Mitchum's. character making his point: if YOU GIVE him the little finger, I will give you the MINE. Well, it's the least you can do, is it? So he takes out a knife, breathes with resignation and begins to cut that limb (out of the frame, luckily). It was a moment that probably should have been solemn. It just made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The use of places is very good in this movie. I particularly liked the scenes filmed in and around the international conference room on Lake Takaragaike, an interesting futuristic building by architect Sachio Otani (the Kyoto Protocol was signed). For me, the presentation of the architecture seems better here than in the most recent Sydney Pollack documentary, Sketches of Frank O. Gehry which is about architecture and nothing else.
