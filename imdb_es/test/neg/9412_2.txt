I entered this film decided to like. Usually, I enjoy dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc. I entered this movie thinking that it would be on the edge of my seat. Also, I'm a big fan of Pacino. <br /> <br /> What a piece of garbage. Possibly the worst movie I've seen in five years. This makes the Pacino debacle on any Sunday look really good. First, half of the movie is watching Matthew McConaughey lift weights. Ok, we understand. You're in mate form. We do not need to see all the other scenes with you pumping iron, shirtless. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how many holes of the plot are there in this movie? Why present the phone call from Brandon's lost father and not return to her? What was the point of his mom hanging him? Why does she even call you to tell you that she is sending you too much money? What was the point of that? The boy from Puerto Rico who lost 30 million? Also, since sports betting is illegal in New York and is recognized as illegal, how can you guarantee everyone's bet at the end? <br /> <br /> This was just a very badly written script. It had potential, but lacked a coherent plot. I thought that Pacino learned his lesson about script selection after Any Given Sunday, but apparently not. My God, this is the same actor that the Godfather starred in! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money.
