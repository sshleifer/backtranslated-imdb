Hungary can not make good movies. Fact. This is a great example of that. <br /> <br /> First of all, the term "argument" does not exist in this movie. It is very weak. Even though many people would argue with me about that. Sure, it's a taboo, but that's it. There are endless possibilities, which could have been really great, if they were used, but they almost skipped everything. I think the whole movie is just an excuse to show images, which are the only decent things in this whole heap of horror. <br /> <br /> The acting is just shit. There are not many lines, so you would think that the actors have great facial expressions or mimics, but no. In fact, 86% of the time, they stink. And that's when they do not say anything. If they say a single word, you will begin to bow your head and say, "That is not realistic." But that again, this is partly the fault of the writing. There is also no emotion in most dialogues. <br /> <br /> The editing is sometimes fine, but most of the time it is illogical and the whole image gets worse. I could have given an emotional boost, but it seems that the editing here is about making cuts to each other. <br /> <br /> Someone, please, explain it to me, why critics say that this movie is a masterpiece. Calling this an "Art" will not make it better. I'm sorry, Mundruczo, but you failed. Live with it. Even though you probably will not mind if my opinion or that of any other kind scares your "son".
