I went to this movie with a little fear; The original is a masterpiece of both writing and acting and, unfortunately, my fears came true. This is a work without humor and I sat in the theater hoping that the wit and humor began. It seems I'm still waiting. The updating of the plot to the current time simply did not work and the alteration of the characters was an absolute farce. Why did they introduce the character of Bette Midler when she disappeared as fast as she arrived? The related character in the original 1939 was an integral part of the plot. The women in the movies laughed a few times, but nothing moved me as funny, with the exception of a quote from Meg Ryan who talked to her mother about her situation and told her "it's not like a 1930s movie" . Seeing the 1930 version. It was very delicate, "sisters come together" and I really need some acerbic wit and an intelligent dialogue of the original work. I still watch the original movie and buy a line I had never caught before. There is no sense of closure for this new version, and although the 1939 film is politically incorrect by today's standards, every thread was tied and when the movie was over, it did so with great force. This remake must be labeled with a warning for all the spectators: if you know the original, do not get upset: I felt cheated when I lost part of my life in a movie theater watching this piece of fluff not memorable. Bring in the red jungle!
