The Man (Gaston Modot) and Young Girl (Lya Lys) go through the movie consumed by mutual passion. They long to be together, but their moments together are constantly interrupted. The film is full of images and stops after an hour ......... do lovers find happiness ...? ... <br /> <br /> The film starts interestingly with images of scorpions, but soon you realize that everything is a meaningless pretext. It is made like a silent movie with occasional dialogues and has a continuous soundtrack that at one moment is so irritating that it will lower the sound and want to see it as a silent movie. The continuous drum rolls must have driven the cinema crowd mad. There are some genuinely funny moments, for example, when the man kicks a dog and when he hits a blind man. Unfortunately, this humor is carried out in the name of art, so it is just a pseudo absurdity. The movie is crap.
