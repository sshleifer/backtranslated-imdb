There is a lot of evil with this movie. It can be said that making a sequel to "Halloween" was a bad idea in the first place, and we should feel fortunate that previous entries, even at their lowest point, can still be seen. But still, "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers", even today, is so bad, shocking. Poor making movies at its worst, in fact. There is so much guilt about going around. But where to start? On what shoulders does this guilt rest? <br /> <br /> Was the directorial style on substance of director Joe Chapelle? Well, at least, the sixth installment is fresh on the visual front. And as for the visual effects, you can see Michael kill in pretty gruesome ways, even if it does not fit the overall tone of the series. <br /> <br /> So, could Daniel Ferrands. Can writing with problems be the culprit? Well, to be fair, he did the best he could. When you get to the sixth in any series, you're running out of places to go. Finding a rhyme for Michael's reason is not a bad concept but it is uninteresting, especially the way it is handled here. And it really does not help that the film has been cut into pieces and sewn up again so many times that the story has been completely lost towards the end. <br /> <br /> Maybe Dimension / Miramax could have ruined the whole thing. After all, this was the first studio movie in the "Halloween" series and we all know what happens when many chefs enter the kitchen. Heck, look at the incredible minimums that dragged "Hellraiser" to? I guess it's all the fault, because apart from the actors and the visual effects, it seems that nobody tries to offer a decent movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that no matter how you cut it, cut it, cut it or electrocute it until it blows up, "Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers" was never a good movie. Marking a historical minimum for the series that almost killed any credibility for Michael Myers, "Damn" is just that: damn. The angle of the spine was never interesting, nor probably expanded. The unnecessary gore is so out of place and replaces the tension that is the trademark of the name "Halloween". Towards the end, the movie stops making sense, stops trying to force a plot and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and finish the movie before you miss anything else. It is sad that the final performance of Donald Pleasence is immortalized in this film, even if the man did the best he could in the worst possible conditions. And for the most part, there are other strong cast members in this movie. Paul Rudd plays the strange and antisocial adult Tommy Doyle quite naturally, while Marianne Hagan does a good job of portraying the friendly female protagonist. On the other side of the coin, the cast of Jamie Lloyd was a shame, and thank God, Devin Gardner no longer makes movies. As the child in the movie is chased by the "Man in Black", Danny is the anti-Jamie in the sense that he is annoying, plaintive and absolutely amazing in his role. It's sad when you can not even feel sympathy for a child in a horror movie. But I guess that's "Halloween 6" in a few words. Essentially, this is the anti-"Halloween", created by a director who did not know what he was doing and a studio that had its own agenda. Hell, even music is bad. Many will try to paint this as the avant-garde "Halloween" because of its touch of science fiction, but in reality, it's just stupid. With the exception of some good visuals and decent characters, "The Curse Of Michael Myers" is as bad as possible. And this comes from a fan!
