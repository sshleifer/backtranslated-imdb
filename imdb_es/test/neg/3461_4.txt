This is definitely a DVD rental movie. I'm a big fan of the cast members, but the story never got me. Do not expect "Oh brother where you are" in no way or form. The funniest part in my opinion is when the war hero explains what happens in argon. It seems they were trying to copy some of Clooney's funny facial expressions of "Oh brother, where are you", but you could say they were trying that. John Krasinski was the bright spot and he was solid at all times. Renee Zellweger plays the role of an enthusiastic reporter willing to do anything for the story. In general it is a movie that is worth watching at home.
