Eddie Fischer was simply bad. Possibly the worst scene came early in the film when it burst into a spontaneous song and a dance number centered around a piano and some conveniently located employees. The song was totally stupid ... I think I could offer some lines on a sheet of paper that would exceed it and probably win a Grammy. Then, as if the writers could not find a better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene, Fischer says something like "Do not say (insert the boy's name.) He does not like music" and smiles. . I can not describe how bad this is, I felt a little embarrassed. And that girl Debbie Reynolds works with and who is always hitting her is also very annoying. I can not even imagine someone like her wasting a fraction of time on him. The jokes were delivered without any chemistry between the characters that made the film crawl. At least the baby had nice hair. The two stars are for Reynolds, who was like a swan among ugly ducklings. <br /> <br /> See the single mother instead.
