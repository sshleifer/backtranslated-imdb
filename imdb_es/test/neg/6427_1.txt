Wow, what a bad movie. It does not frighten in the least, and barely understandable. The plot is not held together, and the performance is absolutely atrocious. What is that line of a famous critic? "She goes through the emotional range from A to B." Yep. That sums it up. It's not even good for camping value! I did not expect Oscar material, but this? And God, is your friend a ghost? You should have the IQ of a particularly stupid mollusc to not see what's coming. <br /> <br /> This movie (and I use that word lightly) is an insult to the audience that goes to the movies. If only someone involved with him knew how to chain narrative! This gets 1 out of 10, simply because there is nothing lower. On the positive side, at least they do not last two hours.
