I bought this movie at a garage sale when I was about 15 years old. I hated her then, and seeing her again, just from hell, is even worse now. You can hear the director and the cameraman in the background screaming commands like "Zoom, zoom, zoom!". There are no special effects, just a piece of raw meat that is supposed to be a brain. This is total shit, and originally I thought it was a unique home movie or something I bought. But this was distributed elsewhere and it is really strange to know that other people have seen it. Wow, I need 10 lines ... well ... this can be an interesting thing to see to see how movies were made without a budget before the invention of digital cameras. This sucks. Actually, yes, look at this just to see if you can sit down with the worst. If you can do it through this, you can do it through anything.
