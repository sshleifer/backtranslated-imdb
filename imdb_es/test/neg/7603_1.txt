Unfortunately, this is not one of those movies that at least make you laugh at his incredible stupidity. It has no entertainment value at all. It just sucks. I do not know where to begin to explain how much this film bothered me. I think what the cake really takes away is the unbearable soundtrack. It seems that someone took a simple rhythm and then, during the rest, let a 5-year-old boy go crazy with a synthesizer and record it. It's really so horrible and as if that was not enough, there is not a scene in the movie without "music" (= noise). At the end of the movie, you are deaf or have already cut your ears before. Which at least would prevent you from falling asleep, since there is nothing that happens in the movie to keep your attention. Just a lot of bad acting, some cheap and unconvincing murders, no history at all (just jump from one scene to another and you, as a spectator, can try to make sense of it) and in the last 30 minutes or so you can witness of some of the worst "special effects" in history. It is extremely boring. Do not watch this movie! You could do something much more entertaining like looking at a wall or reading the phone book. Did I mention how much the soundtrack stunk?
