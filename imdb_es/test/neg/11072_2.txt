What a surprise. For starters, I could not stand the constant screaming and the loud panic all the time. It did not scare me, it horrified me, nor did it make me sympathize with the characters; It was just annoying. The sudden movements of the camera were also annoying. The plot was equal to almost any other cheap horror. There were some pathetic attempts to give depth to the characters, but it really did not work in the rest of the plot. And then there is the end. I'm still not really sure what to do with that. I guess it was supposed to be a smart turn, and then shed some light on the situation, but it was stupid. <br /> <br /> The case had a couple of those little prize winners / nomination symbols, so I thought it could not be that bad. I was wrong. If you see it, you should probably leave it on the shelf.
