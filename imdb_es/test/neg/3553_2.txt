I had high hopes for this after reading the previous reviews, but it was so slow and the plot was so basic that I wondered if I had read the wrong reviews. <br /> <br /> Please, a guy meets a girl next door at 11 and they both aspire to love and be basketball legends. Separate yourself, but see how others progress. Guess what! Both get scholarships for the same university and become lovers again until their father is caught playing with a younger woman. Our young hero, unable to cope, has lost concentration in the court, but somehow he decides to go for and leave the studies, and guess what the Lakers are collecting. He abandons heroin because she was not there for him during this emotional period. So for 5 years they follow their own path. She returns from Spain after having lost enthusiasm for the game and our hero is getting married in two weeks. Mom tells him that he should fight for his love, so he professes his continuous love and challenges him to a basketball shooting. He wins, he marries, she wins, he loves her. Well he won, but he decides to leave another girl for our girl. The End has her playing basketball and he has baby duties. I'm sorry 2 is my highest score. My partner scored 0 for a soapy story for those who read Mills and Boon
