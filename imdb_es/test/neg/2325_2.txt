Most of the comments on this film are positive, so I thought I would try to correct the balance. I left this movie wondering what was going on. Now I know it and I still consider it a bad movie. Initially I discarded a sequence of dreams because it seemed too obvious. I was glad to have a free ticket for the movie or I would have asked for my money back. Film critics and critics love this movie, which only confirms that most of them would prefer to sound smarter than to review how an audience can enjoy a movie. The rating of 8+ that this movie has is so deceptive. In 20 years, this movie will not be compared to real greats like The Godfather. The film has good performances from both drivers, but that's not enough to save the movie. (Neither do the lesbian scenes!)
