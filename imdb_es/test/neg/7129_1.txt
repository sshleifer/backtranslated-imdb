Do not waste your time or money on going to see it or even rent it. It is by far the worst movement I have ever seen. Your two hours (too much time) of your life will never come back. If you are looking for fear, go see something else. We went with someone who still has nightmares about the Gremlins and she was not scared in the least. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that make this movie an incredibly poor attempt to make money. Now, before we begin, let me tell you that I loved the first Grudge! However, the second is a somewhat different story. The plot is very deep and complex. However, in the end you're wondering "what the heck was this or all". The acting would be considered poor in a pornography film from the list B. I could locate several examples, but I do not want to spoil it for those who are buttocks for punishment, but I can sum up two horrible hours in two simple words ... it is spreading.
