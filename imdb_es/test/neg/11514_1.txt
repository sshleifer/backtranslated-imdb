This film is about 3 stories together that revolve around 3 separate people. One of the worst movies available and even better if it is not available. <br /> <br /> The Good: 2 beautiful lesbians actress 1 real and moving story about Theresa Chan <br /> <br /> The Bad: The main story that revolves around the blind and beloved woman, Theresa Chan , it does not need to be told in film format and more appropriate in documentary format. There is no link between the 3 lines of the story. MINIMUM DIALOGUE in the movie, replaced by SMS and CHAT programs on PC. There is no cultural vision of the film and it makes you forget even before leaving the cinema.
