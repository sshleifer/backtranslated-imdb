Launched at a time when Duvivier was again in force. "Black Jack", which was between the extraordinary "Au Royaume des Cieux" and the dazzling "Sous Le Ciel de Paris", is a jumble that Duvivier himself hated, which is not surprising. There is almost nothing to write about this problem. We can notice that: <br /> <br /> 1. Orson Welles used to admire Duvivier. This may explain why the Wellesian actors appeared in the films of Duvivier: Joseph Cotten in "Lydia" (1941), and here an Agnes Moorehead totally wasted. It's the first time <br /> <br /> I have not enjoyed Moorehead's performance! On the other hand, Welles borrowed his Desdemona (Suzanne Cloutier) from "Au Royaume des Cieux" by Duvivier for his "Othello". <br /> <br /> 2. In any Duvivier movie, there are one or two sequences that are worthwhile and this is no exception: the search in the caves where Duvivier feels The mystery works wonderfully (for a short time ), then the pursuit when Dalio is caught in the fishing nets. The touch of the Divivier can also be felt in the sad end. <br /> <br /> As for the rest, as the reign of my dear friend by correspondence writes, it is a black joke.
