I really wanted to like this movie. The second movie of the series had this nonsense, I manage the movie sensation that was funny (of course, I was also drunk). I saw this movie with the highest expectation of a similar experience of great cinematic hilarity, a-la-Mystery Science Theater 3000. I was wrong !!!!! This movie is a terrible waste of film, AND I LIKED THE SECOND !! From the effeminate villain with David Bowie's hideous wig, to the obnoxious, sticky female villains with laughter that could remove paint from a garage door, all this was just a painful mess. In fact, I felt bad for Sue Price, because the material was under an actress of her stature (that says it all). A horrible, horrible movie (that's not a recommendation).
