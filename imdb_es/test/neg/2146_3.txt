After a little more than 50 years of avid movie viewing, I have come up with some simple rules for making good movies. <br /> <br /> 1. Introduce your main characters early, certainly within the first half hour 2. Keep your characters to a minimum. If you adapt a novel, combine the characteristics and actions of the minor characters <br /> <br /> into one person 3. Make sure that the actions of your characters have credibility; if necessary, create additional scenes to establish motivation 4. Keep the action clear. Violence does not have to be explicit, but neither should it be confusing. 5. Get the best music that money can buy. Often, it is more important than acting, photography, etc. 6. Usually, if a movie is not very good in the first 10 minutes, it will not get better <br /> <br /> 'Cannon for Cordoba' is a textbook example of what happens when you do not Follow these simple rules. Elmer Bernstein's score is rinkydink, one of the worst I've heard in a movie on a modest budget. This is quite surprising considering Bernstein's credentials ("The Man with the Golden Arm", "The Magnificent Seven", "The Great Escape", "Children of Katie Elder"). The address of Paul Wendkos is mediocre and confusing. The performances vary from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to terrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Ralli, Gabriele Tinti) with the generally reliable George Peppard falling somewhere in the middle. This should not be surprising, considering the mediocre direction and the amateur script, which breaks rules 1, 2 and 3. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time. I give 'Cannon for Cordoba' a '3'.
