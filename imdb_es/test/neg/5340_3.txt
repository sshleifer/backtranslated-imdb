Well, it's a quickie of Monogram from the dreaded period of the 40s, when the studies of the poverty line published many "horror" movies that are almost unimaginably boring ... So I expected the worst. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a doctor who has been working on a way to bring the dead back to life by using a room full of non-utilitarian electrical devices that light up perfectly. There is a dog heart hanging under a bell jar and it twists irregularly, what we are informed is proof that your method is perfected. <br /> <br /> A brief discussion of the metaphysical implications and the mention of an important plot point precede the inevitable death of a young man who is revived in a rather non-dramatic, not dramatic sequence even with sparks. The important point of the plot is that a convicted murderer is being executed just at midnight, which turns out to be exactly when the young man is revived. It is not surprising that the young man is very different after his experience; Apparently amnesiac and with a strange desire to visit the places of the underworld and get acquainted with certain gang members ... <br /> <br /> It is difficult to explain why all this is not completely impossible to identify, but perhaps it is enough to say that It is slightly interesting and contains several murders and a couple of interesting characters. Towards the end, it even begins to move along with some real tension and a confrontation that is frankly Hitchcockian. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to warn of a very, very bad end. A labeling in unnecessary, pain in the end of the ass sorta. After the plot is solved quite effectively ... <br /> <br /> You know the kind of things ... Everything is a dream. It never happened.
