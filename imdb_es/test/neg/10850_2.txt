Rigoletto is Verdi's masterpiece, full of drama, emotion and powerful and memorable music. The master had to shoot in his grave when this parody of his work was published with his unnecessary frontal nudity and his cheap copulation and his naive portrait, but Gilda was highlighted as a horny ditz. Undoubtedly, the opera can be adapted to the cinema (look at the magnificent La Traviata by Zeferelli), but when a work is as magnificent as Rigoletto, it does not need cheap tricks. It might even have been acceptable if the dubbing in the music had been good, but it is a mediocre interpretation of the libretto with a second-level sound quality.
