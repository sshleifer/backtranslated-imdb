Johnnie (Bert Wheeler) is a possible composer; Newton (Robert Woolsey) is a possible inventor. Both work in a cigar stand in the lobby of an office building. Johnnie wants to sell a song to Winfield Lake, a song editor who also owns the building. Lake's secretary, Mary (Betty Grable), is Johnnie's girlfriend. When Lake appears dead, circumstances conspire to make Mary and Newton think Johnnie is the killer. They conspire again to implicate Mary, who goes to jail. But who really shot Lake? Who is the Black Widow, the blackmailer who had threatened him? The other characters in this mysterious murder are: Lake's suspicious wife, a self-satisfied private detective, a seemingly slow janitor (Willie Best), Lake's auditor, a composer who believes Lake is stealing from him and another who believes that all are stealing from him It is up to Newton and his truth machine to reveal the true murderer. <br /> <br /> Wheeler with baby voice and Woolsey sucking cigars seems like an arbitrary couple, but they made several movies together in the 30s and some of them were fun. <br /> <br /> Not this one. George Stevens, who had a distinguished career, directed this depressing comedy with a plot of tedious, mysterious murder. But two scenes are good, and both present Wheeler and Betty Grable singing the excellent "Music in my Heart," written by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh. The first time, they sing it by climbing a ladder (after which they dance down). Later, Wheeler and Woolsey are on stilts to see and talk to Mary, who is in a cell on a high floor. Wheeler and Grable sing to each other through the bars. <br /> <br /> "The Nitwits" laughs, but the level of comedy is best illustrated by the Woolsey line: "Sonny, you have the brain of a six-year-old boy, and I bet even he was happy to get rid of him. " It is diluted Groucho who did not use the superfluous "pair" when he said it.
