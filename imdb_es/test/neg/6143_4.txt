Fingerprints we can find ... " <br /> <br /> Yes! Exactly how the real professionals would talk to each other if there was not a completely uninformed and stupid audience. <br /> <br /> However, not everything about this show is bad. Some stories work to a certain extent, and the colors are really beautiful. They use red, blue, green, yellow ... all the colors that I have loved since kindergarten.
