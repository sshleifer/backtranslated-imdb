This must be classified as one of the biggest debacles in cinema. At that time, I was wandering around Europe and had the misfortune to trip over the team that was making this film in what was, even then, one of the idyllic and intact environments of the world. I joined as an extra, and what followed was an exposition of the current perversity. Forget all the accusations I have heard about the intrusions of Peter Mayall in this rare piece of French life: Geoff Reeve and his companions embarked on a level of revelry in the restaurant of Les Beaux that left the Maitre with his mouth open for the incredulity. They were, simply, terrible, uneducated and unworthy of French hospitality.
