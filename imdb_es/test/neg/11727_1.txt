It was badly thrown. It seems an urgent job, the last minute casting is obvious. The writing is very weak. Good for the stage, not for the cinema. I feel bad for Andrew McCarthy. He is a very good actor who has not had good roles lately. This role was not for him. Maybe I'm glad he was picked up yet. In the circuit of the festival this film will be maintained.
