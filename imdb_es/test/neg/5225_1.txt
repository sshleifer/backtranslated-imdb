I gave this movie a rating of 1 because it is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. This film was made in 2003 and I have seen films made in the 60s with better special effects. I wish I could go into details, but the words can not describe how horrible this movie was. I could have done better with a home video camera and $ 20! I pray that Chuck Norris will never make a movie again. Now, if you think I'm downloading this movie because it has a Christian theme, you're wrong. I like the fact that IL 'Chuck decided to make a movie that would at least try to make God look good, but why would he make poor viewers like me suffer through such a horrible movie? This whole movie can be summed up in 3 words: RE DAMN DICULOUS.
