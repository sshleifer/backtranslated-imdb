It may have been exciting for an audience in 1946, but the movie is now a bit boring. It was very difficult for me to review everything, and it was very predictable: that is, we know from the beginning of the film that Welles is the Nazi war criminal, and I will give him an idea of ​​whether he is properly trapped and punished in the end. <br /> <br /> It's not worth seeing. It is sad that Welles has made three films that are worth seeing in his long career: Kane, Ambersons and A Touch of Evil.
