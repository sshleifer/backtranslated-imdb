What's wrong with this movie? Does Mr. Lyne and his writers think that a sadomasochistic adventure between two fucking Yuppies can lead a feature film? Maybe if I had some comic elements (which is not, at least intentionally), or if there were some additional dramatic elements (that are not there), or maybe it was something hard. No, it is simply the history of the matter; A chronology of a lot of dating R-Ho-hum rating, who cares? "Nine and a half weeks" deserves every nomination of the Razzie he got. He is a loser. <br /> <br /> And, by the way, what about Roger Ebert and his excellent criticism? Where was your head in 1986?
