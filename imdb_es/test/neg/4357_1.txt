Killjoy 2 beats the first movie by just a little bit. What improved here was the performance, Killjoy's makeup and history. This is more like a gore festival, it does not have supernatural elements like the first. In this installment, Killjoy kills his victims in more normal ways, does not set them on fire and does not shoot them with bullets in his mouth. The only thing I did not like about this movie was that the ending was a bit half-hearted, in fact, it was half-hearted, they killed Killjoy in a very cheap way. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes horror movies. Seriously, the first movie was good, but the second is better. 10
