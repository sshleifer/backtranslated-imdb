What was I thinking when I rented this one? What did the distributor think when he copied the tape and sent it to Holland? That someone really wanted to see this shit?!? <br /> <br /> It's about some astronauts getting into trouble in outer space (flashback of Apollo 13, but never in the shadow of this good movie) and they want to go home If you act in a movie of This guy, you should be happy that you will get away from Earth as far as possible! <br /> <br /> This one wants to navigate in the small wave of space films of 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere. Deep Impact and Armageddon were not perfect either (far from it), but at least they were worth seeing once (and maybe once again, when we're all old). They had a little fun. Max Q does not do it. It gives irritation. Well well. It's a television movie, but does that mean you can create a disaster like that? <br /> <br /> If you have not drowned with your own vomit at the end (for all the cheap drama and no dialogue value) you must have been bored to death with this waste of time. <br /> <br /> It gets worse when the space shuttle lands ... No, I can not mess up 'This (the IMDb guidelines forbid). So you have to see for yourself. DO NOT! DO NOT SEE IT (sorry), but rent a movie worth renting (like Battlefield Earth ... just kidding!) <br /> <br /> Probably the worst I've ever seen.
