I am rarely motivated to write a review unless I am inspired by the quality of the film. In the case of Comanche Moon, I was so uninspired that I felt the need to warn others of how bad this mini TV series is. Here are some thoughts. <br /> <br /> The Indians: They found themselves as if they were in a Saturday Night Live play, mocking how the Indians speak. When McMurtry writes a dialogue in his novels, it reads so interesting; I'm not sure how they ended up with what they got. <br /> <br /> Gus McCrae: It looks like Festus from the old Gunsmoke series. Acting is fine and Robert Duvall's McCrae manners are correct, but his appearance is pure cowboy comedy. <br /> <br /> Clara: Maybe you can use a little sweat or sweat next time. Have you ever been to Austin in the summer before air conditioning? I promise you that women would not look like this. Do you think they never saw any episode of Dearwood? <br /> <br /> Gov. Elisha Pease: Once again, when they are in the Governor's office, it feels like a live play on Saturday night, and the sketch is a bombing. <br /> <br /> Woodrow Call: Call is the most reasonable character, of course, he talks very little. How can you ruin that? But hey, what's with that hat? <br /> <br /> Blue Duck: see above and include the fact that it is not even a little scary. They should have gotten Javier Bardem to play the role. <br /> <br /> The Watchers: Right out of "Oh Brother, where are you?" I was hoping that George Cloony would come to assemble and they would form a song. <Br /> <br /> Maybe it's premature because the miniseries is not complete, but I doubt I'll see it any more in some way. <br /> <br /> I would not expect anyone to duplicate the lone Paloma's thrilling Feeling, but I see this and it seems that they have no feeling of the Old West at all.
