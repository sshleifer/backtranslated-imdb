Of course, this movie was delayed. But you expected that the moment you looked at the cover. It's a B movie, and in the T & A factor that this film delivered. Honestly, it was funnier than expected. While it was not in any way a work of comic genius, such as "The Party Animal" or "Orgazmo", in regards to the B movies, it was worth it, if you like that kind of thing. <br /> Christians and groups of parents with moral orientation, this is a soft core adult entertainment. If you do not want your children to see sexual content and naked, you should keep them away from this movie.
