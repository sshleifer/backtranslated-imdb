I've seen a lot of television over the years. So much so, that when I start to see new programs that basically seem to be repetitions of old programs, I feel insulted. Luckily, I am not too sensitive because "Hot Properties" makes the cast (which means they are more attractive) of "Designing Women" updated and published in New York City instead of in Georgia. <br /> <br /> The jokes are more TV-14-ish, but they do not improve the show. The only thing this program has shown is that Nicole Sullivan is SO SO good that she could have made a show like "My Mother the Car" a classic. His comedic talents are reminiscent of a modern Lucille Ball, only more fun. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is flashy and sexy, which might be good for a brainless soap, but they're not funny. <br /> <br /> Fred
