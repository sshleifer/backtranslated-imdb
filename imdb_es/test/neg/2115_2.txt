Will Spanner (David Byrnes, the fifth actor who plays the role in the series) stumbles over another strange case, this time involving vampires instead of the usual witches, sorcerers and demons (he's in the hospital to see how the son is doing of his friend who was injured by a blow and a race when a girl who has been attacked by a vampire is moved in. Bring Detectve Lutz to help him with the case that revolves around a clandestine organization of vampires trying to achieve a business merger to allow them to legally own all the blood banks in the world or some of that nonsense. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie takes a back seat to nudity and sex scenes simulated. (As expected from this series, I suppose.) So, complaining about the lack of good acting, a convincing plot, or even convincing characters, I suspect, would fall on deaf ears. I i mportan those 'frivolities' and just want some 'action'. Unfortunately on that front the film also fails. All women are attractive enough, but the way the scenes are filmed is atrocious. Do this more or less a useless exercise in all possible ways. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kimberly Blair and April Breneman show everything; Ashlie Rhey shows full-frontal; Aline Kassman and Mai-Lis Holmes only show their breasts <br /> <br /> My rating: D
