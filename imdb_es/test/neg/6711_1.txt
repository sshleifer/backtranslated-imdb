Two things have changed since then. First of all, I am no longer a child, and secondly, most of Seagal's new films are simply terrible. In my opinion, this is the worst movie ever made with Derailed, starring Jean Claude Van Damme. In this movie, the plot is just an excuse to film some terrible action scenes that are painful to watch. I love action movies, but this is not an action movie ... This is not a movie ... this is a group of irritating scenes that are connected in an annoying way to kill the love of the viewers for the films of action. I'm sorry, but I do not feel any respect for anyone who has liked this movie. He has a serious intelligence problem at that time. I hope that Seagal will make some good new movies in the future. Good luck to him!
