Heftig og Begeistret (Intense and Enthusiastic) is a documentary story of a male choir in Berlevåg, in the far north of Norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark during the winter and the towns face young people. They move to the most populated parts of southern Norway, where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves. The people in the choir, who are between 30 and 95 years old, have unique and colorful lives and are very nice beings. They are characterized by the harsh climate and the recession of the North and have adapted to the way of life required. Throughout the film, we learn a little about many people in the choir and follow them through songs, some events in a church and in the harbor, and in the end, a trip to Murmansk. <br /> <br /> The external environment filmed in the film is very beautiful and is characterized by Norwegian nature. The scenography is also natural and is taken directly from the choir and from the lives of the people we know. The salons, the bathroom, the kettle in the oven; There is nothing artificial in this movie, neither in the people, nor in the environment, nor in their music nor in their feelings. Everything is as real as it can be. <br /> <br /> Everything is lost when it comes to telling a story. It is very beautiful and real, but why do we see it? Is it because of the songs? Is it by nature? Or simply to see a story about Berlevåg Mens-Choir, about his life and some of the trips they have. The message, if there is one, is that this small society faces life through social events like the choir. The choir has kept people together for many years. <br /> <br /> Everything is fine, but being as popular as it has been, seen by almost 200,000 in Norway, there is something wrong. There is no beginning or end. Nobody wins or loses anything, no one reveals any message or tries to convince the audience that this is good or that life there is excellent. Why was this movie made? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. It's a good movie about good people, but compared to the average European, Scandinavian or Norwegian film, it does not deserve a 9 out of 10. It's closer to 4 out of 10, and that's what I'll give it. br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a theater, you should expect the average age in the audience to be around 55-60. It has been reported that it is consistently high in all theaters. Perhaps this is also the reason why he receives so much praise in the news and good grades also in the IMDB: it is a film about the elderly, for the elderly. It's a "I do not regret anything in my life" movie, and a story that says living in a small city like Berlevåg could also be a good life.
