An atrocious offense to the memory and genius of Welles, this senseless set of self-indulgent improvisation on a great subject should have been kept together with a series of other unfinished Welles projects that no one has seen. Now we know why! To add an additional insult to past injuries, the dreadful English-language dubbing by amateur dubbing actors in the United States and even the great man only accentuates all careless mistakes in storytelling and construction. It's as if every weekend some good-hearted Spanish soul gave Orson a few pesos, a 35mm camera and some negative film shorts left over from some other production and told Welles to go out into the Spanish countryside and I would continue filming anything. Until the movie ran out. It is true that if Orson had really formed this film in his place, the famous Jesus Franco, could have discarded 85% of what he filmed, but we will never know. As Welles never took the time to edit his own work here, and somewhere along the way he or his heirs sanctioned someone else to do so, he is not entirely guilty of the debacle. Those who wish to prove that in their early days Welles was the luckiest of young men because he surrounded himself with people like John Houseman, Herman Mankewiecz, Greg Toland, Bernard Hermann and Robert Wise, do not need a better proof of their adult inadequacies than this disaster. from a movie. In his sad old age, Welles was able to do anything when he needed a few dollars or pesos, including the sale of his artistic soul. The devil certainly had his due with this one!
