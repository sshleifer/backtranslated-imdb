The artist Daniel King (Chris John) and his partner Laura Peters (Lara Clancy) are invited to move to an old house in Cornwall, in Great Britain, for their rich childhood friend Natasha Carlton (Carol Kentish). Natasha is in love with Daniel, who is an ambiguous man regarding his love life. While she is alone in the house, strange things happen and Laura is startled and scared. When Laura meets the old and crazy priest Gabriel Norton (Brian Blessed) on the way, he is advised to leave the house immediately, since the evil lives there. But the couple stays and has to face tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> What a messy script and this horrible and cheesy movie of this "Devil's Harvest" is! Cinematography and camera work are not all bad, but the amateur performances of Chris John and Carol Kentish and the direction of James Shanks, along with the terrible story, the ridiculous situations and the dialogues make this film one of the worst I've seen in history. gender. From time to time I've seen on YouTube a couple of shorts from the film university that are better and better than the useless and terrible "Devil's Harvest". In the end, it is not a horror movie, but a horror movie. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Colheita do Diabo" ("The Devil's Harvest")
