This movie is about two murderous women who go on tour to kill random men they know. <br /> <br /> Wow, "Baise-moi" became the worst movie of all time on my list. The plot is crazy, meaningless and unnecessary. The whole movie is full of violence and sex, and I'm sure no healthy parent would want to show this movie to their children. I do not understand what people get out of doing this movie or watching this movie. Maybe someone somewhere has fulfilled their perverted desires. There is simply no excuse or reason for the existence of this perverted and depraved work. <br /> <br /> The only consolation that I offer myself is that I saw it in the fast forward, so I have not wasted so much time.
