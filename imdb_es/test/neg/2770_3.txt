My question is, what was the worst element of this movie? Was it the performance? leader? script?. Maybe it was the waste of Alan Ladd and Jack LaRue. LaRue and, especially, Ladd are able to carry an extreme sinister role. In this movie, it was hard to tell who was the bad guy. Granted, Ladd was playing a good undercover guy, but even in his good boy roles, it could be very creepy. Then, the net result was a potentially good movie, devoid of any sense of conflict.
