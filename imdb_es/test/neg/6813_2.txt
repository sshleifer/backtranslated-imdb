After reading the reviews I decided to rent the DVD version. <br /> <br /> I like classical music and I wanted to learn more about Bach. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. I guess I do not know enough about Bach's music and the comments were not enough for me to understand the importance or the music that was playing. <br /> <br /> It might be appropriate with the guidance of a Bach music expert who can explain the film. <br /> <br /> I really tried and saw the whole jumping movie that I could enjoy at least a little, but I did not. <br /> <br /> See it at your own risk.
