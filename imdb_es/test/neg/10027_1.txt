Even by the lowest standards of the movies of the 80s, it stinks. The usual herd of overexposed teenagers heads to a "forbidden" part of the forest, which burned down in the 1940s and apparently left a single survivor angry. Fast forward (actually, you'll want to move quickly through much of this mess) to this day, where a couple of campers are killed; the teenagers are still in their wake, while a semi-worried ranger (a sleepwalker Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spends a lot of time tuning his banjo) are partially successful in directing our attention from the playgrounds of the bullfight. Quilting the nature of footage. Finally, more murders, but nothing you have not seen a million times before. If you want to see the children massacred, choose SLEEPAWAY CAMP or the first FRIDAY THE 13th ON THIS DATE
