This movie is a cinematic collage of gangster clich√©s. The writing is of degree z and the plot and the story are constructed without care or logic. It is a messy pastiche of stereotyped gangsters (think of the Bugs Bunny cartoons) and silly support characters (the doctor and the writer). There are much better Bogart movies out there. In fact, Bogart seems to have slept during this performance. He puts very little effort into this character. I think the board of directors he received was something like, "He's a bad guy, he's acting bad." This guy is the equivalent of the Darth Vader era; Obviously, the evil and the antihero. Do not waste your time with this.
