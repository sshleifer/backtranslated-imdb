"The Patriot," starring Steven Segal, is a late-90s action / suspense movie that is not really a thriller or an action movie; rather it's Steven Segal playing Steven Segal under another name, but this time he's a Native American country doctor who kicks every now and then. Discovering the obvious orifices of the plot, the film itself is absolutely amazing in terms of the blatant disregard for the character's development. <br /> <br /> From a marketing point of view, I asked myself: "Who in the world did you point to?" The plotline of the bio-thriller is very out of the ordinary for the people of Middle America and Segal as the silk cowboy would never sell it to anyone, even if you fried it and put it between a kripsy cream donut. The whole movie is very widespread, even for Segal fans, because it simply is not met at any level.
