I rented this movie because I enjoy watching things with Lauren Graham in them. Well, she was the highlight. Everyone else seemed complete separated from the photo. You keep looking around for those who watch the movie with you, what? However, she provided some clarity, since she was the only normal character in the image, which does not really say much for the movie. Personally, it was too far-fetched for me. However, I'm glad I rented it even though I would never want to have it. I still feel that Lauren Graham proved to be a strong actress and even thought that she was not the protagonist, she seemed to steal the movie. My husband and I were happier and we cared more for his character that ended with Josh's character than for the two main characters.
