On the opening night of the silent film festival in San Francisco, I was very excited to see films that are historical and not very common. The guest speaker who opened this movie created a sense of exaggeration towards the darkness, and how this film is underestimated. The science fiction part of the film was very interesting and fantastic for its time, but I'm not sure if it was due to the fact that it was screened directly after Brilliant 1928 "The Wind" or if it looked like the Russian filmmakers took it after what are famous Russian novels (hundreds of characters, tangled plots) but I know with certainty that the dramatic parts, as in the parts of the Earth, did not make any sense, they were boring and I got lost in about twenty minutes. Maybe it was the performance but I was convinced of why this film is "unknown and underestimated": it's boring, there's no plot or basic story and the acting is horrible. This certainly is not a "Battleship Potemkin", however, I will say that Russian films do not make a real effort to illuminate what life is like in Russia.
