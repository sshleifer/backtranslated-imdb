I'm so glad that I only got this movie for $ 5. The anime is expensive, there's no doubt about that. I took a look at this for a while and finally saw it for sale. I grabbed him immediately and took him home just to hang his head in disappointment. This movie sucks. I've heard people talk about how bloody and violent this movie is. It really is not so bloody or violent. I've seen it three times, and I think I've lost enough of my life in this. The demons get a point for being unique and sometimes great. Sex gets a point since it is almost non-stop. The old horny gets half a point for being horny and still having sexual desire. And the main character (whose name I have erased from my mind) gets half a point for the cool design of his weapon. I saw important connections between this film and Demon City Shinjuku. Both have the same style animation, that's obvious from the director, both have unconvincing soundtracks that stink like the Antichrist, and both have terrible endings. Avoid this movie unless you like anime sex.
