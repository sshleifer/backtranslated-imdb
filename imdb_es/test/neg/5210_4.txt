The director Nico Mastorakis has made a cynical money collector (by his own admission) who is too cynical to impress anyone but a fan of the second-year genre. <br /> <br /> The most extreme, to confront the gender photos, to paraphrase a character in VIDEODROME, "have a philosophy"; that is what makes them dangerous. <br /> <br /> The philosophy of ISLAND OF DEATH is to release many "striking" elements into a film mix and mix slowly. The result is a dish without flavor but with an ugly appearance. <br /> <br /> It should not be confused with the brilliant Serrador. WHO CAN KILL A CHILD? (sometimes called ISLA DE LA MUERTE), the effort of Mastorakis takes place on a Greek island that is the scene of several forms of slaughter, a bit of bestiality and a certain total perversion. <br /> <br /> Everything moves at an affectionate pace and the violent pieces are misdirected. <br /> <br /> Touted as "The movie that the censors did not want you to see", I dare to assume that the censors never saw it, they simply read the press kit. Until his knees shook up.
