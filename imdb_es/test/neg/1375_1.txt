Carlos wants to make fun of affirmative action, racial stereotypes and related issues in his program, which makes him very similar to Judge Thomas of the Supreme Court. He is there because of his race and then denigrates him. He is supposed to mock Mexicans to the end because he himself is Mexican, and I would also say that he can mock the mentally disabled because any layman can say that it is not the best tool ... although it is. Definitely a tool of some kind. <br /> <br /> He is a comical pirate who, even with a team of writers, can not put together 3 minutes of really fun material in a 30 minute show. I can not think of a single comedian who is regularly on television so Carlos can hold a candle, except maybe Larry the Cable Guy (not surprisingly, he also has a program on Comedy Central to attend to the same audience, no doubt). <br /> <br /> If you ever see the greats, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, etc. They talk about comedy, you really have an idea of ​​the amount of work and thought involved in developing an interesting and funny comic voice. All that work was omitted completely by Mencia; his comic voice is, in part, stolen from other better comics and partly obscured by his propensity to shout his revolted racist scoundrel. The show of Mencia is loved by some of the "at least I don" Do not fuck me so much, "I think I strongly believe that it is better to feel better for his comments about the numbness of society, unfortunately, Carlos and his fans are part of the problem, not the solution on that issue.
