The credits come from the sewing work of Sandy Frank that was made to turn this movie into Cave Dwellers for its re-launch. Now that it's cleared up ... oh! Unbearable, visceral pain. Blade Master jumps shamelessly in the sword car and the witchcraft started by the Conan movies ... except that the car never left the garage anyway. As such, this Italian film is a failure trying to defraud a box office failure, with predictable results. However, this would give very little credit to the director and the writers, who make no effort to maintain a coherent plot, a continuity, any appearance of exact continuity of the era. Miles O'Keefe is not a main man, neither now nor forever (Tarzan, the monkey man, proved it, if Ator did not). Just an unpleasant image and a task to see.
