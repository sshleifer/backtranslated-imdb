Even Mel Gibson could not save this movie. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Why did Mel Gibson make a movie that I'm sure he could not sit and watch? What was this? A stupid total on some heavy drugs stalking a schizophrenic lady, who was also taking some illicit street drugs. For all moviegoers who consume heavy drugs; you will love this movie
