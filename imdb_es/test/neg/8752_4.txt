I love this movie. Although I rated it with a "4", that is because the performance, the plot and the budget were programmed for the universe "B" even before this movie was released. But that's okay! It's an entertaining movie that has a lot to offer! <br /> <br /> I remember what Leonard Maltin said about "Plan 9 From Outer Space": a film so bad that it's great! Lacking the UFO: the alien plot, The Thing the Could not Die is based on the supernatural (divination, a buried head looking for his body, hypnosis, etc.) to tell his story. The acting is forced, the camera works in second class and the adjustments are limited, but go! What movie is this movie available in the pirate market. If you find a copy, buy it!
