As someone already said, the Living Dead Dolls were cute and if they came out as a new series of little evil things, I would buy one or two. Well, basically, this movie was dark, not in the sense of fear, but in that I can not see a little. And it was boring. Three females in a house, the youngest ones said not to go to the forest under any circumstances (well, that did not sink) and it would have been better if that advice had involved their death. And if someone does a cleaning or a face wash or something, you'd think there would be a lot of coughing. A young sexy mother where you waste time trying to calculate her age (according to my calculations 34 or 36.) And it seemed like more than 20 years had passed since someone had lived there, so what was with the young parents photos of adults largely older album? I'm so tired of clichés that it's just lazy writing, and here they come in a fast and thick way. Teenagers are stoned and drunk in the car and, well, you know where that leads ... death and apparent deafness too, since Tim seems to ignore the scream of his friends. I mean, I've pushed many cars where the driver did not shout and I heard them. Cliché strange man in the woods nobody believes. The plumber who has lived in them there for years and this is his first experience with these children, so that driving avoids the piquetero who drives a young man in the middle of the night ... catch him over you, idiot! Cliché ... wandering through the woods without having any idea where you're going, armed with the knowledge that the pickets of children wielding (yes, again they) are out of the house. Pointless scene, the brutalization of the pig ... why do so many directors see no problem with the mutilation and killing of animals? I would have preferred to see the children run and bite the people in the thighs than this. Zombies do not seem to have that much energy in other movies. The villain well, how ineffective was he? His big part was in the store ... coming in and demanding to be taken care of first. What a memorable man he was. Why not kill it before, before the family arrived and prevent the film from being made, or remake it in a different way? I give my marks to the house, to the woods and to the little Gothic dolls I want!
