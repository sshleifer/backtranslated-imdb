This was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I'm still trying to overcome how bad it was. Just because it has Godard's name attached, it does not make it great. Beyond the fact that it does not make any sense, we see a very remote possibility of a traffic jam that is not surprising, unbelievable or something like that. While this large part of the traffic jam is occurring, you will probably feel more like making a pastrami sandwich instead of continuing to see it. Pieces of a supposed story, silly, stupid characters. What message are we supposed to take from this? It offers nothing and is useless. The arrogance of the director to show these puny and bored French people who smoke in chain and make them sit and talk for hours and then pose as art is really amazing.
