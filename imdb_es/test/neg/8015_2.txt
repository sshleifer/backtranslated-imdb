I rented this because I could not pass up the opportunity to see Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones before the Hollywood fame together, but it was definitely not worth it. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because of the novelty of seeing them before they have grown along the pond. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones, who is usually fun to watch even if she is not. The best theater in the world is horrible. Owen seems really uncomfortable being in a turkey like that, plus he wears a ridiculous and extremely tight chin wig (at least I hope it's a wig and not his real hair). And the scene in which a country template dances with Zeta Jones simply makes you feel embarrassed by it. Joan Plowright walks stunned by the whole movie; You're probably wondering how he got into a mess. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Clive Owen's wife is not terrible, but almost everyone else is. . Oh, and the writing also stinks.
