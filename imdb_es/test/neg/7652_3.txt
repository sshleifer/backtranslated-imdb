Very disturbing, but elaborated by experts and with a script, and directed intelligently, with a good eye for color and detail. Mary Beth Hurt, Sandy Dennis and especially Randy Quaid are unusually good. The story centers around a child (Bryan Madorsky) who wonders where all the leftovers they eat each night come from. The strange behavior of his parents (Hurt, Quaid) makes the school psychiatrist (Dennis) get involved. It is a frightening movie of cannibals. But I'ts not bad. If you like Hannibal, you will love this. If you do not like parents, get away from the movie. I just gave advice to Cannibal Lover and those who hate. <br /> <br /> R rated by strong adult themes and graphic violence.
