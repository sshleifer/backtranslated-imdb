(Synopsis) In the year 2055, the rich can travel back in time and hunt a live dinosaur for a huge price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can push people back in time. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) took this technology and opened a business known as Time Safari. Anyone with the money can travel millions of years ago and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team along with the big game hunter on a floating walkway to a place where they can kill the dinosaur. The travel protocol is that they must stay on the road and not disturb the earth or any creature that surrounds them. Unfortunately for the human race, a hunter steps on and kills a butterfly. This insignificant act causes great impacts on the climate of the earth and creates new species of animal life. The course of evolution as we know it now is being changed by the waves of time. Travis and Sonia try to stop the process of change before it becomes permanent, and the man is extinguished. <br /> <br /> (Comment) The film was a bit slow and the concept of going back in time and changing things was a bit exaggerated. The death of a single butterfly that causes the tremendous changes in the atmosphere and the evolution of the world is simply ridiculous. They changed the Chicago skyline to look modern, but the new cars of the future seemed stupid. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD. (Warner Brothers Pictures, run time 1:43, PG-13 Rating) (4/10)
