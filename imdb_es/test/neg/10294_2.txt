I must say that when I saw this movie in a 6.5 on this site, I thought it was worth seeing. I was very disappointed. From almost the opening scene, it is obvious that the two alleged FBI agents are, in fact, the murderers. Could they have made it more obvious? If that is the "turn" foreseen in this movie, it is quite sad. While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is no match for a rethinkingly bad script. Pullman acts skillfully as part of a sociopathic killer ... and that's the problem. There's no change of "I'm playing the FBI guy!" a "I just killed 12 people and boy, my arms are tired". You can not blame the actors ... the story fails in many more ways than one. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, however, I was sure I was wrong, that no director / writer would. Ever be so blatantly obvious about a "spin" plot. Ormond and Pullman must act in a strange way to divert the viewer's attention from the real murderers, I thought ... which gave too much credence to the filmmakers. I should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before the 15 minute mark had passed. <br /> <br /> For Lynch's credit, he managed to interject many things that make a good movie: sex, violence, humor and well-trained actors. Too bad they were in the wrong configuration. Hopefully, Pell James can recover from this role ... I found her performance particularly impressive, as the amazing savior addicted to drugs and turned into a savior. I should have rewritten the paper so that the "crack bitch" would win. <br /> <br /> Those people who have compared this movie with Natural Born Killers take note: Tarantino made the characters of Mickey and Mallory reprehensible, but sympathetic. The art of that film far exceeds the gore, and this is not seen once in the Surveillance. The surveillance only wants them to be Born Born Vacuum Cleaners ... in fact, he has damp dreams of being even a fraction of what that movie was. People who have not seen the Vigilance ... are attached to something with a little more intelligence. Like Camp Rock.
