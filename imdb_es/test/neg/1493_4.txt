I was very disappointed with this series. I had a lot of cool graphics and that's it. The level of detail he entered was minimal, and I always had the feeling that the audience was being sponsored; There was a lot of what I thought "This is extremely good, but we will not explain it in more detail, because you will not get it anyway, we will only show you some nice images to entertain you". The host would release words that sound interesting like "sparticles" and "super-symmetry" without any attempt to explain what it was. We had to look for it in Wikipedia. <br /> <br /> Also, I know a lot about superstrings (for a layman) and I found that their explanations were complicated and could have been much better. They could have chosen MANY better examples to explain concepts, but instead, the examples they used were confusing and further obscured the subject. <br /> <br /> In addition, I got so tired of repetitiveness. They could easily have condensed the series in a single episode if they had cut all the repetition. They should have shown the Quantum Caf√© clips approximately 8 times. The host repeated the same things over and over again. I can not remember how many times he said "The universe is made of small vibrating strings". It's as if they're trying to brainwash us just to accept that "superstrings are the best since slices of bread are cut." <br /> <br /> Finally, the show ended with an unpleasant feeling of a "competition" between Fermilab and CERN. clearly biased towards fermilab. This is supposed to be an educational program on quantum physics, not on whether EE. UU It's better than Europe or vice versa! I also felt that this was part of the condescension: "Audiences need to see some conflict to remain interested." Please. Give me a little more credit than that. <br /> <br /> In general, 2 thumbs down :-(
