Dee Snider is the villain of this movie and his bad acting and his overacting ruined it for me. The whole movie seemed to take itself too seriously. Try to achieve the dark atmosphere of "Seven" without the good performance. The film highlights the "subculture" of the urban rock / tattoo / body art industry and expects us to be shocked (scared) by the size of a man's nose ring. I'm not an expert in movies, but the script and the acting in this movie are horrible. Dee Snider looks at the villain's part, but his performance is downright horrible. I recommend not wasting time on this unless there is nothing else available.
