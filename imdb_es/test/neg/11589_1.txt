Writer and director Jay Andrews, also known as Jim Wynorski, offers more of his signature shlock with a decent cast threatened by Z-grade computer-generated reptiles in "Komodo Vs. Cobra", as generic in a scam of "Mysterious Island" . Jurassic Park "As you can imagine, the main problem with this predictable thread about the monsters they eat about mankind are the incredibly fake special effects, the cobra and the Komodo are hilariously horrible, but graphics people make a good I work by integrating the monsters with their victims, not that any of this is at all credible. "Clearly," Komodo Vs. Cobra "had such a low budget that practically everything that is not human in appearance is as false as the This epic of corny monsters takes place on a remote island where the US Army performs top-secret DNA tests on animals.The result is that gigantic Komodos and Cobra thrive on this tropical paradise island. the action, the primary scientist is swallowed by a cobra that likes to swim in. Then, they introduce us to a group of 'Greenpeace' as environmental protesters and a journalist Planet One organizer Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish of "Hellbent") pays charter ship captain Jim Stoddard (Michael Pare of "Houston Knights" on CBS-TV) five grand with the promise of another five grand if he takes them to this forbidden island. Meanwhile, the US military UU They suspect that something is wrong on the island, so they send their own team of men who eat large predators. Our heroes meet the last remaining scientist on the island, Dr. Susan Richardson (Michelle Borth of "Wonderland"), the daughter of the scientist responsible for this insane science project, who tells them that the military will target the island for destruction. The fight for the title between the two overly large predators occurs in the last quarter of an hour after our heroes, who have been constantly reduced by the monsters, find a helicopter and take off in time before the military pulverizes the island. There is no tension, suspense or anything worthwhile in this deficient creature feature. The best thing about this yawner is the orchestral soundtrack of the composer Chuck Cirino; gives "Komodo Vs. Cobra" an epic feeling. In general, Jay Andrews writes and directs tolerable nonsense, but this is far below its low standards. Sexy women do better in survival than boys. In one scene, our heroic group fords a river and we do not see any wet shirts. Fuck There's nothing in the way of memorable dialogues or relationships in this dreck. I think the military makes a lot of greetings when they put their heads together to conspire. Hopefully Michael Pare has had a good day of payment with this garbage. The end as one of the scientists takes the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly as a last minute idea. It's not so bad, it's good, it's just bad.
