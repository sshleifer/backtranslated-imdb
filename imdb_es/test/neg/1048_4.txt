Honestly, I'm not so impressed by that, it's not a bad movie, but it's not a great movie either. There is a story to tell, but it is told in a very incoherent way, which makes it lose its full meaning and capacity for intrigue. This film could have been done differently with an outstanding result, the story is very interesting, but somehow it does not intrigue me to see it. <br /> <br /> Definitely not an amateur movie, but quite the opposite and some of the scenes are very emotional. The actors and actresses do a good job, like the director, but there is something so unfinished throughout the film that I can not say. Maybe if I had gotten to know the characters a bit more, all the "clutter" of the film could have been better clarified and put more "action" throughout the cause, since it became a bit slow from time to time. when.
