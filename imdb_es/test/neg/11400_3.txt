As a fan of the dizzy and humorous books of Gipharts (of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the best), I really wanted to see this movie. However, I did not catch it at the cinema and, after watching it on television, I am terribly happy that I have resisted buying it on video. From a good book, they managed to make one of the worst movies in the history of Dutch cinema. All good parts have been left aside, history has changed, not in its benefits. All the humor has been cut. What remains is a misplayed, dramatic and incoherent film that I never want to see again. <br /> <br /> Congratulate Giphart with this result, and I am happy that Robbert Jan Westdijk has made a hell of a better job in the topper of Giphart Phileine zegt Sorry. Go see that!
