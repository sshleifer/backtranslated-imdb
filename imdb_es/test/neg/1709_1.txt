It is possible that this is the least fun movie I have seen. You can take my word for real, because it is playing on television right now. It's really one of the most pathetic productions I've seen. There is not a single redeemable aspect of this movie. He just lacks humor. The only good thing that it possibly has is that it is so funny that it has nothing memorable. In fact, I sat in a ridiculous subplot and I can not really tell you what happened. The only reason I can remember seeing this movie is because it does not have that much humor that will stay in my mind forever just for that. <br /> <br /> It's something you can not miss. If your friend wants to teach you, shoot him and save yourself boredom.
