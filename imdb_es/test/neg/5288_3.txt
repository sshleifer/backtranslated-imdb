Dr. Chopper begins shortly after the mother of teenager Nicholas (Robert Adamson) has passed away, he is still cut off by that, but each cloud has a silver border and, in this case, it seems that his mother owns a wooden hut in Lake Tatonka. 'friendly place for happy people' that she did not speak to. So Nicholas along with his girlfriend Jessica (Chelsey Crisp) and his three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoyt) and Tamara (Ashley McCarthy) are heading there for a fun weekend. Unfortunately, things do not go as planned, the cabin turns out to be little more than a shed and his neighbors turn out to be Dr. Chopper (Ed. Brigadier) and his two nurses who are killing anyone they know. In horrible experiments ... <br /> <br /> Live to the DVD / video, Dr. Chopper was edited and directed by Lewis Schoenburn and this movie seems to be having a hard time here in the IMDb with some harsh criticism, Although I think that Dr. Chopper, as a horror movie, has no value, I do not think that some of the criticisms I have read are totally justified. The script that is taken very seriously is attributed to Ian Holt (like it or not ...) who has a role in the film as Detective Crocker according to the list of IMDb actors, although I do not remember any character with that name. Maybe he was one of the cops at the beginning? Anyway, the basic story is fine, I guess although it's a bit boring and it lasts too long, it's a typical slasher meal with some kind of evil character that hits our annoying American cast, you know the exercise. In addition to some brief and undeveloped nonsense about Dr. Chopper using parts of the body to replenish his own deteriorated body, there is not much history here and the script seems to exist only to invent situations for the girls to remove the top, there are the inevitable sex scenes, there is a sequence in which some girls have to complete an initiation in a sisterhood house of topless women and there are even a couple of lesbians here as well, one of which is seen without its full complement of clothing. Oh, and when I say topless I mean they do not have tops, but they all put on bras, so you have to keep in mind that there is no real frontal nude in Dr. Chopper. So there you have it really, it's an average story that has a slightly surprising twist at the end, it's wasted, it's populated by silly and poor characters that just exist to show some cheap gore scenes and girls with bras. To be honest, I expect a little more of my films, but again maybe I'm just being demanding. <br /> <br /> Director Schoenburn is fine actually, this is not the worst looking movie I've seen. Although it still seems cheap. There's no style here, I did not think it was scary and there's no atmosphere either. The blood is restricted and restricted to some corpses and cut limbs, there is nothing new here or any special effect particularly convincing. Dr. Chopper is also one of those movies in which the decisions and motivations of the characters are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Technically this is a bit rough, but it is reasonably well done in what was probably a very low budget, the forest locations are adequately isolated, although the police office looks like the opposite room Someone and the teams of the two nurses at first look like stripper teams. The acting is fine, it could have been better, but I've certainly seen worse. <br /> <br /> Dr. In fact, Chopper has a doctor who travels on a motorcycle, but unfortunately that is not enough to satisfy me, despite being a reasonably competent production, the lack of real blood, naked or a decent plot sinks without a trace.
