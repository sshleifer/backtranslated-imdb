The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology about it, such as Star Trek. That's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what you think each episode was a winner. They are the ones that qualify each individual with a 10 and can not objectively evaluate the show. Due to this, some time ago I reviewed all the original episodes of Star Trek (the good ones and the bad ones) because the ratings and the general reviews were too positive. Now, it's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Now I was very surprised when I saw criticism for this tasteless episode that described it as "one of the best" and gave it a score of 10 If this is the case, why is it that all those who I know you have seen this episode they hate it as much as I do? It is possible that I, my family and friends are in a bad mood, but it is also possible that this is another case of rabid fanatics who inflate with anger the rating in an average or inferior episode. <br /> <br /> The episode itself is played by William Windom and others as several archetypes: a soldier, a dancer, etc. Everyone is stuck in a cylindrical room with no escape and only in the end do you realize the "shocking truth" - which is not at all surprising and is in fact mostly lame. No, this is a badly written and uncommitted episode. Yes, there were many episodes of the series that deserved a 10, but few as unworthy as this due to a superficial script and an unattractive resolution.
