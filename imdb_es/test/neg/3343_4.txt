(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> Oh, sure it's based on Moby Dick. Totally obsessed and that destroys it. It is total madness. The movie starts pretty well, but at the end of the movie, all the others are destroyed and the mind of the main star is blank. <br /> <br /> The supposed half sister is never convincing. Some very poor lighting effects. The music is interesting. But little more. It took me over a month to finally finish the damn thing. I suppose if you like being John Malkovich, you might like this. But when BJM was a great movie that I did not want to see again, Pola X is a movie that I hate hell. The only possible emotion in the movie is the free sexual scene of incest towards the end of the movie. (Hopefully you're not thinking about Catherine either.) <br /> <br /> This movie is very boring, depressing and misdirected. Not very recommendable Yes, if you like French films. (go see Crimson Rivers instead) <br /> <br /> 4/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 1/10 Reproducible: 0/10
