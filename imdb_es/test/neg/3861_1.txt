I have seen many movies over the years and I am a big fan of comedies. <br /> <br /> But this supposed comedy almost made me cry. It is without a doubt the worst movie I've seen, the worst. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing about this movie from a friend and decided to watch it. If I could turn back the time, I would. I will regret as long as I live, the time I wasted seeing this garbage. <br /> <br /> The story is crazy; It just does not make any sense and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish mafia and a German headhunter who chase Pestaria 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish Mafia after $ 50,000 and the Germans after his head. <br /> <br /> While trying to escape from The Pest, it takes the form of many costumes. But by doing this, we attend some of the most annoying, worst and dormant performances, dialogues and sounds in the history of cinema. This movie bothered me so much; In the end it was full of aggression. She was so angry that she had wasted so much time watching a movie that would surely lead depressed people to almost certain suicide. I mean, how can there be hope when you can give permission to a movie like this? <br /> <br /> I know people have their own opinions, but the most striking thing about The Pest is that people really like it. Why? What's funny about a man who is annoying from the first second to the last? A man who can not act? Who has an annoying voice and a confused face? <br /> <br /> I sat thinking that the movie would improve, surely I would. It did not. Usually, you want the good man to survive, but I wanted the Germans or the Scottish mafia to find and kill The Pest, anything that would take me out of my misery. There's nothing funny, interesting or normal to happen in this movie, it's just annoying and confusing. The jokes are dead even before they are counted. I'm sorry for the cameramen who have nothing to say about how the film is made, but actually they have to film this nonsense. I would not be surprised if they received advice. <br /> <br /> If you want to stay healthy and be part of society, my advice is to never watch this movie. I prefer to lock myself in my room for 5 weeks and go without food or water to watch this movie again! <br /> <br /> I do not think I'll ever hate anything more than this.
