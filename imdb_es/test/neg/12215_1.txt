Negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is! The wooden performance together with a story that has been repeated dozens of times. Everyone in this movie should attend Overactors Anonymous. One would think that an original story could evolve from the general concept. Young people in a high school are trying to face the Pearl Harbor attack. It raises interesting questions, but the way they are transmitted makes it more of a joke. Typical characters were present, including the fan and the nerd (glasses included). I could not have been more disinterested in the wooden dialogues and cliche characters. At the end of the movie, I had to throw the DVD in the trash. Stay away from this failure! You will not recover the 90 minutes of your life!
