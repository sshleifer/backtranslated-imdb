When a friend and I saw this in recent releases, we decided to get it despite the fact that neither of us had heard about it before. We both like Costas Mandylor and had James Coburn, so we thought it could not be that bad. We are wrong. Was. It was really so bad. No actor or actress could have made it worthwhile to watch this movie. It was like taking Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and a movie about nuclear bombs and trying to cut and paste everything. <br /> <br /> I must admit there was a couple of laughs. I laughed when the boy in the main cabin is asking Alan (Costas Mandylor) if he is a "sea kitten". The other laughs that this movie had had nothing to do with writing. I would love to know how the people who are doing this movie thought you could make a cruiser crumble and stay firm. He is not inclined or anything. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something to watch over Costas Mandylor, James Coburn or any of the members of this cast, go ahead. Find something good they did.
