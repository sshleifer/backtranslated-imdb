Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is a kind of international criminal brain sought in countries across Europe, and to stay free is locked in the Casbah, a mysterious part of Algiers, where even the police are reluctant to go, until The superior officer is sent from Paris to capture Le Moko once and for all. For Moko, although the Casbah allows him to stay out of police custody, it also becomes a kind of prison at the same time, a place where he can not leave, because the moment he does, he knows that he will be arrested. <br /> <br /> Boyer's performance was good, and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. Capture the essence of such a character: a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very elegant at the same time. The film itself, unfortunately, was quite disappointing. Several parts of the story seemed inconsistent, of which I will mention two. First was the idea that the police would not enter the Casbah. The local commander clearly stated at the beginning of the film, but the repeated references in the film suggest that, in fact, the police entered the Casbah quite regularly. Therefore, neither Commissioner Janvier's suggestion that the police would not enter, nor Inspector Slimane's statement (also a decent performance by Joseph Calleia) that they could enter the Casbah but did not seem to make sense, seemed to make a lot of sense. . It was also hard for me to believe that Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) snatched Moko so quickly, a hardened criminal genius that he was, to the point where he entertains the local population singing love songs and then leaves the Casbah. to find it, essentially surrendering. Of course, I understand the irony of the few final scenes, since Pepe abandons the freedom of his prison (the Casbah) only to find true freedom in his capture (because the police shot him and he was killed). He believes that someone like him Moko would fall into a trap like that. <br /> <br /> This is worth watching Boyer, and to a lesser extent Calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10
