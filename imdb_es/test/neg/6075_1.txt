About your terrible movie copying Beethoven. As a professional musician, it is my duty to see all the films about any composer and Beethoven is one of my favorites. When Hungarians and Americans meet, it is a terrible combination of empty emotions over the best combined with the worst possible flavor. You tried it on your terrible b-movie. The only thing that the film takes is music. Of course, he did not bother to look beyond the good, but to my taste he managed to play the Tackacs quartet, but hey, I must admit that the performances at least have a quality in contrast to the film he has made. It begins with the moribund DEAF Beethoven who understands Anna perfectly, who is simply whispering. Beethoven's audition during the movie improves every minute, but that must be due to something vague and divine. Then there is the semi-pornographic double-driving scene "eyes wide open" that is totally impossible, totally exaggerated with the delicious Anna and the nephew who cries at the end (who also cries in the scenes eliminated with constant red eyes, my GOD that performance ). And as a culmination, the Amadeus scam, with Beethoven dictating music to Anna not in notes but in complete nonsense, which she understands perfectly, but no one else in her audience will not even trained professional musicians understand. Of course, your reaction will be that the negative answer is at least one response, but I can assure you that Beethoven himself is becoming his grave because of his worthless creation and rightly so. This so-called homage is a blasphemy and I regret having rented one of the worst films ever made, even if it is my favorite subject. Ed Harris and others, you can not understand Beethoven's greatness in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a couple of direction and violin lessons. That's the problem that Americans have: they think they can capture everything, even when a hard work life is needed. Yes, we can do it anyway! Remember that a good product comes with hard work, talent, devotion and professionalism. All these creators of the copy of Beethoven lack. I see you in kindergarten.
