This movie is a real shame, not only because of the plot, the empty performance of the characters, it is because of the lack of creativity of the director and the whole team, this is perhaps one of the worst movies of all time, and it is Hard to believe that it is the sequel to one of the most famous movies of the 90s. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of The Mask, when I went to see this movie I hoped to see in a movie with a good sense of humor, a film with an acceptable plot, instead I saw a very bad copy of the cartoons of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery, the film was not funny or for my sister of 7 years, so I wonder: What was it did New Line Cinema? "Was he trying to repeat the success of the first movie, or was he trying to create another masterpiece like The Lord of the Rings?" Because if they did, they were completely crazy.
