These days, Ridley Scott is one of the main directors and producers, and can get large sums to direct films, especially because he has films like ALIEN, GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER. So, from this partial list of his credits, it is obvious that he is an incredible talent. However, if you observe the effort so early in the film school, it will probably be difficult for you to say that you were destined for greatness. That's because, although it has a good style and style of camera, the film is irremediably boring and not very involved. However, considering that I was not destined for the general launch and that it was only a training camp, then I am willing to look at it in a charitable way, hence the score of 4. <br /> <br /> By the way, This film is part of the CINE 16 DVD: European Shorts. In this DVD there are 16 shorts. Although most are not great, since it contains THE HEADLESS MAN, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP, it is an incredible DVD for those who love short films and it is worth buying.
