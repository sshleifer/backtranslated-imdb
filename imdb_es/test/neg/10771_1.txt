Before I start to tear this movie apart, check: I LOVE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. That story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. The film by Jane Gray is very good and the musical on Broadway is the hottest thing. So, when I heard that this movie was coming out, I thought it would be great since it was a BBC movie. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, it was a weak and totally stupid story that FULLY failed to capture The Beautiful Story. <br /> <br /> There were no exciting escapes with daring costumes. There was not a deep love that made your heart flutter when Percy left the room and Marguerite sighed when her husband was leaving her again. -Blue sex and violence. <br /> <br /> Sink me! What a horrible movie! <br /> <br />
