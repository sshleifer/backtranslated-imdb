"The Yellow Tomahawk" (1954), director Lesley Selander's meticulous outdoor routine, confronts the Cheyenne against the US cavalry with the leathery Rory Calhoun in the middle as the experienced Indian scout dressed in buff he has to take the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was focused on color, but the TV image that Turner Classic Movies transmitted was inexplicably black and white. <br /> <br /> The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of "Black Spurs") eluding several Indians and riding up to the verbiage with his old friend and Cheyenne boss, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef from " The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly "), which has in mind the idea of ​​killing. Fire Knife warns Adam that his brave Cheyenne are ready to destroy a cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform the camp commander, Commander Ives (Warner Anderson of "Objective, Burma!"), On the imminent attack of India, Adam discovers a beautiful wooden nymph stepping seductively on a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle from "I, Jury") is another of those silly women in westerns who bathe naked in the middle of an Indian country without any worries in the world. Castle also seems to be genuinely nude in her bathroom scenes, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally, Commander Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that someone has attacked his ammunition depot far from the fort. This is one of the many questions that the script of Richard Alan Simmons leaves unanswered in this 82-minute cut. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition in a secret place in the desert instead of keeping them in the fort's facilities? As soon as they have made this discovery, the Indians attack, beat the hero and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white seekers rides towards the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves from "Stalag 17") brings his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam gets hot water to help remove the arrow, the greedy Sawyer crushes the deepest well and kills his helpless companion. Later, we learned that Sawyer and his partner had found gold. The question of the dispersion of gold also remains unanswered after our heroes survived the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have a last pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam deliver to Major Ives or they will all die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to reduce the targets. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman receives an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a Mexican scout chased by a sexy Indian damsel, appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno from "West Side Story") and Robert Bray from "Lassie", fame is briefly presented like the badly disemboweled cavalry officer Kate had planned to marry. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot in the town of Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who killed Indian men, women and children in the infamous Sand massacre Creek, has kept a secret that he is a Native American, too! Ironically, the tense bow that Fire Knife bestows upon Adam at the start of hostilities is what our heroic explorer uses to kill Cheyenne's relentless warrior after she has run out of bullets. "The Yellow Tomahawk" concludes with an ambiguous note. The survivors arrive at another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives present their respective reports on the subject to an army general, but we never know the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or another question unanswered? The producer Howard W. Koch has no relationship with the "Casablanca" theatricalist Howard Koch. Ultimately, "The Yellow Tomahawk" is one of the many pro-Indian westerns that appeared after "Broken Arrow" (1950), where the Native American is seen as a noble savage unfairly treated by some but not all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns during the 50s and 60s, makes this little western tolerable despite his slender characters and difficult family situation. Calhoun stands out from a cast above average as the main man always useful, and it is worth seeing the attractive Castle, for its feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as usual in most of his early roles. Actually, Lesley Selander did a more satisfying dramatic version of this movie the previous year called "War Paint" (1953) with Robert Stack. By the way, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno became regulars in "The Rockford Files."
