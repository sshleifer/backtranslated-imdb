Imagine seeing a slide show where the projector stays on each slide long enough for you to memorize it completely three times. Now imagine that the images in the slide show consist entirely of mundane scenes. a small park; and empty tennis court; a piano. Now imagine that the people leading the slide show are having a frustratingly slow and semi-lucid conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the slides they show you. Excellent ?? you just imagined the whole movie "India Song". <br /> <br /> The film is an agonizingly slow montage of images that do little except simply shout "Look at me! I am PROFOUND! With such blatant self-importance that the images themselves and the film as a whole are not only lacking depth, but COMICALLY lacking in depth, the visual elements could have been easily replaced by a series of static images as described above, since it is very rare that there are people on the screen, and even when they are, people They move only a little more often than the furniture, do they never talk or interact in a meaningful way, they just sit there looking at each other, and from time to time they cry.The most energetic moment in the first hour of the film is when three people walk In fact, the images could have been omitted completely, since the story is completely told through The story is about a woman who hates India because it is hot, and hates people who do not hate her because she is hot (this point is discussed several times). It is also a man who feels he has the right to sleep with the aforementioned woman, since she will sleep with anyone who asks her, but he can not sleep with her simply because he never asks, and is very upset. about this. So he looks at her as a single tear runs deep down her cheek. Later, he looks at his bicycle, while a single tear runs deep down his cheek. Actually, you can not see the one tear running deep down your cheek when you're looking at your bike, but you know it's there anyway, just because that's the kind of movie it is. <br /> <br /> The best thing is that the narration becomes a background buzzing, which serves as a perfect complement to the images that induce coma. Simply staying conscious throughout the entirety of this film would require a supreme act of determination. Seeing it and really getting a serious and meaningful idea of ​​what was supposed to induce the same type of migraine would try to read long technical papers in the dark. This film is perhaps the greatest monument of pseudo-artistic pretension that man will ever know.
