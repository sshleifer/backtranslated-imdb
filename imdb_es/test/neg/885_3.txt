I like all the different types of movies, so this is not a hit in the romantic movies of a guy who just likes The Matrix, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> I felt it was a horrible movie. I do not feel that there is enough accumulation of characters to fall in love. They were there for a few days and while facing a severe hurricane and major problems in each of their lives, Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall in love desperately and helplessly. It is not realistic. This movie did not make me buy it and feel it emotionally, and that's something you're looking for in a good plot. Some emotional connection. If someone can relate to them falling in love so quickly, without any real substance, then so be it. You are neither good nor bad. Different strokes for different people. <br /> <br /> Another very unbelievable component of the movie was the very rude daughter of Diane Lane, who became kind and friendly at the end of the movie. Is a teenager who is so miserable and aggravated by her mother for not going back to her unfaithful husband going to have a change of ignition and be nice? This movie, in a few words, had some important names, but for me it was a big disappointment.
