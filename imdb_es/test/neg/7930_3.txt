This is another pseudo-intellectual "let's make the Nazis look really bad" in the movie. The Nazis were pretty bad, no doubt, most already knew. However, that does not necessarily make all the films on the subject good. A Discovery Channel presentation of "The Wannsee Conference" would have been much more interesting. <br /> <br /> The "conspiracy" falls on your ass between two categories: documentary and drama. It does not cut it like a documentary, the film is too "staged" and the presentation is too "common". It does not cut it as a drama, the characters are too shallow and conflicts are easily "resolved". <br /> <br /> Another thing is the motto: "One of the greatest crimes against humanity was perpetrated in just over an hour." As the film shows the Wannsee Conference, the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a consensus on the final solution. The decision on the solution had already been taken by the SS. The sole purpose of the meeting was to make all significant stakeholders commit to an already established plan. No decisions or plans were made at the Wannsee Conference. There were only threats and coercion (some needed less than others). <br /> <br /> Finally: Something that the film shows (although by no means exceptional) is that man has a tendency to resort to culture and aesthetics an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he is committing appalling atrocities. This is seen in most political and political "leaders".
