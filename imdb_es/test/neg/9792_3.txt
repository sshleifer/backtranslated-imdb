It is impossible to make a film based on a book like "The Brothers Karamzov" by F.M. Dostojevsky. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks is a great director, but that movie is at a very low level. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie was the ending. Well, let's think about the book. In the end we have the "guilty" Dimitrij Karamazov. Then they sent him to Siberia. In the end, Dostojevsky's famous epilogues, friends and family members make a plan to save him. But that's all ... and now the film takes two more steps and shows us an illusory end to the escape of Dimitry and Gruschenka (I think). Only from the moral point of view, I am sure that Dostojevsky would finish the book with an open ending because, on the one hand, he is not guilty (Smerdjakov is the real murderer) and that is why he has to be a free man. But, on the other hand, he goes to his father to kill him, so he has decided to commit the crime ... that's a moral dilemma, so the next point is an open ending ... well, really, just do not is complete. open. <br /> <br /> William Shatner as Aljoscha Karamazov ... Sorry! -> NO !!! <br /> <br /> The other characters are having a good performance, since we have to wait for such good actors ... In front, of course, an excellent performance by Yul Breynner as Dimitrij. I think there are not many actors that can play this part in a better way. <br /> <br /> But as I said at the beginning: this book is unadaptable. You should never shoot in two hours, that's impossible. I think there are some longer films, so perhaps they could do the right thing ... But I still think that this book can not be adapted. <br /> <br /> Then, 3 points: <br /> <br /> A point for the great director Richard Brooks <br /> <br /> A point for an excellent performance by Yul Brynner <br /> <br /> Finally: A point for one of the best writers of all time: dostojevsky
