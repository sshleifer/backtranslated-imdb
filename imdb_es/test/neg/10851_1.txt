The publicity of this movie suggests that it is shocking and sensational. Well, opera lovers see some strange sights in the opera houses, so it's no surprise that the Duke of Mantua urinates during his rehearsal of La Donna Ã¨ Mobile, nor is it sensational to see Gilda singing Caro Nome in bathroom. It's just crude and boring. What stands out about this movie is its lack of imagination. Director Corina Van Eijk places the duke's palace in a seedy pool. In fact, he's not the duke, he's just a character named Duka, so it's hard to see why he has many hangers and his own buffoon, Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in a council apartment that is furnished with an orange sofa and decorated with a stained wallpaper that is de rigueur among avant-garde directors. The dukes of Duke, I'm sorry, those of Duka are on scooters (Yawn). <br /> <br /> The concepts imposed in an opera like this can produce an unexpected and unintentional mood. What can we do for the fact that Gilda has a maid, even though she lives in an apartment? When we hear that Monterone is taken to jail, we see that two assistants wearing pink shorts take him out of the pool. One imagines that they are going to carry it with urinating in a public pool. <br /> <br /> It was common for opera films to be synchronized with the lips 20 years ago, but nowadays there is no excuse for that. A doubled opera is like soft porn. You do not believe in what is happening because the artists are not making enough effort. The actress in Gilda's role does not seem to have learned her lines correctly. He barely moves his lips when he is supposed to be singing. When she sings Caro Nome in the bathroom, she lies down with her legs slightly apart. It is difficult to say from which hole the sound is supposed to emanate. The duke, later, sings this while singing with Maddalena, giving a new meaning to the phrase "yodelling in the canyon". <br /> <br /> The sound environment never seems right with the orchestra sometimes sounding as if it is playing through a transistor radio. Quite slow, rumpity-tumpity tempos are preferred, so the overall effect is that of a karaoke at your local pub. <br /> <br /> This is a film from an Opera Spanga production. Spanga is a village in Friesland in the Netherlands. They are usually done in a tent in a field. If I had been watching this performance in a tent in a field in Friesland, I would have been quite lenient. By filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience, the villagers are also kept open to the world ridicule.
