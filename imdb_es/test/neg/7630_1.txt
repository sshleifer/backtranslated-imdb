I thought that Sliver offered the most boring and trivial "trick" that ended in the history of the movie, but, of course, I was wrong. I had no disappointment that this movie was going to be good. Unfortunately, it was worse than I expected. The worst part is that the obvious ending is so ridiculous and horrible that you can not believe it until it really happens.
