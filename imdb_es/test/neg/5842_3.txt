It's awesome boring, completely predictable and, in the end, simply laughable. That sums up quite well the disaster that is Indecent Proposal. Starting with a decent premise, everything falls apart and becomes a complete disaster. Basically, the story boils down to the question: "Would you let your wife sleep with another man for a million dollars?" Here, of course, the answer is yes, because otherwise we would not have a movie. Frankly, we would have been better if we did not have a movie. <br /> <br /> Our married couple (and with financial problems) is played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. They go to Las Vegas to enrich themselves. Yes, that will work. Anyway, a billionaire, played by Robert Redford, likes the wife and makes the million dollar offer. For one night with the wife will give them financial security. The consequences of that night is what the film is really about. Unfortunately, none of that is the most entertaining. The script is so predictable that you can say the lines of the characters before they do it. The performances leave much to be desired. Harrelson would be better off if he became attached to the comedies, since this attempt to act seriously loses the mark. Anguish is not something that seems capable of portraying. And it's pretty safe to say that Demi Moore will never have to empty space in her home for any Academy Award. Why is she a movie star again? In a part that should be full of emotion, it does not transmit any. Only Redford escapes mostly unharmed. He is appropriately thin but soft and clearly the best actor in the group. But he can not save this movie. A horrible script, a bad performance, a slow rhythm, zero entertainment ... The indecent proposal is downright horrible.
