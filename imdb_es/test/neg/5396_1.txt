SKELETON MAN was fine for the first 5 minutes, but as soon as the so-called "Special Forces Agents" arrived on the screen, they came down the hill faster than a fat kid on a sled. <br /> <br /> The opening makes us think that we could have a horror movie, fun and funny, but no ... the filmmakers ruin any hope of that when the "Special Force Agents" appear. I wish the scriptwriter would take a different route and that the "skeleton man" would persecute some naive teenagers until one of them finally takes the lead. Instead, the "Skeleton Man" chases some "Special Force Agents" of weak wits and hires them until their Captain finally gets the advantage. "something that has been done before, but would have been more suitable for a movie like this. <br /> <br /> When the" Skeleton Man "finally encounters his" call "disappearance, in a building that explodes, a Police officer outside the building asks the Captain of the "Special Force Agents": "What the hell happened there?" My answer to that question: "Who the hell cares?"
