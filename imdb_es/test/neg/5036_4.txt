The brief existence of The Sex Pistols and the making of this film after the controversial and revolutionary break of the English punk band happened before I was born. However, I started listening to their only album, "Never Mind the B * &% @ # & s, Here the Sex Pistols", in 2003, when I was a teenager, and I quickly became a big fan. I did not see "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle" until 2006, but I saw it a couple of times that year, and I thought it was pretty good (certainly not excellent, but pretty good), even if I could only remember fragments. Of that, and I did not see how everything connected. When I saw him for the third time, almost three years after the second, I did not care much. I'm not even sure what I found so good about the majority in the first place (I can not remember now). <br /> <br /> This movie is a fake documentary, in which Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren tells him about the history of the band and its members; guitarist Steve Jones, credited here as "The Crook"; drummer Paul Cook, credited as "The Tea-Maker"; bassist Sid Vicious, credited as "The Gimmick"; and John Lydon (a.k.a. Johnny Rotten) credited as "The Contributor". McLaren claims that he created the band (and even the punk rock genre) as a scam to make money. He tells much of the story to Helen Wellington-Lloyd (a.k.a. Helen of Troy), in several places where they go together. It's basically a mix of talking McLaren, Pistols songs, live images of the band, fiction scenes (often silly, weird), various cartoon sequences, etc., all together in a movie, to tell the side of the story of the Pistols manager. In a strange way! <br /> <br /> It has been proven that McLaren is a liar, I know that many have already pointed it out, including the members of the band. It was not the driving force of the band, it did not create them (nor did it invent punk rock, and The Sex Pistols was not even the first punk band, although they were unique). The members of the band were the ones who made the band what it was. "The Filth and the Fury", a much more credible film about the band of Julien Temple, who made this film, is told from the point of view of the members of the band, who contradict McLaren's claims. However, the dishonesty of "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle" is not my biggest problem. If it were really entertaining (which I used to think it was to a certain extent), I would be able to overlook it, as it's obvious I used to do. During my third visit, apart from the Sex Pistols songs, some live images and at least a slightly funny cartoon sequence, it was pretty boring! I found the song "Who Killed Bambi" a bit funny at first, but it quickly got tired. <br /> <br /> Is it worth seeing this fantastical documentary for Sex Pistols fans? It seems that a good number of fans would say that it is, not to learn about the real story of the punk band of the 70, of short duration but revolutionary, but for entertainment. That was once my opinion about "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle." After the first time I saw it, I could not remember anything of what McLaren said, and when I saw it a second time, I realized what the Pistols manager was using this movie to insinuate, but I could barely remember anything. I heard him say! Obviously, other aspects of the film were what I found impressive. Now, after my third visit, I can definitely remember some of the things that McLaren says, but it was still not 100% clear. Like most of the movie, I think their words are not so memorable, probably because of the way they present themselves. If you're a fan of the Pistols, I think it would not hurt to give "Swindle" a try, but for me, for the most part, it's just an incoherent and boring mess that tries to be funny but fails.
