I would have given it less than 1 rating if possible. The whole movie should have been left on the floor of the cutting room. What a pathetic waste of time, money and effort! Let's see ... gather the most beautiful cast you can find (which, of course, is in direct proportion to the amount of talent you lack) ... gather the finest plan you can unearth ... and viola! An abominable piece of garbage that the director and / or producer should be ashamed to put his name on. How much WORST can the horror genre get? And do not use the "low budget" as an excuse ... I've seen many BIG low budget movies ... in fact, some of the best horror classics of all time were low budget. If you do not have the talent and ingenuity to make a GOOD horror movie, then, for God's sake, do not do one at all!
