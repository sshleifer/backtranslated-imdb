Whoever compared this with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, I certainly knew what he was talking about. I could also have compared it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. "Kay Hoog" reminds us of one more than Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The Shadow, the quintessential mystery man, and the first "Dark Knight" was also thought to be a Kent Allard.) If one took the first name of Savage and added the Kent, it will end with - voila - Clark Kent. Funny, is not it?) Like Indiana Jones, Hoog is not above stealing the artifacts of an ancient civilization (though his thefts are often more brazen and less "mischievously roguish" than Jones's). Unfortunately, this double division is very far from subsequent series (of any epoch) in terms of general quality. One of the first indications that something is wrong in relation to the film narrative is a scene in which the desperate on horseback, literally breathing in his neck, simply watch as Hoog escapes from his clutches in a hot air balloon. The reason why they do not bother to shoot down the globe is just one of the many cinematic mysteries that beset these two films. <br /> <br /> The second half of this double division is even worse than the first. Of course, this was one of the first series and, as such, should be reduced a little, but there are limits, even, to tolerance. (At one point, the hero's capture is not made on the screen, but in the narration itself! Let's talk about the shortcuts ...) Fritz Lang is one of the best filmmakers who has ever made films; unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did, THE SPIDERS is a bitter pill to swallow ...
