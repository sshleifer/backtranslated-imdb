First I must mention that, as a peer group, we often find entertainment in movies that are known to be terrible for their comedy value, hence our Camp Blood rental. <br /> <br /> Camp Blood was the first movie we had rented that had been filmed on what appears to be a camcorder, and it was so absurd that it was not even funny. <br /> <br /> The DVD was returned and a refund was requested, with the additional suggestion of some. A type of quality control is implemented to prevent so much garbage from being stored. <br /> <br /> Do not do what I did, and curiosity overcomes you, it's so bad that it's not even funny.
