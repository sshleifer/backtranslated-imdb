I watched this movie with an audience of ... 5 in total! I had to choose between Lakshya and Assemblyhav ... (he realized that he should have gone for Lakshya). A typical plot ... India v Pakistan ... but it's just not cricket since you have Kashmir in the middle. An Indian superhero goes on a mission to save the president of India from some Pakistani rebels who are involved in a drug scam. I left the movie halfway, as it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and everywhere. The songs were also horrible, the film tries to hide the flaws with its special effects, but unfortunately they are also outdated. <br /> <br /> In general ... avoid it if you can, it has to be the worst movie. I've seen this year.
