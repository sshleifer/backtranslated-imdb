This film tries to take advantage of the success of Richard Curtis' films, particularly "Love Actually" (which I loved), a series of disparate scenes that follow the love life of several couples. <br /> <br /> It's a great idea poorly executed. The script tries to be a little too smart and just does not resonate. Most of the action is based, which is more a reflection on the director than on the actors. <br /> <br /> The version I saw (on an airplane) was called "Scenes from a Park", which is a more appropriate title. As not all the scenes were of "sexual nature". <br /> <br /> I really wanted to see this movie, but in the end it is disappointing. Do not bother yourself
