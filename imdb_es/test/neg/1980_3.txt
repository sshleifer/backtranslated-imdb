I was dizzy with joy when I found out about this movie shortly after seeing Spirits Within. <br /> <br /> After years of anticipation, they gave the release date in November 2005. Well, November came. And went. Followed in December. Oh, look, today January 31, 2006. There is still no release in the US. UU <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I'm so glad to have a friend with a pirated subtitled copy. ; D <br /> <br /> Well, the CG was great. Not as good as expected, but almost perfect. However, I shrugged off the unnatural movements made by the children throughout the film. I thought we had already passed this. Also, I really did not care about the anime appearance that was given to their faces. I had the impression that they were looking for a realistic image of the film and yet, most of the characters have bigger than normal eyes, especially the female characters. Although they had personality, I will give them that. <br /> <br /> Although I am not a big anime fan, I have to say that I was impressed by the wild fighting scenes. They were very well animated and had me hanging on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> During the first two. <br /> <br /> And there's the biggest flaw of Advent Children's. For the most part they are only a handful of hypersilized fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> For years a sequel to FF7 with epic proportions was promised. Instead, they gave us a nice piece of CG with just a plot to excuse that is a little less than two hours long. <br /> <br /> Where Final Fantasy is famous for its intricate stories, this film falls short. You really do not get to know the characters. The only way to understand most of what happened in the movie would have been if you had played the game. We could barely see them before they were fighting against any current threat. <br /> <br /> What most hurts the fans are the terrible cameos that most of the characters of FF7 received. They were nothing more than Cloud's. "I'll call you if I need you, but I probably will not," to the singers. And, to increase the damage, they made each character throw Cloud higher and higher. This little part here was so corny that I almost turned it off. I would have been much more impressed if I had jumped on my own, bouncing off the walls to climb higher. <br /> <br /> It hurt even more when they reduced the Turks to less than-just comedic relief. That was good for the game, but this is cinema. People do not act like cartoon characters in a tough battle. They took away their dignity: / <br /> <br /> And, spoiler (yes, of course, most of you probably already know, anyway). Who remembers that Darth Maul was promoted in SW: Episode 1? Yes, now, imagine that, but with Sephiroth. It's okay. I had maybe 5 minutes of screen time. Maybe that. End Spoiler: P <br /> <br /> If this movie was made for the fans, then you have to go to Square. If this is an indication of the direction in which you take the FF series, I doubt you will see much of my money. I played your games for the wonderful story and the great characters. <br /> <br /> You had the chance to do something epic. Something really beautiful, a masterpiece that faces all the Disney CG movies. <br /> <br /> Instead, you gave us a piece of meat with almost nothing underneath to hold it together. The way to follow. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure that if the rest of the fans stopped for a moment and tried to pay attention to everything, except the CG they would know what I'm talking about. Well, I was going to qualify this as 5/10, but after thinking about it while I corrected it, I give it a 3/10 because they could have done it better. They have done better. And this is simply sad. <br /> <br /> If you are going to redo something FFVII, you must first do this.
