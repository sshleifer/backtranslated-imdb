Basically, this was obviously designed to be promotional material for the film produced by the same horrible director, which is even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst movie I've seen, so avoid it at all costs. <Br /> <br /> Regarding this documentary, it is entertaining; Entertaining and blatantly deceptive! Most likely, most "historical" looking images are just that, historical images of unrelated events that were cut and pasted in this documentary to make them more dramatic than they ever would have been. There is no doubt that Waverly is a very interesting place with a lot of its own fascinating history, but the making of a documentary to market the place and the related production is, for lack of better words, terribly useless. <br /> <br /> And Yes, I have lived in Kentucky all my life and have visited the place several times. Waverly Hills deserves respect; And there is nothing respectful in this lame documentary.
