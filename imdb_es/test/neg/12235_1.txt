This movie is a terrible attempt at a parody. His attempts to parody several sports movies are half-hearted and not at all funny. <br /> <br /> Even things that should be fun, like the Indian women's kick that always wears a traditional dress with their uniform, are not. very funny. The fact that the football team studied and got good grades which made the coach angry did not laugh either. <br /> <br /> The plot of having a traditional loser has one more chance when training a high school football loser. The team really had potential as a parody. It's a classic and trite sports theme. But, unfortunately, the script was too weak for ANY cast to achieve. And this cast is no exception. <br /> <br /> There is a free use of women in bikini and underwear, so not everything is bad in that regard. <br /> <br /> But Animal House or Talladega Nights, this is not.
