An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous bag of nuts (side note: I would love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a movie together, talk about the cheekbones!). The soundtrack was not terrible either. <br /> <br /> But the performance, even that of professionals like Drago and Debbie Rochon, was terrible, the direction was worse (maybe it contributed to the first one), the dialogue like the chimpanzee, and the work of the camera , hardly tolerable. However, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale. I do not know where this was filmed, but if I had to guess, it would be an open-air museum or one of those recreation villages, where everything is too well preserved to do more. that suggest the "true old west." Okay, so it was filmed in the budget of a college kid. That said, I could have forgiven one or two of the faults mentioned above. But taken all together, and being generous, I could not see more than three stars.
