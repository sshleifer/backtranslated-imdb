Are you the one who lives? OK, I think I'm smart, cultured, liberal and I really like movies. I like it a lot and I have a great sense of humor. I had the impression that it was a sadly painful comedy. They were paid to do this, gas was used, electricity was burned, food was consumed, games were built ... why? I blame the current state of the world in this film and all those people related to it, they will even include us to the public that sees them. We are all guilty and we deserve whatever comes. It's not funny, it does not happen much, everyone seems bored or bored. There are no conversations, communication is minimal. There is no plot that I know of. In fact, I just lost 89 minutes of something in my life. I will never recover that time again. The only message I have received is that maybe life is too short to watch movies of people who do not do much ... and then you die!
