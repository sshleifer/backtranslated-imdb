First of all, I do not know if I was supposed to use my imagination in this movie or if the director was trying to save money or have a small budget. Here we go ... <br /> <br /> Basically there were so many years and gaps that I do not understand, it's as if the movie jumped from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so many gaps that ask questions like hell did this happen? and because? I think this is a great flow. Forget the criticism that continues to whine about history, this film not only has problems of historical events, but also has many flaws. So most people keep saying that, seeing this in the cinema, they will lose all the cinematography, like rivers, deserts, etc., it is true that they are beautiful, so I waited for the release of BluRay 1080p. IN AGREEMENT! Fine scenes but what's the use of that? I turned off the movie after 1 hour and a half, I just lost interest. The film continued to do exactly the same jumping in years (at least Mr. Director put, for example, after 2 years after 10 years!) I mean I could not watch the movie! Anyway, I'd like to be able to include spoilers, but when you decide to watch this movie, ask yourself how this happened. You will know what I mean! Do not watch this movie is a waste of time.
