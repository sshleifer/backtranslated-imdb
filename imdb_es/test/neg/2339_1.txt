It's a joke, right? Lynch could not be produced as a television show. I was without money, so what to do? Well, he somehow got some dollars and "completed" the pilot and created this mess by simply mixing everything together ... How can someone see a failed pilot for television as a cinematic masterpiece ?! <br /> <br /> And now, are you all guessing about the deeper meaning? Well, wake up, there's none! As in that other Lynch television series, what was the name again? Same procedure there. Build a mystery and find nothing. I guess Lynch will repeat this concept until people notice, the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> In Germany there is a comedian named Harpe Kerkerling. He dressed as an opera singer and "played" some new "art songs". Singing a complete nonsense like this: <br /> <br /> "The wolf, the lamb, in the meadow, Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> It's a classic now. <br /> <br /> Anyway, then he discussed it with the audience. And they were talking seriously about the deeper meaning of the wolf / lamb relationship. <br /> <br /> You guys, who give this movie a rating of 8.0 on imdb.com, could be one of them. <br /> <br /> Then let's say it all together: "Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> 0/10 Macaulay J.
