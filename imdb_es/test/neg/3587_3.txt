We have already seen a story like this before: a wife in marital problems (played by Nastassja Kinski) engages in sexual relations with a stranger (William Baldwin) and then wants to return to her life with her husband and her girl. When she returns home, she discovers that her husband has finally found a job. Everything seems bright. However, Kinski discovers that the new boss of her husband is actually the stranger who still shows interest in her and seems to do anything to get what he wants. What to do? You do not say anything? <br /> <br /> I really did not like the movie. While it was not only bad, it clearly lacked "that something". Maybe he should have focused more on what's going on inside Kinski's head. There's nothing to say about the actors themselves (I think Baldwin was a good choice for the role of the obsessed boss), but the characters seemed somewhat stereotyped, acting the way you would see the characters acting in your television movies everyday Finally, the ending completely ruined what could have been an interesting plot. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the film tried to look good, had some unstable camera work here and there, some photos, quick cuts and glamor. , but in the end I think it fits much better with the productions of Spelling. The same goes for music. Otherwise, it did not look too bad. <br /> <br /> Some might like this, but it definitely was not my cup of tea. To be fair, I do not usually see this kind of thrillers very much. This one felt too long, even if it only lasted an hour and a half, I think it could have worked better as a one-hour episode in some TV series. There was absolutely no need for some of the scenes, especially the shower scene. <br /> <br /> My advice: Try it before you buy!
