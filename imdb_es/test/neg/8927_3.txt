The bad action films are the cemeteries of the aging of the stars of the martial art. In such films they struggle to maintain that dangerous behavior that made their initial work successful, but all end in failure. Seagal is too old for this kind of role, but he will not let go ... no matter how stupid it may seem. Some expect their current work to bring magic back, but there is no magic left. The late '80s and early' 90s belonged to Steven Seagal and his work made me a fan. I could see him fit very well in a place in The Sopranos where his overweight body, his sensual features and his sullen attitude could have found a home. I wonder what is the return in your career from direct to the video films? As it produces them, I assume that the $$$ is more than satisfactory. If this is the deal, we will be subjected to badly made Seagal action movies well into the 60s and 70s.
