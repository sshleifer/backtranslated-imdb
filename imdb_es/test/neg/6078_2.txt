Let me start with a personal note as a movie and TV fan, more on the fun side: I love what James Woods can do and has done, and I always love Melanie Griffith, and Natasha Wagner was very good at this horrible thing. miserable, stinky essay on "real crime". <br /> <br /> Whoever actually wrote this movie, apparently, never spent time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents: yes, some thieves are drug addicts but they have very short careers as thieves. Really successful thieves are rarely caught because they do not do "junk" or any drugs before going to a bookmark (job). <br /> <br /> The character of James Woods was faithful to this paradigm at the beginning of this film. , and then the script completely unraveled. He becomes a crazy, alcoholic lunatic ... good job for a guy with ropes like Woods, maybe, but not credible in the least. <br /> <br /> Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work, they would work. <br /> <br /> These people in this movie are beautiful, self-indulgent and narcissistic losers addicted to drugs. They could not get a real score in the real world, in the real world where a large and robust security guard who defeats the hell of a skinny child (as in the first scenes of this "DOG"), keeps it Defeated and not lets it go up Never. <br /> <br /> How many ways did I find to hate this movie? Many. Even totally vulgar people, like most thieves and hide-and-seek addicts, have a wider vocabulary than these cretins. And the 'scam' scenes with the neo-Nazi cyclists? Puhlease. All Rednecks are not neo-Nazis and those who are Neo-Nazi speed dealers are not so stupid! <br /> <br /> This movie won two because Natasha Wagner was extremely good in her role as Rose and because Melanie Griffith still has "that something special" or, at least, she had it for this brutal and offensively stupid movie. I'm not someone to sing praises of real criminals for any reason, but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible movie is that everyone would be dead or in jail for Act 2, Scene 1. Watch a lousy movie of Zombies is passed a better time than this ... thing ... and I hate zombies.
