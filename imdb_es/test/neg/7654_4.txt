(May contain spoilers) This movie is the epitome of rarity. I rented it expecting a movie so bad it would be funny. However, honestly I still can not decide if this movie was to scare or make humor. It combines emotions in a very disturbing way. Apparently, this is trying to be smart, but in reality it is not. For example, when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher, he starts playing happy music. When we go to Toxico, we have hike, quasi-Sr. The music of the neighborhood of Roger. However, when the little boy dreams of falling into "blood" and when he finds the leg, it is clear that his intention is to be tense. Then, watch this movie, and decide for yourself. It's too strange to be described in words and for that I say, congratulations. <br /> <br /> "Snorkeling ... WOW!"
