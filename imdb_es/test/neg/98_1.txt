<br /> <br /> Never take a movie just for its good looks. <br /> <br /> Although everything starts well, the film suffers the same imperfections that it sees in the series B movies. It is like at a certain moment the writer does not know how to finish the film, so it ends with a way that nobody suspects that he thinks in this way that he is ingenious. <br /> <br /> A movie that should appear at the top of the garbage list. <br /> <br />
