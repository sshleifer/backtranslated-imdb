This self-important and confusing "film" of b + w looks like a baby on a very bad acid trip. You're dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotten lettuce that accidentally fell out of the back of a garbage truck: no one cares to touch it because it will probably be dragged by the water down the drain of the storm. There is no space for the plot when you have "visceral images" and "subtle" allegories. For me, it seems that the director tries to make the next great art film while asking for intellectual praise. I did not bring my beret either. Seeing this, I felt almost insulted since the "movie" does such an effective job of distancing yourself from you.
