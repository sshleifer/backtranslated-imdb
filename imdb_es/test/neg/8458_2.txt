I used to think that "It Came from Hollywood" was the worst movie I had seen that showed clips from horror movies, science fiction, crime and drama. Of course, I had not seen THIS beauty yet. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with "Terror in the Aisles"? Four things: <br /> <br /> 1) It assumes that most of the great moments in the history of shock cinema began in the 70s when directors such as John Carpenter and Brian De Palma arrived. And what bones are thrown at the true classics (ie, black and white films) like "Frankenstein", "Dracula" and "The Werewolf" are shown with Martin and Lewis or Abbott and Costello next door or not! <br /> <br /> 2) Most of the time, the clips are so short and out of place with their originals that they only cause a momentary impact to the viewer and, for those who are not familiar with these films, they will not have no sense (in fact, the moment when the shark jumps out of the water in Roy Scheider in "Jaws" is largely shown to the effect of a visual gag, while, in the context of the original, it had power.) <br /> <br /> 3 Do we really need Pleasance and Allen in the audience that reminds us that "it's just a movie" or that most of the violence in horror movies "is, unfortunately, against women"? So, is it an accusation against the filmmakers to add those scenes or the film assistants who come into the theaters and watch the same type of forage again and again? I'm sorry, it's a bunch of worms to open for a more deserving movie. <br /> <br /> 4) And most importantly, why is the movie so SHORT? It is not that there is not enough of this type of movies to use. If they had just opened their resources and used EVERY movie available, they could have had a movie like "That's entertainment!" That would have been comparatively more entertaining. Hell, I even drag Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (Cushing was alive then, of course) and, better yet, even Vincent Price would have been more than willing, I bet! What joy I would have received from the audience! <br /> <br /> But no ... all that we have left is a sad little movie that tries to pay tribute to these films, but all it does is leave the film The viewer feels cheated for less than 90 minutes with those who could have gone to see a REAL movie. Do not get me wrong It was good to see what clips they showed, but if they could have done more with the products! <br /> <br /> Two stars. Another good idea was to leave it "in the hallways".
