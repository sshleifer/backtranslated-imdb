You know, I'm getting tired of all the generic music that is used in this kind of movies (see Jawbreaker, Disturbing Behavior, etc.). Each scene of genuine tension here (and there is some) is immediately reduced with a corny pop melody, completely diluting the suspense. Why do they do that? Of course, to sell some soundtracks, but in this case, mission not fulfilled, did someone buy the CD? add kick). But what are Molly, Leslie and Vivica doing here? Their roles (they are so underutilized that I can not use "characters" here) have no purpose in the story, so I can not understand why three famous actresses were chosen. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the ending is incredibly trite and irresponsible. The children get out of bed and act as if nothing happened, all smiles upon graduation. They are criminals, people! There are no consequences for their actions (kidnapping, assault, manipulation of degree) - nothing. <br /> <br /> Little things too: was Tingle's story about her husband the truth? What's up with the crossbow? Would the character of Katie lose the cherry on a whim like that? (Great message, guys.) Why did McKean go to his house? How did Kate's academic nemesis walk through the door at that exact moment? How do students get directions from teachers? WHAT IS WITH JEFFREY DRUM? On what basis did McKean shoot Tingle? She is bloody, abused and kidnapped by the students, for the good of all! <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I'm thinking a lot more about the script than Mr. Williamson apparently did, so I'll stop here. br /> <br /> 3/10
