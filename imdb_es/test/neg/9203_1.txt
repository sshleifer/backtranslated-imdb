1) Bad performance. <br /> <br /> 2) For a group of castaways on an alien planet, it sure looked like home, especially with the houses and roads you can see in the background. <br /> <br /> 3) A terrible plot with stupid characters who make idiotic decisions and happily lose the precious survival equipment and clothes left, right and center. <br /> <br /> 4) Fantastic science fiction costumes from the 70s (possibly the only good thing about this movie) <br /> <br /> 5) Interesting boat at the beginning (this crew must have been watching a lot the Space 1999). Too bad it explodes so early. The escape ship also sank too fast. * sigh * <br /> <br /> 6) Anthropologists may find some aspects of the film interesting in terms of primate group behavior.
