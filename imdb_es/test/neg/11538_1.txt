This movie can not decide what it is, a soft movie or a science fiction movie. It is not enough argument for a real movie, but too much for a porn movie. <br /> <br /> In a galaxy far away, a good princess (we know she is good because she has long blond hair, she wears a white robe). , is educated, and grieves sadly of his dying mother when we see her for the first time) inherits the kingdom over his older sister, who is evil (and we know because he has dark hair and wears too much makeup, abuses his sexual slaves male, mocks and curls her lip all the time, and speaks imperiously about the horrors she will perpetrate when she is the queen). The evil princess gets angry and tries to take a coup, but the good sister escapes to Earth. Of course, she materializes Buck naked in a bar during a wet t-shirt contest. It really goes downhill from there. The acting is ridiculous, the dialogue seems like it was written for a porn movie and the general plot is ridiculous. There is not even enough skin to make happy the kind of person who would take care of this for skin. I love the "good" bad movies, and this is not even nice at the level of "bad movies".
