At the opposite end of the spectrum from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is David Hemmings' absolutely inferior adventure with respect to the rescue of a World War II aircraft with a valuable cargo. The assets include the beautiful setting of New Zealand, the energetic music of Brian May and some helicopter flights and jet boats. The bad, however, far exceeds the good. Donald Pleasence the hams like never before; Half of their dialogue is almost unintelligible. George Peppard tries an Australian accent (I think), then abandons him in half. Lesley Ann Warren is at its most irritating. Ken Wahl is, well, Ken Wahl. The dialogue is painful to listen to and the direction of Hemmings is largely inept. The script is not only obvious but terrible. The jokes are discouraged, the scenes have no force and the continuity is practically nonexistent. According to the final credits, two men died piloting jet boats during the making of the film. What a waste.
