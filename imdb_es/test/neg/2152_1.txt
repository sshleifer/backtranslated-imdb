I just can not believe that the people who did and acted in this movie really took it seriously. Skits in SNL seem more real. Everything was ridiculously false. The nonsense, the ridiculous fist fights, the dialogue, the background music, and even the blind eye of Bo. If it had been cataloged as a comedy, it would still have made more sense but it would still be bad. I can see this as "entertainment" only if you get a room full of drugged college students who see it as if it were Rocky Horror Picture Show. Imagine some of the things you saw in Blazing Saddles, like Mongo knocking down the horse or the old woman getting punched in the stomach. Now imagine that the producer wants you to take those scenes seriously and get the details of this disaster.
