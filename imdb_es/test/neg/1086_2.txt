I am very surprised to see the good grades of this movie. <br /> <br /> 9 years ago I saw the movie and I still remember how angry I felt to sit in the cinema and watch this disaster. I'm a big fan of John Boorman's work. I really like his movies. So I went to "Beyond Rangoon" with great expectations. But I wanted to see a silly, cheap movie from the jungle of Chuck Norris with all the action scenes cut out. Even the soundtrack was very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that John Boorman was the director because this movie was so badly made. I think the Burmese people deserve better films to illustrate their struggle.
