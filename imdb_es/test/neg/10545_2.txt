The first toxic film was dark, bloody and hilarious. This movie is a bloody battle for jazz music, it's not a real gore, and the worst mask I've ever seen! His deep voice is now a light and happy voice, the characters of part 1 reappear by actors who do not look at all like them (Claire, mom Junko), the names of the characters change (Claire or Sara?). It lacks all the brutal violence, black humor and political imprecision of the first film. If it were not for nudity, this movie could have been classified as PG. I'm really lame. However, I'm a big fan of part 1, but I can not stand this.
