This movie is delayed, a cheap movie that tries to be a fool movie because the characters are looking for a pot, but none of them is a smoker, just a lot of trash that Thomas Hayden's church should no longer direct, especially this movie that It is a waste of film. People who liked this movie made good comments, but of all the people here, some are delayed and do not watch movies, so they think that any bad movie is good, the actors suck and the movie sucks balls. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people are going to get mad because this movie tries to look like the best weed movie when it's the worst movie about weeds I've seen. I hope people prevent the director from running trash like this weed can not even make this movie fun or entertaining.
