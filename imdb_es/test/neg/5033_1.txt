I turned this off in the first five minutes. It is very sick and disturbing, the moment I turned it off was when the beautiful white horse was left in the slaughterhouse and his skull was pierced by a small tubular instrument. This creature was lying on the ground in shock before dying. The narrator said that the animal dies instantaneously, it was not like that. I do not agree with the graphic realism towards animals, insects or any living creature. I felt very disappointed, since I had just seen 'Eyes Without a face', which was a brilliant film and this short film was attached, which ruined my night, since I could not hurt a fly, I do not mind seeing this wild documentary. <Br /> <br /> reading other reviews on this page, I had noticed that they used words like aesthetics, this is not art or beauty. I can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic.
