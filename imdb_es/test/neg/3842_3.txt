In moments when I see this movie, I start to think that the people who made this movie were drugged. What's wrong with this movie? I'll tell you Bad Plot, Bad Jokes. Acting badly and with disordered characters, everything is simply bad. <br /> <br /> The film is about Pest Vargas, a two-bit swindler who has the possibility of surviving for $ 24,000 by a German hunter who kills people to survive. Therefore, Pest must think of ways to do it. think of this hunter before they kill him. <br /> <br /> I know what you think "What the hell is this?" Another aspiring Ace Ventura trying to get money really this plot is boring and confusing sometimes changes the plot of the story and you get lost during the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the funny scenes of this movie, I had a serious face oh yeah, I smiled a couple of times, but nothing laughs out loud. In addition, the jokes are cheesy and seen before, it's like seeing Ace Ventura meets Dumb and Dumber, but bad. dry and flat. You do not learn much about the main character. The only thing you know is that he is an annoying con man swindler, but that does not change his image or is a bit smart, just corny.as for the German hunter all you are that is crazy and wants to return to Germany. You really start to wonder why this man lives on an island if he has money to go to Germany. The hunter's son, Himmel, is doing better, but not much. He is really a coward and he is a snake. obsessed by the reasons for the end He confronts his father and allies himself with Pest. <br /> <br /> Regarding the performance there was not or There were only some memorable achievements, but a little bit above. For example, John Legizomo is so exaggerated in terms of performance and does not fit into his role, is out of place, as Jeffery Jones, who plays the hunter in the same way but offers a stereotyped performance. as well. As for the rest, it simply is not used enough or is excessive. <br /> <br /> in general, a bad comedy that you will find for $ 2.00 in K-Mart.
