From late adolescence to the 1920s, Stan Laurel was a solo act in films. During this period of time, Laurel was definitely not among the highest levels of talent and her humor is not as good as contemporaries such as Lloyd or Keaton. However, for the short comedies of the second level, he created a decent niche. As for the quality of the films, they varied enormously. Some, like DR. PYCKLE AND MR. PRYDE, it was amazing, while most had an average quality or lower than the average. <br /> <br /> FARZEN HEARTS is a strange movie. Like many of the films he made for Hal Roach and distributed by Path√© during this period, the costumes were absolutely first class and the film looked very good. However, despite this and with the support of people like James Finlayson, one thing they forgot to include in this film was humor. None of the jokes seems to work and the movie seems almost a drama, not a comedy. Only really fun cards betray the kind of movie that is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> My advice is that you try to see all your Laurel and Hardy movies and then watch the movies alone. In addition to DR. PYCKLE, try to watch THE SOILERS and MUD AND SAND - two of your most tolerable solo shorts.
