The photography is good, the costumes are good, but the edition is bad. The various scenes are cut, or stopped at the wrong times, and the conversations are s-l-o-w and tedious. This slowness continues the whole show. It is a very tedious show to watch. . . . I think more scenes should have been added, but that would make it a longer show. It is very slow. The writers should have done ONLY a 1-night show, and not prolong our agony night after night. There is nothing else on, otherwise I would change the channel (the first night). I feel bad for the Indians of the time, and I am angry with the white men for what they did with the Indians, but that is our story.
