The story deals briefly with the priest of businessmen who lack faith, Daniel Clemens (Christian Slater), who is watching more closely a case where another priest is suspected of murder. The priest denies that he is guilty, but at the same time he can not discuss the matter due to confidentiality. Enter Daniel Clemens, who starts playing the police ... <br /> <br /> Although the plot is not ridiculous, everything else is ridiculous. Let's start with the visual side, the cinematography is boring, it's more like a television series than a movie. The angles of the camera are boring, in fact, there is not a single memorable camera angle in the whole movie. There are no interesting close-ups that reveal details. And the transitions of the scene, well, there is not much to say about them, they are not easy, it seems that there is no connection between the scenes that the real plot. Okay, they used a transition with music between two scenes, but there are no interesting visual transitions throughout the film, the dissolution times were used, there was no visual connection between the scenes. <br /> <br /> The Boring The visual part could be forgiven if the movie offered something else. Unfortunately, the film only offers a forced wooden performance and a clumsy dialogue without a blow. In addition to that, the film has audio problems, the volume of the sound is reduced several times in the film as if the microphones were too far away. <br /> <br /> I did not predict the solution of the movie. It could be because the movie never gave me the opportunity or it could be due to the presentation, which was so boring that I did not even try to understand it. <br /> <br /> Put two plus two together and it's the same as a B-movie where 'B' means boring.
