I am currently fighting for the "Fall and Decay of the Roman Empire" by Gibbon, so I have all Roman things in my mind. I have not advanced much yet, perhaps more than two hundred pages, but it is amazing how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I think that until now I have read 15 emperors and only Antonius, Trajan and Hadrian have not been killed or at least suspected of being killed. I have also been fascinated by the crazy excesses of many of these princes of Rome. Not the least practitioner of these was Caligula. This leads me to review this movie. I think of the film on a historical basis insofar as I understand it from Gibbon's explanation of Rome, as well as in other investigations of some good websites and some fiction novels about the period. <br /> <br /> My point is that I do not think this film is what it is believed to be by many of its supporters. I do not believe that the depravity shown with sex and the horrific violence of this film qualifies it as accurate. The general ideas of the film seem accurate. Caligula is raised on an island, exiled with his family and afraid of being killed by the increasingly mad, suspicious and strange Emperor Tiberius. Grows paranoid and scared, and can never get rid of the nickname given him by his guards, Little Boots, this helps him grow up feeling abused and helpless. He is given the empire after Tiberius dies, the Senate expects him to move away from the informant squads that caused death at the whim of the former paranoid tyrant and drove Rome away from the madness in which the dictator had settled. Caligula begins as a decent emperor, though without hands, but becomes ill, almost dies and returns from the edge of febrile death like a true monster. Your perversities with your sisters start here, if not before. He has Macro murdered and many others who were his supporters originally. The acts of madness did not seem to be the murders of Caligula but his new thought of himself as a living God. He saw him talking to the statue of Jupiter as a condemned alike. His violent and crazy excesses would have condemned him anyway, and three years seems to have been a pretty decent race for Tiberius's successors. Well, the film basically adheres to these lines while it manages to be coherent, which is not common in its entirety, it does so while trying to surprise the audience at all times, in each scene the film begs you to be disgusted by the depravity of ancient Rome. The shocking scenes are what this movie is based on and where it completely fails. It is too much to see the successive rulers make one man after another be murdered, raped, tortured for no other reason than a fantasy. The depictions of violence are possibly, but not probably, accurate. Murder was certainly the order of the day in Imperial Rome, in advance torture was routine. But the visions of the director of these deaths and the boring fun of their protagonists, while the spectators observe with indifference, I simply do not see that it has happened exactly like that. The death machine, the decapitator, is certainly something you've never seen in movies, and something that I once saw you probably will never forget, even like me, you would want to be able to. Drinking wine while the penis is cut is the same, once you have seen this shame, it is yours forever. These things impact the fantasies of the director and that tycoon's porn. They arose from his sick imagination and not from any proven record. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good. I really think that Mcdowell is the weakest link here. Mirren always has something to do, and here, in her younger years, she is formidable and beautiful. The representations of Nerva and Tiberius are very well done by their respected actors. The film could have been much better telling stories, it's a failure, so it's a completely different layer than it is a pity. For example, he could have given an opinion on how and why Caligula went mad, or showed that he was crazy, paranoid before his illness and that fever broke the mental restriction he had previously had. He could have shown Claudio's weakness and the miracle was that he survived Caligula. He could have these and many other things, but he clung to his sad nightmares. <br /> <br /> Finally about sex. It's porn Shows that these sexual acts are being performed in all palaces by many people. Man in man, woman in woman, man in woman. It's a sex without passion, disgusting. Keep in mind that if you want to get out, I seriously doubt you can. Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been addicted to sex, and the orgies may have been common enough, but the visions in this film seem to remind more of a Greek era than a Roman one. I do not believe that this kind of acceptance of homosexuality or out of the ordinary orgies was common until the strange and depraved reign of Elgabalus, and he was killed for it. <br /> <br /> This movie probably should never be watched, if you're curious about it, let it go. It is something, as I said before, if you observe this, unfortunately you will keep the sick visions in your mind for the next few years. I do not believe that it is a precise historical image in particular, even if it is historical in its entirety.
