This terrible moovie is fun on many levels, the most obvious is the lame and fake bird puppet that floats around the cheap sets, without even beating the wings (as if they were on a string, right?), Attacking trains and toys toy cars. The "science" is asinina, a Masonic atom gun? And what about the huge amounts of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I guess the 50s were the decade of Slimeball! Well, this bird puppet apparently comes from "an antimatter universe abandoned by God," and is here to build a nest and lay eggs in New York. Seriously. That they manage to kill the puppet is almost a pity. I give him a helmet of 4: he is stupid and stupid, but more fun than Armageddon. : = 8)
