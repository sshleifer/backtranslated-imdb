I thought about this movie when I saw Pluto Nash ... Why? Because both films have a randy quaid playing a delayed robot, this film was made years before but it was probably written by a screenwriter who drank the same biotoxic coffee or something like that. ..Whoa ... AVOID AT ANY COST, even to pay homage to the late great Andy Kaufman, it's hard to do here ... find another movie or just watch the replays of the taxis on the last night of television ... its character latka gravas is much more adorable ...
