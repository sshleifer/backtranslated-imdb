Poor Jane Austen should be glad she was not around to see this terrible disaster of adaptation. So many fantastic films by Jane Austen have come out recently that this one deserves to be permanently buried along with two other films that I despise: The man in the gray flannel suit and the 1969 version of David Copperfield. My main problem with the movie is that it completely loses the meaning of the book. Jane Austen was making fun of the Gothic mania in her society, and much of the novel is ironic. The film, however, is serious and presents itself terribly melodramatically. The cheerful and amusing taste of Austen's writing is totally and visibly absent from this heavy incursion in which horror meets the drama of the time. The scenes of Catherine's imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting. Besides, Henry Tilney is terribly unattractive. Why, I ask, would someone fall in love with him? If you're looking for a fun-filled night with Jane Austen, watch Emma instead!
