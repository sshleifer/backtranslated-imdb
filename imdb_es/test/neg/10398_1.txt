This insane disillusioner of the left trivializes Dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author and inserts it, inserts ideology of hatred, incompetent satire and stupid political comments in every imaginable place, and deserves a place in the Eighth Circle, Tenth. Bolgia with the rest of the counterfeiters. Sandow Birk has reserved a place next door. <br /> <br /> Stocking Hell with republican political figures, Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, not to mention extreme liberal bias. It is, however, unoriginal, tedious and trite. Nothing in the unworthy and heretical revision of Birk is at all relevant to the original text or is it in any way entertaining, humorous or enlightening, despite its presumed presumption to the contrary. <br /> <br /> I could have eaten a roll of video tape and PUKED a better movie. I regret the two hours of my life that I lost seeing this insult to the very concept of poetry. Calliope will cry forever.
