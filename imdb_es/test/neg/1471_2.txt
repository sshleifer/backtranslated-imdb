This movie has been praised to the point of ridicule. "American Movie" is a boring documentary about a bored person, so it is common to find equivalents in almost every corner of the United States. It takes a long and hard look at a guy who has failed almost everything to make an independent film ... or two. If his failures were not for his own selfish purposes or if they were in the name of real art, the film could have had an opportunity. America has an abundance of better stories to tell. This must be flushed and many critics have good reason to be ashamed. Two thumbs up in fact!
