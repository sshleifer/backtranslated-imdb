This plot had more holes than an alibi of OJ Simpson! <br /> <br /> I noticed two Star Trek references in the film and yet, <br /> <br /> ironically we have a main character played by Andy Garcia <br /> <br /> which is the Antithesis of the Vulcan philosophy of "The needs <br /> <br /> of the many exceed the needs of a few or one". <br /> <br /> Let's say that, while trying to save your child from cancer, it puts most of the rest of San Francisco at an incredible risk. The character of Michael Keaton is almost as unrealistic as it is. He refuses to kill on numerous occasions and, nevertheless, gets angry when Garcia frustrates his attempt <br /> <br /> to kill a group of policemen at the same time. The girl's doctor is still in charge of her faculties, even after she was <br /> <br /> held hostage several times in a short period of time, but <br /> <br /> put her on a wide path 5-story apartment and she loses it <br /> <br /> Andy Garcia's son is something of an anathema in this film <br /> <br />. He is the most sympathetic and real character, one of the bright spots of the film. In addition, he pronounces a line, which must have been the result of a coincidence, in relation to the fight against cancer, which parallels Keaton's motivation to escape. In general, the film was not a complete loss (see From sunset to sunrise 2: Texas Blood Money <br /> <br /> for that) but disappointing considering the talent available.
