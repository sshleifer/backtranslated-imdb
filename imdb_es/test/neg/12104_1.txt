... out of this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say, this was shown at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy did not have subtitles, so I asked the Festival team if there was a problem with the print received. "It's not like that ..." they told me. "The director wants it that way." <br /> <br /> Again, I'm sorry to say, my French is just an elective high school level (more than 3 decades ago). Much of the initial dialogue is in French, so I'm sure I've lost the nuance and many details between my understanding of some keywords. <br /> <br /> I rated this with a "1", mainly because of the irony of a director who once worked making subtitles by refusing to put subtitles on a movie to be seen by an American public. Excuse me, even if most Americans do not know where Europe is on a map, you should not assume that not even the audience of a film festival knows "the native language" of a certain movie. Even if some of us do not know Finnish, I would still expect subtitles for the few "dolts" that are not sophisticated enough to have experience in the 37 different languages ​​presented. I will endure this ego of David Lynch, not Litvack.
