Director J.S. Cardone presents something a little frightening and a bit creepy, but nothing more. A widowed mother Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) inherits a house in the mountains of Pennsylvania; so he takes his two daughters and moves to the large estate in what seems to be the middle of nowhere. But it's somewhere, somewhere ninety-odd years ago, a tragic mining accident took the lives of numerous children who were forced to work in darkness and humidity. The area and especially the property of Tunny seems to be obsessed by the spirits of the little evil souls. The legend is that children who scream come out in the moonlight to seek their revenge; and you'd better believe it. Also in the cast: Ben Cross, Taylor-Compton Scout, Chloe Moretz, Julie Rogers and Geoffrey Lewis.
