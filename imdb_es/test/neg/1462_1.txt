This movie was pretentious, stupid and simply not funny. The filming technique reminded me of MTV. I'm a fan of Hartley. But what was he thinking? Much more thought could have gone into this movie, considering the subject. This could have been a true theoretical battle over good and evil, but Hartley, it seems, used the technique of psychology support for the viewer.
