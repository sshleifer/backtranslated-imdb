At the rate that these films are plowing through the artifacts of the Amityville house, it will not be long before we reach the floor, but for now it is a mirror that is causing problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth entry of the series. A homeless man gives it to the artist Ross Partridge, who has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past. This worldly horror goes through a dull rhythm, leaving us waiting for an accumulation that never comes, as the various "spooky" events lead to a stupid ending. Soft and lifeless, with the performance of the lambs and the huge hair of Partridge does not help.
