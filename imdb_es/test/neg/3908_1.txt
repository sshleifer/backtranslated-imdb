About five years ago, my friend and I went to the video rental store to see something. My friend saw Space Truckers on the shelf, and that's how we got it. Once we got home and started to see it, we realized it was absolute shit! Can a beer float in space? A guy taking a dumpster in a bathroom? A guy with a mechanical cock trying to wake up a woman saying: "Whiz, whiz!"? WTF !!! The stupidest, stupidest, most delayed piece of garbage, horribly throne to which my eyes have never been exposed. My friend and I still call it the worst movie we've seen. Only one more movie has come close to its crappiness (and that would be the stupid Jackie Chan movie, "The Medalion"). If you ever see this scrap piece on the shelf of your video store, proceed as follows: 1. Remove it from the shelf and throw it on the floor. 2. Stomp on it for at least 30 seconds. 3. Proceed to set it on fire in a contained facility (bathroom cabin). 4. Finally, take it to your local hazardous waste management facility immediately so that it can be treated properly.
