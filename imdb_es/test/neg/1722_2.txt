'Tycus' is almost as bad as a science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> I can barely find something good to say about this movie. The premises are completely wrong. A comet is supposed to hit the Moon and cause catastrophic damage to Earth, but nobody believes the scientist who predicts this. An entire underground city plus a launch pad for nuclear-armed rockets is built in the mountains of California without anyone noticing. When the comet approaches Earth, news reaches television and newspapers just one day before the event. And so on, and so on ... <br /> <br /> Neither emotion reaches the screen. Is it the genius who discovers the comet and builds the underground city a savior of humanity or a beast? The director or Dennis Hooper who is playing the role did not seem to decide until the film was finished, and it does not really make any difference because acting and directing is so confusing that you end up wondering what this movie is trying to say. The special effects are so cheap that not only can they not be convincing in the era of computer effects, but they could not be convincing even in the 50s, four decades before this movie was made. <br /> <br /> A total loss of time.
