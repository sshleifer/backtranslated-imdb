This movie should be called guilt in the script. Directed by Stanley Donen of Singin 'in the Rain, the midlife crisis of celluloid is not so bad. It has some exuberant scenes of Rio de Janeiro and several extras with little clothes that mix with each other and rumble along the beach to the sensual sounds of the samba, but there is something in regards to see how the Michael Caine, of fifty something years, talk to the tearful teenager Michelle Johnson That makes you feel ... well, sleazy. This story is a complete stretch, too. No one but perverts and old studio executives in Hollywood could have illuminated this shame. Perhaps they are so accustomed to having young bimbos as sweets for the arm that they forget that it is their fat wallets that hold the key to their appeal, not their huge Larry King-style glasses and their yellow teeth stained with cigars. It's one thing for a nubile young sexpot to be attracted to an older man, but for the father of his best friend who is married? And then throw himself at him shamelessly? Ugh! There is nothing entertaining about that. It is quite pathetic and grotesque. Take note of the talent of the young * cough * cough of Demi Moore.
