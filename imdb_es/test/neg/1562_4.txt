The plot: Four people are trapped in an elevator. One is a businessman, the annoying guy who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone, and is a sign of distress and hostility. Then there is his colleague, a woman who is much more pleasant in character. A teenage rebel who just broke a coke machine and by his mere presence drives the businessman crazy, and an older man who just stole 100,000 DM makes up the rest of the cast ... <br /> <br /> The movie It's all about how to deal with your problem, as time goes on and still does not succeed in getting to the outside world, as the lights go out and the wires start to fit one after the other ... <br /> And, however, it is not too exciting. The characters are stereotypes. The story is stupid and unlikely (how could so many things go so wrong in a single elevator?). You do not like the characters very much, you just hate one of them. And all the twists and turns in the plot do not contribute to the emotion, they are just stupid excuses to complete other minutes with the dialogue while the writers are left without inspiration and ink in a long film in an elevator. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that "Phone Booth" is a better effort ...
