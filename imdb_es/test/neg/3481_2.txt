This movie is highly unlikely. Read the other reviews to see why. <br /> <br /> I would say that most of the characters were plastic, but they did not even allow themselves that little luxury; They simply act as cardboard cutouts. Of course, they had to get real surfers for the surfing contest roles, so that's a shit if they can act. At least Occy did not care about the shit and he just went with that. But "Lance" ??? Fuhgeddaboutit. <br /> <br /> The only character that was said to be true was played by Gerry Lopez, who really did not act, he himself was quite. He is quite used to trampling people. :-) The only reason I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was because I was placing a newsletter on my laptop when it came to a cable channel one night. That saved me from having to pay all the attention to this stupid waste of time. No way would I get out of my way to see it.
