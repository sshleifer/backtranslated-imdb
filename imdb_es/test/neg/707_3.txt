When the movie starts, it is obvious how old and sick the children are. Although Oliver Hardy is huge, it is Stanley who seems that death has heated up. Apparently, he was seriously ill during production and had obviously lost a lot of weight. Although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half, here he looks like a dying man. Also, while watching the movie, I was surprised at the amount of problems Stan took, I almost expected him to fall dead from the effort. I really can not understand why they came out of retirement considering their health, especially when history and production values ​​are as poor as they are with this movie. <br /> <br /> Stanley inherits an island and a ship. He and Ollie are ready to leave when Antoine, a stateless person, literally drops into his boat and begins his journey to find the island. On the way, they discover that Giovanni is gone, but despite this, the four men become friends and land on a different island. It seems like a paradise and everyone is very happy. A little later, a beautiful young woman joins them and everything looks great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the uranium is discovered on the island and the place is flooded with a scam. Finally, the mafia decides to hang the four men and take control, at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are saved. <br /> <br /> I'll give the film some credit for being original and for being interesting. However, one thing that is not is FUN, and that's unforgivable for a Laurel and Hardy movie. While it's not a bad movie, it's certainly not a good movie. A sad end to his brilliant careers. <br /> <br /> All the actors, except the duo, are dubbed into English, since the film was made in France. While it may not be the worst movie they did (this would be THE GREAT NOISE), it sure is close! Watching this movie is painful and like watching people clean up after a serious accident.
