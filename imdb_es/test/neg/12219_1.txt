Maybe it's just the format of this film, a documentary, but I think the film would have been better served by good actors and a more solid dialogue. The fact that actors also own businesses is a double-edged sword. They know better than anyone the emotions and complexities of the business they were in, but since they are not professional actors, they do a very poor job of transmitting those emotions and the documentary suffers. There were some really memorable scenes in this film and many good lines, but they were delivered so badly that they will disappear with time and the only memory I will have of this documentary is that it had some good scenes that I can not remember. . <br /> <br /> Look at this if you want a first-hand account of the .com bust and see what happened to 99% of the people in the industry who did not become instant millionaires. However, be prepared for nauseating camera work, poor performance, poor dialogue and a bad movie in general that personifies the age of the Internet boom.
