I could not wait for the end. This is absolutely the worst movie I've seen in my life. If you thought that almost anyone could make a movie to watch, these people demonstrate that a minimum set of skills is required. This is a movie without redeeming features at all. Enter a zero in all departments. This is more than just 'amateur', since the audience receives no consideration or consideration. There is no serious attempt to act or entertain. The plot is useless, meaningless and meaningless. The cast seems very uncomfortable and completely lacks direction. The technical aspects of the film are deficient. <br /> <br /> Like DVD makes a good roller coaster.
