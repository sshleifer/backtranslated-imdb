"The Snow Queen" is based on the famous and very beautiful story by Hans Christian Andersen, about a girl, Gerda, who makes a dangerous journey to rescue her friend Kai from the clutches of the Queen of the Snows. This adaptation tries to capture the sense of adventure of the story and the intricate and luminous images through luxurious scenarios and production design, but fails in several aspects. <br /> <br /> Like so many other Hallmark productions, the potential of the story is completely undermined by hard-line writing and direction. The two actors who play Gerda and Kai are very nice but forgettable; Bridget Fonda as the Queen of the Snows seems to be the part, but otherwise it is a mistake for the role. There is a remarkable lack of dramatic tension in this snaking three-hour miniseries. At least some of the rhythm problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story, particularly at the opening time that presents the main characters. <br /> <br /> That said, "The Snow The Queen" would be almost ideal for pre-teens with a taste for fantasy and a little patience. It's great for the eyes without being scary, and the performance is presented at the pantomime level at the top that explains the story in a very, very bold text. Just make sure you read Andersen's stories too.
