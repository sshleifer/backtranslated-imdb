As a young girl, the beautiful Joan Woodbury (as Rita Adams) was orphaned, after her "pigeon stool", her father was shot to death. As a young woman, Ms. Woodbury is struggling to keep a job, as the ex-convict status of her murdered father makes Woodbury a bad business risk. Woodbury has the understanding of the singer Linda Ware (as Donna Andrews), who recommends Woodbury to get in touch with the old friends of the orphanage John Archer (like Bob Elliott) and Jack La Rue (like Mickey Roman). But, none of her friends can help when Woodbury is the victim of a scam, which takes her to jail. After his release, Woodbury decides to give male gangsters a chance for their money. <br /> <br /> Re-titled "Gangs, Inc.", this is a melodrama of cheap and obviously weak mobsters. Still, it's very fun to see Woodbury do wonders with inferior material. She plays the innocent and increasingly sophisticated "Rita" quite convincing; and, she pulls in a big bit like a blonde whore. Woodbury should be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized Hollywood actresses of the past. "Paper Bullets" also has an old Alan Ladd (like Jimmy Kelly, also known as Bill Dugan). Ms. Ware, who sang the blockbuster "An Apple for the Master" with Bing Crosby, sings a couple of numbers from the 40's fair. But, mainly, it's the Woodbury show. <br /> <br /> **** Paper Bullets (1941) Phil Rosen ~ Joan Woodbury, Linda Ware, Alan Ladd
