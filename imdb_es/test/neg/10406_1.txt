And obviously I did not see it! <br /> <br /> But seeing the cast and seeing that Doug Masters has returned from death, now I know I should avoid this like the plague! I hate that Hollywood, the producers, the writers, the directors or all of the above think that the audiences are stupid and that they will not detect errors of continuity. A supposed Doug Masters who returns is one of the giants, do not you think? <br /> <br /> And I can not believe that someone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would come back for something like that. <Br /> <br /> Jason Gedrick really rejected this? Well, I hate to say it, but even if I took the role again, I would still have had the same continuity error. I bet (if he really rejected it), he must have been incredulous to see that his character died in the second movie. <br /> <br /> I probably caught it by accident in the air one night on some channel. , but in no way am I going to rent this or buy the DVD!
