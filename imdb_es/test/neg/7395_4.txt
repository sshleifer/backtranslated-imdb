Imagine an island of Gilligan located in the African desert in modern times. Add people who are not as fun as Skipper or Marianne, and enough anguish to fill the office of a German psychiatrist. Add a plot that manages to be interesting only in parallel and a literary parallelism that never deepens enough to truly satisfy. Season with a really morose subject that has been exploited since the first travelers of the world were very, very lost. <br /> <br /> If THE KING LIVED was not a product of the current czars of Dogme Day 95, is this movie going to attract so much attention? Dogme 95 is for Hollywood as is modern Danish for Rococo. As a byproduct of digital technology, this Scandinavian movement seeks, quite dogmatically, to eliminate artificiality in the making of films, using more natural elements and returning to the essence of the narrative. PEARL HARBOR, for example, is the Antichrist Dogme. <br /> <br /> The saga of director / co-author Kristian Levring reflects on interpersonal relationships and human nature when placed in the fire of a life-threatening situation. Eleven people aboard a bus that passes through the dunes of Namibia are trapped in the remains of an abandoned city. An African local that does not speak their language serves as an observer and narrator (whose ideas are among the most scathing of the film). While the strongest move away for a five-day walk to the nearest village, the others fall behind, survive on canned carrots and circle their likely future like a chow vulture. Henry, a former theater actor, decides that this unattractive crew needs a detour and writes by hand KING LEAR by heart. Assign roles, and the group spends many days learning lines and rehearsing, in an effort to divert their attention from what seems inevitable. <br /> <br /> Gradually, the cast begins to lose it, and the savagery of its nature? Or, as William Golding might say, human nature begins to emerge. If you have ever seen LORD OF THE FLIES, you know that these things can get ugly, that being in a situation in a lifeboat can turn even Mother Teresa into the term of PMSing in Calcutta. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed using an international set of American, English, French and South African actors, who, according to Dogme dogma, develop themselves and their roles in a very organic way. THE KING was also filmed chronologically, adding a sense of realism to the growing desperation of its characters. After up to three handheld cameras recorded in digital format, the results were transferred to a 35mm film. <br /> <br /> The performance that most compiles comes from Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays a Boho Pop Tart that tries to encourage the spirits of The Group in every way possible. Henry (David Bradley) is another finely played character whose passion for his life's work ultimately saves the gang from absolute despair. It is hard to feel sorry for the cruel wives of others and their husbands husbands, old and hirsute, bad-tempered French intellectuals, rich men who have more important places to be than abandoned in the Namibian desert. Beckett might hate this question, but why does this group travel on a bus through remote Africa in the first place? Morbidity that threatens life! Total despair rendered in graphic detail! An implacably tedious rhythm! Enjoy.
