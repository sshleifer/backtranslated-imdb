I do not understand the good reviews exaggerated about this movie, except that many people in Venezuela are understandably very enthusiastic, since Venezuelan cinema is far behind what other countries are in the region. <br /> <br /> First, the film is too repetitive, many of the scenes are almost identical in each of the two main roles, so it gives the impression that it is a time filler. A fill time is also a good point, since this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes, you will start to get tired and watch the clock. <br /> <br /> All the actors are pretty bad, by the way. exception of the Venezuelan boy Edgar Ram√≠rez, who brings a bit of slapstick and plays the role of the Venezuelan recruit "Pedro". <br /> <br /> By the way, this is not a representative film about the people of the Region (Caribbean area), it tends to ridicule them.
