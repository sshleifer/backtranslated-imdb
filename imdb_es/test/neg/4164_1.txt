The film disappointed me for many reasons: first, the representation of a future that seemed realistic to me at first was well constructed, but it only had a marginal role. Then, the story itself was a weak copy of Lost in Translation. In the Middle East environment, the man with the family meets a new girl abroad, the karaoke bar, the movements of the camera and the images, all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent Lost in the translation who also had credibility. This film tries to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. I wonder why Tim Robbins even considered making this movie? The main actress is horrible. Did you play the precog in Minority Report? And why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this? Lost in Translation did not have to show excessive scenes of love. R-Rated only for this? This movie is not even worth watching from a videostore!
