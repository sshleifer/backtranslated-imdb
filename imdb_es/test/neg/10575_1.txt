This was the stupidest movie I've ever seen. It is a complete waste of money and time. I went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie ended there was not a single person in the movies, not that there were many people there to see this terrible movie, he said "wow, what a good movie". Someone actually left! It was absolutely terrible! It was disgusting and I hated every minute of it. My friend was putting her head on my shoulder towards the end because after the scene with Rick on the roof peeing, she had had enough. It was not funny at all. Believe me, I went with 11 other girls and none of my friends liked it. It was ridiculous! I have seen many movies but this was absolutely the worst! I mean, a scene in the movie is with an old man kissing a dead person in a coffin. I just can not do these things.
