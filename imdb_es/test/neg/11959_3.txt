Scarecrow Gone Wild begins as high school teenager Mike (David Zelina) and his teammates decide to give a 'hazing' to weaken the diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) as a type of initiation. Mike and his partner decide to take Sam to a corn field, tie him to a cross next to a strange-looking scarecrow and leave him there all night, sounds fun, right? Well, things become counterproductive when Sam goes into a diabetic coma after suffering from hypoglycaemia and Sam's vengeful spirit goes to the scarecrow that comes alive and begins to hunt down the children responsible for Sam's unfortunate problem. Sam's best friend, Jack (Matthew Linhardt) and his girlfriend Beth (Samantha Aisling) can save Sam's day and life? <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Brian Katkin Scarecrow Gone Wild is the third direct entry to the video in the Scarecrow series and although I have not seen any of the previous two after watching Scarecrow Gone Wild, I am in no hurry to change that situation, that's for sure. The script actually has an almost decent premise since Sam's offended soul seeks revenge and his friends have to keep the real Sam alive somehow, but the way it is said is poor and I guess basically it's just an irrelevance to the fact that this is so. a film about a murderous scarecrow that runs around killing people in unholy or imaginative ways. Having said that there are one or two scenes here that save him from a star rating, the fart gag in the cornfield is fun and something that many immature guys could do (like me), the bit when two men bury his partner in the arena and then standing over him and urinating on him is also quite fun in a girlish youthful way and something great when a boy starts singing a horrible song, so the scarecrow throws a stick that impales him. However, these bits of OK are few and far between and, in general, is a silly, boring, badly written film for teenagers, with very annoying characters that irritate. It is also very predictable and has a stupid end of turn that does not present the scarecrow at all, which is a problem, because when you watch a movie called Scarecrow Gone Wild you expect to see a scarecrow go crazy and I have to admit that it looks pretty good like the horror character. <br /> <br /> Principal Katkin does a reasonable job here in reality, although on Earth is the hospital at the end and all that neon light everywhere and the fact that there is only one patient there. and two staff members? The cinematography is much better than the usual low-budget horror film directly to the video and there is a pleasant lighting, although totally unrealistic. The film lacks fear or real tension and part of the medical terminology used is a bit dubious to say the least and I say it as an insulin-dependent diabetic. There is not much blood here, there are a couple of scenes in which an actor has some false guts placed in the stomach to represent that they are destroyed but it seems quite false, there is also a burnt face and a couple of impalements, but little else. There's a good amount of naked female breasts on display, if that's your thing. <br /> <br /> Technically, Scarecrow Gone Wild is pretty good considering some of the low budget abominations I've seen recently, unfortunately it's still a bad movie. in general. The less said about the performance, the better. <br /> <br /> Scarecrow Gone Wild is not as bad as the crap out of direct horror at the video that has recently appeared, but having said that it is not much better. And it's still a bad movie when everything is said and done. Not recommended, the two previous entries are Scarecrow (2002) and Scarecrow Slayer (2003), both of which were also direct to the video.
