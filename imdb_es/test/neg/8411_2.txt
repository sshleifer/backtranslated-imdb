Sam O'Steen, the editor of the film in the superlative thriller "Rosemary's Baby" of 1968, directs here a quick television sequel, one in which Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, for Mia Farrow) is rejected before time: and inexplicably, presumably to help develop the most macabre aspects of this flaccid story about the son of Satan on Earth. The most interesting thing is the return of Ruth Gordon to her Oscar-winning role as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland as her husband, Roman), but they do not give her much to do, and she looks terribly uncomfortable to be involved. . This script is strictly low income, and should have embarrassed the original author Ira Levin (who later wrote his own sequel). Quite tenuous and pale, with bad photography and without suspense or that scares at all.
