This movie is worth nothing. I mean, if you want to see this kind of thing, go to Hollywood movies! This is totally an embarrassment to the name of Bollywood. Neal N Nikki really sucked! Never look at this movie. As for the actors, it seems that the acting genes skipped a generation. Tanisha could not have used less and, obviously, Uday Chopra was chosen because he was the director's spoiled son. (Everything that Halla Re was amazingly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director did not spend a lot of money on that ... Do not let your children see it, and if you have it in your house it's a stupid movie, Download it! Buy the CD, if necessary. (As I said, the songs are eh.) At least it's better than the movie.
