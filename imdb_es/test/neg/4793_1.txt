Infamous for being "brought to you by the digital effects team behind Independence Day", Coronado is an even more spectacular failure due to being juxtaposed with ID4. This ridiculous mess of a movie starts with a brainless premise and goes completely downhill from there. A rich, soon to be married in Beverly Hills are the subjects of this idiotic story. Claire's girlfriend has gone on a business trip around Christmas, so she decides to fly spontaneously to Switzerland so they can spend the holidays together. Especially I love that her initial reason for wanting to go is because he had left some documents at home that she thought he might need. She grabbed them and shouted at him as she walked away, concluding that it would be best to fly to the other side of the planet instead of calling her cell phone. I refuse to believe that a couple living in a mansion as cavernous as his was unaware of the existence of mobile phones. <br /> <br /> So up to this point, the movie is incredibly bad, but look at this, THIS is where it starts to get bad! She arrives in Switzerland and when she can not find her husband, she gets some cake and calls her friend to complain about how unfair everything is. This woman is not an action hero, and DEFINITELY is not an Indiana Jones from Germany, for shouting out loud. She is an overexploited cheerleader, a pampered worshiper whose outdoor experience is probably limited to taking her spike heels off the floor when she gets dizzy enough to roam the lawn during a wine and cheese festival on the cliffs. <br /> <br /> He notices that his girlfriend is in South America, so she flies there to catch him. Once there, this imbecile thinks that he will go alone to the jungle, sniff the enemy base and rescue his poor helpless boyfriend. She laughs at a comment about the danger of entering there, then gets scared later because she discovers that there are ongoing battles. "You never said anything about the battle!" <br /> <br /> There's a point where Claire and a journalist she found herself driven this huge truck through a bridge that is hundreds of feet high and hundreds of feet wide and Suspended by two four. Literally. There are thousands of thin pieces of wood tied with twine, and these idiots decide to drive on it. Not only does she collapse under the weight of the truck, but Claire manages to fall, falling to hundreds of feet and landing on her back in the shallow river below. Later, she remembers the event, laughing, like, oh, maybe it was only a hundred. At least, he was not spinning chewing gum between his fingers. <br /> <br /> What is really sad about this catastrophically bad movie is that they even managed to convince a tremendous performance of the tremendously talented John Rhys-Davies, a REAL Indiana Jones veteran. There is a lot of nonsense about an uprising at the end of the movie, where we meet an extremist rebel leader who, when we first meet him, has such a strong accent that he spins his score as if he thinks he's in a commercial of Ruffles. Then, later, he talks like a guy they took from the streets of Venice Beach. Amazing. <br /> <br /> Special effects are negligible. The team that brought you Independence Day, for the very fact that they were involved with ID4, was simply repeating the movements, throwing some screenshots in blue and matte, I have to believe because they had nothing better to do. The story is surprisingly bad, and Kristin Dattilo, whom many other IMDb users cite as the only reason to watch the movie, does not put the slightest effort into her acting. Maybe he thought that the digital effects team behind Independence Day could superimpose some meaning in this mess. <br /> <br /> And given how far they have fallen, maybe they thought they could too. <br /> <br /> They could at least have tried.
