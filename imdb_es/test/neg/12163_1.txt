Okay, I guess I'm a big fan of Stephen King's stories, mutilated and destroyed (when they hit the 'Screen') like any of us, the sad masochists here. I know very well that most of them are badly made. I hope so. I plan on it. I allow it humbly ... <br /> <br /> But, THIS time ... GEEEEEEEEEEEZZ ... Well, then I THINK I saw this several years ago ..., well. I thought I remembered that I was pretty good ... BAD ... As I say (granted in a neat, annoying, indirect way :) I was not really trying to be a snobby or wait a lot, but what was this? thing, a miniseries? I only have ONE thing to say: D ...... R ..... A ..... W ...... NO ..... U ..... T How can I POSSIBLY justify dragging the thing minute by minute, scene by scene of the friggin 'ENDLESS, completely MEANING, and mentally slow the dialogue box? I refer to EVERY scene of bl ** d and are two "DISCUSSED" people of how they feel and from one side to another and D ... R ... A ... GI ... T bl ** d well O ... U ... T After about an hour and a half, what I THINK is about half the execution time (I did not check it, I'm sorry). I finally got totally tired! After an hour and a half, what happened OTHER than the original accident ...? They were running away while the 'Tienda' boy was killing eye doctors, news photographers and LOTS & LOTS & LOTS of meandering dialog. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I promise you it's not what I have. have a nonsense action without stopping; I love LOTS of films in which it does not happen much, but in them at least when they speak and say SIGNIFICANT things and the characters are deepened, the thoughts are transmitted ... Â¿SOMETHING ?! Okay, I admit that the actors themselves were not that bad (except Stephen King, of course :) I liked the guy from the store, I thought that both "older" people were fine. I liked the general and the main woman. It's only if they could have cut all the FILLING HOURS, that's all I'm saying. I mean, it's supposed to be a science fiction thriller, something like, right? You know what the prize really took away when the man in the store unnecessarily did one of his MANY times filling phone calls, this time he's talking to God, who knows he's getting very emotional (for him anyway) and acts like if I could not handle it. .. WTF !!! ??? It has been clearly shown that the guy is an efficient and cold-blooded killer. What the hell was that ??? So, just multiply that by about 500 and that's the reason why I finally turned it off in half; It was that or I hanged myself, I swear! I mean there are other 'adaptations' of King out there that are scarce, but at least MOVE EVERYTHING ...! Oh, well, I suppose maybe, if you CAN be in the "story" itself and do not mind dragging and have the SUPREME AND DIVINE patience to wait until the end, it might be worth it. <br /> <br /> But, I doubt it with sincerity and humility ... <br /> <br /> I do not write these things very often, but this time I HAVE OR I could not sleep at night (like I did DURING the show! :)
