Terrible adaptation of Heminway's low profile love story. An American soldier (Rock Hudson) falls in love with a British nurse (Jennifer Jones) in Italy during the First World War. What's wrong with this? Practically everything. Hudson is very far from his depth here. I could be a good actor but not in this movie. Jones is too old for her role (she has 21 in the book, here she is 38 ... and she looks like that!). Also his performance wavered between exaggerated and helpless! They took a simple and discreet love story and exaggerated it. The film is fatally long (a little over 150 minutes), self-indulgent and quilted to a ridiculous degree. It seems that producer David O. Selznick thought he was doing "Gone With the Wind" again. Some of the landscapes are really impressive (even on a small TV screen), but there is not enough history to match the images. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The ending where Jones dies is supposed to be tragic, but the bad acting and the exaggerated theatricality made me fight so as not to laugh. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, actor Vittorio De Sica exaggerates to a truly embarrassing degree. Exaggerated, self-indulgent, badly melted and slow. Pretty terrible This was (understandably) a financial and critical bomb and ended with Selznick's career as a producer. You may want to tune in to some of the scenery at the end, but it's really not worth it. I give this a 3.
