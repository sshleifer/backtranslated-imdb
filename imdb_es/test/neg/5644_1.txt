The enigma as a concept is an interesting idea, but I am afraid it is a mistake, Vinnie if he is given the role of hard man is his element as in Lock Stock and Snatch. In this film, Vinnie plays a sports writer of Newspapers (the greyhounds to be precise), who during the course of the film is easily beaten easily and tied on a balcony by a man who is between 10 and 15 years older than him . I'm sorry, Vinnie is tough, she looks tough and she has to kick him out like that. Trying to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict who are near the Thames. It assumes the role of police, while the real police is little part of the players, interceding with the flashbacks of Charles Dickens. <br /> <br /> When Vinnie is on the screen, his reputation precedes him, he looks tough but not in this. Part needs to act strongly, growling at the camera in parts. If you look at the bad machine, he is perfectly fused, credible and has a very decent performance. <br /> <br /> Going back to the movie, what confuses the issue in some way is the memory of Charles Dickens, who tells a different story with characters that also appear today. These two stories seem to be unrelated, apart from using the same actors. <br /> <br /> The sound in the film, especially by Julie Cox, is inaudible at times, and it really does not materialize as to what role in the film lacks the interest of Vinnies Love, the film begins as Detecive, but quickly becomes the Bride. <br /> <br /> The death of the prostitute has an answer but it is not answered. Eliminate the things of Charles Dickens and you may have a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Vinnie, little by little is becoming the British Steven Segal, stick to the role of supporting actor, you're pretty good at that.
