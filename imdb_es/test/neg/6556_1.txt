Especially if you like horrible movies. When I started seeing him for the first time, all he could say was "I hope there is a dance sequence in him". Imagine my delight when NOT only the two main characters danced, but the main ghost also started dancing. And on top of THAT, Sherman Hemsley sings the break dance song (not to mention the subject). It makes me a little sad to be broken by this movie, but I've never liked it as an actor and I really should have known better. However, neither the director would take credit for this movie (and you should check out some of the other films he directed!). A note of caution, however, the writer liked the jokes about the movie. , um, male lower regions. For example, one of the characters discovers a book called "Groins of the Darker Species." I'm not kidding. And that, for me, is the most disturbing part of the movie. Apart from that, find the darkest video rental store in your city, get the movie, invite all your friends and laugh until you cry with Ghost Fever.
