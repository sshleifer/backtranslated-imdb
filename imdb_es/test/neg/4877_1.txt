Where I start First we will list the good things about this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Mikael Persbrandt is great like the Gangster Thomas. This is the only character that really matters to you, and he is a bad guy! (Allthogh never does anything bad, and he's usually a pretty nice guy) 2. Kjell Bergkvist is always great. It's a little toned down here, but it's still pretty fun. 3. The film looked pretty good by Swedish standards, good use of depth of field and lights. <br /> <br /> Now the bad. This is by far the worst script ever made on the big screen. The performance of all the others was quite bad and exaggerated. The address was horrible. A totally meaningless story, totally unreal characters and events and 1.5 hours long. During the emotional scenes, almost everyone in the theater laughed. People have just started walking during the course of the screening. <br /> <br /> There is no way to really summarize the story into something coherent, so I will not even try it. Every clich√© ever conceived is there, and in all the wrong places. I'm sorry to say that this is one of the worst movies I've seen in my entire life. <br /> <br /> Look at it to laugh, but try not to pay money for it;) <br /> <br /> .R
