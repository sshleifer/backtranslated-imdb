I enjoyed the caricatures of Mr. Magoo that I saw growing up. And I enjoy the comedic abilities of Leslie Nielson. So, I thought, this marriage should produce a funny child. <br /> <br /> I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie was just horrible. I do not remember a single funny moment. This is one of the two or three times (in hundreds of movies over the years) that I wanted to get my money back. You will leave this movie down because you will never have that time to use it in a better way. In a comedy, the plot must draw on the viewer and serve as a framework for the gags. This plot does neither one nor the other. It's just there, panting like a stranded fish.
