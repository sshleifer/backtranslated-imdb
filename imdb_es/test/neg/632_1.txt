I did my best to see this two-hour fiasco. It combined the terrible special effects and the plot of the original "Blob", with an execrable impulse of the script (highlighted in the original) of "Runaway Train". The only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a large tax deduction and imagined that it would be combined with an opportunity to house a casting couch. What an awesome stinker! Lou Diamond Phillips is eager to show us why he will take part, no matter how bad it is. Barry Corbin continues his career as an error of typecasting, a US senator from Texas and plays it well. Then he must play the lead role in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. The women in this film seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the screaming contest of Memorial Fay Wray. The special effects are incredibly bad. H.S. the children in the film class in North Dakota could have done a better job. The writers must have made a robbery in the bank of clich√©s to accumulate so many. I could not look anymore without being forced to sit in the Clockwork Orange chair. I have no idea how it ended, except obviously, 119 minutes too late. Ugh! Cavtor emptor.
