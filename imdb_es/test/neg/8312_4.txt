There is a point in the film in which the boss of the "death machines" (a multiethnic trio to please everyone, being inclusive, I think it's called these days) talks about using leverage in a businessman. Except that your shipment is such that it sounds like "tanned". At that time, this viewer was encouraged to think that this boring movie was becoming a new world of perversities. But it was not like that. The boss had to talk while the "death machines" did not say a single word during the whole movie and the conversation she makes. Endlessly there is action in the movie, but it is not so exciting and the plot wobbles from one cliche to another. The three silent "death machines" live to survive another day at the end of the movie. Hopefully there is no sequel.
