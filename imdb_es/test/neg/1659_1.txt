I rate movies on this site all the time, but I usually do not write comments. However, in this case, I felt compelled to WARN OTHERS! This movie is bad! It's probably one of a dozen movies that I've rated as '1 (horrible)'. I know people say this all the time, but this was really one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Anyway, it's easy in the last ten. <br /> <br /> When it comes to horror movies, I have very low standards. I'm going to overlook all kinds of bad quality movies for a good scare. But this movie is shamefully bad. It seems that someone bought a video camera in Sears and decided to make a movie with their friends. (I think the fact that the name of each member of the crew appears on the cast list is proof of this theory). This movie has lower production standards than its average game in high school. It's really a bit shocking to see a movie that looks so badly released on DVD. Special effects are sometimes effective, but they are still, at best, amateur. The best that can be said about the actors is that they at least remember that they should not look at the camera, most of the time. I can not say for sure if they are struggling to remember their lines or invent them as they went along. Any and all attempts at humor are lame. This movie is such a colossal waste of time.
