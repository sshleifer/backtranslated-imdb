The first time I saw the trailer of The Comebacks, it looked absolutely horrible and I had no interest in seeing it, but when I came out on DVD today, I thought that since there was nothing else that caught my attention, I would rent it and it would be a shot. I saw it tonight and it really was not that bad. I think I was sometimes immature and stupid, but there were some funny moments that made me laugh. I do not really see many sports movies, so I wonder if maybe I would see more, maybe this movie would make more sense to me, but everything is fine, I still did not care much about watching The Comebacks. I admit that these "stupid stupid" movies are rare, but what is a stupid joke about once in a while? The Comebacks is not really that bad if you give it a fair chance. <br /> <br /> Coach Fields is failing in his life, in his family and in his career, but when he is offered the opportunity to bring his career back to life if he can bring a looser soccer team to championship. But the team is really terrible, beyond the terrible. But with a little work and team effort, they try to give everything, although that could become something sadder. <br /> <br /> Comebacks in general are not the worst movies I've seen. I think it's good for a couple of laughs and giggles. I know this was stupid, but I could not help but laugh when the coach comes in the middle of a fight in the locker room and is beating the nerd's head against the locker, only he and the nerd in general were so funny together. . If you have an open mind and you do not take this movie too seriously, I think you'll have fun watching it, if you see it waiting for it to be a material worthy of an Oscar, this is not the movie for you. <Br /> <br /> 4/10
