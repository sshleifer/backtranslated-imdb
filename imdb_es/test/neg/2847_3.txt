Worse than the mediocre thriller about a battered wife who dares after she is circumstantially linked to the death of her husband and sister. Determined to prove that her husband is alive, she follows directions throughout the state, and her danger increases with each stop. Chasing her are the pair of traditional "good cop" and "bad cop" pairs. One is convinced of her innocence, the other is more interested in closing the case and returning home. This pair can often corral their suspect but can never capture it. All the main players gather in a remote city in the desert and the truth begins to develop with deadly consequences for some. <br /> <br /> Wow! This was a bad movie. The leader acted as if he were reassured. The cops could not find a suspect if he or she is at the police station (this happens twice) and all others are as one-dimensional as possible. Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
