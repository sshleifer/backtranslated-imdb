A murderer (John Karlen) with a penchant for really bad disguises (Afro wig on a white guy?) He walks in his truck in search of victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Luisi) is in the case and finds the killer quite easily by simply hanging out at the local pool and looking for someone who looks weird (again, the afro wig comes into play). After tracking the murderer to his home, DeCarlo decides to install a risky trap that involves a police psychologist. <br /> <br /> Inspired by Ted Bundy's crimes before he was caught, KILLER'S DELIGHT is a pretty predictable and cheap series. killer movie. Director Jeremy Hoenack has no idea how to go to the beat of a movie or even put it on hold. But he does know how to show many close-ups of the murderer wringing his hands! The only thing that really has to its favor is the captured atmosphere of the 70s (look for wallpaper in the bathroom). Well, that and a downbeat ending. The DVD of Media Blasters / Shriek Show has many good things, although it includes an audio commentary by Hoenack and Karlen, as well as video interviews, breakthroughs and an alternative opening.
