After a snowstorm, the roads are blocked and the highway patrolman Jason (Adam Beach) arrives at the diner of his friend Fritz (Jurgen Prochnow) and informs his clients that they can only continue their trips the next day. Among strange strangers, Jason meets his ex-girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan), who has just left her husband in Los Angeles. Throughout the night, without any communication with his base, Jason faces perplexing and suspicious situations with the clients, and finds some corpses, which indicates that among them there is a murderer. <br /> <br /> "The Last Stop" could be an average thriller, but the script is just horrible. Most of the characters are despicable people and the motives of the amazing serial killer are never revealed, and the spectators have no further explanation as to why the killer decided to kill the guests. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Encurralados" ("Trapped")
