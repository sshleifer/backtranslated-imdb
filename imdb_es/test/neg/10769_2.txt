I have already read almost all the books and I have seen the musical production in two different languages. I absolutely adored everything I've known before. But lately I have been running out of resources to maintain my fantasy. I still have a couple of books left, but they are in transit or are the sequels that I am not in a hurry to read. So an idea came to my mind - Sink me! There are movies that I have not seen! Therefore, I must see them immediately. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes of these series were ... acceptable. In fact, I quite enjoyed the variation in the reason for the complaint, however different it may have seemed. Although everything went downhill from there. Chauvelin was too ... foppish? And, dare I say, too old for this role. Not even that dark and elegant figure with his terrible or ... (And what was that with the random bed scene that showed it?) It was too spooky: was not your only love Mrs. Guillotine and her only interest, his work and his only obsession, Sir Percy?) Marguerite ... The most beautiful woman in France? The most intelligent woman in Europe? I do not think so. Although, what forced her to enter the study of Sir Percy, I have no idea. And all that my Lord Tony has done to deserve this death? Yes, every member of the League promised his life to Sir Percy, but he would never have endangered any of them or run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger. And if somehow he had to mourn his partner, he would have done it, cry, not just move on as if nothing had happened. Which brings me to another point, Sir Percy. His representation was most frightening. He was neither a lazy bum, nor a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations. Neither did he care about the ties (his only pronunciation of that word made my ears bleed) And with his own hands he had never killed anyone. So, what was that with him walking around randomly and killing people? <br /> <br /> The costumes were too flashy for that period of time as well. We are talking about post-revolutionary France! Not pre-revolutionary. People with dresses like that stand out from the crowd quite easily. Everything was just ... gah! <br /> <br /> Although, I must admit, after seeing other parts, my opinion changed slightly. Seeing it as a separate work, independent of the Scarlet Pimpernel series, it was tolerable. Only your other average hero in the mask. But for what they tried to pass it, it is still miserable.
