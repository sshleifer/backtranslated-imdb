The original "Assault on Precinct 13" is gritty, witty and, perhaps most importantly, brief. This remake is without mercy and is tacky. Worse still, the African-American hero of the first film is replaced here by the handsome white boy Ethan Hawke, which makes this "Assault" less progressive than the 70's. God, how I miss John Carpenter and his improbable plot and his strange sense of humor. I even miss your list B players, who are better leagues than Hawke and company. <br /> <br /> I can not say I'm worried about the new villains in this version; to the limit. The female characters are useless, the criminals are all generic hoods, and Gabriel Byrne gives another of his boring performances. The music is also bad, they are things of bland action that actually lessen the tension. Just horrible
