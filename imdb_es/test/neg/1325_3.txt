I do not know, maybe I was not in the mood for this kind of movie, but it was full of trite melodrama. It was too long and seemed at least slightly disconnected (granted, I did not pay all the attention ...). For a more entertaining description of the Battle of Stalingrad, see Enemy At The Gates. It is true that some pretentious people will make fun because it is a Hollywood movie, and does not show "the reality of war" as this "wonderful foreign movie" does, but it has a better flow and is much more fun to watch. In addition, there are already enough "gritty" war films, and this one seems simply made by amateurs. But hey, you might like it, so keep going; It just was not for me.
