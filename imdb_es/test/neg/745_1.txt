The filmmakers were clearly on drugs. That is the only explanation I have. How else do you explain this parody of an adaptation of Jane Austen? The Northanger Abbey is a parody of a Gothic novel. But this movie was made as if it were a Gothic novel. The strange music and the dream sequences for me suggest drug-induced hallucinations instead of an innocent and naive girl with an overactive imagination, as Catherine of the novel is ... <br /> <br /> The actress who played Catherine just stands with bulging eyes all the time. Peter Firth seems to be at least 10 years too old to play Henry and, in fact, I thought he was a bit gay. I do not see the attraction between him and Catherine. The portrayal of John Thorpe was quite strange, but Isabella was not really that bad. But nothing could save this film from PIECE OF CRAP! One more thing: this film invents a character that is not in the book, a French friend of General Tilney, "La Marquesa". Why exactly they added it is beyond me. It must have been drugs. She has a terrifying look that you can not believe, with a white base, red lips and black lines painted randomly on her face (dimples?). <br /> <br /> You would think that this would at least be entertaining in a "so bad It's good" quality but unfortunately it is not. It's just BAD.
