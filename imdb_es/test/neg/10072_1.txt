This movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life. From the first 10 minutes, I was ready to leave. The clich√©s there slapped you, and the plot was not only predictably stupid, it was filled with more holes than Swiss cheese. I am considering suing for that 2 hour loss, and $ 6.25 along with the fact that I am now more stupid to see this movie waste. The T-Rex must be rotating in their tombs, so to speak.
