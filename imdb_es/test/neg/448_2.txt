Let's describe Larry as an interviewer: a complete suckhole, in all possible ways. He laughs at all the jokes of his guests, asks the most boring questions and never dares to contradict them. It hits me like the kind of person who wants to like ... everyone. Friendly, boring, ol'predecible Harry. He probably owes his success to being an ideal interviewer for celebrities because they are not bombarded with what we, the people, want to know and have the right to know. Let's put it this way: he interviews as if he were in a red country. 02/10, 2 for the guests who come in the program, but everything seems useless when Larry starts asking him questions that numb his mind, such as "What is it like to be a mother?" followed by the usual response of "Being a mother is the best thing that has happened to me: it is wonderful, but exhausting".
