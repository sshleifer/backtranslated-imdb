It is hard to believe that a movie can be so bad, but you live and learn. What is more surprising is the fact that the people who put this together probably had university education. Meanwhile, the fruit of his work reveals the appearance of something a group of five eighth-graders could have invented. On the positive side, (if there is one) the soundtrack has some nice moments, which is another reason to question how the rest of the movie can be so horribly bad.
