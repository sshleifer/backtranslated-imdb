A friend of mine once rented this, thinking that since Peter Fonda starred in it, it could not be bad. INCORRECT! It is bad as anything can be. There is so much to laugh about and it's not the jokes. For example, in one scene, Hawken enters the forest and when he leaves, he suddenly wears a completely different outfit! Where was the brain of "the director" when he filmed that scene? Probably the same place where Fonda was when he agreed to make this movie. It's really a shame that one has to see an actor as good as a fool in this poor excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> No one's acting in this movie can be called acting. Jack Elam is brought only to show the star count here, but all he does is look surprised in a very dark scene and terribly shot in some kind of bar. Not to mention the "Indians," the girl was so fearful that I wanted to shoot her just to end her misery and mine too. If I could give 0 to this, I would. It is a pity that this brand does not exist here. This really remembers a bad joke or an amateur video made just for fun. This should serve as a test of how bad the serial films can get.
