This is a movie that should have been a mini-series, as it tries to get too much information in a space that is too small. The whole story is constantly bombarded with subplots, character introductions and pieces of meaningless information that lead nowhere. There is an underlying plot where the child meets a girl, she has doubts, but anyway she gets married and then the doubts come out and she will see if they are real. It turns out that they are not, but her husband will not believe that she was not unfaithful and that her boyfriend almost does not love her since she did not cheat on her husband. That said, there are no less than 1000 subplots and introductions of characters that make this plot almost incomprehensible. In the first 15 minutes you are inundated with so many things and situations that you simply stop worrying. You do not care about any of the confused and fucked-up actors that come and go in history like vultures feeding on a corpse. Each one enters and takes something of interest from the viewer. After half an hour, and completely disinterested, I stayed and observed the remaining two and a half hours by pure and morbid curiosity. I could not imagine where I was going, but like looking at a fire, I just could not get up and turn it off. The production values ​​are excellent, but the resulting film is a waste of time; wash your socks instead.
