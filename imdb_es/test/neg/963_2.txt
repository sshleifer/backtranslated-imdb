DANGER: Watch for the spoilers that fall ... <br /> <br /> Boy, this was a bad movie. I know they were going for a kind of "true love that conquers everything", but over all this conquered film there were about 3 (which seemed more than 9) hours of my afternoon that I will never come back. The film is about two young lovers called Kai and Gerta who live in a remote city in a fantasy world. Kai is the battered bellboy of a hotel owned by Gerta's father. At first, Gerta ignores Kai's advances, but eventually warms up with him to the chagrin of (You guessed it!) Gerta's father. As if this obstacle was not enough to overcome, an evil snow queen shoots a piece of glass in Kai's eye and becomes a bad person who treats Gerta badly. Finally, Kai is taken to the Fortress of the Snow Queen (which is the same set as the hotel that has just been covered with ice, because the good people of Hallmark like to do everything possible) and Gerta leaves on a mission to recover Kai. On the way, she runs into the other 3 seasons that are evil in their special way, but Gerta escapes them with the help of some boring and forgettable characters she finds on the way. (In the meantime, you'll want to turn it off, but you can not force yourself to do it.) It's probably the most evil and most effective spell cast by the Snow Queen.) Anyway, I'll spare you the end because anything you can think of in your head in this moment is probably better than how they finished it. So, in conclusion, the Snow Queen is an incredibly boring movie, which takes fanatics out of fantasy.
