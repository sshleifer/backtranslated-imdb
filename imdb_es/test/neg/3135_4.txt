First, I would like to admit that Chokher Bali was not my cup of tea. This film was evidently not directed towards the masses. It's the kind that critics would enjoy watching. Advertising and advertising were quite deceptive. <br /> <br /> I expected something very dramatic like Devdas. Realizing that the story and the time period demand it, I found the movie with a very slow pace. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Aishwarya, and I'm sorry to say that I thought she was a mess. The role of Chokher Bali required an actress who could present herself as subversive, not innocent and naive. All the others performed well. Tagore's description of the human condition comes through celluloid to give the film an interesting theme.
