Start with the premise that you will do anything to replace your lost love with a similar look. Incorporate your scientific knowledge of a deforming disease (is not this what Leo G. Carroll contracted from the spider venom in "Tarantula")? Highlight the fact that the main character, instead of finding a way to attract the young person, engages in harassment with heavy hands, until he draws attention completely and has to plot this crazy plan: if he can make the The girl's father gets sick, then help him to recover, she will marry him. The problem is that most events are random and unpredictable. Anyone with half a brain would have seen through things. There is a third, a woman that the doctor, played by J. Carroll Naish, has treated with great insensitivity. You know that she is going to be a factor. There is also a gorilla kept in a cage that is used occasionally to find out what. Oh good. This makes so little sense for who plays and people get their just desserts.
