The reports on the brilliance of this film seem to have been very exaggerated, and, unless the other reviewers were watching a different movie, I do not see how anyone can find this movie more than boring, thoughtless, carefree, prolonged and, sometimes, unbearably irritating. I'm not a fan of horror. I love j-horrors and euro-horrors about American horrors any day, but I feel the need to warn potential viewers about this movie before they invest two hours of their life in it. <br /> <br /> It could have been so big A reporter is investigating a series of strange deaths and occurrences, which seem ostensibly unrelated, but a series of baffling tropes seems to connect them: dead pigeons, loud noises, the presence of knots strangely tied ... Our reporter goes from person to person, interviewing them, filming them and then happening. Three important characters are among this group of people, a shy young psychic, a psychic immensely irritating and insane, and a crazy old woman and her son, whose importance is not revealed until later. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the movie is not even remotely interesting, which makes its two-hour execution time unforgivable. Nor is it remotely frightening or scary. The supposed scenes of fear, such as the taking of macabre faces, are incredibly wrong, they are shown twice or, worse, we are told when they will happen. Other techniques, such as telling us that a family that has just been interviewed "died five days later" simply do not worry me, much less continue to move slowly. <br /> <br /> The movie starts a bit towards the end, while our reporter, cameraman, psychic and damned woman goes to a village to 'eliminate' the curse that unites all these deaths. However, at that time, I was in a state of catatonic boredom, and I could not care less, so all the camera work and the pretty scary downloads were wasted on me. The "final tape" is pretty good, but, once again, I had stopped worrying and I just wanted this movie to end. <br /> <br /> Bored and bored, not scary or scary, I would advise you to stay away from Noroi. It has promising moments, but this is a poorly made movie and it is not worth it.
