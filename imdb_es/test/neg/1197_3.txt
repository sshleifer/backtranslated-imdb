Based on the propaganda on the back of the DVD box; Jonothan Ross 'laughed until it came out a bit'. I suspect that that has more to do with being full. <br /> <br /> I never saw the series for one reason or another, so maybe I'm missing some essential clues. Regarding this movie; I saw the first 45 minutes or so. I laughed once, smiled once, then reached for the newspaper while I waited for something more entertaining to happen. Nothing did it. <br /> <br /> Obviously, I intended to be a surrealist parody of life in the post-Python style, of crude humor, this falls absolutely flat. There has been a series of comedy series on television in recent years, among which are 'Bottom', 'The Fast Show', 'The Vicar Of Dibley' and 'Father Ted', each involving a group of Strange people but Hilarious characters and sketches. Any of these could knock this shit down in a domed hat. <br /> <br /> If the series were something like this movie; I'm surprised they got the financing. Happily, it was one of those Tesco purchases of $ 2 in bran tubs and is now at the local charity store. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is; Do not believe the experts, never pay a dollar.
