BLACK EYE (2 stars of 5 stars) The action movie of the 70s filmed in an unimaginative way seems to have been made for television ... only the occasional word and a secondary plot about lesbianism inform him that the movie really was made to be seen in theaters. Fred Williamson plays a tough-guy ex-cop who becomes a private eye of a tough guy. He runs into a couple of murders and assassination attempts related to a mysterious staff. There are some fights, a car chase inspired by Bullit, a quite original elevator scene and even the time for Williamson to face the rich and lesbian lover of his girlfriend (Teresa Graves). There is also a scene in which Williamson harasses a poor old man by breaking some priceless autographed photos in his souvenir shop. Yes, ready, tough guy ... maybe you can find a cripple to hit later? Obviously destined to take advantage of the success of "Shaft" (this and six thousand other films), this film does not have enough advantage or enough originality to make a great impression.
