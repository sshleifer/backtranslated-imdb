The basic idea behind "Dungeon of Harrow" is not all bad. The performance, however, is bad. The lighting is bad. The music is bad The scenes of torture are without emotion. There really is not much to recommend this movie. You know what kind of movie you're in when the credits say "Special Guest Star" and list someone you've never heard of. You could also say "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln." because there really is no one in this movie that you can identify. There are one or two decent moments, mostly towards the end and I think the basic scheme of the plot may have contained an original idea, but that alone is not enough to keep you awake through this inept yawn.
