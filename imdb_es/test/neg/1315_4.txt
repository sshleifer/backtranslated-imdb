The production values ​​of this film make it below the success of Hollywood, and the script does not reach the cult status. What remains is a tired attempt at formula in the genre of the disaster film that will disappear with the ebb tide. <br /> <br /> A decent cast, either can not be disturbed, or can not be bothered. The beautiful Joanne Whalley can not Bring any character in the role of Police Commissioner Nash, who carries the most irritating waist riveter over her skirt. <br /> <br /> Jessalyn Gilseg plays the heavyweight part of the Thames Barrier Director with all the conviction of a loose silk fair candy. His Canadian nationality and accent were probably written to attract a transatlantic audience. She and she fail. Her initial appearance in a tight pink jogging suit when she arrives at work is laughable. <br /> <br /> The part of the "siren gypsy who was right" is played by Tom Courtenay as if he were acting while he slept, and the various twists of the plot that are designed to energize his son, played by Robert Carlyle, they struggle to get any response from him. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planer seems determined to commit the hari kari ritual for his failures as Office Director, or for his performance, or both, and only David Suchet appears with some credit for his role as Vice PM . <br /> <br /> There was enough in the story, and the cast and effects have produced a decent effort. Unfortunately that did not happen.
