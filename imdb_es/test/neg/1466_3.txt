Hey, remember when Hal Hartley was brilliant? What time it was. I would say that the Book of Life was when things really started to go downhill, but I will say that at least he went uphill for this. A film that seems to be shot on someone's cell phone should not be a bad thing if it were distinguished by an interesting story and dialogue, but, unfortunately, missing, along with Hartley's extravagant dialogue. Instead, there is a tedious exposition on themes of the end of Christian times and a trivial story of a modern Jesus in a dilemma, packaged in a modern world that tries to be a hip in which everyone resembles someone from a movie Hal Hartley. Although it recovers a bit in its second half, it is never pleasant, nor especially sensible. What the hell happened to you, Hartley?
