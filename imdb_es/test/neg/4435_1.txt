Legend has it that at the premiere of the Hollywood gala in 2001: A Space Odyssey, about 20 minutes into the movie, Rock Hudson shouted, "Can anyone tell me what the hell is this movie about?" Well, I hit Rock for about 19 minutes, 59 seconds. This movie did not make any sense at all. Who were those people? Where were those people? What were the rules of the game called the Quintet? Is there any rule for Quintet? Were Robert Altman and his companions forming the film as they went along? What was Paul Newman thinking when he signed this? Maybe Eddie Fast saw Zardoz and thought, "Well, if Connery can get involved in a futuristic movie that does not make sense, I can too." Maybe the good is on the floor of the cutting room and all we can see is the incoherent. Also, was the entire cast able to keep their fun individual hats? You've never seen such strange hats in one place in your life. Quintet simply confirms what I have always thought: when Altman is good, he is excellent, but when he is bad, he does things like Quintet.
