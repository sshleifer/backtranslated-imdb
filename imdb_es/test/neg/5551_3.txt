I debated quite a bit about what rating to give to this one because it is my least favorite Herschell Gordon Lewis movie so far apart from The Gruesome Twosome, but it has the best performance I've seen in a Lewis movie. However, we all know that he is not saying much. Once the film was made, I felt happy because I felt as if I had been sitting in a 4-hour movie, although it only lasted 82 minutes. I'm trying to watch all the HGL movies and that's probably the only reason to watch this one. <br /> <br /> The blood is fine as usual, the only thing Herschell seems to have guessed right. The acting is as bad as always with one exception. That exception is Frank Kress. Now, would you say that he is a good actor? No way, but it's good compared to everyone else. The story is boring and flat and does not go anywhere and in the end, I did not care what happened while it was over. I know this is a cult classic, but I did not enjoy it very much. I hope you will.
