I have seen this movie several times, surely it is one of the cheapest action movies of the eighties. So, I think that many viewers will definitely change the channel when they come across this one. But, if you like garbage, "Dragon Hunt" is made for you. The main characters (the McNamara Twins) wear big mustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage dresses. One of the best scenes is when one of them is shot in the leg and keeps kicking his enemies in nirvana. This movie is really horrible, but, again, it's a great party movie!
