Who the hell had the "brilliant" idea (?) Of choosing Lucille Ball in this movie? It should have been Angela Lansbury's baby all the way. At the very least, Lucy should have doubled her singing. <br /> <br /> There is some compensation in the fact that Jerry Herman's score is pretty well intact with the exception of "That's How Young I Feel", and we do have performances by the original Broadway cast members Jane Connell and Bea Arthur. <br /> <br /> I guess Robert Preston should be given a song, hence the lower "Loving You". <br /> <br /> In general, I think that in this case the wrong redhead was launched.
