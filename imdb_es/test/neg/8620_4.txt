In Thailand, Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) fight in a Muay-Thai fight, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She asks the address of the hotel to a stranger, in fact, to the evil vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and her gang of evil vampires will bite her and kidnap her on motorcycles. Connor joins a clan of "good" vampires led by Sang (Stephanie Chao), trying to save Amanda from the clutches of Niran. <br /> <br /> I expected "Vampires: The Turning" to be a good movie. The places and the cinematography are beautiful; The heavy music is excellent; Stephanie Chao is beautiful and attractive; but unfortunately, the script and the director are terrible and the very loose costume of Meredith Monroe does not help her fallen breasts. The story is very short, and the unknown Marty Weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle racing, fights and boring flashbacks to complete a minimum run time for the film. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vampires: A Convers√£o" ("Vampires: The conversion")
