In fact, I was disappointed with the theft movie, I actually expected some great cat-and-mouse stuff to happen throughout the whole movie and they have some of those cat and mouse things, but it was pretty stupid. And basically it showed all the good scenes in the trailer, in fact, if you've seen the trailer of this, you've basically seen the whole movie because it's so predictable. Basically, the plot is about a few workers in an armored truck company trying to steal the 42 million dollars that they are supposed to transport, until one of the members becomes aware. I thought the movie would be better with its cast of well-known actors, but I was wrong. I want to say that this is not necessarily a bad movie, but it was not as good or has any depth. This is definitely a rental at best, just not worth seeing in theaters. robbery <br /> <br /> 4.8 / 10
