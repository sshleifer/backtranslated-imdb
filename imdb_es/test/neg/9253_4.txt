Lord David Cecil wrote an interesting book in the 1930s EARLY VICTORIAN NOVELISTS, where he observed the works of Dickens, Thackeray, Eliot, Trollope, Mrs. Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte. He selected these writers as the popular favorites of the first half of the Victorian period, and explained their strengths and weaknesses (as he saw them) to the reading public. Some of his comments are quite relevant to this day, but like all criticisms, they also give an idea of ​​the spirit of the times of the critic's life. <br /> <br /> Cecil thought very well of George Eliot (Mary Ann Cross), who wrote about seven or eight books (including sketches and poetry). But for most modern readers, they are generally familiar with their shorter book, SILAS MARNER, which is still read in the high school curriculum. The other books, FELIX HOLT THE RADICAL, DANIEL DERONDA, MIDDLEMARCH, THE MILL ON THE FLOSS, ADAM BEDE, ROMOLA, SCENES OF CLERICAL LIFE, are still printed (Penguin, for example, has the majority printed), but they are mostly unread The most interesting today is his latest novel, DERONDA, where he talks about Jews in English society, and an incipient type of prehertzl Zionism. ROMOLA is his only attempt at a historical novel (about Savanarola's experiment of a religiously pure republic in Florence in the 1490s). His most meaty novel is MIDDLEMARCH, which deals with English society in the provinces in 1832, the year of Lord Gray's Great Reform Law. I had to read MIDDLEMARCH at the university for a literature course. It is certainly a thoughtful book (Virginia Woolf called it the most adult book in the English language). But he suffers (like all Eliot's novels) from a defect: he can not write lively and exciting prose. While Dickens is too exuberant at times, and Thackeray can become pompous and tedious, and Trollope can become (as Lord Cecil says) very common in their discussion, and Charlotte Bronte may fail to explain certain relationships well, and Mrs. Gaskell seems be the best. with female characters, all of them (and Emily Bronte in her only novel) maintain the interest of the reader. Reading most of Eliot's novels is like trying to chisel sentences from marble blocks with a toothpick. <br /> <br /> To date, I have read about fifty pages of MILL OF THE FLOSS. I noticed that one of the other critics never finished the novel as well. But I read a synopsis of what it is about. The Tullivers (Maggie and her brother Tom) are the central figures: they are the owners of the mill in the title. Although it is near the beginning of the story, Maggie falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is involved in legal difficulties with Mr. Tulliver. Mr. Tom has a vague vision of this relationship, and the tragedy of the story is on the subject. divided between the brothers, which culminated with his disappearance in the conclusion (Maggie runs to the mill to rescue Tom during a great flood, and they die together). It must have been a success among Victorian readers, but it is very bleak and depressing for the modern public. <br /> <br /> The movie changed the ending a bit: Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) dies at the end with her lover, and Tom (James Mason) signals her death at the conclusion of his record book. The story is totally rewritten, except for a double death in the flood at the conclusion. It really does not help things. Although Fitzgerald and Mason do quite well with their parts, they can not really lift the film just for their work. The final result is a rather minor film, which fortunately did not hurt the leader's careers. The only thing that must be taken into account is that the groom was played by Frank Lawton, who two years before played David Copperfield as an adult against W.C.Fields, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan. But, in fact, Lawton never had an important cinematographic career, simply happened that he was always present in some images, some good, some mediocre.
