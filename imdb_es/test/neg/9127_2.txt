The problem with this type of lyrical filming is that you either make a masterpiece or a lemon: there is little intermediate ground. Putting it gently, this is not "Berlin, symphony of a city" or "Man with a film camera". Unfortunately, there is not much to see either. <br /> <br /> The problem with this is that it is simple and half done, as if Michael Moore had come on board. It really has nothing to say, or rather, show us with images and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propose a thesis. This is just a mosaic looking for a point. (Although, inadvertently, the film tells us more about Uncle Sam's mind than he pretends.) There is something profoundly paradoxical about an anti-technology, anti-civilization, anti-media film that is so deeply enriched with technology. what I'm telling you, and not what I'm doing. "You just have to love the Yanks, eh.) Tonally, there's something sour and misanthropic in this episode. The two previous episodes had moments of lyricism and euphoria; This time the tone is always grim. It just does not work for this duration, as Gustav Mahler will tell you. <br /> <br /> Stylistically, Naqoyqatsi is a disaster. The digital material is especially wrong. It gives everything a totally fussy and overprocessed look, and also undermines the 'realistic' nature of the analog 'footage found'. (I mean, I feel sorry for the guys.) Part of the joy of Koyanisqaatsi was that it was a tribute to the use of optical film, but now the optical film is a historical artifact, they have to "tackle" the digital domain, but I do not You think it's the cause of it Digital things often look like the video links of CNN or BBC World.) And with the "footage found", well, digital manipulation is often ugly, and usually just silly, and False color and solarization made me think of ... <br /> <br /> ... ahem ... <br /> <br /> sequences of James Bond titles. <br /> <br /> Ahem. Oddly enough, there is also the possibility that the movie was simply stolen by Yo Yo Ma's performance; It is as discreet as Lawrence Olivier's voice-over. The images would have to be very attractive to stack against all that charisma. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass himself is in a strange shape; I never expected him to break Verdi's requirement! (It made me laugh, which, of course, is not the desired response to any part of this movie). There is even a piece of music that sounds like Brahms. (?) Maybe your pills have changed. <br /> <br /> From our department of 'idle questions': Is Geoffrey Reggio really a Hopi Indian? Or just had a sweat in the Hollywood Hills? Oh, and the various fragments of images from the previous "episodes" of the trilogy are a comment on the way these films are also part of the global media?
