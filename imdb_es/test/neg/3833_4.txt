I just can not imagine any possible reason why Madsen and Hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script. Have they blackmailed maybe? Or are they so bad about money? The main problem with the movie is that it is boring. The conversations between the character of Madsen and Hopper are useless, like the boring conversation between two friends while drinking beer on a Saturday night. He never feels for any of the characters (although Madsen's murderous psychopath is very nice, compared to the other characters). Hopper was always a good actor, and Madsen does a good job as a serial killer, otherwise, the acting is almost ridiculous. There are about three scenes in the whole movie where something is happening, each of which lasts approximately three minutes. Although the scenes of "talking and thinking about the murder and the nature of the murderers" would have been interesting, if they were scenes from a book. The whole concept would have been interesting for a novel, but a movie simply can not stand a story with so much internal thought and so little action.
