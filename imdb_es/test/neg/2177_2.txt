Chaplin was a great silent comedian, but many stars of the silent era fell when the audience heard their voices in the first films. In my opinion, Chaplin's voice simply did not fit with his silent characters that made him rich and famous. His career never recovered when the sound reached the cinema. Contrary to most of the criticisms I have read, Chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity among the average viewer who expected comedian Chaultin to entertain himself, and did not spend his money on entertainment watching political commentary of Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Despite Chaplin's knighthood and prizes, I would like to make an exception to his "contributions" to humanity. The Great Dictator was made at the same time that the brutal dictatorship of Stalin was having his trials, and both Dictators signed the agreement that led to the invasion of Poland by both Dictators. WWII began in an attempt to save Poland. The Nazis were defeated in 6 years, but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country. This happened during the time this film was made and the Hollywood investigations by the federal government. If Chaplin had included Joe Stalin in this satire, in addition to including the Italian dictator, he might have received less criticism of his policy from politicians. The mistreatment of the Soviets by the Jews and the dissidents exceeded the Nazis in time and number. <br /> <br /> Judged simply as a movie, many of the gags were too current for younger viewers to understand, who would not know who Goebbels was. , Goring or Mussolini were. A work of classical art must stand the test of time. The classic Greek tragedy, the novena of Mona Lisa and Beethoven are still enjoyed centuries after their creation because they are eternal. Movies that are based on current political commentaries or popular social opinions do not usually last longer than the generation in which they are made. But those who address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high grade on my part. <br /> <br /> Chaplin, since the writer, director and main actor must take responsibility for what I judge to be a dated and tedious film. <br /> <br /> Chaplin's apologists have excused his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous. If Chaplin found the United States so offensive, why did not he return to his homeland? The great Briton fought the Nazis with blood and money. What did Switzerland contribute in the fight against European dictators? Switzerland is like a country club that chooses and chooses its members according to race and class, and cares little for people who can not join the club.
