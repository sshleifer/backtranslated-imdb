Some things just do not stay dead. They just have to come back for more, like it or not. I guess some people like to hit a dead horse. The first 'Ghoulies' was a surprise success and its first sequel was an even better movie. The third film had a more comical approach and by this point, the little bugs were beginning to stay too long in their welcome. I guess someone in Hollywood thought it was a good idea to resuscitate the franchise, but the result will probably disappoint fans of previous entries. <br /> <br /> Advantages: the acting is pretty good for a movie like this one. A silly, but fun score. It moves at a good pace. A little cheese for those who love it. Some pretty good sequences full of action. It has a bit more plot than the others and, unlike II and III, at least tries to link with the original. <br /> <br /> Cons: It's not as fun as its predecessors. Although it has more argument than before, it is quite ridiculous. Poor effects The original Ghoulies only appear in flashbacks and here they are replaced by two trolls that have no other purpose than to be comic reliefs. Speaking of comedy, all attempts at humor are boring. It's a direct sequel to the first movie, but there are so many loose ends. For example, I thought Jonathan had finished with black magic after what happened in the original. Not that it was spectacular in the others, but the direction of this film is especially bland. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: The first three films of 'Ghoulies' are a bad dream for movie lovers. This fourth, and so far the final sequel (hopefully), is a bit disappointing. Of course there is some fun, but it is not the same. The others also have a low budget, but the people involved put much more into them. See if you are a complete or want to see beautiful women in small suits. Otherwise, stay with the other three. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
