TWINS EFFECT is a bad movie in many ways. The only good element is that it is not taken seriously. Apart from that, this is not really a movie, but rather a marketing tool for the two stars of the movie, the popular pop idols in their native Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The film itself is poorly constructed and acted out. The management offers some silly martial arts, which is strange since the action director (and supposedly co-director) is Donnie Yen. Like many Hong Kong movies designed for the teen audience, the large fanbase of "actors" such as the Twins (the two girls who star in this film) and Ekin Cheng, there is so much bad music that forces the audience to believe that certain scenes are fun, smart, etc. <br /> <br /> The final conclusion: it is in vain. Even as a fan of Hong Kong movies, this is a bad movie. It's not funny enough, it's not serious enough, and chewing gum is generally too much for its own sake. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (Go to http: // www nixflix.com for a more in-depth review of this film and other foreign films)
