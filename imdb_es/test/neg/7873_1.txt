One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. When I was trying to see this, I had the flu and had a fairly open mindset for any brainless entertainment. Unfortunately this was too much. How, so many totally ungifted actors can be in a movie? This movie makes porn look like a European art movie. The cast simply pronounces its lines without any emotion; Special thanks to Charlie Snows (Baldwin), the future wife who talks about her divorce as the rest of us talk about the weather. Simply horrible (and fun). <br /> <br /> With a lot of alcohol and friends, this could become a background entertainment and little laughs, just like in the Ed Wood movies. The plot is a joke and a soundtrack directly from some telenovelas. <br /> <br /> Hopefully nobody has paid to see this movie. <br /> <br />
