Before reaching international recognition with The Silence of the Lambs, director Jonathan Demme made an effort to make extravagant comedies. This was one of them and, like a few American Oscar-winning comedies, he could have a good concept, he has a good rhythm, great performances, a complicated romance. but it's just not fun. Pfeiffer is a mafia widow who moves to the backwaters of the city after her husband (Baldwin) is murdered. The crime boss who killed him (Stockwell) is proud of Pfeiffer, his wife (Reuhl) is furious and, to complicate things, Pfeiffer also falls in love with the policeman who is following her. All this should have been a laugh a minute. Pfeiffer, wearing a strong wig is excellent as the widow, just as the hyperactive Ruehl and Modine is also good as the good cop. But the script simply lacks phrases of a single line, wit, humor or punches of the verbal or physical type that this type of film demands. The result is that it raises smiles at best instead of laughter. It oozes charm, but it is tediously lacking in humor.
