This appeared on a DVD that a friend of mine bought me. They had it listed as "The Savage Guns", which was a completely different movie. Obviously, the people who packed the DVD never bothered to look at what they were recording on the disc. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is as bad as it comes. The soundtrack is a combination of TV Batman / Early James Bond / Spaghetti western. A lot of galloping around this music. It seems that the boy has to gallop between scenes to burn a little time and give the people of the soundtrack something to do. <br /> <br /> English doubles over Italian and it really shows. I wish it had been a little worse and then I would have had the country feel of Ed Wood's films. As it is, it's just horrible.
