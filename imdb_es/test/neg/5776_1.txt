Seeing the cover of this before I saw it, my expectations were not high, especially because I was among those other horror films in box office success (along with movies like Junior). <br /> <br /> Okay, not just this The movie has the stereotyped brainless characters (the rich shower bag, the bitch, the sheriff, the local who knows what's wrong in the city, etc.) , but it has such a terrible dialogue, action, direction and CG effect. The guy at Jeremiah Stone was very funny. (* SPOILER *) I will never understand why he bit his finger out of the blue when he held that chick as a hostage. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is as atrocious as the other faults. As far as I could get from him, Jeremiah Stone was a gold prospector during the Gold Rush, and a notorious outlaw. He had a lot of gold, (* SPOILER *) and he cast a curse on anyone who went after his gold before the locals shot him dead after he killed a girl, but not only did he survive, but he also bit the finger. and went out running. So, today, a group of clueless imbeciles find out about this gold mine and, of course, the locals warn them about "The Curse of the Forty-Nine". And what do they do? Unsurprisingly, he ignored the warnings and avidly searched for gold. They get the gold, and all kinds of things continue. Fortunately, (* SPOILER *) the bitch cuts her head. <br /> <br /> That's it. Looking at the cover of the movie, you can tell what kind of movie it will be. It's so terrible that fun. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 stars out of 5.
