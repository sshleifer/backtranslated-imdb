I should live this movie, but I do not. He won international awards, he's a foreigner (I usually like those movies) he's slow (again, something I like) and does not have free sex or violence. The problem is that it is boring. We have two friends from the same town in Turkey, one "successful" and the other not. the bankrupt comes to Istanbul to stay with success in an attempt to get a good job at sea. Both live lives that are not satisfying, meaningless and petty. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not the first time this kind of movie has been made. I did not see anything new being added to this tired subject. There are long shots that are only someone who is standing looking at the sea or sitting in a cafeteria or watching television. I understand that these kinds of things are there to show the emptiness of their loves, although I do have the idea in the first 15 minutes. I do not need to be stuck in the head for the rest of the two hours. <br /> <br /> The symbolism is also a bit heavy. the small fish-like live fish dish with one off the plate and jumping on his death shots. The symbols are better when they are not obvious, but they are there, in the background, creating an environment slightly below the viewer's consciousness. <br /> <br /> The movie is so apathetic, it does not even score a score of 1, so I gave it a 2. To qualify a 1, a talent is bad. This movie did not have that much energy.
