I'm not sure that this movie could match the first, even if it starred in the original seven (despite the fact that four were killed). It just does not have the spark and the chemistry. All the actors seem tired and look as if they were simply following the moves to get their paychecks. <br /> <br /> It's interesting how Yul Brynner is "gorgeous" in the original movie but rigid and unconvincing in this sequel. However, when he starred in Westworld and Futureworld in the 1970s, his character (with the same matching black pants, shirt and hat) evokes the same mystery and presence of Chris Adams in the 1960 film. <br /> <br /> There's nothing in this. 1966 movie to be worth watching, even on cable.
