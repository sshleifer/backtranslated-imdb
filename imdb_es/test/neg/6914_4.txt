J Carol Nash and Ralph Morgan star in a film about a mad scientist in love with the daughter of a pianist. When her advances are despised, she injects to the father a disfiguring illness so that she is forced to go to him to obtain a cure. <br /> <br /> God, this is horrible. It's boring and boring and nods. turned off before the pianist was raised, I was on the edge.
