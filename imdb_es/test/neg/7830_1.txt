Asia Argento has never made a film (as far as I know, and this includes those directed by her own father, Dar√≠o), where she does not show all her anatomy at some point. Indeed, in the most boring opening dialogue scene of all time, poor Madsen has her entering his office and right there, reminding us that even though his hair is pulled back, he can still stick his fingers in his crotch at any moment he does it, but in such a random way "what, am I really seeing that?" The DVD box, the package, makes it look like a fatal woman movie, so you're still waiting to see it become an elegant and minimalist killer ... not so lucky. She is verbose, has been hanging from a bit of aging and, what is worse, does not have credible abilities in physical agility other than (surprise!) Remove ALL clothes when any scene allows it. Her accented English would be great if she did not try to make him look so affected and try to talk like a 12-year-old girl. How is this plot? Suddenly, the weak-minded and nympho-minded woman is forced to kill while she has another business under way and is in charge of a cheap drug business ... eh? What? Is anyone motivated in this film to do more than buy a hamster? The script seems to be oriented to allow everyone to talk a lot about the same things over and over again (I expected the worst performances to appear as a producer who invested money just to spend some time on the screen): there's nothing. overlooking the obvious shortcomings of the Asian character who at any point in the film offers what the cover of the DVD promises. She is weak ... but she knows how to kill. she flages a lot She gets naked, she gets naked, she even moves with the clothes of a dead woman ... she's very loose and unmotivated. In fact, "Floppy" would have been a great name for this movie ... and a photo of Asia fainted with an angry image on the cover would have been a better representation ... there are actually pictures of your plane food! What is that about? <br /> <br /> The end does not make sense, everyone is simply upset in their attempt and in the execution of all the objectives. Lester's wife does not release any REAL revenge (bringing someone to bad karoeke is a threat to life but is not really valid) ... and Lester simply floats without making a big proclamation of anything. Key art totally deceitful ... yes, we know that Asia lost the chubby of her first child, but in reality, it's not worth trying a whole movie that tries to be interesting enough to lead a movie about a passive-aggressive girl . See Point of no return instead.
