Well, I must say that at the beginning I found that this short was quite normal, but after having seen it almost 5 times since (it is constantly shown in IFC), I developed an enjoyment of the simple elements of the plot and the reality of the situations presented. Sofia Coppola brings a solid addition to the category.
