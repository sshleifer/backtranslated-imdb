If you took all the elements of a Shrek movie (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitten, obligatory dance number, etc.), put them in a blender and condensed them to 20 minutes, you will have this disaster. Painful to see; I may have laughed once. History and dialogue rush beyond comprehension, with the voice actors sounding as if they had telephoned their lines. The last reworked version of the poem "The Christmas Story" felt as if it had been written by a committee in five minutes. And boy, a little Eddie Murphy goes a long way. With his desperate attempt to be modern and current, this show will be obsolete and forgotten for a long time, while the classics like "The Grinch?" It will remain timeless. A sad loss of effort on the part of all involved, a real "shark jump" for the Shrek franchise.
