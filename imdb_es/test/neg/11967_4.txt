I guess 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is a boring slasher movie. Yes, it has a good point, but it is a rehash of another movie. The acts are so horrible nor the plot. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a legend about a scarecrow living in the corn field. When an initiation becomes a joke and causes the life of a child in danger, the scarecrow comes alive and begins a deadly frenzy. Sound familiar, right? It's derived from Scream, Friday the 13th, Jeepeer Creepers, Children of the Corn, whatever you want. <br /> <br /> 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is well below average. He barely has a moment of fear. Even the final scene is laughable! Unfortunately, we can still enjoy it as our time killer. But I prefer that you see something else instead. Unless you're a fan of bad and cheesy movies, of course. <br /> <br /> 4/10
