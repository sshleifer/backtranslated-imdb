Lisa Grant (Adrienne Barbeau) is a real estate agent who is in danger of being killed by a crazy madman who kills people in her profession and believes that house prices rise too much. As the reasons go, this is quite a long way behind. Lisa's boyfriend is a talk show host that the killer keeps calling on the air. At first I was sure that it was supposed to be a comedy or a satire of some kind, but as the minutes went by without stopping, I realized that it was not and that the film was totally incompetent in all aspects, shapes and forms. . I'm surprised that something this horrible has not been directed by Jeff Lieberman (yes, send me a hate email again, Jeff, hack it). Anyway, back to the movie, poor, poor Barbeau, you can point EXACTLY when your film career caught fire and it all started here. <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: The Movie Channel
