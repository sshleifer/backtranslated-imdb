I will not reiterate what many others have said about this film; I will try to add some new points. The Coolio-as-vampire bit is a nod for fans who are familiar with their turn in the Blondie song "No Exit", in which he assumes the role of a vampire rapper (actually works as a musical concept and in fact it's a great song). Casper Van Dien is not worse than Brad Pitt and is actually more handsome. And really, what is someone engaged in a Brad Pitt movie that is not in sight? The same here, although this is badly filmed (check "Starship Troopers" instead). And, of course, Udo Kier, after playing Dracula in the Morrissey / Warhol movie, has little more than a cameo. Enjoy it if you can.
