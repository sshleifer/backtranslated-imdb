Fun with Dick and Jane did not entertain on so many levels. There were loose ends with the writing, for example, it seems that one of the main conflicts was the accusation of the character of Jim Carrey, DIck Harper, but the writers never follow that particular conflict. Basically, the story is weak and almost without grace, but Carrey saves some scenes with his physical humor, but honestly, Jim Carrey was not very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone could have been there just because of his appearance because he was not there. funny either. This is just another example of the Hollywood bench of franchise actors with an unoriginal story.
