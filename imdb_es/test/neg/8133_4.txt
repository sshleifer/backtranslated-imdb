Julien Hernández is certainly an attractive and pleasant person on the screen. In fact, his character has practically all this movie, or what is worth it. The problem is that, with the exception of his friend (played by Marisa Petroro) and Paul Lekakis (as a trick / date / boyfriend for some of the characters), no one else comes close. Hernandez plays a director of 30 years of Cuban heritage, and of unknown sexuality, who comes to L.A. and get a job as a gay documentary. In the process of meeting a group of homosexual people while finding issues, he leaves ... but very little. Even at 88 minutes, the film has obviously been stretched and padded with several devices from the film school, most of which end up interrupting the narrative (which is not much to begin with) or pointing out the overall amateur character of The Movie. movie theater. <br /> <br /> What a shame, because there is a love story somewhere, and in the last three minutes, when Sebastien de Hernández finally clicks with a rich West Hollywood party thrower (very well played by Lonnie Henderson) and they share some touching and sensual kisses, it works despite everything that came before. But we do not really care about any of the other characters or their situations: Why does handsome Dante have a Eurotrash conviction for a boyfriend? He did not want to And I do not even mean the "rules" of Sebastien's friendship, Paulie, for dating. No gay man I know, demons, no sensible person, period, would put such restrictions on himself or on other people. And, please, tell me how Sebastien gets a peeled banana (which is usually quite sparkling, right?) He gets stuck in his ass and has to go to a doctor to have it removed? <br /> <br /> I noticed that Hernandez won a prize for this movie as a "short film", probably should have stayed like that. Having said all this, I expected to see Hernandez on the screen again, in a better written comedy with a more secure address.
