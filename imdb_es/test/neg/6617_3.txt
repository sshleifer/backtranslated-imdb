Despite the famous cast, this animated version of Dickens' story is the most beautiful I've seen. Enough that I went to kicks in the first commercial. The characters did not appeal to me at all and the animation seems cheap. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie a very low rating. Give me the Disney version at any time.
