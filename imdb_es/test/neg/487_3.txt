I did not expect a classic, but at least a funny movie. There were only a few scenes that make you laugh, but nothing more. It does not scare you that it is full of clich√©s of American teenagers and you can guess what will happen easily. <br /> <br /> But it says a lot about a senior student at a Turkish high school. Pressure of the student selection test (OSS): the 3-hour test determines which university you will go to and think about the test when a ghost is behind you is not an exaggeration. The movie is bad Do not waste your time to see it.
