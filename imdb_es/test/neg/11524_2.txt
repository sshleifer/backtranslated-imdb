I rented this movie because I'm a big fan of Dudikoff. I thought it could not be so bad. Boy was wrong! At the 15 minute mark, I was begging others to let me take out the DVD and return it to the rental store, but they refused. They swore that he had to improve. <br /> <br /> They were wrong! This movie was missing everything. The actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock! The plot was ridiculous and it offended me that Hollywood assumed that people were foolish enough to enjoy it. None of the characters interacted very well with each other. Ice-T offers one of its worst performances here. <br /> <br /> After seeing images of the wrong plane, the bad guys got up to receive the shots and the clips emptied and they missed everything, I wanted to scream and hit my head on concrete. The film reached its plateau of ignorance when people on the space station used an elevator to travel. Space suits are not necessary and there is gravity in space, regardless of what real astronauts say. <br /> <br /> I did not finish this movie and I hated it. I do not want to end this movie. This is a slow suicide. I could feel my cerebral cortex planning to avenge the torture I subjected to it.
