I like Steve Buscemi. I like his work very much, both as an actor and as a director. You could say that I am -in- Steve Buscemi. A crazy man by Steve Buscemi. I'm on the lookout for Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> I remember when I first saw Buscemi's directorial debut, "Trees Lounge." I enjoyed the movie, although it was not as good as it could have been. It was-almost-there. It almost took away that itch, the itch of wanting to see "small" movies about "little" people in "little" bars that are in "small" cities. I was close enough to where I would say it was a very good movie, one that with a few tweaks could have been great. But that's okay. I like the movie and I've seen it more than once. <br /> <br /> But this review is not about Trees Lounge. It is "Jim lonely." When I saw the description of the movie and then saw who the movie was, I was excited to finally see the movie that I knew Trees Trees could have been. But what I really experienced was no different than leaving one of those small city bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and a lot of cheap trinkets, returning to your apartment with a soft brain and full of exciting perspectives that inevitably disintegrate in the reality of Impotence induced by alcohol and regurgitation in the head. <br /> <br /> In other words, this movie left me flat and unrequited and I regret having lost the time and money it cost me to get to that state: the equivalent of the movie of waking up next to that cheap herd the next morning, or if you're a vagabond, wake up next to that stinky, stony, unshaven imbecile. The film had all the essence of a white bread sandwich (with store-brand white bread, no less) and the excitement of a corpse. I'm not sure what the point of this film was, and since it was supposed to have some kind of point and it was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can be endured without one, this lack of a point is a sin of omission. Sorta likes those new cars that no longer come with ashtrays, although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (I'm not one of them, but hey, I can sympathize). In general, it was a boring movie about boring people who do boring things and have nothing of the agility and credibility that can carry and save a movie of this type. I mean, Trees Lounge was about boring people doing boring things, but it was interesting. <br /> <br /> I blame Affleck a lot of this. Why do people keep casting these Turks from Affleck? They take away life from anything they are connected to. One Affleck was in a decent movie (and it was not even the reason why the movie was decent) and, suddenly, every hole called Affleck is stinking as many movies as possible. And Liv Tyler is not better. Being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily act as an actress. She is as lifeless as Affleck. These people just do not get up from the script's flat page. People pay to watch movies and deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma: these two fake boards do not have the spark of the old man who delivers shopping carts at Wal Mart. I always thought that Steve Buscemi was the kind of person who would rise above this kind of pablum, but oh Steve, you disappointed us. This movie makes me want to get into another wood chipper.
