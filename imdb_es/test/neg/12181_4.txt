First of all, I'm a big fan of Bronson, since the late 70's. I saw all the movies he made on the big screen from "Love and Bullets", which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big star, the Hollywood star . <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for things to change. Around him, he would make a really good movie in the 80s, but that never happened. And I do not know what he was thinking when he signed with Cheapjack Cannon's studio and hack director J. Lee Thompson for most of his latest films. <br /> <br /> "Assassination" gave me some hope when I saw that. Peter Hunt was directing instead of Thompson, but those hopes quickly fell apart. First of all, the movie seems incredibly cheap, as if it were made for approximately 3 million, minus Bronson's inflated salary (I heard he insisted on 5 million per image, which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his films Cannon). The scenes of the White House were filmed on the grounds of West Virginia in western Los Angeles: I was taking the bus when they were firing. Good job in the recreation of the white house, but did not anyone think of getting the palm trees out of the shots? I suppose not. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the cast is really bad. Ireland was dying of cancer and, despite this, it is not bad, but the horrible Asian woman who played with Bronson's partner was typical of Cannon's talent at the time: nonexistent. I would be very curious to know how he got this role. I can not imagine a worse actress for the role, besides, she's 40 years younger than Bronson! The story is not so bad and it's something that bigger and better budgeted studios did later ("In the Line of Fire" by Eastwood and the movie "Bodyguard" by Costner), but the way it is presented here is really sad. I wonder if they could not afford to do more than one or two shots per shot. None of that is credible in the least. If the Secret Service men really behaved like the key cops in this movie, we would have presidents rotating from office (and out of life) every few months ...
