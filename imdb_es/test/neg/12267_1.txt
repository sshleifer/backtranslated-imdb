Everything about this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> In the first five minutes you can say that this movie is going to be terrible. However, you can not measure how bad it is going to be. <br /> <br /> We started the movie with a seemingly endless introduction scene with gay music and no dialogue. To make the camera move up and down, the big ones who try to appear mental do not cause the slightest emotion. <br /> <br /> What begins then seems to be one of the two separate stories. The first half of the movie consists of the wogs competing in midnight pay bouts with other ethnic groups. The wogs always win, of course, because they apparently lift weights and have "respect." It is in these scenes that we first see the degree of bad acting, editing, scripts and hatred towards the people who financed this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the main character and his partner are sent to prison. The whole part of the prison film is not related to what I assume is the plot, and it consists of a lot of fights. <br /> <br /> Once out of prison (3 years for murder?) The main character and his partner meet with the wogs. Then they go to the "other side of the city" and try to bend down, because apparently everyone wants to kill them. <br /> <br /> soon the wogs prepare for the rape of another gang girl and run around the city fighting against hordes of different gangs. This point of the movie can be compared to an arcade game, since the wogs simply run and fight against enemies that apparently get worse as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie ends with some Fighting Climate Scene in which the remaining wogs (the two main characters) face all the gangs they have fought with so far. Apparently, the other gangs have no problem joining the remaining wogs (skinheads do not care about Asians). After a million other people are hit by the invincible wog brothers, the film ends with the main characters heading home. However, they do not arrive home because they are burned by the thousands of angry movie critics who assault the set and leave angry letters everywhere. <br /> <br /> This movie may look more like a computer game then a movie, because that would explain how two men can receive about a million hits in the face of a million different people than most people do. Sometimes they are twice their size. <br /> <br /> There are also tons more stupid unexplainable events in this movie, like an Asian who fights his own gang and takes a katana to the head just to let the wogs escape. <br /> <br /> As someone else mentioned, this movie is not so bad It's funny, it's so bad.
