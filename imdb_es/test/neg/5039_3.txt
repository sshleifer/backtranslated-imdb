To this day, Malcolm McLaren is telling anyone foolish enough to believe that the Sex Pistols were his idea and that the members of the band were his puppets to use them to earn money. There is a good reason for him to do this, namely, that he is a liar. <br /> <br /> Here are some real facts. <br /> <br /> * The band approached McLaren to be a manager, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> * The Pistols were a strictly organic band and not created by McLaren or anyone else. Jones and Cook were childhood friends. Rotten and Vicious went a long way too. This is something that has led to unfair criticism of the Pistols over the years, as they have been compared to bands of manufactured boys. <br /> <br /> * The band and nobody else wrote the songs, recorded them, played live, created the publicity and gave the interviews. <br /> <br /> * McLaren did not instigate the Bill Grundy incident. The Pistols only appeared on the show because Queen had retired. According to the band, McLaren was cowering in the back in case of arrests. <br /> <br /> * Johnny Rotten left the band. He was not fired. <br /> <br /> * Far from outwitting the Sex Pistols, John Lydon (Rotten) actually sued him successfully in the 1980s for control and a considerable sum of money. Some of the evidence used by Lydon's lawyers comes from McLaren's boast in 'The Great Rock & Roll Swindle'. This would suggest that McLaren is not too smart despite his affectations. <br /> <br /> * The layoffs and subsequent compensation of A & M and EMI were not designed, it was simply the way things were resolved. <br /> <br /> * McLaren boasts of the money he made from the band. If I had been competent, I could have done much more. It seems that he could not even organize the concerts correctly. <br /> <br /> * McLaren's claim at the beginning of the movie that he invented punk rock can be refuted in about ten seconds. The Pistols were not the first punk band, just the highest profile. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. The only parts that are worth seeing are the genuine images of the band, which were then used much better in "The Filth And The Fury".
