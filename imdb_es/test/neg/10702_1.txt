All I heard when I was raised was the equality of the sexes, and here we have a film that not only exemplifies the imbalance, but continues with the concept that one sex is better. As he watched, he hoped that redemptive quality would make the viewer feel as if there was hope for the future, and there was not. I admit that I did not finish the movie, I had to turn it off in the part where the old whore told the genetic Adam that it was fine to be a whore and get, and I quote: "More tail than any other man in the past." I know that not finishing it is a bad criticism for myself, but it is the responsibility of the writer and the team to develop a story that will keep the viewer interested and failed. This film reveals all the qualities of the true feminine nature of the mother figure and the need for balance. Instead, it exemplifies what America would be like for lesbian natzis, and I'm not against lesbians. Thank you, Mr. Director! Someone, please, give me a redeeming quality ... wait, I have it! There is no sequel!
