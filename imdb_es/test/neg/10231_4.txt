I had to rent a couple of movies for my little cousin for New Year and she chose The Swan Princess: The mystery of the enchanted kingdom and The Little Mermaid 2 and we only saw both movies, while she sleeps, I thought I could get A couple comments. :) Although this is a very corny caricature, it really was not so bad. You have to admit that for children, these plots are new to them and it could be a great introduction to these stories for them. <br /> <br /> Odette discovers that Derek has been secretly keeping Rosthoe's magical secrets and she tells Derek to destroy them immediately, but he is a man, usually does not do it and tells him he could not achieve magic without your help. When a witch named Zelda takes her hands on them, she discovers that Derek ripped out the last words of a spell he wants to use to destroy everything, and kidnaps Odette to retrieve this information. <br /> <br /> The Swan Princess: The mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom is foolish and predictable, but for children, honestly, I would say it is an opportunity. It's so weird that we have these cartoons clean today, so I'm going to cut the film a bit. It was just weird to see that all the voices changed suddenly, I grew up with the first, so I guess it was just in my head. <br /> <br /> 4/10
