Most likely, "Cleopatra 2525" has little interest if you did not watch the series when it aired; And I do not think many people did it. But if you're still somewhat intrigued, it's a premise of "Buck Rogers in the 25th century" without spaceships and no budget for costumes or production design. <br /> <br /> In this case, the part of Buck Rogers (Cleopatra) is played by Jennifer Sky. What one might expect to be a good thing, since Jennifer is very beautiful and quite talented; And it has a nice comedian touch. But a quick look at the promotional material will show that she is a bit worse for having a bad haircut and a Salvation Army Thrift Store wardrobe. If you remember how attractive Jennifer was during her time in "Xena", her disheveled appearance of Cleopatra will be a big disappointment. With an audience of "male teenagers looking to burn their eyes and looking at" girls in fetish attire "it is not a good idea to skimp on the exploitative value of their heroine or their disguise, and they wonder why some series do not. I love it or I hate it, "Buck Rogers" had more attractive costumes and invited stars with much better looks. <br /> <br /> The other two elements of the exploitation are the two associated women of Cleopatra; Hel (Gina Torres basically playing with his character "Firefly" and Sarge (Victoria Pratt-another connection "Xena", an extremely wooden version of Natasha Henstridge.) Torres does a good job playing the character of Cleopatra, providing most of the comedic relief from the show. <br /> <br /> Torres sings the theme, a somewhat loose parody of "In the year 2525 by Rick Evans (Exordium and Terminus)" (1969) .Remember the one that opens with the words "In the year 2525 If the man is still alive, if the woman You can survive, you can find ... "I suspect they gave him his title so they can cut this catchy little song, but who knows, maybe the title is a tribute to" Buck Rogers "and they thought about using the song later. <br /> <br /> Then, the premise of the show is that the surface of the Earth has been taken by aliens called Bailies (not the WKRP one) and humans have been driven underground. Our three heroines fight against the Bailies under the direction of a disembodied female voice (presumably) (appropriately called "Voice"). Unlike Buck Rogers, Cleopatra is a kind of weak third puppet, still dazed and confused by her cryogenic dream or perhaps simply disoriented by the hair-raising haircut. There are many beautiful close-ups of Sky with their eyes open and bewildered. Like "Buck Rogers", the gag that runs is Cleopatra using a common expression of the 21st century and all find them totally profound or completely disconcerting. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Firefly," the action is more of that hyper-edited "Xena" crap that is neither realistic nor particularly funny. A good trick is that the girls travel to the fashion of "Spiderman", a kind of spider web through tunnels and wells in the labyrinth of their underground world. <br /> <br /> Strangely (or perhaps without considering the budget) these are only half-hour episodes and, except in a two-part program, there is not enough time for subtlety and nuances. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
