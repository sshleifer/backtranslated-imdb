I have seen almost all the Kurosawa movies and dozens of other Japanese films as well. In comparison to these other movies, this is a fairly average to poor movie. The plot presents two brothers at war, none of whom mattered much to me, and it is very confusing to keep up with who is allied with whom. The music and the cinematography are pretty good, but the special effects, sometimes, are terrible: the rubber heads fly with almost the same realism as the average game of high school! In addition to these complaints, the end of the film completely DESTROYS and REPLACES the complete image. It turns out that the ending is not true, but it was completely "fudged". What is the point of this, then? If you've seen this movie, understand that there are MANY better movies, so do not give up!
