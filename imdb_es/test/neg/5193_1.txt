While the film has a function of redemption, that is, some striking shots, for example, the shot of the sheep hanging from the tree, the scene of the funeral procession on the raft or the scene of the boats leaving the village ( which seems to be influenced by the scene when the warships approach in the fantastic "Fellini Satyricon"), these were more photographic than cinematographic, and would have been better appreciated hanging on a wall in an art gallery that painfully embedded in a movie slow that reaches a whopping 162 minutes and suffers from a terrible dialogue, an extremely poor character development, acting, symbolism without inspiration and heavy stylization. This is the first movie I've seen by Angelopoulos, and his reputation had preceded him, I expected much better, but I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I will not get out of My way of seeing any another job of the director in the future. The four friends with whom I went to see him agree.
