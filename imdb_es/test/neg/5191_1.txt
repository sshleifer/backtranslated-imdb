Ewe, the opening screams zero budget. The titles that were heard as if my grandson had been released with iMovie. The DVD box gives the impression that you will be invited to the old days of the 80s movies. NOPE! Almost no nudity from a movie starring Traci Lords! This movie really needed nudity too. Instead, there are many gentlemen who point through a shirt, however, they seem to be activated by hot steam. It's strange, in my world the headlights light up in the COLD. <br /> <br /> The plot is pathetic, the blind is just a joke and not a joke. Their antics are so forced and predictable. He stumbles on things and you see him preparing for the fall. He needs to work on his physical comedy. <br /> <br /> Most of Frostbite's nudity comes from a scene in a jacuzzi that appears to have been filmed months later and inserted to obtain a distributor. And nudity is not worth it. <br /> <br /> NamoiBucks; It's only a matter of time before Starbucks claims it. Not even funny. When Billy comes to town for the first time when they meet Namoi Bucks, he says: "Wow, they have them everywhere." This leads you to believe that it is a parody of Starbucks, but, surprise, behind the counter of this location is Namoi. Apparently, he loves coffee so much that the owner of this great chain decided to work in a small cold city. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie has in its favor is Warren Miller's snowboarding material. Yes, this is all about Warren, so if you want to see a great action, get a Warren Miller movie. Leave Frostbite alone. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good in this movie. There is no reason to rent it or buy it, and if a friend offers you a loan for free. Hit it and the friendship ends.
