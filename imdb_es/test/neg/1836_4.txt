Medical student Paula Henning wins a place in an exclusive medical school in Heidelberg. When the body of a young man he met on the train appears at his dissection table, he begins to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death and discovers a frightening conspiracy perpetrated by a secret anti-rival society operating in the school. Disgusting and disgusting, many parts of fear. It even has a good script and ending. But it has a poor part. What else could you see in this movie? It's a good movie of mystery and terror. But, of course, if you like it, go buy it. If you do not, there's still no reason to spend your money on this. <br /> <br /> Rating R for extreme graphic violence, sexual situations and obscene language.
