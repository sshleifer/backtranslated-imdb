Smart summary, is not it? <br /> <br /> If Mad Max was something simple, direct, nothing special, but nothing bad in a little movie either, they invented it totally with their sequel, The Road Warrior. So, in theory, with a third great movie, it would have been a great trilogy ... now, it's not! <br /> <br /> What a disappointment was Beyond Thunderdome! Its main premise is quite good, with an 'underworld' (think of a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but all this is not carried out with too much conviction. Add the unpleasant Tina Turner and the not good story of people waiting for a plane, and this is just a big stinker. <br /> <br /> Maybe they can clarify things again with part 4 (although that is likely to be just a big budget explosion), because this is not right. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
