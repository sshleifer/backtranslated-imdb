"Love Life" explores a culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay. The issue seemed convincing to me, even if the conflict was a bit forced and resolved too easily. For example, Thomas falls in love with Joe too quickly and conveniently for the plot. There are many continuity errors: another user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses ... the one that caught my attention was the fact that the configuration of Joe's facial hair seemed to change from scene to scene. In the end, I found myself more excited by this movie than moved. Stephan D. Gill has a pretty nice body and shows it several times with dexterity and exuberance of porn star, and with too many functions like chops. Many times, the movie seems like it's going to go complete with porn. Stephanie Kirchen does a good job, but her lighting moment finally got a little messy for me, as I wanted to have a good romp in the shower at the end of this movie.
