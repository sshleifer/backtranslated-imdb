I found this movie a big disappointment, especially considering the cast. The characters are not credible, as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves. The only part of the movie that I enjoyed was when the most annoying characters are finally killed. Special effects consist mainly of scenes of dead or dying corpses. A typical unimaginative slasher movie. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, does not believe that a solitary creature that sneaks in goats in the middle of the night could be captured by a group of bumbling idiots and noisy. . Equally impossible to believe it is how they knew exactly where to find it, despite the fact that the creature has evaded capture or even photography. <br /> <br /> The man who makes the impossible to capture the Chupacabra alive is our unidimensional Dr. Peña (Giancarlo Esposito). The only thing with which Dr. Peña is more obsessed than with the creature is his dart gun. A dart gun that works when bullets fail. <br /> <br /> The captain of the ship (John Rhys-Davies) is presented as a "war veteran". Use your military prowess by having your men shoot the creature, no matter where they are on the ship. The Navy Seals that appear out of nowhere repeat the pattern of shooting at everything. <br /> <br /> Dylan Neal plays an insurance investigator who climbed aboard the cruise to catch a thief. He spends most of the movie together with whoever is trying to kill the creature at this time. <br /> <br /> The creature does not even look much like a Chupacabra. Neither behaves like one. Instead of a small, shy and secretive animal that hunts in secret at night, we got Freddy Kruger bulletproof, killing everything is in sight. A simple search on Google would have been very useful for writers and the special effects team.
