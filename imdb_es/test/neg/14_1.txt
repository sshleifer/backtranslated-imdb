Some may opt for a movie like this, but surely I did not. A university professor, David Norwell, suddenly receives a yen for adoption. He almost takes the first child offered, a bad choice called Adam. It turns out that Adam does not have both oars in the water, which, almost immediately, causes great stress and confusion for Dr. Norwell. This sobbing story was played happily with one problem after another, all focused on the disabilities and convulsions of Adam. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor as an adopted child was never explained. On the way, the good doctor managed to attract a woman to share in all the hell that the little one was handing out. Personally, I think they were both a beer less than a six pack. Skip this yawn
