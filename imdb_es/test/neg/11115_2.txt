"Chupacabra Terror" was saved from a "1" thanks to the presence of the Canadian Chelan Simmons as the heroine.It is a delight to see her from the front, the back and the side.Otherwise, what you have here is your film of standard monsters, playing as a low budget version of THE RELIC, John Rhys-Davies is the captain of the ship in which the monster is transported, and the very simple monster is simply a man in a suit. About 100 people with no sense, bloody murders, at least, so the body count in this one is pretty amazing ... Formula, to say the least, I love the moment when Simmons sinisterly tells someone what Chupacabra means: Goat eater ... Oooohh ... terrifying!
