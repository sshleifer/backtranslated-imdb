Now, any fan of Blaxploiation will recognize the ingredients: great Afros, topless babes, surreal bad fads and some "jive" talk. In this case, add a clue that can not act, a plot that does not make much sense, edited by someone without hands that has blindfolded and the most frightful fighting scenes and you have 'TNT Jackson'. It's not bad enough to be good, but not bad enough to be bad, this is a big mess from start to finish. I especially loved the endless continuity errors and the double white lead trick. <br /> <br /> This is so bad in the 70s that the martial arts of the Far East meet the black power that hurts, but it hurts a lot! I am ashamed to admit that I almost enjoy it.
