Regardless of whether the predominant social message of this film, that the vigilante's justice is acceptable, is justifiable, McConaughey's final statement insulted me more. In a drama in court, the final statement of the defense attorney is practically the crux of the film, and when the problem is as difficult to solve as this one, the statement is delivered to the public and the jury. This basically implies that the public believes that the rape of a white girl is a more horrible crime than the rape of a black girl. For my part, I find this very insulting. As for the rest, I thought the acting was reasonable, with the exception of Sandra Bullock, who seems to be playing her usual bubbly personality (it does not really work in a court drama), but what is the point when the message of the movie is so bad? how does this tell you that the vigilante's justice is fine and accuses you of racism if you do not agree?
