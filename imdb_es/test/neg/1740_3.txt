This feeble attempt to divert your typical bland Japanese horror film to a spooky cult hit did not have the ammunition necessary to keep the viewer involved at all times. After translating it into a vortex, Uzumaki deals with precisely that: an irrational and overabundant tribute to the strange downward spiral towards nothingness that seems to have captivated a small town in dementia obsessed with lunatics. While this undoubtedly makes for a pleasant b movie on the surface, the traditionally boring performance, direction and script will have all but the Asian horror fans shaking their heads in dismay. What might have been translated roughly to the Japanese equivalent of a previous piece by David Lynch, instead, is a spiral trick before he even has a chance to explain himself, which, of course, he does not. Apart from some clever techniques employed, the film seldom connects the dizzying themes with the boring script, which ultimately appears as a cheap exploitation in the cult genre, replacing the hollow images with a genuine substance. When the movie was over, almost none of the interactions were obtained, except for some scenes or images that rose above the one-note movie. I applaud the creators for at least trying to take the genre to more supernatural metaphysical realms and understand the harsh losses lost in the translation, but with a zero substance to back up any of its oddities, this will likely be relegated to obscure the fanboy bong - basements hidden.
