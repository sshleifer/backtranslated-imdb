This is a very low budget movie, placed in a place in a valley protected by the effects of radiation. The cast, an older man and daughter, an attractive visitor, a couple (a strong purchase and a girl), a vagabond, a donkey and a man affected by radiation, interact during the after effects of a nuclear explosion. To this is added an entity that watches women take a bath. <br /> <br /> They all have guns, some of them are shot, others are told to have children, others are killed and others just walk away and well, this is the movie. The first film by Harvey Cormann, shows a certain simplicity in the making of films. To avoid expensive sets, the actors go through the curtains to enter and leave the house (that is, the studio). The location photos filmed in the hills near Hollywood are the backdrop. <br /> <br /> I would not say it's worth going out of your way to see, but it's interesting to see how movies were made with human subjects in the 50s.
