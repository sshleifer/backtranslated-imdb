"Hoods" does not deliver the goods. This half-mafia comedy has a star cast, which includes Joe Mantegna, Kevin Pollack, Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly and Seymour Cassel, along with a series of familiar faces for those who watch crime movies, but it's truly a fire mistake if there's always been one Writer and director Mark Malone, best known for writing "Dead of Winter" for the director of "Bonnie & Clyde" Arthur Penn, has prepared a pedestrian kettle that has a sick mafia boss but vengeful Louie Martinelli (Seymour Cassel) dispatching his son Angelo (Joe Mantegna from "House of Games") to beat Carmine DellaRosa. It seems that a rival mafia bombed one of Pop's stores (in the opening scene) and Martinelli wants a return. The problem is that nobody has any idea who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other mafia comedy, such a complication can be fun, but here it is simply flat. Angelo and a bunch of smart shoppers, including his best friend Rudy (Kevin Pollack from "Deterrence") spend half the time trying to figure out who Carmine is. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to make the hit, so they track down a crazy Mafia killer, Charlie (Joe Pantoliano from "Bad Boys"), to do the dirty action. Before they can convince Charlie to do the hit, they have to locate him, and Charlie's whore wife, Mary (Jennifer Tilly from "Bound") reveals that he is locked in a psychiatric hospital. Our misfit heroes sail to the psychiatric hospital and separate Charlie. Approximately half of the film ends before they discover that Carmine is a boy in shorts (Vincent Berry) that is tasteless and harmless. In fact, Carmine has the only decent line in the movie. While our group of brainless heroes walks away from home with him in the back seat to take care of business, Carmine warns them that they need to take him home in time or his father will kill him. Charlie tries to freeze the hedgehog, but he can not. Instead, he reconnects with his feelings and wants to return to the psychiatric hospital to be able to tell his doctor the good news. Meanwhile, after Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine, the boy puts his paws on the gun and fires several rounds aimlessly. He and Angelo fight for the automatic. The gun comes out of his collective hands and hits the ground, shoots and makes a hole in Rudy's chest. Now, keep in mind that Rudy never wanted to shoot the child in the first place, and he and Angelo argued about the bad head of the blow. So Rudy ends up on the floor with a fatal wound, while Angelo struggles to stop the bleeding. Talk about a boring death scene. Angelo is in conflict because his father ordered the coup and Angelo fears that Papa will do it if he does not execute the orders. There is a secondary argument about Angelo's father teaching him how to handle a gun that provides an idea of ​​Angelo's reluctance to pack a gun. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that can remotely be redeemed about this depressing comedy with a final disappointment. . Things get worse, and if you endure this 90-minute absurdity, you'll see what I mean. The comedy is largely without laughter. Good actors wallow in sketched papers that are not even funny. Maybe director Malone was trying to make another comedy like "The gang that could not shoot directly." If he was, he lost it by a mile. The busty Jennifer Tilly shows cleavage and growls through a couple of scenes with Mantegna, but she does nothing more than nothing. She is the stereotyped whore who does not even get naked. A paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast, otherwise, this image is pathetic from start to finish. Initially, I was hoping that this could be an imitation of "Ransom of Red Chief" where the kid drives the wise guys crazy, but there's not so much luck here. Of course, the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a child, but it is not the kind of surprise that makes you want to see it until it is resolved. The Canadian DVD label "Sevilla" and contains only the most basic special features. If you hate the previews that give the plot, do not look at the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna, one of your first questions should be why he helped produce this yawn. It is neither hilarious nor dramatic. There are no citable lines, and none of the characters stands out as interesting or sympathetic. The Seville DVD presents the film in full frame without subtitles or subtitles.
