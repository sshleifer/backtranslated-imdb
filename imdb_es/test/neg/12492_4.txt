I expected a lot from the SARKAR role of Mr. Emabab Bachan, but I am disappointed. Being the course of a Ram Gopal Verma, I was not prepared for this kind of movies. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the film shows that Amitabh is too dependent on the power of others instead of his. There is a film in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the main role. The film is well directed and the power to the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not her son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the film and he simply accepts everything instead of changing things. The film does not show the strong impact of God the Father.
