This movie fails on many levels. The script is the first to fail, and as I understand it, if the script sucks, there is nothing that can fix it. The plot is boring, after the first 45 minutes, I'm looking at the counter on the DVD and I say to myself: "how much more?" The cinematography is pretty horrible. I'm not sure how bad the transfer to DVD was, but it looked like a VHS copy. Also, the sound was bad. I realize that this will not be remixed for 5.1, but yes, it did not even sound like it was in Dolby Stereo, which had been around for almost a decade when they cut this movie. <br /> <br /> Slipstream was too similar to Mad Max and Blade Runner for your comfort. Due to the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialogue, it is extremely disappointing. If I remember, the pointer scene took place during the last 20 minutes, it should usually take place in the top 20. Most people will be totally confused as to what the hell is happening until the last 20 minutes. <br /> <The music of the film was excellent in parts, and then completely inappropriate in others. Elmer Bernstien made the score, but it seems that someone else participated in "other" things in other places, since it does not match the good overall orchestral score (with some synthesizer music). <br /> <br /> There were chosen great actors, Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley, Bill Paxton. And they did a great job infusing the little life available in their characters. (Well, Paxton's character was pretty stupid, and the whole movie was centered on him, I'm not sure that a heroic puppet is a good choice for the main character in the film). Again, a major flaw in the script. br /> <br /> Thank God I saw this from a mail-order DVD service, and not from the movies. In general, it was a big disappointment for the fans of science fiction, or the fans of Paxton or Hamill. 90 minutes of your life, you will never come back.
