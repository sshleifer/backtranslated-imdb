When I first heard about this movie, I went out anxiously to rent it, believing (wrongly) that it was one of those very bad and funny movies and that something was waiting for me. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the pace is agonizing, it is very slow. The rhythm does not even begin to rise until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie! The plot was boring, and the ending did not make sense and it was confusing. For those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills, look elsewhere. This movie offers the possibility of making spikes, but lacks "emotions", cheap or not. <br /> <br /> Instead, try "Child's Play."
