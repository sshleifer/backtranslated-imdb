Significant spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is a sick and disturbing movie ... like the sick and twisted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch, who also wrote it. I do not even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It's not the actors' fault. The cast certainly portrayed their roles well. It's the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written, which was the point of reference for a truly sick mind. <br /> <br /> I know I will never see another movie that has been written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She is a perverse sick, crooked, mouth choppy and ill thought. She looks, speaks and sounds like a biker girl with her brain fried by drugs, who spent 20 years making the time difficult. You can clearly see what kind of person you are when you see it in the special features section of the DVD "Surveillance: those who are watching". You can see it and hear it for yourself. She was as bad as she had imagined when writing this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised by the bad language, although this director certainly talks like a sailor. This goes far beyond the simple bad language; Worse than any movie p0rn. The implicit level of sado violence and perversion that it incorporates in each character that he writes is of the genre that is even illegal for the standards of p0rn. This perverse and disturbing thought is clearly evident in his own personality and in the things he says. Another critic found the description he was looking for. This is a snuff film. <br /> <br /> Be sure to listen to your narration about the deleted scenes and the alternate ending. This director / writer is truly a sick person. I can not believe someone put her in charge of a movie, let alone pay for it. You can be sure that I will never see another film in which you are affiliated. In the thousands of movies I've seen and collected, only a couple of directors and writers have deserved this type of boycott. She is offensive beyond anyone she has seen in connection with filming a movie before. There have been some bad directors and writers, but none could compare with their sick and twisted mind. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, it was one murder after another. Once he got over the murder at the hotel ... then the sick policemen shot and abused the drivers for the kicks ... the family on vacation with the bad parents (who had nothing to do with the presence of children). .. followed by drug addicts ... the movie then proceeded to the (even more) serial killers devious and twisted. <br /> <br /> When I saw the serial killers reveal themselves, I began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this. movie. Those were my real thoughts while watching this movie. I had the intention of discovering which writer had such a sick mind ... because that writer needs seriously committed to a long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise, it turned out to be the director. When I saw and heard what I had to say on the DVD, I realized that my evaluation of the writer was accurate. On the DVD, she was in fact the sick and twisted person she had imagined writing such a disturbing movie. <br /> <br /> While the girl, (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins, really stole the show ... I can not 't think her real-life parents would have tolerated this sick and dirty-mouth director be near your daughter. <br /> <br /> This film is disturbing, sickly, offensive, twisted and the director-writer needs some serious treatment in a mental installation. <br /> <br /> As far as the end of the film is concerned ... the alternative ending, should have been the result of this ordeal. There was no point or benefit for the film or the story or the flow of the film for the death of the other character. I'm surprised that any studio has distributed the movie. The trailer was completely deceiving. The only reason why the film attracted the audience was because of the ingenious creation of words and the creative representation of the trailer. That trailer is not representative of the movie you'll see. <br /> <br /> Apart from the child ... all the characters in this film were sick, murderous, twisted, perverse, violent sex fans and their characters are reflected. The mind of the writer-director who created them. But if you look carefully, even the parents of the family on vacation; the sick policemen who take pot shots the serial killers posing in alternative roles; policemen at the station; and even the dispatcher at the station ... each of these character roles incorporated a sexual pervert, twisted and violent. I'm not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the film and the Canadian city in the Special Features section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> This writer-director has a very personal staff. mental deviation that no matter what you write, each character role contains those same carbon copy seals. The only character that did not have these deviant tendencies was the child. Watch closely and you will see this in each character. Then listen to the director-writer talk in the Special Features section of the DVD and you will understand what I am saying about your mental state and your psychological problems. She would not be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a family of Hollywood moviemakers. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Jennifer Chambers Lynch does not have much filmography ... less than a handful of things. Since she copies the disturbing characteristics of all the roles of her character, I do not think we have to see many films written or directed by her unless her father, director David Lynch helps her. I recommend getting away from any movie I'm involved in ... and I'm not sure that his father's films are better. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.
