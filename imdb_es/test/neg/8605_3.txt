I saw this movie with a kind of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog caught in the headlights. There's no doubt that (even if you enjoyed it) it's a bad movie, but the important question is why? It has a good deal; he is animated he is prepared to face the sex, with some of the personages who in fact obtain something here and there, which is unusual for a British comedy. He also has Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, the Marmite artists agreed, but they have had their moments in the past. <br /> <br /> What he lacks mainly is the charm. The characters are incredibly stupid, amazing and alienating, so instead of a Men Behaving Badly movie, the producers have done Game On. Any mediocre writer who wants to make a film about the sexual attitudes of sexist and asleep British men would have gotten some copies of Loaded, Zoo or even Viz to read Sid, the sexist, and the thing would have written itself. Instead, the producers clearly tried to make some silly characters difficult to care for. Character comedy, unlike slapstick, etc., only works if the public can recognize some human truth about the situation. But watching this movie is like telling you an annoying joke that you know will not end up being funny, but you can not stop it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie is also badly made. The structure of the plot is weak, there is little delineation or development of the characters, and many of the scenes are not fun. Again and again, the same lame Reggae is divided to divide the scenes, uselessly and bluntly. There is a lot of unnecessary repetition: when you have made a joke about parking outside a sex party, you do not need to do it again. One wonders what the UK Film Board saw in the script. <br /> <br /> This is a world where most men are rakes, and most women are continually willing to do so. The Apartment and Alfie satirized almost the same vision of the world, but the producers of this film accept it without criticism. So they ended up with a kind of inferior update of Confessions of a Window Cleaner. Does any British need to have another chance in this kind of thing, and do it correctly? a good next project for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, I think ...
