This is a web of stereotypes. A young fighter tries to participate in a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his combat school. This leads to separation from the fighting school and, naturally, finds a strange new teacher to teach him to fight. <br /> <br /> The fights are not high level. They are too "simple" in a way that 1 + 1 is simple for each adult. The fighter has trained and enters the ring, but he does not do what he trained and they kick him in the ass. The coach yells to do this and do it without success. And after a little more of this ridiculous beating, he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once. This results in a turning point in the fight, although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up to that point. Think of the Rocky movies and you will have a good point of reference for the amount of hits you really take. The fights are also badly done. <br /> <br /> The last thing that ruins this movie is the stupid romance. The cheesy music and the uncomfortable moments are not what I call entertainment. <br /> <br /> These guys really could have done quality entertainment, but the director was not up to the task. Or the other crew in my opinion. Maybe they had a small budget, I do not know, but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10.
