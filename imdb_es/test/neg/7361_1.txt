What begins as a passable film degenerates into one of the most incoherent, stupid and incompetent, stupid terror attempts of recent years. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible. It is such a derivative mess that destroys every decent fear movement you can imagine without successfully producing a single scare. Either copy the recent trend with spooky children or ghosts walking the camera or the horror of the old school of Fulci's Gates of Hell. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that there is not even a cat jumping out of a closet to make your jump. Be avoided
