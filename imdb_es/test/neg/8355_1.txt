This movie is as bad as "The Birdman of Alcatraz." I do not mean the performance, but the premise of both films, which try to represent the psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. In addition, I worry that respected and revered actors such as Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play those roles, because their status tends to lend credibility to the director's intention to raise the theme of the film, an outcast of society. <br /> <br /> I was in high school during the last years of Caryl Chessman's life and his appeal to the death penalty and the books were very much in the news. I remember the wave of opinions that the death penalty was wrong and Chessman was the victim. <br /> <br /> Grab people. Read the story Chess was a criminal and sexual predator. He drove through the streets of Los Angeles at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle. He stopped the cars with attractive women inside with the excuse of making an arrest for trafficking; Then they abducted and raped the women. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to their horror and humiliation. <br /> <br /> Chessman got exactly what he deserved, it only took a decade too long. There is no sympathy for the devil here.
