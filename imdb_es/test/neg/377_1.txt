Truly flat writing, and I felt very disappointed with Marc Singer for agreeing to be in it. <br /> <br /> Actually, I left the theater in about 15-20 minutes and claimed my money back. In fact, I only got out of a movie 3 times in my life (I'm 43 years old) and this is the only one that angered me enough to claim the price of my ticket. If I could, I would have also got a refund for the popcorn. This was a really bad movie, and there's no excuse. <br /> <br /> First, how does someone who was raised as a barbarian of advanced technology learn to drive a car? In California!!!? (Driving a car is a somewhat complicated skill, and in California, even more deceptive ... I should know, I live there).
