After losing 2 hours of my life watching this movie on nightly television, I went back and reread some of the IMDb material, to remind me why I saw it in the first place. In retrospect, the only thing I can think about is that gender usually attracts me. But this movie was a total waste of effort. It fails on all levels, and seeing what is described in IMDb as a comedy really leaves me senseless. I do not remember more than a couple of giggles. There is more laughter in any episode of Law and Order than in The Last Man. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Too much interaction of the characters just did not seem to have any foundation, and therefore was very unlikely / unbelievable. <br /> <br /> If it had not been like that. I've been for almost free bikini photos, well, what can I say? Avoid this movie like the plague. Or stick it and move quickly towards the bikini photos. However, do not spend even $ 1 to rent it.
