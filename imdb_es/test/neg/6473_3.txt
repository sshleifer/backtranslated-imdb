But I still enjoyed watching her, so I gave her a 3 instead of a 1. Her expressions are priceless. Some of the other cast members (for example, Michael McKean) are also really poor. The cat itself is fun. Apart from that, the film is a clich√©, culminating in a long car chase. (It is also at this point that the film becomes unnecessarily crude, having been very "familiar" until then).
