I always wanted to see the movie because I loved the novel, but I was warned because I had heard that the movie sucked. It's. Fowles wrote the script and I could follow it well, despite the fact that I read the novel more than thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is execrable: discordant, tinkling and absolutely inappropriate, breaking any attempt. in the mystery or the mood in the movie. I suspect that the director must take a large part of the blame, since even Michael Caine is terrible and was already doing an excellent job at ALFIE a couple of years before. <br /> <br /> The "Mysteries" evoked by the The book is not well translated to the screen. I would love to see someone redo this.
