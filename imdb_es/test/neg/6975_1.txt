And in general, you will have to investigate this little gem. When I describe I Changed My Sex, or Glen Or Glenda as it is best known, I must echo the thoughts of Andrew Smith, who hit the nail on the head when he wrote "If you have not seen any of the other Ed Wood movies ., this is a completely disconcerting experience.If you've seen any of Ed Wood's films, this is still completely disconcerting. " The film is both hilarious and tragic, but moves with a strange rhythm of its own that leaves no doubt that its author knows and means every word he says while running. Wood, bless him, had some of the highest ambitions as a director, with the desire to promote peace, understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s of all times. When Tim Burton recreated an image of Glen Or Glenda by studio executives for his biopic, he showed the executives laughing and telling themselves that this had to be an imitation. More than fifty years later, there are still people struggling to be given the kind of respect that "normal" takes for granted, so I say it certainly is not. <br /> <br /> No, the real comedy in Glen Or Glenda is the sheer ineptitude that Wood shows in composing his message. Directors frequently use archival images when they can find some that fit their purpose, and can be edited to fit their own images. Ed Wood used the archival material indiscriminately, and Tim Burton's biopic celebrated the event with a scene in which Wood, played by Johnny Depp, is betting that he could make a full movie out of the footage. Unfortunately, the real Ed Wood died before he had a chance, but Glen Or Glenda is as close as he has been. The IMDb claims that twenty percent of this sixty-minute film is archival footage, and it's never hard to guess what footage. Images of busy motorways, airplanes flying overhead, ill effects of lightning, soldiers doing their thing, all are used casually, sometimes repeatedly, and often only have a loose connection to the story that Wood is trying to count If Wood could have sat and thought about what he is trying to do for a while, it is not known what kind of heights he could have achieved. <br /> <br /> Wood appears in the film as the titular character, a confused transvestite who imagines himself as a woman named Glenda. Apart from the audacious way in which he tries to make his point, Wood makes a horrible woman. Having found myself on the sidelines of a society that thinks I am "disabled" and that I need to "heal" myself, I honestly found myself waiting for the best result for the character of Wood. However, to make his observation, Wood weaves short stories of two other transvestites. One of them takes the extreme step of enduring a change of sex to become a woman, the other is so marginalized that he fears being arrested again so much that he commits suicide. What is scary about this movie is that if you eliminated transvestism and replaced evictions like my position on the autism spectrum or things like schizophrenia, very little of the film would have to be changed. This is how society has learned very little since Ed Wood was a child. <br /> <br /> The other important personality of Glen Or Glenda is Bela Lugosi, whom Wood did not want to include in the film. The speculation varies according to Wood's motives, but the accepted theory is that Wood wanted to help revive Lugosi's career and would do anything to achieve it. With the exception of taking your time to carefully build a good movie, that is. In Glen Or Glenda, Wood makes use of Lugosi who was best described in Flying Saucers Over Hollywood as "bizarre". Lugosi plays a character announced as The Scientist, but he appears more like an omnipotent puppet master. People who have not seen Ed Wood's films before the biopic will think Tim Burton invented the "Beware the big green dragon sitting on the door" speech. In any case, he was restraining Burton on what strange speech to use to represent Woodian's dialogue. Nothing can prepare you to see the speeches in their original context, not even Criswell's amused laugh during Plan 9 From outer space. <br /> <br /> The observer types will also notice the presence of Delores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend at that time. Once again, Burton dramatizes his reaction to seeing the script for the first time, while the film portrays it as accepting and thinking about the future. I can not help feeling that Burton's performance is more accurate, since Fuller is extremely uncomfortable in his role. She only appears for about fifteen minutes, but her delivery seems so mechanical, so lifeless, that somehow she manages to look less talented than her co-stars, if such a thing is possible. It is difficult to determine if Wood's orientation was better focused in this case than normal, but if the ability of the support to leave the stars (with the obvious exception of Bela) in the dust is a guide, then it should not be surprising that Fuller alone appear on a very small piece of paper within another Wood movie. The fact that she has written several successful songs tells her that she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. Although Wood would appear again before the camera, it was never more than a cameo, a walk-on or a small part. <br /> <br /> I gave Glen Or Glenda one in ten. In general, I only give this rating to films that are so bad that they become entertainment as a result. Daring and well-intentioned, Glen Or Glenda adjusts that description to a T.
