It's great to hear the 3 or more comments, which indicate what 'Wives of soccer players' means for women. Only the title eliminates any supposed equality that women have in the media industry or in society, reducing them to two-dimensional cartoons of how men think women should behave. It's a post modern moronic farce. It could also be called 'Wifey footballers who stay at home and know their place'. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it could be a kind of parody in the representation of the garbage press in the United Kingdom. Of the celebrities and the role they have in maintaining a patriarchal society. So women can undermine stereotypes by acting like those stereotypes and possess the image that has been created by the desire of men. No, that would be ironic and intelligent. I also sound like I should praise him. <br /> <br /> Zoe Lucker is simply too camper and exaggerated to be taken seriously. Like an even cheaper Cruella De Ville. He just needs some manic laughter, condescending and, at the same time, self-evaluating to show his true range of action. Oh she does? Right. Anyway, it almost comes down to who is targeted. Be it an 'intelligent' journalist, who thinks that it is a rising shipment of vaudevillian proportions, or people who think it is 'real'. "The best actors"? OMG!! Stop seeing this birth of a pantomime and get a life. <br /> <br /> It is completely sexist and of such low quality, that perhaps those who enjoy it think that they "agree" on the "joke". Do the actors really care or understand what they are communicating? It is so degrading for women and men. Not all are self-centered, selfish and football-loving idiots who think that women are just another trophy that will be shown to the public. It is so humiliating. I am sure that Mrs. Lucker would easily face them in her "real" life, and twist them around her finger as it is so easily done in 'Footballers' Wives'. <br /> <br /> But, of course, it's not like that. really matters. I mean it's just a television and television show after all. So please let it stay trimmed. It is terrible and will only be remembered with the same incredulity with which he was so fondly reminded of the 'Blocking of Prisoner Cells H'. <br /> <br /> How did it come to be? Surely it is not subtle or complex. It could only come from the same mentality that the FHM magazine read, and believes that it is "fine" to look soft-porn, and "make" so many women who bow to their "will" and sing patriotic and racist comments every time "their "Football team losses / victories. It is totally coarse.
