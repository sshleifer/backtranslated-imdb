An original science fiction network. It is not the best. Not far from being the worst. An electrician (Richard Grieco) stumbles upon a "key" that can open a gateway to a parallel Earth that has been taken by mutant spiders. The mutations have been controlled by a large alien queen for the past thirty years. She has already eaten the population of this parallel world that resembles the lesser inhabitants of Chicago. Guess what? Now she must find another world to feed herself. The electrician leads a team of four men who, reluctantly, is faced with the task of saving the world. The final confrontation is probably the best part of the whole movie. The cast also features: Richard Yearwood, Colin Fox, Kate Greenhouse, Jason Jones and David Newman. One would have thought that the Science Fiction Network could have spent more money on special effects.
