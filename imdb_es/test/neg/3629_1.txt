Zeoy101 ?? Actually, this has to be one of the most stupid attempts to get the attention of people in my age group. It's about a preppy girl named Zeoy and her friends who attend a boarding school. BORING!!! All she does is whine and complain and act like a spoiled idiot. I remember that this program came out in 2005, I was 13 and 14 years old, and even then I thought it did not make sense. The only episode that I liked was when the boys hid a camera in the girls' bedroom. THAT'S. Anyway, I do not understand why Nickel-Oh my bad-Nick feels the need to syndicate this sorry poor excuse for "entertainment". Seriously this decade is becoming a joke every year and it gets worse and worse. What's up with this generation? <br /> <br /> Anyway, R.I.P. Nickelodeon 1979-1998? / 2005?
