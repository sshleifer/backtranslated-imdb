This is a parody. That means there are no characters as such, all are simple stereotypes, and the movie is based entirely on the quality of the jokes. <br /> <br /> Well, there are some good jokes in this movie. Unfortunately, they are hidden in a mass of real fools. If one expects all dialogues to be absurd, the fun disappears. <br /> <br /> You see, there's American Pie 2, my favorite teen movie of all time. It contains many real original characters. Maybe the jokes have no flavor, but all people have some kind of life. For example, they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens. That's what makes jokes really fun! <br /> <br /> It is not like that in this movie: each scene is clearly organized as a pure parody, so there is no character, so there really is no room for any sympathy. . Also, if you know the original movies, you know full scenes in advance. Add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all, and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved me from being completely bored when, in fact, the comments of some teenagers in the movies where I was. Watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and my personal highlight of the movie was the brief appearance of Melissa Joan Hart in a scene. Sigh. She is too good, can not be real. Hmm, is it worth a whole movie?
