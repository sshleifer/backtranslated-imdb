It is painfully clear that all the efforts in this film were directed towards cinematography and very little attention to everything else. The most obvious error is the error of the entire female cast. Many of them are very experienced and capable, but all seemed out of place, and having an amateur director certainly did not help. The story is a very common story of geishas, ​​and the characters behaved very inconsistently, so I find it extremely difficult to connect with the heroine. <br /> <br /> The theme of this film is "modern prostitution", but even so, it was annoying how the main character of Tsuchiya Anna continued to speak as a member of a biker gang, while everyone else spoke in ancient Japanese for this setting. This film has very beautiful vibrant colors, similar to the "Hero" of Zhang Yimou, but viewers can easily tell that it was filmed in a cheap and elaborate set. The two sequences with the insertions of Shiina Ringo were really nice. , in the middle section of the movie. I really really did not like his music before, but they fit perfectly into this movie. Although Ninagawa Mika is a complete failure as a film director, she has great potential in the production of PV (music video). <br /> <br /> I think the story felt very clear because the director did not focus on the development of the character, and because Tsuchiya Anna is not convincing acting like an Oiran. If this film had been directed by a well-known director of Jidaigeki with some other actress known in Japan, it would have had the potential to become a masterpiece.
