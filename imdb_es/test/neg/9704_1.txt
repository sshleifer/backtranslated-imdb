Maybe if you've never read literature in English or have only seen the Hollywood version of any book that can find merit in this horrible movie. He has the directorial and scripting skills of Shoreditch. The adaptation of the BBC of 1995 is very nice and close to the book and captures very well the atmosphere between Elisabeth and Darcy. <br /> <br /> The characters in this production are very bad, Sutherland as Bennet seems a total buffoon. Bingley also acts like the fool and it is incomprehensible that he is my friend Darcy. I can not imagine how Judi Dench could have accepted the role, maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version. <br /> <br /> The quotes from the book are taken out of context. Missing huge pieces, the important episode with Wickham is overlooked. <br /> <br /> However, Mr. Collins is very good, and rises above the other cast members. <br /> <br /> The only good What happens is that we do not pay to see it. Wait for the DVD and use it to prevent the table from wobbling.
