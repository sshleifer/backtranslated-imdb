I respect Mike Hodges, and I really liked Get Carter because of his somber point of view, but The Croupier seems like a particularly boring ITV drama. <br /> <br /> Cold and reserved acting is not only the preservation of the main character. , it extends to the whole cast, which means that there is nothing to contrast the character of Owen. <br /> <br /> None of the characters evokes any kind of feeling, except boredom. The end of the movie is also a little messy at best. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera, etc. It's pretty good, but if you want to see the best Hodges watch. Get Carter, do not bother with this uninteresting and unimaginative drag Emotions that he covered better than 20 years ago.
