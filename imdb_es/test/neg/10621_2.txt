Well, the name in the summary should tell you everything. FRED OLEN RAY: the modern king of low-budget films, either for television or directly to video (I doubt that it already produces for the silver screen - with the death of the double features of the B movie of drive-in and all). <Br /> <br /> Creator of such cult classics (?), Such as Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers and Dinosaur Island .... <br /> <br /> Well, I like these guys things. It is mainly entertaining (in a clearly corny, cheesy and especially cheap way) and if it is one thing, it is a professional, something that can not be said of all the guys in the movie business. <br /> <br /> But this movie here is among the weakest of its time. Tasteless action, an uninspired script and flirty jokes conspire to make your brain go numb in a matter of minutes. If you are out of truth F.O.R. goodness (or rather badness), look for those mentioned above, and generally his things of the 70s and 80s (I think lately he lost a bit of his advantage).
