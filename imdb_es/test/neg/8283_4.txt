An interesting slasher movie with multiple suspects. <br /> <br /> Includes the typical girl who shows off her breasts (Denise Cheshire) while putting on her swimsuit, suspicious creepy: any of them might be doing the action, the chest is expected to expose get a passing grade (Linnea Quigley), a very unusual advance pass, more bare breasts, a track and field event that will NOT be held at the Summer Olympics and a macabre secret. <br /> <br /> It's all about a crashing ending. There's no more. Will not this guy die? I bet Anne (Patch Mackenzie) does not plan any more home visits soon. <br /> <br /> If you like teen movies, can you be a pervert, even if all the actresses are over 18?
