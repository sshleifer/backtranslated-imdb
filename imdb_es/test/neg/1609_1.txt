I will begin by confessing that I tend to really enjoy action movies (military or other). I am a boy. But this dreck was horrible. I saw it for free, at the time of the show or hbo and I still feel like I paid too much. It was a prolonged episode of general hospital. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 1, just because 0 or 0.1 was not possible. How or why other 59 would give a rating between 5 and 6? Unless they are all family members of the cast or crew. <br /> <br /> It could be, this movie was so bad that many were rescued ....... and as such, they did not invest too much to bother. <br /> <br /> Sorry for repeating, but the minimum of 10 lines seems silly, because what essentially comes down to a warning ......... in the hope of saving others the black hole of 2 hours, this movie represents. Trust me, look at a blank wall, they will be more action.
