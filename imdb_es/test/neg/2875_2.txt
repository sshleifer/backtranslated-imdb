I really like Salman Kahn, so I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. It did not have much plot and what they had was not so attractive. However, Salman looked good in the movie, he looked young and renewed, but it was worth the price of this DVD. The music was not bad, it was quite beautiful. In general, Indian films last at least two to three hours, but this was a very short film for an Indian movie. The American actress who played in the film is from the hit TV series Heroes, Ali Larter. His performance had a lot to desire. However, he looked good with the Indian dresses he wore. The whole movie did not have much to wish for and I hope that Salman will do much better in his next movie. Thank you.
