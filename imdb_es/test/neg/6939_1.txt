For some unknown reason, 7 years ago, I saw this movie with my mother and my sister. I do not think I've laughed so much with them before. This movie was very bad. How the sequels were produced is beyond me. It's been a while since I last saw this "movie", but the only impression that stuck with me over the years has been: "They must have found the script in a dumpster in a movie studio cheap, turned into a "movie", and I decided it was not bad enough, and it got worse, I'm pretty sure they spent the entire budget on the camera work and the so-called "special effects", and then I stayed 13 cents for the Screenplay And to pay the "actors".
