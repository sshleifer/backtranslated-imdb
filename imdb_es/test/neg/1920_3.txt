Rich against poor. Great city vs. little city. White neck vs. blue collar These things are not original themes in the movies. So, when one chooses to involve these issues, the situational plot should be very original or very good. This was none. I never believed in the romance of the two young lovers in this movie. Neither convincing nor convincing, he simply fell to the ground. Do not bother, even with a video rental.
