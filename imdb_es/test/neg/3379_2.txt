This episode had potential. The basic premise of a woman living next to an empty apartment (but a phone that constantly rings) is interesting. And when she explores the noise, there is genuine tension and fear. But the writing of stupid scripts ruins any promise the episode has had. <br /> <br /> First of all, the woman easily admits to seeing things that would send us the majority to run in the other direction (for example, "It's funny that the door closed Shut up even if there's no wind." This door has serious damage that was not here a minute ago; "" The door opened alone, without me touching it; "etc.). Considering these supernatural phenomena, besides the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, would not she take some precaution before entering? Maybe she could investigate in the day. Or maybe I could investigate the apartment with someone else. Or maybe she could turn ON THE LIGHTS! Also, while she is in the haunted apartment, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and has a discussion about who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then they start talking about the details of the suicide. TURN OFF THE PHONE! The telephone company does not need to be involved. Walk to the phone and unplug it. Case closed. <br /> <br /> Finally, showing that the phone runs around the floor as if it were alive was simply funny. If the director wanted the phone card to strangle her, he could have done it in a way that did not seem like a caricature. Brave Little Toaster to someone?
