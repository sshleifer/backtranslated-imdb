I liked all the films of Lilo and Stitch. The television series was not so good, but I put aside my opinions about the series when I saw this movie. And I must say ... it was bad. <br /> <br /> One thing I found disappointing was the animation. Yes, you heard it. The animation. I found its quality very degraded since the first movie. Its quality was as high as that of the television series, something I did not expect at all. If you're looking for candy for the eyes, do not expect much here. In addition, the animation could not portray any serious mood. Even in the supposed sad scenes, I did not feel anything for the character, another low of the first movie. <br /> <br /> The following was the absolutely horrible performance of the voice. I found it very, very unconvincing, and I wondered why, Disney, with all its wealth and glory, could not afford voice actors with real talent. The ability of the voice actors was as annoying as that of the series. I tolerated the one in the series because, who would not get tired when he was made to act by voice in so many episodes? Heck, I do not even know how many episodes there are (theoretically, there are 624, but I can not believe it). However, I thought that the performance of the voice would improve in the movie, and the truth reprimanded me, that what they could do in the series was the best. <br /> <br /> Next, there was The horrible script. It was corny beyond redemption, and writers simply try too hard. They try to put some jokes, but I found them annoying. Maybe it was not the voice acting, but the cheesy dialogues that ruined the sound section. (On the positive side, the soundtrack was not that bad and matched quite well with the mood). <br /> <br /> Fourth, there was the problem with the story. I predicted everything, and the plot was what made the characters so unoriginal and unpleasant all of a sudden. You have foreigners get new positions and responsibilities in outer space. After the initial hype, they realize that they really did not like it and miss their old life. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the evil villain comes out of prison after a very action-packed action scene and enters the Jumbaa lab to steal his experiment. The experiment was then cloned into another 100 and the hamster wants to conquer Earth. When the main characters find out, they try to stop the evil hamster, but they face a final confrontation against the experiment and have it in an extremely weak excuse to try to make the series look good. The characters then renounce their new privileges and return to Earth to resume their lives. Seriously, how many other movies have already used that ending? That story was extremely short and formulated, so do not expect too much from it. <br /> <br /> So Disney has failed in sound, graphics and history. The only charm of the series were the original characters, and how they managed to retain the "feeling" of the characters, but even that was not able to save the film. I tried to like it, I really did, but I give it a rating of 4/10. Another disney failure.
