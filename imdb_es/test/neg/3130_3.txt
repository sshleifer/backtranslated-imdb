Dakota Incident has to be one of the weirdest westerns I've ever seen. It's not good, but definitely weird. <br /> <br /> A driverless diligence goes into the city of Christian Flats with all the passengers dead. It is scheduled to continue, but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the Cheyenne on the road to war. But Linda Darnell, Regis Toomey, John Lund, Whit Bissell and Ward Bond have their reasons to continue. And Dale Robertson, who killed John Doucette in a shootout after Doucette and Skip Homeier shot him and left him in the desert, is so eager to leave that he is willing to lead the team. <br /> <br /> Of course, Cheyenne's attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced to dry wash to cover themselves. Who will live and who will die is the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Dakota Incident arrived at the end of Republic Pictures before Herbert J. Yates disconnected from his small studio. Westerns were his specialty, but they were usually the type Roy Rogers did. This would not have been a product of Rogers. <br /> <br /> In fact it is beyond belief. The characters are not based on any kind of reality. Whit Bissell is recovering ore samples from his claim, but Robertson discovers that it is iron pyrite, fool's gold. Toomey is a cynic who plays the guitar and becomes crazy with thirst. Darnell is behind a trap manager of her, but he really does not know what to do when he finds it. Lund is looking to bring Robertson, who committed a crime for which he took rap, but has to bring him alive. For that he would need help, but he has none. <br /> <br /> But the worst is Ward Bond, who is a United States senator on his own peace mission to Cheyennes. In real life, Bond was a most right-wing individual and I'm not sure this was not a caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal. He really is a silly fool, but I think that might have attracted him to the role. <br /> <br /> I tried to get into the Dakota incident, but I could not. And the ending was a strange fantasy to say the least. <br /> <br /> Give the cast involved three stars.
