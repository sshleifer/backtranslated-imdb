This program demonstrates the depths to which the drama prior to the UK basin has been sunk. With these boring scripts, mediocre performances, deficient plots, horrible dialogues, one is forced to watch a DVD of any old ER episode to watch an excellent hospital drama. <br /> <br /> None of the actors employed in this program seems to be able to act! <br /> <br /> If you want a low-quality but easy-to-absorb soap opera-style television, this is the program for you. Personally I like something with more meat on the bone. Unfortunately, as with all other UK license payers, I am funding this scum.
