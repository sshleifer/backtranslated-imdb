This movie belongs to the cutting room. On the one hand, the opening sequence does not present the element related to the "gang" theme. If it was not supposed to be like that, at least they had that correct part. Secondly ... What about the whole look on the left and then on the right? They even do it in synchronous style. Nowhere have I seen a member of a rival team walk to a bar, look for someone, from the outside it looks like it's all that and a bag of chips on a barbie and get away without even being confronted and much less getting "for what" '. I lost money on the rental price and I'm glad I did not buy the DVD itself. <br /> <br /> If this was done by university students (T.A.F.E), at least they tried it in the old Aussie. Better luck next time.
