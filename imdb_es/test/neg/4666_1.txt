I do not remember when I saw a worse movie. The performance was overloaded, the dialogue trite to the point of being painful to listen to, the second-class special effects and the general story of laughter. <br /> <br /> I've never wanted to leave one more movie, and if I had been alone, that's what I would have done, in about 30 minutes, and I saved almost ANOTHER TWO EXPRESSING HOURS of dialogues that cause nausea and a plot with more holes than a Swiss cheese "the size of Texas." I just can not help but emphasize what a miserable experience was going through this colossal garbage celluloid perfectly good. <br /> <br />
