Okay, there's no way to sweeten this. The plot was ridiculous, the premise was ridiculous, the acting was inconceivable, the effects were ridiculous and all the outdoor scenes seem to have been filmed in Central Park in New York. Having said that, there was something about this movie that I could not get away from. Maybe it was the atmosphere, or maybe it was the evil super vixen or the amazons. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I am not one to sit on the sidelines and criticize without pointing out some redeeming qualities, so here they are. <br /> <br /> A violent launch of the women's liberation movement takes place in a natural environment (central park, of course), and all young masochists there will be very impressed. In addition, some of the scenes in which certain characters lose consciousness are dramatically funny (you'll see that I write dramatic, rather than convincing). <br /> <br /> All I can say is that some people like B films and I am one of them. If you are one of them too, then try it. Greetings, Mr. Kincaid. This is one for the ages.
