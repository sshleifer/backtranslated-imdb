Forage MST3K. It's so bad that it's really worth seeing for that reason alone. There are some funny things about it, like the mysterious device in which the bad man is seen working throughout the film, which turns out to be this little helicopter that flutters charging and firing a machine gun without even a wobble, is knocked down by a bag of balloons (of the kind they throw at political conventions). Many other wonderful touches of that type. Stars Charlie Sheen. There is a scene in which he spends five minutes recording a conversation, only to drop the micro cassette into the Potomac River by accident. If they had thrown Emilio Estevez in the part that never happened.
