After having seen this show a few times; As a woman, I am completely offended that there are so many stupidities, women out there who fall into the trap of this shit. I'm a bit more mature than some of the "players" in this program, but I'm still horrified that the whole dating game has been reduced to a contest: where foolish guys can score points in their attempts to pick up chicks. If young people see it and use it as a learning manual: Do not do it! Save yourself the effort and hire a prostitute if all you're looking for is a piece of ass. Maybe there are girls out there with the same mentality, but somehow I do not think so.
