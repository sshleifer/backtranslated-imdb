This movie does not make me very funny, and I imagine it would be quite offensive to the Jews. (and I'm not Jewish) Why? First, the whole movie shows the protagonist Zucker as a liar / cheat who runs shady businesses and businesses, while his son is gay, his daughter is a lesbian and his niece is a whore. Then there is the incestuous relationship that occurs in the family, first his daughter with Joshua and Jana, and then his son with his niece. Two incestuous relationships running in family. I'm surprised they did not add the plot of having a mental disability in the family ... Now, that would really complete the subhuman Nazi ideal! (Gay, lesbian, Jewish ...) <br /> <br /> Totally disgusting movie. I am surprised that this film does not receive a response from any Jewish community.
