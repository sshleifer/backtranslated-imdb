The movie is nice. Well photographed, but without originality ... <br /> <br /> this film is copied directly from "The Hitch", where Salman plays as a Dr. Date as Will Smith, and Govinda as a asshole, who is desperate for fall in love with his boss at the end, the film comes to an old Indian style of Flimi, the father of the bride does not like the lover of the bride and gets another boyfriend, and Govinda, the lover of the bride, comes to the end and saves . her new boyfriend and an elegant dance and those things. <br /> <br /> The comedy was very good, no doubt, when the hitch meets Hindi, it would be more fun ... <br /> <br /> Ultimately worth watching it but when it comes out the television after a few months ...
