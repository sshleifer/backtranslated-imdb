I gave this film a chance just because I had very good reviews. After watching the trailer, I thought: a movie without grace full of clich√©s. But I decided to give it a try because the trailers often do not represent the film very well. What a waste of time ... The movie is worse than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it, I could not remember a single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were the parodies of CSI, but that is also quite past. I could not relate to any of the characters or expect them to be together, because I found them completely stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. Unintelligent comedy for people who are still in high school or feel that way mentally.
