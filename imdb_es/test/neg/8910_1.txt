Really? Is this necessary? How can someone make a movie like that? Disgusting!!! Seteven Seagal with funny hair and fat as an elephant. Tricks all the time, car chases with an annoying soundtrack. Without mentioning the end. Completely absurd with the presence of the girl. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood !!! Well, at first a fortune teller answers something, nobody has asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. They must be kidding. Steven Segal faints after the pursuit of a car, and I know he can not act. It was terrible. Nothing can save that movie. <br /> <br /> I lost 90 minutes of my life! See you
