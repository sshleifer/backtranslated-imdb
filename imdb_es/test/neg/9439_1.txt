This movie was absolutely horrible. Stupid premise, and horrible performance of all. Whoever wrote this garbage should be hanged. It reminds me of a student hack movie, BUT WORST. Whoever produced this should surrender now. I know that opinions are subjective and all, and some may think that this is "fantastic", as some think that "Dune (1984)" was fantastic, get off the horse and watch some real movies. OK, the performance was tolerable, and with a better direction it could have been much better, but he did not do it so he suffers. I do not know how much more I can say about this waste of film, apart from destroying it completely. Anyway it was horrible and I recommend avoiding it like the plague, if you go near "dreamland", rent the movie next door.
