Roeg's opinion of Conrad's "The Heart of Darkness" was not exactly what he expected. Although it is based on one of the most studied and interesting texts in history, the film became boring. History never captures the viewer. In a way, he is indifferent. <br /> <br /> The traces of the text can be easily seen, but even so it is not really Conrad's "Heart of Darkness". The script by Benedict Fitzgerald (who also wrote "The Passion of the Christ") only uses Conrad as inspiration, and therefore becomes Fitzgerald's "Heart of Darkness". The movie is simply not worth it, unless you are particularly interested in Conrad or perhaps John Malkovich.
