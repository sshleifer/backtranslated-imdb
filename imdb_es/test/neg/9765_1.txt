What a total disappointment. Forget about this abysmal movie and get the TV series. What the hell were they doing to make the US president relatively healthy? ALL politicians should have been clumsy buffoons (Peter Cook is as good as the British prime minister). It lacks the biting satire of the original, and instead goes for the slapstick of the "lowest common denominator." 1 out of 10 if I'm being generous! Unfortunately, this is another example of a remake that does not take into account the original point, the difference with this is that both were written by the same people.
