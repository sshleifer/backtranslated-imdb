Another B movie for teenagers, based mainly on CGI effects, industrial soundtrack and some medieval images. It's a shame that the Beowulf legend is used so uninspired. I'm a fan of Christopher Lambert, but I must admit that he's getting worse as an actor and also in his films. Rent it if you are a teenager only.
