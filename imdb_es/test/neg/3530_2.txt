Okay, let's see ... a handsome handsome young man is new to the city and walks down the local boardwalk. Meet a pretty girl, meet the nasty leader of the local club of young vampires, dare to follow them to this cave, get into a conflict for the pretty girl, an epic struggle takes place ...> <br /> No, they are not Lost Boys, although it would be hard to tell the difference, since I believe that even some of the carnival music is the same. (Do you have to pay royalties for trying a movie?) Even the end of this stinkbomb is stolen from Lost Boys. The makeup is below average, even for a low budget thriller, the characters are one-dimensional, and exactly how many scenes of "Oh, I had this horrible experience" of teen angst need a movie? Humor is flat and stupid, and everything else is sadly predictable. Yawn. <br /> <br /> The only thing that scares this turkey is the promise (threat) of a sequel, an idea that we expect all distributors in the country to drive a stake.
