I'm a big fan of terror, particularly Spanish horror. This movie had so many possibilities of being good. It's a wonderful idea, a vigilant ghost nun, like most of what has come from the mind of Jaume Balangueró. The visual and sound effects were also quite good. But everything was embarrassed by a bad address, a horrible cast and a painfully bad script (exhibition, exhibition!). Too. Maybe Balangueró should write and address himself a new version ... <br /> <br /> Also, I do not understand why actors who can not really speak English (and when they do) should understand this in English. , they do it so badly that it simply makes their actions even more false). If you look at contemporary Spanish horror films like The Orphanage or Rec, the performances are totally in tune with this kind of ghost story with style, and that is being realistic, being credible as someone like us, as real people, because That is the only way Thus horror achieves its goal. Unfortunately, everything failed at La Monja.
