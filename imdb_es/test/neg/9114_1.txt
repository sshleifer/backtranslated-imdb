I had a bad feeling ten seconds into the movie when a pair of overworked wristbands (probably from a bad west) blew through the scene. The bad feeling grew ten seconds later, when the forced stranger turned into human sacrifice for no apparent reason lowered his rearview mirror to see a shadow in the backseat. During the next five minutes on the opening credits, they give us a picture from the top of the car moving from one side to another and only the dramatic music made for television informs us that a murder is being committed, not a recovery session. For the next 27 or more hours, we are invited to two psychotic idiots who, for some reason, seem obliged to drive together through the desert of the Southwest, going one after the other like an insane abbot and Costello. Even with the "shocking" turns at the end, they simply let us shake our heads and wonder if the producers and the director / writer feel as ashamed and embarrassed as they should be to create this inconsistent and incoherent nonsense.
