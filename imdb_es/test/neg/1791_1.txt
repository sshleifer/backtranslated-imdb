Of all the movies I've seen, this one, The Rage, has to be one of the worst. The direction, the LOGIC, the continuity, the changes in the plot-script and the dialogue made me cry out in pain. "How could SOMEONE propose something so horrible?" Gary Busey is known for his "B" movies, but this is a sure "W" movie. (W = waste). <br /> <br /> Take, for example, about two dozen FBI officers and local law surrounding a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. MA is inside the jeep and he is "confused" as to why the police are involved. In a matter of seconds there is a great armed battle, MA dies directly. The cops shoot the jeep with Gary and the company firing at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives in circles and is not hit by a single bullet. MA is killed and it seems that Gary has not noticed, damn it, that guy is tough. Truly a miracle, not since the six-shot shooter received 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.
