I rented The Matrix Revisited with a friend of mine. We both loved The Matrix and we both like to make movies, so we wanted to see what was happening behind the scenes of The Matrix. It turns out that The Matrix Revisited barely tells you anything about the art of cinema or even how The Matrix was made. It's basically a big commercial for The Matrix, a movie that the target audience of The Matrix Revisited has already seen! <br /> <br /> If you really want to know about the process and the problems, the stress and the details. In the creation of The Matrix, look no further than the additional features of the original DVD of The Matrix. There are things that show in those documentaries that I had not even realized what had to be done or what was done. The Matrix was such a difficult and challenging film that it deserved more credit than a "documentary" that is as informative and interesting as an MTV special.
