I was pretty disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me a fan of Tsukamoto INSTANT, from the first 5 minutes of the movie. It was fresh, innovative, and simply ... different. I prefer to enjoy a movie on your face and press all the buttons "make you writhe". Tetsuo did just that where, for me, few films can. <br /> <br /> For those of us who enjoy breathing in some fresh air, those who appreciate the unconventional styles used that make independent films worthwhile, Testuo II is probably a disappointment. If you are looking for the visceral sensation of "HYPER-KINETIC" of the first movie, skip this, since all that has been eliminated. Tetsuo II is for some strange reason, just a typical Hollywood-style action movie. I was pretty confused. However, in my opinion, it's still worth it for any Tsukamoto fan.
