I found this movie on the net by accident and I was horrified by its content of violent violence and scenes of torture. It was a relief to know that it was not real after reading the comments. what dangerously sick animals of a person do something like this and for what purpose it goes beyond belief. I was even more surprised to see the people who valued the film in the comments section of this site. This is an extremely disturbing movie that could change your life forever. The people behind this should be bought to justice as soon as possible. today they showed a girl being raped and murdered on the screen tomorrow she could be a girl. Even if it is false or not, it is very disturbing, very nauseating.
