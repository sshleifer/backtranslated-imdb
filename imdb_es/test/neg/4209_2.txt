He saw this cheap used DVD, and he got it for a giggle. Recently I also found "The Octagon" on DVD and I bought it to remember, having seen it in the theater as a preteen and loving it at that time. The problem now with "going back" to these American karate movies, is that since then I have seen so many Thai and Hong Kong action movies, in which the fight scenes are long, fast and amazing. I'm thinking particularly of fights like Jackie and Benny "The Jet" at the end of "Dragons Forever", or Tony Jaa's circular fight of "The Protector". Hollywood's kung fu offers are simply not "well-filmed," and they even make someone with certified skill, like Chuck, uncomfortable at times. And what is worse than a fight in slow motion? Then you know that it looked horrible at normal speed, so they decreased its effect. It really highlights how ridiculous an opponent looks when standing and just WAIT for him to be kicked in the chest. <br /> <br /> Poor Chuck, he does not have much intensity in this movie, nor does he project any fair threat. Compare that with his former co-star Bruce Lee, who had charm and attitude to burn. When Bruce faced an opponent (s), you could almost see the air around him crackling with what was going to happen. In "Breaker, Breaker", Chuck seemed to be accidentally kicking people, with total nonchalance. When the judge comes to see him in jail and sentences him to death, Chuck looks at him with a sad look, and I thought: "It's okay ... he's doing that 'third eye' approach thing and he's going to grab the judge. Throat and get out of this, "but he does nothing, except look up with a look of fat eyes. Terrible. And while the DVD case gives you hope, with a run time of 1 hour, 5 minutes, it's actually 1 hour, 25 minutes, so there's 20 more minutes of pain viewing. <br /> <br /> For a great fight action, go see Jackie Chan in the first "History of the Police" ... the fight in the mall at the end is pure gold ......
