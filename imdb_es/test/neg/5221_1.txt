Normally, I do not like Chuck Norris movies. I appreciate his work as a martial artist, and his fight scenes are usually quite well choreographed. Chuck is undoubtedly one of the great martial arts. Then, at my used local bookstore, I found a movie that I had not seen before and took it home. <br /> <br /> Although the performance in this movie was worse than most Chuch Norris movies, I expected to see at least one fight scene. I quickly began to realize that this was not a typical Chuch Norris movie; rather it was a Christian film, destined to illustrate the paradigm of "the willingness to win". <br /> <br /> There is really nothing in the package that indicates that it is a Christian movie, with the exception of the label. .. Goodtimes Entertainment, which I had never heard before. No doubt I'll keep it in mind the next time I see a movie of that company. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with Christianity ... I have a problem with furtive proselytism. If someone is going to make a religious film, at least have the good sense to tell the viewer that this is what they will get. The only redeeming part of this exercise is that I spent only $ 3.25 in 97 minutes to see a great martial artist not fight. At least it was during dinner time, and I spent some of that cooking and eating. <br /> <br /> In short, if you're looking for a mediocre martial arts movie and you do not expect much, do not do it. Do not bother with this movie because it does not even offer that.
