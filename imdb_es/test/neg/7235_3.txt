I must say that I've seen worse Sci Fi Channel originals, but this shosker from Nu Image by Yossi Wein was still an obstacle. The big problem with this is that it's just not convincing, not just your creature, but your acting, writing and any attempt at drama. The direction lacks all kinds of talent and the script by Boaz Davidson and Danny Lerner never works, it's predictable, it's often ridiculous, while offering fewer howlers than some of these types of movies, it never offers anything to catch the pulse. The actors do the best they can, but with such material, their professional efforts have little effect. Matthew Reilly Burke is an observable hero, Meredith Morton, similar to an observable love interest. Actually, she was a little less convincing, but at least it was easy to see. The film, at least, has the dignity of rolling at a reasonable pace, but its biggest advantage is that the octopus is not completely rendered by CGI. So, although it does not look good, at least there are some legitimate scenes of characters that fight with rubber tentacles in a very funny way. I also chuckled at the disparities between the different representations of the octopus, the cgi shots of the creature as a whole vary in the course of the film, they are also different not only in size but in appearance to the practical shots of the same , and there are scenes in which the action of the tentacle suggests that the creators had abandoned pretending that they were making a film about an octopus and that they only imagined their creature as a group of different tentacles. The scenes of the creatures that attack people age rather quickly, but there are some funny scenes in which he tackles other things, like a ship and a crane. Yes, these scenes are poor, but they made me laugh. However, the undisputed highlight is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus acquires a point of reference in New York, the scene may not be much more than a minute, but it is actually inspired and worth watching on YouTube. Apart from that, things do not have inspiration in all aspects (a lack of gore or nastiness in the level of PG prevents this from happening in the good moments of the garbage). I can not really give it credit because the best shots in the last scenes were selected from the Stallone Daylight movie (which, according to my memory, is quite good). In general, this was quite bizarre and it was not something I would really recommend to anyone, except the characteristics of the creatures. Better than a blow to the eye with a wet stick, but not by much.
