One of the first things I noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the vigil at Sole's house. An aerial shot is used to show Sole blooming with kisses by a sea of ​​women. He believed that this was a comment about the closeness that women had to each other of this culture, that they remained together over generations, separations and misunderstandings, and that they could still join and trust each other. In addition, the film seemed to glorify women as almost perfect individuals. What I want to say with impeccable is that they did not suffer the consequences of their actions and were treated as if they did not have imperfections. An example of this is shortly after Paula accidentally killed her father. Her mother immediately comes to rescue her and assumes full responsibility for the act, while Paula seems not to suffer remorse for what she has done. Again, another example of this is when each daughter (or granddaughter) has had the opportunity to meet with her supposed "dead" mother (grandmother). Knowing the tensions that this has probably caused in his family, each one of them continues to hug the mother without worrying about what she has done, that is, to kill her husband and her lover. In this sense, women are portrayed as those who not only love each other independently of acts of character, but also those who do not seem to be bothered in the least by the acts in which their friends / family act. <br /> <br /> Another idea that I found intriguing about this culture was in relation to his idea of ​​the supernatural. With the death of Raimunda and Sole's mother and his inexplicable return, the director constructs the emotions of the audience to believe that this film will embody the supernatural. The people represented in this culture seem very supernatural, that is, very anxious to believe that life exists beyond the grave. His aunt, former friend Agustina, the prostitute and other people who live in the city of La Mancha, believe that rumors that the dead return to relatives to end the "pending issue." He believed that this was a mixed reflection of the religious faith of the (predominantly Catholic) culture, as well as his need to compensate those who did not have the opportunity to be forgiven during mortality. The belief they had about the fact that the dead were "alive" was also to give hope to the destitute circumstances they suffered in mortality. When the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film is not supernatural, it is interesting to observe the role that the mother continues to play. She is treated as if she were still a ghost (that is, hidden in small cracks (under the bed or inside the trunk of the car)). I think the director portrayed the mother in this way to enhance the existing supernatural beliefs that the city had adopted. The character of the mother seemed to be a metaphor for the city's long-held belief in life after death.
