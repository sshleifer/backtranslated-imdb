George Zucco was a good actor, often playing villains with a lascivious intensity. However, even he could not save this boring and flat-footed movie B. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays the usual mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron, who believes that the blood of wolf, injected into humans, can create an invincible army of werewolves that can win World War II (! Imagine!) Experimenting on Pedro, the assistant (Glenn Strange) Zucco creates a werewolf that looks like the ones Dave Allen used to play in his comedy sketches. Pedro obviously relies on Lennie from Of Mice And Men, and you're almost still waiting for him to say "Hey, it's okay, George!" There is a surprising moment in which the werewolf kills a child when reaching through the window and grabbing it, but for the most part it is a pedestrian routine, very pedestrian, of 77 minutes through all the old clich√©s that are They do much better in others. films. We also got the revenge motif of the Devil Bat worked, in itself from Son Of Frankenstein! <br /> <br /> Zucco is wasted, and you only have to see it in movies like Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes, The Mummy's Hand and Dr. Renault's Secret to see how it is wasted. A few atmospheric swamp scenes are all he has to offer, really. And the scene in which Zucco demonstrates his werewolf technique to those who doubted him (again the tones of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) is undoubtedly hilarious. <br /> <br /> It's not one of the best B movies of the 40s.
