This is the type of nighttime cable that is usually associated with Andrew Stevens or Shannon Tweed. Although unlike most vehicles powered by Tweed and Stevens' T & A, this is lethargic! <br /> <br /> Let's go to the persecution. The real reason to see this non-thriller is to see the breasts of Shannon Doherty. Anyone who says otherwise is a LIAR! However, most of his torrid sex scenes seem to be all smoke and mirrors. <br /> <br /> Note that all the shots in which your head and chest are shown at the same time are quick flashes. Frames where the camera remains on your naked body, have little or no glued face or are behind a wet and soaked shower door. <br /> <br /> All of you, boob watchers, know what that means: double body! <br /> <br /> However, I must admit that the ending where Doherty is bound, blindfolded and threatened with a knife, provided some fetishistic emotion. <br /> <br /> If you find a VHS copy anywhere, buy it! As everyone involved is probably too embarrassed for this to come out on DVD!
