TART is the worst movie I've seen this year, and that includes both Affleck / J.Lo bomb GIGLI and Rob Zombie borefest HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I do not know if that's a fair comparison, since TART was made two years earlier and probably has half the budget than even the 1000 low-budget CORPSES. In any case, the three films have the same deficiencies: horrible script, horrible performance, horrible direction. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly do not think there is anything to spoil) <br /> <br /> TART is a group of very spoiled private school children. Most of them reside in large apartments along the expensive Park Avenue in New York, thanks to the finances of their negligent parents. The film shows the life without direction of one of the students (Cat) while discarding his only true friend (a person as frivolous as her) in the search of the "good life" with the crowd. That, of course, leads to sex, drugs and music that is substantially worse than rock & roll. Everything is too dramatized in the way that really bad movies are. Cat's first sexual experience leads her to be marked as a vagabond and rejected by her new circle of friends; her first encounter with drugs leads her to almost throw herself in the trash after her classmates think she is dead of an overdose. There are no hard-line messages there, he said sarcastically. <br /> <br /> That is mainly what the "seen before 100 times" plot implies. Other minor details of the plot, and even less interesting, include a friend who steals jewels and trinkets from everyone else, a wild boy who lives on the edge (and finally falls one night in the East Hamptons), an anti-La British Semitic girl who ends her friendship with Cat the moment she discovers that Cat has a Jewish father, and Cat's tense relationship with her single mother who tries unsuccessfully to appreciate Cat's privileged life. The thief turns out to be a low level of irremediable life. The "wild child" is played as an attenuated version of one of the Hilton sisters. The British girl disappears from the movie after the breakup. The mother / daughter relationship is considered totally inconsequential until the last scene of the film, where she and her harassed mother have a kind of reconciliation. * yawn * <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> About the cast and crew ... Dominique Swain came on the scene with her role as the seductive minor in 1997, LOLITA and FACE / OFF, highly visible. His performances were strong enough to be placed on a good number of "one to see" lists at that time. I was 17 years old at the time and I hope that they are not the best roles of his career. If you take some more papers like the one you take on TART, it may very well be. <br /> <br /> I've only seen Bijou Phillips in another movie (BULLY) and I swear by his performance that one was almost identical to the one she gave here. I am not sure if he is incapable of performing varied actions or if it was just a coincidence that his roles in the two were very similar. My guess is that the first is true. I feel that this woman has very little talent when it comes to acting. Here, she is the actress chosen to portray Sister Hilton diluted. The fact that she gives such a weak performance is amazing, since she grew up and is still a friend of the real-life Hilton sisters. Basically, she's playing a version of herself in this movie, and she's doing a bad job. <br /> <br /> As for the writer / director Christina Wayne ... I do not know anything about her, other than that TART was her first. And only, film project to date. With a first effort like this, it is not surprising that his career in the world of entertainment was brief.
