Robert Lansing plays a scientist who experiments with the passage of objects through solid matter, but goes too far one night and, unintentionally, becomes four-dimensional! The fantasy of the atomic age is quite charming in a very cheesy way. Maybe it was considered a thoughtful science fiction at the time (with psychological connotations), but nowadays the film is slightly overheated and naive; It is a tailor-made camp festival for the late and late television program. The wooden performances of Lansing and Lee Meriwether are hardly considered one-dimensional, although Patty Duke (who plays a cute brat before "Miracle Worker") gets a colorful and memorable output. <br /> <br /> ** of ****
