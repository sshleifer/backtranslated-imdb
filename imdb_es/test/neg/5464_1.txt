Well, it certainly surprised me. I can not believe that someone has made another Australian movie that is even more boring than Somersault. The story is implausible, the characters, with the exception of the Friels and Mailman characters, are unpleasant and wooden, Tom Long has a wide variety of facial expressions VAST: happy and not happy, and the "sex scenes", which could Having been very confrontational and disturbingly erotic, I would have been at home with a low budget porn movie. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I've seen in 30 years of cinema that has had me on the edge of my seat ... ready to get up and leave. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the promotional poster.
