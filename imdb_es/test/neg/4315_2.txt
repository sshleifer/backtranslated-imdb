This is total swill. If you take away The Devil's Rejects and you get all the good stuff out of it, and you add a lot of twisted, twisted parts, some rape scenes, and like one or two truly horrifying scenes, you get this movie. People are calling this a '86 Hitler scam, but I do not see that at all. Even Hitcher's worst thefts are even better than this. The main problem shown here is that there is really nothing here, apart from some of the director's fetishes that are exhibited as circus shows. Is it all you need in a movie of pictures of girls being abused and bound, cowering in fear? Well, then rent this movie! <br /> <br /> However, I prefer to watch a good movie, which clearly is not. The sad thing is that there are some really good emotions waiting to be discovered here, but only some. For example, the suspense at the beginning before the slavery of slavery began ... very well if you ask me. And the scene in which the hitchhiker kills the nympho girl (I do not remember the names) is chilling, somehow very brutal, defying even the Devil's Rejects for unbridled fury. How is it that the rest of the movie can not be so good? Hey, I really need to stop renting stupid things like this. Closing message: Just let this cunn of garbage die and forget it forever. Not recommended.
