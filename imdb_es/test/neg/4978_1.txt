When I learned that Disney had the rights to "Underdog", at least I thought it would be a great relationship with Pixar, and we would get a great movie of Adults and Children as "The Incredibles". Oh! I forgot how Disney should silence the classic material for the young fools of today. What were you thinking? "Underdog" was a product of the 60s, its Prime Fanbase is in its 40s and 50s, why would it refocus it on 5 year olds? It should have been done to "Roger Rabbit", half animated half real. Instead, characters like Riff Raff (a WOLF!) Are mistaken for another dog. "Underdog" can not have an "energy pill", since we are so "enlightened" that it would obviously be a reference for steroids or drugs. The only good casting was Patrick Warburton as "Cad" because it really looks like the cartoon version. Otherwise, fans of the old school "Down" should avoid this as the plague it is. Whats Next? A live action version of "The Go-Go Gophers" disguised as a re-visionist history lesson? (My advanced apology if Disney jumps on this!)
