... but I had to see how bad it could be. For starters, the plot was thin, but it kept getting worse. A graduate student in genetic engineering uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a man, because a biological weapon used in WW3 killed 97% of the world's male population. The surviving men are either high gigolo prices in clubs of alleys, or madmen crazed in football stadiums that try to overthrow the 'Conspiracy of Lesbians'. The whole process resembled the microwave of a large jelly bowl. Press a few buttons and ding you get a baby. Not only that, but it will age until mid-20 in a month and then begin to age normally (what's convenient). Finally, poor Adam gets bored with the isolated cabin in the forest where his creator raised him and steals his car to "see the city". <br /> <br /> This starts at 90 minutes of unlikely chases, convenient plot twists and several subplots that we never see resolved. As Adam quickly learns, what men survived are treated as marginalized / criminals, because they are dangerous beasts that can not help there with a genetic predisposition to violence. The propaganda machines have been in full swing, frightening women into believing that all men are rapists and murderers. This has led to lesbianism being the norm, the fall of Christianity, female reproduction only through cloning and, oh yes, world peace, among other implicit results. All of which seems unlikely given that only about 30 years have passed since the war. Adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next, while being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to do much by himself. With the FBI on its way, madams looking for fresh meat, and its creator trying to retrieve it (so it seems), he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after all. <br /> <br /> Everything in general, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed the performance of Veronica Cartwrights from the FBI Director of 'Love to Hate', and Julie Bowen did not do anything bad like Hope 'hetero closet' geneticist either.
