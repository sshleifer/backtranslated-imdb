What is the deal with all these groups of ethnic crimes that copy films related to the Italian Mafia? We all know the Godfather as in Don Vito Corleone, now we have this Mexican, which is only a copy. I can not see why other ethnic groups have to imitate and imitate Italian mobsters, but that makes them look foolish. Surely they seem to be Italian wanabee. I would rather see Mexicans realize their own ideas and I would like to see their own culture and the way they do it, instead of copying ideas from the Godfather trilogy. Apart from that, the movie was disappointing, seeing Mexicans acting and trying to be Italian is not my thing. After seeing this, now I'm going to see the "real" Godfather so that this movie can be erased from my memory.
