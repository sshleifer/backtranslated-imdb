I will confess that, once I started watching this movie, I had a control over me that forced me to see it to its conclusion. Possibly this was a latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero agree with his victim, or perhaps the fascination for which they obtained funds to make, distribute and show this movie that kept me looking for it by merit, or possibly some strange fantasy of desire-fulfillment that there could be a point at the end of all the pain. But there is not so much luck. <br /> <br /> Therefore, you are warned not to start seeing it in the first place, so that the same thing does not happen to you. There is nothing here that is worth spending in its hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The first-person mockumentary and the confusion about Fabian's "search" to impregnate Falkland women is further revealed as a sophomore freshman student, meaning , film student project of what you can imagine. The effect ends up being both mocking the local inhabitants (who, apart from the two professional leaders, who are actually real people) and participating in rather repugnant sexual policies (it does not matter if you take everything literally or symbolically, it does not make sense ) and sexist). <br /> <br /> The reason why I ended up seeing it to the end is the same reason why once you start to touch a scab, there is an irresistible fascination to continue doing so until it's completely turned off, even when You know what is bad for you He just wants to see what happens. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a rather dishonest cinematographic realization, because it seems that ultimately it does not have a moral center, nor an explanation of the local political situation, nor any place of the type. From the universe of political-sexual-personal cinema to Goddard. In short, he has nothing to say and spends a lot of time pretending yes. Presumed would be the motto of a single word. <br /> <br /> I would suggest to the filmmakers to rent "Waiting for Guffman" a few times, or even to hell, even to the "Blair Witch Project" if they want to stay the course with A little more style and a little more than genuine emotion. Or at least entertainment value.
