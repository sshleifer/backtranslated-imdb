While David Lynch's version of Dune is choppy, clumsy and unfaithful to the novel, it is visually well-designed and acted out. The best that can be said about the Sci Fi channel's attempt to turn Dune into a miniseries is that it is ambitious. Actually, that is virtually the only positive compliment that one can offer. The actors (with few exceptions) seem happy to recite their lines with as little emotion as possible and less appropriate accents. The wardrobe seems to have been designed by someone with a large surplus of Mylar fabric in his hand and an unhealthy love for unattractive hats. <br /> <br /> In part, this miniseries suffers from living in the shadow of the well-known Lynch effort. However, it takes elements from the Lynch movie that were not present in the novel and the almost wholesale copy (ie Guild Steersman's navigation sequence), and this only encourages the negative comparison with the Lynch movie. A for effort. D for practically everything else.
