For me, this is not a good television show, animated or otherwise. However, it is annoying until the ninth grade. There are some reasons for this, in no particular order. First, the introduction of one of the most useless, and annoying characters of all time, Batmite. This character is useless for the show, not at all. Maybe it's thought of as a comic relief, but it does not work that way. In addition, the Joker.i thought it was really ridiculous to have his character unleashed with that ridiculous laugh after almost every sentence. Talk about the repetitive. This ages very fast. Neither believe that the right actor had the voice of the character. It just does not sound like the prankster should. In short, they made Robin look like a complete idiot. Apart from these problems, the program is not so bad. But these are problems large enough to drastically decrease the probability factor. For me, "The new adventures of Batman" are a 3/10, at best.
