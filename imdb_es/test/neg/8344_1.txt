I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie. What is even more stupid is that who had thought of an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This film should not be filmed in Los Angeles, it must be filmed in Honolulu Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes, which is a real fact that this film must be made in the state capital of Hawaii. This movie should be filmed in Hawaii because this is the real idea and not in Los Angeles. There are earthquakes in Los Angeles, but there are no volcanoes. To be honest with you, this is incredible and very silly nonsense. In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but foolishness.
