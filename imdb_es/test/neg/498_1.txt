Critics love this movie. Personally I found it meaningless and tasteless. This is the millionth time I fall into the trap of "critics love me" and I left wanting someone to throw boiling water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie. There are many scenes that are completely unnecessary. A warning for animal lovers: do not watch this movie if you do not want them to kill or bother the sheep. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Asian movie, see Afrika. If you want to see a movie about escaped convicts, see Gene Wilder / Richard Pryor's classic, Stir Crazy. Avoid 9 souls like the plague.
