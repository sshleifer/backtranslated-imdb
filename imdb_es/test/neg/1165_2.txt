I just watched this movie and it turns out to be quite boring, as other user reviews mentioned and what bothered me the most was the southern accent that some of the characters had, which took place in Wisconsin, not in the south. As mentioned in other reviews, Ed Geine was not a great friend, so why did the guy who plays Jason and Leatherface portray him? <br /> <br /> I moved quickly through most things because there are many slow parts. <br /> <br /> We hope someone will do their homework with Ed Geine and the city and make a more accurate movie
