I saw him last night at Sundance. Altman must be the most famous director in history. Despite its "stellar power", this show is not at all convincing, and its political ideas, with which I, as a proud liberal, do not agree, are superficial and clumsy, and seem torn from the headlines of USA Today, despite the fact that it is coming out of the mouth of someone as dear as Mario Cuomo. The drama, as such, is not very dramatic, and comedy is not fun. The only points of interest, in fact, are to see how New Yorkers live in their lives, and the loyalty of a cast and crew to regroup a show that continues to insist has some cult followers since 1988. Sometimes it seems that the only contribution of Altman to the cinema has been The art of having all your actors talking at the same time, whose effect is one feels depressing as if they were a stranger in a wedding.
