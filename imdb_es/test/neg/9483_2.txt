The boys were the most attractive things in the whole movie. The girls were lame and pathetic, I mean, how can they have their own line of clothes, dolls, movies, production studios and not smell this bomb from far away? to gain some kind of responsibility, I really do not see the meaning of punishment ..., they are sent to Paris, very far from home to live with the so-called strict grandfather who has an important position with Paris. I really can not remember what it was, who cares? the detail does not help, the girls are sent to Paris to learn something ... so, what exactly do they learn when they meet two French boys and they can manipulate the boy who is supposed to watch them so they can meet these guys in scooters? The typical preadolescent movie, having all the preadolescents who wish to behave badly and be able to pay for the trip to Paris or some distant country away from the parents? I do not like olsens anyway, they could never get rid of the image of michelle, in the whole house ... in case you have not seen it, you were lucky from the beginning. (F F-)
