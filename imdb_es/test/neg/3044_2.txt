That's almost all I can say about this flat, uninspired remake of Carol Kane's 1979 vehicle. Camilla Belle is not a great actress, and does not add energy or vitality to the role of Jill Johnson, the nanny harassed by an anonymous telephone caller. <br /> <br /> But if you're looking for an excellent interior design and architecture ideas for the home, this movie provides more inspiration than anything you see on TLC or HGTV. Jill spends almost 90 minutes wandering around the house of the rich doctor and the wife to whom she is giving her services to sit down, in search of the origins of strange sounds and things that keep "hitting" at night. While she hides in the corners and looks down the corridors, we see a beautiful master bathroom with his and hers basins that look like Roman bathtubs, a huge kitchen with incredible glass shelves with back lighting and the piece of resistance, an independent aviary. and the shy pond that has an automatic irrigation system. <br /> <br /> Because the movie is not convincing enough to attract Jill's fear, the grandiosity of the house distracts us, which is not something you should be doing when you're watching a thriller. Even while Jill is being chased by a faceless maniac, we are embarrassed because she is breaking valuables and spoiling the shy pond, not because she is about to be killed. , and the ending is anything but original. By the time he finished, he just wanted to know where the hell this house was and if it was real. It does not matter, Jill and the children she cared for. <br /> <br /> 2 stars, both for the house.
