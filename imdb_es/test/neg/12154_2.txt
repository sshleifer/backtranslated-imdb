I'm really surprised that he got 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and a nomination for the best foreign film at the Oscars. The rating of 7.3 in IMDb ... is not a surprise, since IMDb users have recently voted. I just can not get into a movie in which the real facts about his main character have been clearly distorted, and not at all to make the artistic film, but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring. It turns out that, in fact, it makes it very boring for anyone who expected to see a serious and credible interpretation of the life of Genghis Khan. The exaggerated and dramatized Mongols often echo 300, a movie that could not be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate; But unlike the 300, the Mongol is taken seriously. The stoical seriousness, mixed with the obvious inaccuracies, is what makes it the most boring movie I've seen this year; Possibly the most action film or biopic I've seen. The characters were written pathetically. Honestly, I doubt that Genghis Khan was as boring and passive as shown in this movie. Which is funny for me, because if there is something that I think should change for the sake of theatricality, it is turning a bored person into an interesting person. The romance between Khan and Borte is equally boring, simple and stupid. Also, without revealing anything, Mongol contains the only stupidest scene I've seen in a LONG TIME, where there should be a good 20 minutes of development of the plot, the film simply advances without explanation. It looked like something out of a Saturday Night Live skit that parodies epic action movies with a horrible rhythm. (Did I mention how seriously Mongol is taken?) Meanwhile, it crawls like no movie I've seen before. Even now, I could swear it lasted three hours. After about 45 minutes, I checked the time, pretty sure it was almost over. In addition to some beautiful landscapes and quality acting from Asano (naturally), the Mongol is honestly just a mess. It did not entertain me or enlighten me in any way. I would never give this movie a second chance. And not to sound racist or patriotic or whatever, but give me a malicious American epic about Mongolian any day. At least then I know what I am getting, unlike Mongol, where the comments and ratings made me believe that it was really worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about how much I hated Mongol is that I have friends that I would definitely love.
