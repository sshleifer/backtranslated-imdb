In general, I really like Steven Seagal's films. In general, they are very entertaining and are adept at Aikido. Usually, I like the way Steven incorporates these martial art techniques into the fighting sequences. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is a really bad effort to make movies and it seems obvious to me that it's the fault of the director and the producers who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie, and a lot less direct someone like Steven Seagal and take advantage of his knowledge and competence. <br /> <br /> I never saw the end of this movie. I left before the end simply because I could not stand seeing this bad movie anymore. I am sure that many people also share my feelings.
