You have to start worrying when you see that Michael Madsen is leading the cast of any movie. I will not go through the list of shame that is his film career. <br /> <br /> I saw him for 45 minutes and I still was not sure what was really going on. The film consisted of a love-hate relationship between Madsen and Argento, which was basically insulting her, threatening her with violence and, in general, treating her like trash. She, on the other hand, loves him, then she does not, then she does, she wants him, then she loves him again ... What's wrong with you, woman ?! <br /> <br /> The Script is a horrible, terrible soundtrack and an aggressive and crude useless sexuality, which I think was added to attract some viewers, since the film has little more to offer. I would have given the film a 1, but almost achieved a 2 with a little excitement in the last 20 minutes. He really answered a question in the last minutes, but I'm not going to share that, I'll make you suffer for the whole movie like I did.
