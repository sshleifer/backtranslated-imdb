I worked in this atrocity ten years ago. Luckily for me, nobody knows because I did not make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in theaters, I was happy! My agents went crazy for the filmmakers (apparently for the first time), rewriting the script daily and changing their agreements with the agencies with the same frequency. Later they told me that, once back in California (we filmed in Atlanta), these "professionals" had 4 1/2 hours of filming! Even edited up to 90 minutes, it is at least double what is necessary. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming, but otherwise, what a waste of a movie!
