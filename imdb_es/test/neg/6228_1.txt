I have to say that there is a redeeming stain in regards to this "movie". It firmly establishes the bottom of the canyon. Now the filmmakers know what to point up when they make a movie. Apart from that I regret seeing this debacle. What brazen abandonment the realization of this "movie" was. What a waste of $ 100,000 (that's people, HUNDRED THOUSAND dollars). This "film" reminds me of the "Adult Video Awards" program in which a group of "industrial prostitutes" praises themselves, believing that they are real actors, actresses and filmmakers. That's why it's ironic that I've seen blue films with better acting, direction and writing. I also found it funny that the executive producer, Justin Ament, just had to be in the "movie". He plays Deputy Jake Barker. I am sure that his "acting" career has taken off ... Ted Pfiffer, the writer, has a part. No doubt he was wallowing in the clich√© of the glory he created. It should be noted that Carrie Finklea has a leading role in the film. You may remember her from 'Elephant' by Gus Van Sant. Although I'm not sure she wants to write this movie on her resume. And I'm not sure which is a more depressing point; Money was spent to make this movie or people will see it. Along with 'Torque', 'Godsend' and 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow', one of the worst films, IF NOT THE WORST FILM, 2004.
