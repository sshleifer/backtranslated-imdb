No one is going to confuse THE SQUALL with a good movie, but it sure is memorable. Once you have taken into account the performance of Myrna Loy as Nubi, the hot-blooded gypsy, you are not likely to forget the experience. When this movie was made, the exotically beautiful Miss Loy was still being chosen as a foreign fox, often Asian and generally sinister. She is certainly an eye here. It seems that his skin darkened and his hair curled. In most scenes, she is barefoot and wears little more than a loose skirt and peasant blouse, while in one scene she only wears a patterned towel. I guess I'm focusing on Miss Loy's appearance because she's by far the best, if not the only, reason to tune in to this crunchy antiquity and keep watching. Surely you will not be attracted to the dialogue, which is hopeless. In a typical passage, Nubi looks out the window at the caravan that leaves and comments on poetry: "Gypsies always sing, Strange and sad, When the great sun has the breath of fire that burns, and when the pale moon looks from behind the cloud, and breathe cold air like death, they sing. " Poetics, or what? Those who love purple prose will have a field day. However, I can not help but wonder if, in her last years, Miss Loy preferred not to remember her participation in this project. <br /> <br /> Like many other fans, this was an adaptation of a recent Broadway hit. . The theatrical version opened at the 48th Street Theater in November 1926 and lasted more than a year. The play sparked a famous episode in which comedian and theatrical critic Robert Benchley, who was known to have an aversion to characters who spoke in a thick dialect or pidgin English, participated. According to a very repeated anecdote, Mr. Benchley writhed uncomfortably through the opening part of this show. The atmosphere of the Spanish village (moved to a village in Hungary for the film, for some reason) gave the actors room to maneuver to practice their accents with varying degrees of success, but Benchley's patience reached its limit when , during a family dinner sequence, a door was broken. It opened and an actress dressed as a gypsy girl ran into the room shouting "Help! Help! Kneel!" Then he threw himself at the feet of the owner of the house and exclaimed: "Me, Nubi! Me, good girl! I'll stay here!" At that moment, Mr. Benchley got up and announced to his companion: "I'm Bobby, I'm a bad boy, I'm leaving," and he left the theater. <br /> <br /> The film version offers numerous examples of unwanted humor but never comes close to Benchley's level of wit. The melodramatic plot concerns the Lajos family: father Josef, mother Maria and son Paul, a student of the nearby university. We would consider this prosperous "upper-middle class" family, since they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life, but their comfortable existence is suddenly seen in chaos when a gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their home is invaded by , yes, Nubi the nubile gypsy. She arrives at your door during the storm of the title, symbolizing stormy emotions, I dare say. The girl is fleeing from an abusive relationship and asks for sanctuary. After considering the matter, the Lajos family accepts to hide it from their angry lover, who appears shortly afterwards but is rejected. Nubi becomes a servant in the house. Kindness motivates the family's decision to welcome her, but soon enough to fool Nubi, a little good for nothing, has paid them by seducing all the healthy men in the neighborhood, starting with Lajos's servant, Peter, and then working its way up. son Paul Nubi breaks Paul's relationship with his girlfriend Irma (played by Loretta Young, who is still a teenager), forces him to drop out of school and then asks him to buy his jewelry by stealing the savings from the family maid, Lena (ZaSu Pitts). Lena, meanwhile, is still mourning the loss of her own boyfriend Peter, seduced and discarded by Nubi when he turned his attention to Paul. Ultimately, Nubi looks at the paternal father Josef, and I suppose if the execution time had been longer, he would also have gone after Uncle Dani, Maria, the priest of the village and God knows who else. <br /> <br /> I guess it goes without saying that a scenario like this lends itself easily to parody, but during its first half, THE SQUALL, however, exerts the undeniable fascination of a daytime soap: we watch, hypnotized , while Bad Girl exerts its spell on men. - individuals and wreak havoc as an irresistible force of nature (almost like ... a storm! Ah, ha, another metaphor!). But as the machinations of the plot move in the field, the fun fades. During the later scenes, Nubi loses the emphasis and the focus changes to the dysfunctional dynamics of the Lajos family, and after a while these people become a real obstacle. The child, in particular, behaves like an absolute heel, however, parents never recognize it or face their own shortcomings; Everything, we are told, is the fault of Nubi, that vagabond not good. <br /> <br /> The cast men are boring. Apart from Miss Loy, the only actress who can handle the performance on talkies is ZaSu Pitts, excellent as always. The mother of the Lajos family is played by Alice Joyce, a silent star who was out of her element and who left shortly after this. The fresh beauty of Loretta Young offers a nice contrast to the dark charm of Nubi, but her line readings are so uncomfortable that it is endearing. No, there's only one reason to watch this movie, and that's the same Nubi. I can not think of another actress who could have played this foolish role and managed to get rid of half of it too. However, I am not an objective observer. I'm in love with Myrna Loy and I'll look at everything, even THE SQUALL.
