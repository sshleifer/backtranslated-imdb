Everything that made the original so fun seems to be absent here. This is simply a "slaher", but without the passion that graced the original. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in the story, in fact it seems that they ignore the first one in total Here, the demons escape in a high security apartment building and, naturally, kill most of the residents in a creepy way. The makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time. Although the actors were not exactly brilliant in Demons, in Demons 2 they are actually much worse. You do not care about these characters, at all. The plot is nonexistent, the poor music (apart from a song by Simon Boswell), is not scary in the least; It's just not so good. <br /> <br /> Easily the worst movie Dario Argento has ever been involved with and also with Lamberto Bava (Bava has a cameo in this movie, not very funny). <br /> <br /> Maybe 3 is too high a grade, but at least I could see everything and I did not think about stopping halfway. My advice; Adhere to the original.
