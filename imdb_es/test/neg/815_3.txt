It is hard to imagine what they thought of when they made this film (that is, the writers, directors, producers, actors, editors, etc.). Christopher Plummer, a veteran of 129 films, has fun among many other actors who apparently have no more motivation than to collect a salary. I guess there's nothing wrong with that, but once you get paid that does not mean that anyone has to see it. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that there really are good reviews for this movie here at imdb. Art? If you want to see art, go to an art gallery, do not watch this movie. Comedy? See a repeat of the Flintstones, almost the same plot with less time lost. <br /> <br /> Dabney Coleman offers his usual performance, for better or for worse. And some of the young actors may have gained a good experience in making this film. But Plummer ???? It was embarrassing to see his performance, in fact, I felt absolutely paralyzed with him during the film, knowing that this was the fame of Plummer of Sound of Music! I see in his biography that he called Sound of Music "mucus sound", so I guess he did not like it as much as the hundreds of millions of people who appreciated him. <br /> <br /> I wonder if today. He was asked, how do you rate the Sound of Music compared to where is the heart, what would you say ...? <br /> <br /> Probably something like "Where is the money" ...
