I know it's impossible to keep all the details of a book in a movie. But this movie has changed almost everything for no reason. In addition many changes have made the story illogical. Some examples: 1) in the movie "Paul Renauld" he really knows Poriot before he dies (in the book, Poirot only receives a letter), telling him that he is afraid of being killed. This is completely stupid because if Renauld's plan had been successful, Poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been Renauld (Poirot was in the morgue when Mrs. Renauld identified the victim). 2) The movie has "combined" two people into one! "Cinderella" has been eliminated by the movie. The girl that Hastings falls in love with and Jack Renauld's ex-girlfriend is one of the people in the movie! Why, for the love of God? 3) Hastings finds the victims because he is such a bad golfer. Totally ungraceful and stupid. 4) The film tells secrets too early (for example, at the beginning). So you know things you should not know. 5) The murderer is shot at the end by a person who does not exist in the book. Maybe because the person ("Cinderella") who stops the killer does not exist in the movie. 6) The book is very complex. The movie lasts only about 90 minutes. Of course it is difficult to include all the necessary details, but it is impossible if you include stupid things that were not in the book and have no meaning (for example, bicycle race).
