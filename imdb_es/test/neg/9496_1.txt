I have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now, but after reading the film I felt it was necessary to warn parents that they might be thinking of showing it to their children. Please no! This is not a Disney movie. This movie tells us that 'life is cruel' and if you show it to your children, in my opinion, you are too. <br /> <br /> The video frame describes the film as a "delight for all ages" and the IMDb plot sketch describes it as a "family movie". I just had to find a definition of 'family movie' and found the following: "Usually, they consist of comedies or adventures, these films are often based on children's literature and can involve any number of useful animals, supernatural beings and fantastic worlds, all oriented to stimulate and attract the imagination, whatever the situation, there is little or no offensive material and a lesson is usually learned along the way ". It is not an adequate description of Tarka The Otter, which contains some totally unpleasant scenes, totally inappropriate for young children, and an ending that qualifies the film as a "feeling bad" movie. The lesson learned? As I said: life is cruel. Family entertainment? I do not think so. Unless you hate your family, that's it. <br /> <br /> Another revision, more revealing than this, but worth reading, can be found by following the link 'external reviews'.
