Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx, and what do you get? You receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of madness similar to Magoo. <br /> <br /> The limited plot has Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) on an international plot, where he steals a world-renowned gem. Of course he has no idea what he is doing. In fact, he has no idea that he had the gem. <br /> <br /> In thirty minutes, you could get very bored seeing this. There are some very funny moments, like when he is cooking chicken. You will want to be as myopic as Magoo. It's a fun movie to watch but it's a disaster! You have to love Leslie Nielson because he made some very funny movies. This is not the best he can do, but he does a good job playing Magoo. I thought it was a fun movie, and I should recommend it to young children because they will probably think it's a lot of fun.
