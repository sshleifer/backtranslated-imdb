Let me start by saying that I have lived in Louisville, Kentucky all my life. I grew up half a mile from Waverly. In the winter, we pulled our sledges down Maryman Road and crossed Dixie Highway for a sleigh ride on Waverly Hill. Many times, during the winter of 76-77, we climbed into the Tunnel to warm up. The place was still running as a "Geriatric Center" at that time. We would go all the way through the tunnel of the hill to hit what we thought was the "Puerta a la Morgue". I have to be honest. The only feeling we feel is that we got away with something we should not be doing. I should say we climbed that tunnel more than 50 times that winter. Nothing more strange happened than the teenage boys acting stupidly. I love the fact that he is receiving attention after all these years. One night, when I was young, we looked out the front porch and it seemed like the whole hill was on fire. There was an older hospital on the hill that burned down. It burned for hours while the whole neighborhood sat outside and watched. What is lost with Waverly is that many people survived tuberculosis there. Let's face it. The doctors at the time did everything they thought was right to save people. It took a lot of guts for people to work there knowing how contagious TB was. Too much focuses on those who suffered. I have also traveled in the building several times in the early 70's. We would visit closed places in the Home for the Elderly through a group of young people from the church. By the way, the doors were not prisons like steel doors with chains and padlocks, as shown in the movie. They were made of wood and sometimes opened too wide. There was a smell of urine and excrement and you occasionally saw an open dressing gown associated with patients with dementia. It was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80's. A lot of that may have to do with the age of the building or the right person was not rewarded. This is after all Kentucky. The part of the documentary that most discouraged me was the accumulation of bodies in a cart. If I'm not mistaken, it seems to have been a recording of the Holocaust. That was added for the dramatic effect. It left a bitter taste in my mouth for the filmmaker. I am a skeptic when it comes to "ghosts". I think many of those around here really think it's the place to be happy. Waverly for me, however, symbolizes a fun place of adventure for a child with a sled.
