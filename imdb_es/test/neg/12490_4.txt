Dear Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, I do not know to what extent I am writing this letter. I am a fan of Amitabh Bachchan who has never finished saying, after having participated in his act of chasing cocks in Jaadugar. I also demand an important designation in the Godfather fan club, since I've seen the Coppola classic more times than you have delivered flops from your Factory. And, of course, I have been a great admirer of yours, from the moment Nagarjuna wrapped the chain of the cycle around his knuckles in Shiva. <br /> <br /> When you announced Sarkar and qualified him as a sponsor All you wanted to know was the date on which the first look would come, on Sunday that the promotions would go on the air, on Friday when the film would be released . It was a great desire to do your job knowing that you, and not someone moving between the mustard fields of Amritsar and the tulip gardens of Amsterdam, had taken on the task of recreating the pages of Puzo on the big screen of Bollywood. <br /> <br /> Your cast could not have been more you? working for the first time with the legend, selecting Abhishek as his screen son, giving Kay Kay the role he has deserved for years, recovering forgotten faces such as Supriya Pathak and Rukhsar, and selecting non-actors like Katrina and Tanishaa to join. the list?? Before July 1, you had made Sarkar the most anticipated film of all the fans of godparents who worshiped Bachchan. <br /> <br /> The opening credits revived the hope that your impressive sepia-colored promotions had been lit on TV. But now, you labeled Sarkar as your tribute to the Godfather instead of the word "inspired" you had been using all along. You probably do not want the two creations to be compared, but when the medium is the same, then a Kaante would be compared to Reservoir Dogs and a Reservoir Dogs to a City On Fire. <br /> <br /> Also, when Your first and last sequence? The heart of any script treatment? all about the establishment and transfer of power, you can not keep the Nagares and the Corleones separate, even if you replace the movements of the American mafia with the political power game of Maharashtria. <br /> <br /> But did you get it wrong, Mr. Varma? You wanted to show Amitabh in his avatar of the 70s, as a crunch for the feathers of Salim-Javed. You wanted it to hide bigger than life. You wanted it to be your own brand (or). So how could you steal your voice in the name of using silence? How could you keep him in his chair in search of interesting camera angles? How could you leave him stranded without his voice and stature, the two things that have made his B so big? Coppola's Godfather's cameraman, Gordon Willis, masked Brando's eyes throughout the film because he did not have the power to match that hoarse voice or that sudden flick of his fingers. But you tried to repeat the Malik act of your own Company. But Bachchan is not Ajay Devgan? His fort is not found in the stagnant gaze and the suffocating silence. You made the man look like a comatose patient, who is reminded from time to time to look at the reference cards and say those predictable phrases. For that, Agneepath is there, any given Saturday. <br /> <br /> What fan of Bachchan would go and watch Kay Kay Menon steal the thunder under his nose at the scene where Sarkar asks Vishnu to leave his house? What Amitabh fan would go and see him focus on quartering and star in a movie about power with a capital P in the promotions? We can not handle so much in the name of moderation and underestimation! You do not even allow the camera to rest on him for five seconds when he learns that his son wanted to kill him. Give me the Bachchan style of old-school camera, any given Saturday. <br /> <br /> Of course, congratulations to you for having made an actor of Abhishek, first in Naach and now in Sarkar. It also allows him to show Mallika Sherawat that he can run as well as his father. Even in the brief prison sequence, you really get the Bachchans out of the text, an opportunity that Shaad lost in Bunty Aur Babli. I wish the film had been more of a father-son story instead of a chaotic conflict between cartoons on behalf of characters, which appear like advertising windows on the Internet. <br /> <br /> You also let women more into the script that Puzo and Coppola did and, once again, you deserve all the Brownie points for tightening them so effectively. Pathak is a welcome return as the mother in the middle, adorable Tanishaa as the girl in love, Katrina a revelation as the confused lover of Abhishek and the silence of Rukhsar says a lot. <br /> <br /> But the subplots are not a classic remake. When your free-flow camera tries to make all the frames look good and your high background score gets irritated incessantly, they remind us that we are in a factory. Well, maybe it's not a Nino Rota score, but Sarkar certainly deserves better than those songs of Govinda, Govinda and flute interludes out of place. <br /> <br /> Mr. Varma, some of his Factory directors tell me that he is involved in every project, from the supervision of the filming schedules to the supervision of the editing sessions. Perhaps, in the midst of all the different storyboards, the scream of Bhiku Matre is being silenced by the silence of Subhash Nagare. Maybe, you need to lower the blinds of the factory and work on a single product made at home. Otherwise, your products would remain products, to use and throw, not to treasure. And film fans like me, for whom there are no successes or failures, just a good cinema, would prefer to choose a film without the end of Factory, any Saturday.
