One of the most notorious of the "Video Nasties" banned in the 1980s is also one of the most exaggeratedly exaggerated. "Make them die slowly" is about what you expect from a jungle whirlwind led by Umberto Lenzi: Native techniques of inventive native torture (albeit misinterpreted), some ridiculous "social comments" (yes, even more foolish than the " Cannibal Holocaust "), and a lot of guts being chewed. However, the exploitative violence of the film is often only shown in a brief close-up and never lasted for a long time, which diminishes its effect (interpret that it can do so). The dialogue is Lenzi's usual nonsense, since our male heroes show their affection for the females by calling them "tw @ t" and the like. The cast of well-known faces (including Lorraine De Selle, Giovanni Lombardo Radice, Zora Kerowa and Robert Kerman) does everything possible in the face of growing idiocy (including a completely ridiculous "castration preservation"), but it can not save this exaggerated work. effort.
