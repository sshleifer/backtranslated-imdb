I could see the final result a mile away. All the signs were there ... the graduation party, the liquor, the fast trip, the distraction of the females ... A good announcement for the use of the safety belt, and later models of vehicles that the passengers feel further back from the windshield. In addition, the end is rather anti-climatic, since the Ford Econoline van hardly suffers a fold in the nose after hitting the bridge on board at high speed (highly unlikely). They have made it a little more credible. And why do these films always take place during / after a prom? Is it about once you survive the graduation party, will you be good for life? More than anything else, it shows the lack of police surveillance for the liquor, and not keeping track of the MINORS who are leaving the dance for a joyful trip.
