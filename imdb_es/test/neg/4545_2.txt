As expected, there is a good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown despite dealing with the always popular premise of zombies and starring the queen of the 80s movie, Linda Blair, namely: sucks ! "The chill" is working tremendously? Too hard ?? to be a story with depth and concrete background, while it should have been a horror movie about frozen zombies. It takes an incredibly long time before something remotely interesting or significant happens. There is a lot of indifference about cryogenics, what I learned in my physics class is the study of the products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. So naturally, in this movie, a group of people is studying the behavior of human corpses when they are frozen. Needless to say, this is extremely boring, until two low-intensity night watchmen decide, during an electrical power failure, that it's a good idea to put cold cells built with metal out in the heights of a thunderstorm. The chillers are hit by lightning, obviously, and the bodies spontaneously thaw and come to live to attack a killer zombie. "The Chilling" is a horror film without gore and boring that surprises (for an effort at the end of the 80s, at least), that does not even consume a quarter of its potential. All the painful attempts to create an atmosphere of suspense and restlessness fail tremendously and I can not think of any reason why zombie attacks should be so bloody. Even in spite of the low budget available, they could have done better. The pieces, the makeup effects and the costumes are unfortunate. The research laboratory, for example, looks like an adequate apartment apartment, while the zombies could not be less threatening with their green faces and their suits wrapped in aluminum foil. How Linda Blair managed to get involved once again in such an embarrassing and low budget horror movie is a complete mystery. She is attracted to the lousy B movies, like bees are for honey.
