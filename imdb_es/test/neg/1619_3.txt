This might not have been as horribly bad as it was if it were not for the absolutely horrible acting job done by Raymond Wallace! This guy is so bad he was not even funny! His character was necessary in the movie, but the reason why they chose this guy surpasses me. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some quality Chinese films ... I would suggest "Raise the Red Lantern" ... "The Story of Qui Ju" ... "Red Sorghum" ...... < br /> <br /> Anything but this! I was surprised at how many people really qualified him! Really ... the performance of this loser of Wallace is so bad that it overshadows the other good parts of this movie. This was agreed by all 6 of us watching this movie last night! <br /> <br /> Stay away from this piece of garbage ........
