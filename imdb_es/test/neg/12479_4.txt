There are certain directors of terror for whom I have accumulated so much respect and admiration over the years that they can not disappoint me, since it matters what garbage they decide to film. Lucio Fulci is surely one of them, but damn, he's trying to disappoint me with his subsequent efforts! You can easily afford to skip most movies directed or produced by Fulci in the late '80s and simply watch "Cat in the Brain" instead, because that title brings together and repeats the best and most brilliant images of none other than SEVEN others. Fulci -flicks, including the most infamous murder sequences that appear in "When Alice Broke the Mirror". In general, this film is definitely among the weakest and most pointless achievements of our director. The script is incoherent as hell, the basic premise is totally implausible and somewhat stupid and there is absolutely no suspense to enjoy. I love the title, but it really does not make sense. There is a character named Alice in the story, but it is only a supporting role and certainly does not break any mirror. I suppose she could break things by simply using her voice, since she is an opera singer, but she does not. The plot revolves around a middle-aged playboy addicted to gambling who spends his days seducing wealthy widows and killing them for their money. Lester Parson kills the ladies (as well as the unpleasant witnesses) in frightening ways, makes steaks from the juiciest parts of his body and feeds the remains to his cat. There is also a silly psychological plot in which he believes that his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him. The difference between "When Alice broke the mirror" and some of Fulci's best horror films ("The Beyond", "City of the Living Dead", ???) lies in the fact that she does not bother to create a Horrible Environment The characters, including Lester, are colorless and boring and the murders are usually depicted, as if it were the most common thing in the world to put a woman's head in a microwave or run repeatedly over a human body with a car. The lighting is poor, the cinematography is super ugly, the clumsy and amateur edition and the acting performances are downright miserable, if I did not know, I think Lucio deliberately made a terrible movie to protest against everything hard, critics who do not like it his repertoire, no matter how much spirit and effort he has put in. The obvious element to enjoy here is simply outrage and bloodshed, because even the attempt to mix with the com Black edia does not work correctly. He swings his chainsaw and cuts the women's feet, "When Alicia broke the mirror" is a piece of entertainment of undemanding horror, but other than that, there is not much to recommend.
