I find it hard to find the words to explain how much I hated this movie. The historical judgment of Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and the Duc de Praslin is a tragic and compelling story that, I believe, had the potential to be a fantastic movie, but it failed. <br /> <br /> Although cinematography certainly had something to say for itself, in no way could it compensate for the terrible structure of the film, the badly written script and, above all, the horribly exaggerated characters. The worst of them were the children of Duc who were so extravagant and so falsely sick that it was almost painful to see them. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film left me only irritated and annoyed. deeply disappointed
