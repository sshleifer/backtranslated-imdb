Originally interpreted as a sequel to the series "The Slumber Party Massacre," this film falls flat on its face with a new title. First of all, if you are going to include the word "massacre" in the title of your movie, it is better that you comply. This certainly does not. There is no gore, there are no murders on the screen and there is no chainsaw, as the art of the box would make you believe. Instead, we have an exaggerated and exaggerated plot over a group of cheerleaders who are stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a soccer game, only to be fired one by one. Once again, this movie could have been fine if the gore ratio increased a bit. Why are the directors, especially those who make direct movies to videos, afraid to show that ANY blood is out of my reach? Now, I'm not a big fan of excess blood, but come on ... why would someone else rent a movie called "Slaughter of cheerleaders?" In addition to that problem, the film suffers from a cheap movie on a video camera. It seems cheap, it sounds cheap, and the actors are not so good. Try to deviate from the path of who can be the killer, but even that fails. The ending ends up being a ridiculous mess. Friends, if you run into this movie, go and look for the original "Sleepover Massacre". 2 out of 10
