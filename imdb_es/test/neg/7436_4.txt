The main problem with this movie is that you can not use Bill Murray in the best possible way, simply because of the co-star. <br /> <br /> If this was a road movie with another comedian. actor, it could work. Even if both tried to get the elephant across the country, at least it would allow them to share a fun dialogue. As it is, Murray is left talking to an elephant that can not respond with witty jokes. Essentially, it means that Murray is talking to himself, and this makes the movie more boring than it could have been if he had had another character to bounce with. <br /> <br /> Children would enjoy this movie, simply because of the Elephant, but anyone who wants to see the bite delivered by Bill Murray and enjoy an excellent script should look elsewhere.
