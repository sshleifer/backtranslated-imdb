As many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that I find amusing, this is not *: <br /> <br /> A MOVIE. (Strain the dramatic music) <br /> <br /> It's just a bad thing, it's good, totally surreal, Jackie Chan trick for all. The fighters are totally on top and Jackie definitely puts herself in her place. <br /> <br /> This is the movie you want to see with some good friends on Sunday afternoons, surrounded by sandwiches, ready to laugh out loud, encourage the good guys, boo the bad guys and scream continuously, " WHAT?" When something totally strange happens. Big fun!!
