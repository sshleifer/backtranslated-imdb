This film suffers from the fact that for years Hollywood had no idea how to package Jackie Chan for the masses. His low-budget films in Hong Kong were all exciting suspense films that highlighted his incredible gymnastic skills and his talent for light comedy. His first Hollywood films put him in the same films that were being packaged for Stallone or Chuck Norris. There is nothing about Chan's character in this film that requires the character to be Asian, unless he is the star. In his Hong Kong films, Chan is never boring, since the movies are a sequence of martial arts from one rapid fire to another, but "The Protector" does not have life completely. Danny Aiello does not have much to work with either, and the lack of chemistry between the two is probably more a result of the script and the direction than the way the two actors came together. Both have been better in worst movies. The best thing about the film is the configuration of Hong Kong. The worst part is the awful way that Jackie Chan becomes so colorless and monotonous. It would not be until the "Rumble in the Bronx" made in Canada that the west finally discovered how to make a good Jackie Chan movie.
