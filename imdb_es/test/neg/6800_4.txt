I would have liked this if I had not liked Diane Arbus. <br /> <br /> He did not really capture the unique visual aesthetic of Arbus (as Stanley Kubrick did in "The Shinning", with the twins in the hallway, a direct tribute to one of Arbus' most famous photos, and one with disturbing qualities that none of the images in this film have), and certainly none of their character (outgoing), likeness (thin and Jewish, not the wasp, Queen Kidman), or life, except for some very superficial similarities, she It was a fad that later photographed "freaks" and "strangers", among many things. This film focused on the "phenomenon", as its symbol for artistic and personal empowerment, in a really superficial and predictable way. Other than that, it could have been an interesting movie about the middle class fetish, but I was too upset to worry. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the name of Arbus had been omitted, this could have been less annoying, but if it did not have its name in the title, there would have been nothing that would make me interested in seeing this in the first place . A disappointment of "Secretary".
