This movie does not look like anything to City of God, you may have the same feeling, but it is not, there are no drug scenes or intense drug scenes, they give you an idea. If you ask me, I think this movie was a waste of time, there are many other films that give 100 times better sense and teaching than "Camera de madera". Yes, I could be the only one who gives a negative comment for this movie, but it is only in my opinion. It's one of those movies where I can have the feeling that they'll surprise me, but when the credits begin to play the role of my friends and we all look at each other, and we all laugh at how ridiculous this movie was. So to conclude this matter, I advise not to see it. <br /> <br /> Personal note: Making Africans speak English was a big mistake. In Ciudad de Dios they used their native language that gave the film much more power and reality.
