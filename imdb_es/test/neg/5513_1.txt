A Roger Corman scam came together for what seems to be a virtually nil budget. All the special effects were originally used in "Battle Beyond the Stars", and I suspect that a good amount of accessories, costumes and sets were also reused from other sources. The story seems to have been written around these elements, so this is not really a movie but a recycling project. The trash of "Star Wars" third category was not necessary now or now.
