Yes, the movie was that boring and insipid. After a certain point, I wanted the crocodile to eat these people just to be able to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is that three Australians go on a fishing trip down a river in a small boat, where the fishing guide girds a gun. He says he simply does it for insurance purposes, all the crocodiles have been hunted out of this river. Immediately it is eaten by a crocodile. Then, the trio is chased by a tree, being trapped by the reptile in its attempts to escape. They spend most of the movie arguing about the best way to escape. <br /> <br /> Predictably, the only survivor finds the guide's gun and shoots the crocodile. Aww, they killed the only nice character in the movie! <br /> <br /> Where are Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin when you really need them?
