I watched this movie preview before another thing I rented a while ago ... and it looked decent. I've seen some good things from the Full Moon video, and I thought it was worth trying ... Unfortunately, this was not good. <br /> <br /> The story is about a possessed bed. A couple moves into a new apartment, discovers the bed and strange things begin to happen. Strange things as the woman discovers perverted sex. And man discovers perverse sex. And the woman draws images of perverted sex. And the man photographs the perverted sex. And both begin to have dreams about dead people who have perverted sex. You would think that a movie with so much perverted sex would be good, right? <br /> <br /> Well ... No. The problem is that this is supposed to be a horror movie, or at least a thriller. , and it just does not deliver. There is little tension, there is no suspense, no fear. Apart from some worrying dreams and visions, there really is nothing that this couple should worry about. The whole movie is basically that the two have these visions and play in bed. Sure, you get a monsters fight in the end ... and some bloodshed ... but nothing spectacular ... There's only one murder and a good scare, and that's it. <br /> <br /> And the pervert, sex? Do not make illusions (or anything else). His idea of ​​perverted sex is a woman above, fully dressed, trying to strangle her partner with a tie. It's not exactly my idea of ​​a good time.
