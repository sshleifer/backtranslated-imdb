Skip this version of Hollywood, a real piece of junk. A cheap insult to the original brilliant "Spoorloos", or for the title in English also called "The Vanishing". The brand is completely lost in the typical and grotesque style of Hollywood, generally due to a group of talented corporate bean counters who do not have the vaguest idea of ​​anything artistic, they just look for the "successful formula" and want it to be applied to everything get a profit Like the horrible "The Scarlet Letter" made in 1995, which twisted the original story both to suit the crowd of MacDonaldsland, which became an aberration, not even in a bastardy, but in a lot of goop that has had a similar way. but it is not seen, it is felt, it does not even remotely resemble the spirit of the original. Except that at least that movie had Gary Oldman, which is interesting to see in everything he does. This dog has nothing in his favor, even the very talented Jeff Bridges is a shame. The great tragedy is not and never should be "the best movie of the year", but it takes one or more of the tragic events sadly too frequent in life and allows the reader / spectator to obtain a meaning and a vision of the human condition. br /> <br /> Do yourself a big favor if you're looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage and remove the original made in Dutch / French collaboration in 1988. That's a great movie. This is a horrible disaster.
