This movie was horrible and the only reason why it was done was because the story attracted the extreme left. I consider myself moderate, so I could see this movie as the pile of trash it was. While I'm not a fan of Bush, his dislike for GW is not enough reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the film was shot in a film of such low quality that it is presented as Cheap, instead of artistic. In addition, the characters lack serious depth. The character of Chris Cooper was a poor parody of George Bush; more suited to Saturday Night Live than a dramatic movie. The rest of the characters are walking cliches and poor facsimiles of other, much better movie characters. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs!
