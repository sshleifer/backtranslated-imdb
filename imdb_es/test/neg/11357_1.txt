If you want to waste a small part of your life, sit in front of this predictable zombie movie. Fail in the first post for not scary Or funny. It's a boring gray movie that I suppose went directly to the video. Hammy and tongue on the cheek act leaving a bitter taste in the mouth. If you want to see a recent poor but still visible zombie movie, look at The Diary of the Dead. Poor special effects, script at school level. Zombie movies work if they have a moral point or even a political point. This movie has nothing, there is no point worthy of being underlined by zombification. This is as exciting and convincing as a Republican convention, I do not regret that seeing the Republican convention is a better example of a Zombie movie.
