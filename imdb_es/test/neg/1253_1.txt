This film is a shameful result of what happens when: <br /> <br /> A) It is written, directed and produced by an idiot. and / or B) He rushed into production to quench the madness of poker / Stu Ungar. <br /> <br /> The story from the beginning is uneven. Vidmer spends too much time in Ungar's childhood and not enough in some of the legendary tales, such as card counting, his blackjack adventures, the money roll as id. It also leaves aside the mentions of other great poker players such as the reese chip, brunson, etc. The movie is a complete disaster from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> If you want a more complete and accurate account, read the book One of a Kind. If you thought the movie was good, read the book and change your mind.
