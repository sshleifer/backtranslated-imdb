I can not say if "The Cavern" is a scam of "The Cave" because I have not seen it. I've seen "The Descent" and that's not terrible, but it's very hard to see and so is this. Difficult to see, since there is very little light and a lot of fast action, so it is difficult to say what you are seeing. There are times when I guess you're supposed to be scared, judging by the music, but what fear? Bad camera work? Bad lighting? If that is the case, then it should be the most terrifying movie made. The story is that a group of cave explorers go to a cave in Kazakhstan (home of Borat) and descend, but something is (of course) there with them. And what is that? A man says that it is a wolf / bear hybrid, that is, just before it is destroyed, but whatever it is, you can not see it. And just when you think (or expect) that the movie is ending, since the screen darkens a bit, you see the two remaining cavers (the two women) awake somewhere in Betty and Wilma's outfit and start trying to get out there wherever they are. They drink some water and start to eat SOMETHING until they find out what it is and start vomiting ... and then the mystery of what's in the cave appears, and you'll be surprised. Maybe, maybe not. Dumb dumb fool ... I think I'm pretty good with cave movies at this point, 2 out of 10.
