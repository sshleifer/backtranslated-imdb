I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was an absolute disaster. You can really see that it was done at a good price. Badly written and with very bad performance. I have read several versions of the book by different authors and I also heard a version in the audiobook. We could not take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained. The experience of seeing this was like when Blair's witch visits Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy using a bed tray and actually show the contents of it. The witch throws the content on the child and the whole family laughs. I thought it was unpleasant and very strange. I really can not understand why anyone would think it would be entertaining. It shows another scene where Dr. Mize arrives and Betsy Bell is urinating on her dress on the steps of her house in front of her mother and her brothers. Instead of the mother taking it away, it is the brother. How sick The little boy in the first scene of the many scenes that deal with how his body discards waste, asks for toilet paper and goes to the house and makes these sick faces of joy have sound effects. I think they should have left all that out. The makeup on Reverend James Johnston as an older man does not really make you assume he was older. It made you think he was immersed in the fish mixture. The blood in Joshua Gardner when he falls off the ladder is even worse. The scene of John Bell's death seems to have come out of the flour and they tried to do something with it to make it look seriously ill. For me, such a sick comedy with bathroom issues and inexperienced people involved was the downfall of this image. These people would do better if they filmed commercials for local TV stations for bathroom products. They chose a good topic and could not produce it correctly. I rate this movie Capital F less.
