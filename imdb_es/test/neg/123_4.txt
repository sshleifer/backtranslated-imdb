First of all, let me say: if you have not enjoyed a Van Damme movie since bloodsport, you probably will not like this movie. It is possible that most of these films do not have the best arguments or the best actors, but I enjoy this type of films for what they are. This movie is much better than any of the films that the other action actors (Segal and Dolph) have thought about publishing in recent years. Van Damme is good in the movie, the movie is only worth seeing to fans of Van Damme. It's not as good as Wake of Death (which I highly recommend to someone like Van Damme) or In Hell but, in my opinion, it's worth seeing. It has the same kind of feeling that nowhere to run. Good fun things!
