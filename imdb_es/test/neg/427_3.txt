An American werewolf in London had some fun parts, but this one is not so good. The werewolves of the computer are simply horrible: the perspective is off, it's like seeing them through a distorted mirror. Writers tread the throat of many of their gags. An American boy says to a Parisian girl: "Is there a coffee here?" Instead of leaving it like that, they have to make the girl breathe and respond: "This is Paris."
