I was not impressed by Graffiti Artist, despite its artistic appeal (also known as low budget improvisation). There is little dialogue and, at least for me, I was disappointed that I did not give more credit or promote the work of guerrilla artists like these. Instead, it was a story that embraces family territory. Two guys who basically do little more than tag buildings become friends, tagging partners and, finally, experiment with a relationship. They seem opposite, quite uncomfortable together. Little is explained about his background and things between the two young people happen at great speed (although, I can understand this because they are only 70 minutes approximately). In recent years there have been innumerable diagrams and similar productions, to the point that the sphere of independent cinema is beginning to become saturated with this particular narrative just as the mainstream has become saturated with this and more. <br /> <br /> Much of the film can bore the viewer who needs an immediate dialogue and purpose. The main figure of this story (at least extensively), performs his routines almost without dialogue, without information, and nothing else to take the viewer. And, for a short film, I would have liked to have gotten to the point much faster. That, apart from the typical plot, bothered me. However, there was something about a momentary view of the daily habits of at least two graffiti artists, even if most of the time it was quite unoccupied. <br /> <br /> Recommended if you are tired of the usual garbage and gift Do not worry about an indie photo and have something of interest in this underground and urban art form. But, you really have to look at it for yourself, because it seems to be one with a more acquired taste. To see more recent independent films focusing on graffiti artists, check out Transit.
