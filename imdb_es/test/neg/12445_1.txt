This movie was terrible, not only was the plot weak, but the performance was incredibly bad and, sometimes, pathetic. Unrealistic dialogues in real life do not talk like that and there is no emotion or feeling in anything that is said to be very monotonous, except for the almost indistinguishable whisper that constantly occurs. Even the editing is bad the cuts are terrible. The work of the camera was sloppy and shaky in the close-ups, it even swings back and forth during the conversations. There is nothing positive about this film and George Katts has to be working on heavy machinery or anything else where he does not have to converse with other humans because he clearly does not know how to do it. How did this film win / be nominated for the awards, oh my God!
