I can not help being completely annoyed by this comedy. It's like they do not even bother trying to write a good comedy, just go over the jokes of third parties and wait for it to stick. The worst of all is that everything is so disinterested and lacking in everything. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, Kevin James has a permanent smug smile of "I'm so funny" on his face that it would be tolerable if only he had once served in the comedy department, which he does not, he just stays there doing nothing like a big, ungraceful baby. Which brings me to the relationship between the representation of Heffernan: easily the most insincere and poor of a married couple in any television show, really painful and unworthy. Remini passes the whole show as if it were a violent task to even be close to her own husband. Jerry Stiller pulling on the few laughs on the show is doing a 100% repeat of his role as Frank Costanza in Seinfeld, only this time his insinuations are focused on the water due to the inability of the central duo to recognize a joke, even if he was flying on his own. . The episodes simply drift into a current of nothing, their jobs do not add anything and their interaction is even worse. <br /> <br /> This is not even a waste of talent, there is no talent here, this is a creativity without laughter Desert.
