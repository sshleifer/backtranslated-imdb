"Do not be greedy" summarizes the depth of this film. All the rest of the nonsense is a big budget showcase. The film rotates through hiding the annoying ball and revealing too much. None of the potentially interesting plot tangents is developed, but the threshing is crushed and cut too much. <br /> <br /> The charm of DD, as others have pointed out, was in the device of schizophrenia, the humor woven into the fabric of the film, and most importantly, the acting. There is enough wood action in The Box to attract a giant mound of Martian termites. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the suspension of disbelief during this mess is the obvious question: "why is a technologically superior power capable of taking control? Does the government need to do some testing?" Fantastic failure from a movie.
