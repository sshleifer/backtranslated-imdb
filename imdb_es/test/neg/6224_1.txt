There is no better way to describe the HORRENDA experience than to observe Mamma Mia: Hitler must be looking up, telling the pseudo director Phyllida Lloyd 'You, monster, what have you done?' <br /> <br /> Everything about the movie is wrong? Only ?? Incorrect! Even its success, which is inexplicable. I can understand when those parodies movies, like Epic Movie, make their small part of the money and get profits just because they are cheap (of course they are!). But when something like Mamma Mia makes $ 450 million worldwide, you think "what the hell is wrong with the world?" <br /> <br /> And to think that we have Meryl Streep, one of the best living actresses in the world. , in that? What was she thinking? "I need the money," I could say. Well, then, sell one of your grandchildren, even that would be less embarrassing. It's not that Meryl is good at a disastrous "movie" piece. She is also disastrous! When he sings, even though he has the voice, it's ridiculous. Worse than his only Pierce Brosnan. I used to be James Bond. Now Abba is singing in a purple spandex during the credits of the worst movie in history. Really? And when I mention Abba, I have nothing against the band and their music. Although it does not help them when the actors start singing (bad), they dance (worse) and the extras join then (They come out of nowhere! Frequently!) To present a terrible musical sequence after the other. You want to cry when the music starts. And I love musicals! But this is the first in the genre where you PRAY for the real silence. <br /> <br /> I could keep going. The list is infinite. You can write a Stephen King novel with the complete list of errors in this movie. <br /> <br /> In summary: go see it. Really! You have to give testimony to understand! And since it is already a great success, who cares if you earn a few dollars more from you? And it is not pleasant that you sell your soul to the devil. Meryl did that before. For all humanity. And now the world must end, because we have committed the supreme evil and we must be destroyed.
