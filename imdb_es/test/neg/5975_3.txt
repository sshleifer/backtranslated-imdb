When the exploiters become evangelists, they still explode in the name of poverty! <br /> <br /> My first reaction after watching the movie is ?? God bless me because I'm not eating fish or any non-vegetarian product! <br /> <br /> The documentary is about Lake Victoria in Tanzania, where many varieties of enchanting fish used to live, and one day during the 1960s someone came and injected the powerful fish perch, which became the Exportable product for Tanzania in Europe and Japanese markets. The consequences were severe? First, all the small and large local fish were extinct; Secondly, the plane that came to fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial / business / capitalist sense, so it is full of weapons and ammunition (that is what Europe can give to this world); Third, pilots (like all migrants and the traveling population, like truck drivers) have to survive their sexual needs through the flourishing of local prostitutes from Africa for them; Fourth, brokers, dealers and brokers in the chain (mainly Indian entrepreneurs) get rich and the poverty of Tanzania remains the same; The fifth poverty takes children to crime, drugs, etc. <br /> <br /> The premise for making this documentary was excellent. But has director Hubert Sauper succeeded in making a good documentary? It is a great NO. <br /> <br /> I say the reasons: As in India, it requires a brahmin of higher caste to rise up and project to the world, Indian poverty and the untouchables; In the same way, it is required that a European documentary maker born in Austrain tell the world the history of Tanzania and its collapse and ruin, economy and poverty. It is the pathetic reason for the unconscious upbringing of that rich class (who has never seen poverty or who knows the poor), who survives, lives, wins and fame as the plague that clings to projecting poverty to the world as soon as they see her. There is nothing but contempt on the part of the poor of Africa and India who see images of their images. <br /> <br /> Hubert's intention and motives seem totally wrong. The images, characters, places, interviews are too serious and dark, dark and disturbing. He uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present his case. What we feel in the end is pity and sadness for the Africans. We also began to consider the Tanzanian government and people as villains. It may be that some Westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms find time to discuss and debate the pathetic living conditions of Africans, but there would be nothing more than that. <br /> <br /> Does the director refrain from showing up even once on the screen? not to be identified among the Europeans who exploit this poor country. <br /> <br /> This Hubert Director can only survive being exploiters like the media giants of CNN and BCC today. Hubert had no guts or common sense to talk to the Europeans who eat or the companies that import these fish products. An awkward effort totally clumsy! But I understand the reasons for the same ?? Hubert just wanted to earn his fame, sit down and smile with awards in his European comfort. <br /> <br /> There are no more words to spare for this pathetic effort. I doubtfully give the documentary a higher rating of 3.5 stars out of 10, just because the subject was correct; But it was pathetically exploited and dragged down by a poorly conceived amateur director and made exclusively for unintelligent Western audiences! (Stars 3.5 out of 10)
