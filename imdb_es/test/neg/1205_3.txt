I liked this movement when I was a child, but now that I'm older I can see how absurd the plot really is. In case you have not read the previous comments, it is a teenager and an Air Force Colonel who stole two fully charged F-16s to rescue the father of said teenager. <br /> <br /> It has some aerial acrobatics, even if the accompanying dialog box is basically teckno babel. <br /> <br /> A little involuntary humor in the version edited for TV. When the father of the hero is being held by Iran, I mean a country without a name, and his captors ask him for a confession (in relation to why they keep him, do not worry exactly why or why they want him to be confused). says "Tell him he can take my confession and push it in his throat". However, her lips and, most importantly, her gesture make clear what movement and part of the anatomy she was really thinking about.
