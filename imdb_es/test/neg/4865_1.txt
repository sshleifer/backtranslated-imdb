I still wonder why I sat through all this. I only had about 3 minutes of real entertainment, the rest was total boredom. The acting is not so good and the action scenes are so corny that they are not even funny. I wish I could say something good about this movie, but I can not think of anything at this time. There were probably some in it that some can enjoy, but its end must be the dumbest idea of ​​all. What kind of person would get a small remote-controlled helicopter with a gun burned in a machine gun to assassinate the President? This idea could never have been done in the first place, let alone have someone foolish enough to try. I suppose the writer must have been obsessed with the scene of the toy car in The Dead Pool, but he actually tried to make this look serious.
