This movie could have been much better than it was if it had not been a Disney movie. I thought that the young woman who was playing Shirley was fine, you could tell she was really trying to do the job well. The teenager Shirley Temple was not right at all. I think they should have spent the last time in their childhood, the first hour should have been about young Shirley, then the last hour should have been about Major Shirley. This was a boring movie, and not a good story of Shirley Temple.
