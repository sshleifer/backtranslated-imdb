Another gray, horrible havoc of the Corman family. The first space capsule in outer space lands again on Earth (with some of the worst special effects in history), and the pilot seems to be dead. But appearances can deceive. Actually, he is more alive than the rest of the cast, including a fatherly and misogynist doctor (who would also be really boring), a greasy guy who seems to have cornered the hair oil market, another bored guy who does not. even make a great impression, a scientist who never seems hurt or angry by the condescension of the old man, and a photographer with a haircut Farah Fawcett (before Farah, of course) and almost as much liveliness as a dead duck. <br /> <br /> What are the names of these people? I think it was Steve. Apparently, everyone in the cast, including the women, was called Steve. Anyway, the dead pilot Steve is not only alive, but he is incubating extraterrestrial babies (or sea horses, or shrimp, or whatever) inside his torso. The mother beast that implanted these little creatures looks like a giant, bald parrot with claws. Once again, I am impressed by the laughing ability factor of the monsters created by the House of Corman. The Venus space carrot in It Conquered the World is still officially the worst laughable monster I've seen on the screen, but the Cormans always deliver when it comes to bad looking and corny monsters. <br /> <br /> They also managed to deliver their other trademarks as well; that is, a boring and confusing plot, long and gray shots (thank God Corman made most of his films in black and white, since his color still looks gray) two or three places with accessories and stupid special effects and lame A lot of much boring dialogue. There are only two deaths in the movie (if you do not count the roasted parrot ... herr ... blood beast that is being released at the end of the movie). The screams were heard on the ground, I'm sure, when the alien tears off the old doctor's head and (apparently) eats it. Now you can speak in English and have the doctor's memories. You can also move the pregnant astronaut like Pinnochio. <br /> <br /> The apparent intention of the monster is to reconstruct his race using human beings as food and giant matrices. There is a bit of confusion at the end (well, more confusing than usual, anyway) in which the creature tries to explain why it is doing this, but it does not make any sense. Something about how humanity is about to follow in the footsteps of its race and destroy itself for something they will soon create. He never really said what that was. It could have been anything from roasting ovens to digital clocks, who knows. Your baby sitter stabs himself instead of letting the alien shrimp leave his body, and the greasy guy (and the other guy) burns the alien parrot with a Molotov cocktail. Ahh, the smell of roasted chicken ... er ... extraterrestrial. End of the story, in which the rest of the characters move away and leave their dead partner lying on the floor to rot. Oh, hell, why not save you the expense of a funeral? I'm sure that's what Corman thought, when he tried to cut corners and make his scenes as cheap as possible.
