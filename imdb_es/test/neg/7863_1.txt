This movie is so bad that it really gets fun. One of the worst movies I've seen in my entire life. The funny thing was that the trailer had scenes that were not in the movie. Just seeing the trailer would have saved a lot of time. Actually, it showed everything that happened in the film, except the conclusion, and that was also very obvious. <br /> <br /> Honestly, it's hard to think of a reason why this movie was made. This is so bad Horrible. <br /> <br /> I would give it 0 out of 10 if that were possible. There is nothing more to say about this movie.
