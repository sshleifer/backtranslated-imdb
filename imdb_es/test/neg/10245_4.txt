I've seen worse movies. This is bad, but at least it does not try to be good, so it deserves a brief applause. Rest firmly in the realms of the low-budget B movie sci-fi genre. <br /> <br /> It's a trash movie but in a nice way and it's definitely worth buying if it's in the bargain bin of your property. Local supermarket Very charming instead of just horrible. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me is when Galaxina's lover is going to rescue her. When she appears she exclaims "Bunnyfluff!" what attracts his co-pilot's giggles. <br /> <br /> Sit, get drunk, enjoy!
