This takes place on Fire Island in the 1970s. A couple Peter (Craig Dudley) and Buddy (J. Will Deane) are hosting a party on July 4 at their home. Unfortunately, their relationship is falling apart and they have to prepare for a house full of very strange guests. The rest of the film tells the party and what happens between Peter and Buddy. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm a gay man but I was 8 years ago when this was done. If this is a true vision of what gay life was like in the 1970s, I'm glad I'm not around. From the disconcerting opening credits that show children playing in the sand (???) this film slowly slides into disaster. There is a guru (Robert Case) who talks non-stop about nothing of importance. I wanted to choke the boy halfway in his first long speech. There's young Danny, who is there for the first time. There's the lesbian couple (they do not do anything, except a strip without a reason). There's the leather queen. Worst of all is the effeminate man named Jimmy (Jimmy Foster). They introduce us to him and his friend (whose name I never got) when they have a puncture. Basically, they scream and shriek for 10 minutes and have no idea how to fix a floor. I know some people find it funny, but I found it offensive and quite sad. The party itself is full of people you would never want to meet. It's like being abandoned at a party full of bad actors who play nasty people. With the sole exception of Dudley, no one can act. <br /> <br /> This can be valuable as a portrait of what Fire Island was in the 1970s ... but it's pretty boring to see it. This gets a 2 only for the frequent male nudity of some very beautiful bodies.
