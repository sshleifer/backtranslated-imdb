I knew it had a LONG duration of 90 minutes when the opening voice mispronounced the word "scarecrow" (it sounded like Scare Crew). And indeed, 90 minutes later, after witnessing beyond a horrible performance, a tedious drama, the scarecrow's blows do not come close to their intended purpose, but "hit" anyway, Ken Shamrock "acts" and the The most stupid illogical ending I've seen in My life (Ok, no, I'll take that last lap, in about a week). After going through all that, I cried openly for not being able to go to Lacuna to Jim Carrey and erase it completely from my mind. Any thoughts I may have had about the fact that Director Brian Katkin could have made a good movie given the right circumstances I had after watching "Slaughter Studios", has completely and completely gone from my mind now. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Tara Platt and Lisa Robert topless <br /> <br /> Where did I see it: Starz on Demand (available until the 22nd of September 2005)
