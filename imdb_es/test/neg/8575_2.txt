Normally I do not like to comment on acting in a movie, because it is the only thing that people who have an agenda against a film will pursue. In this movie, I'll make an exception. The performance in this movie is below the average in general. I mean half the movie, I wonder how the hell the producer and / or the director manage to choose a set of people who can not act. Although the value of the production was good, the badly written story was combined with the poor performance of the actors, and there are even half attempts to twist the end of the film, which is quite confusing. Are all Spanish horror films so disappointing?
