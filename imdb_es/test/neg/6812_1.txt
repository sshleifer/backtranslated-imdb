Did you ever have one of those nights when you could not sleep and just turned on the tube to see what was going on? That's how I came across this gut. For me, it would have been better for me to throw and spin during the 97 minutes that I wasted with this movie. <br /> <br /> In their attempt to "be real," the characters in this film break away from the stereotypes of gangsta that the story should have been the premise of a film by brothers Wayans. The dialogue? Please! It sounded like a white man was trying too hard to write this movie. <br /> <br /> The edition was horrible. One of my "favorite" scenes involved a car chasing a lot of narrow alleys. However, turn to the chased characters and drive through a park with baseball fields in the background. <br /> <br /> When any of our "homies" is shot in this movie, it miraculously bleeds through the clothes. They have no holes, which is more than I can say for the plot of this predictable load of ... baking soda. <br /> <br /> Independent films can be excellent, even if they are low in budget and effects, but still need to have some cinematic integrity. If I could have given him a 0, I would. If you see it, I hope it's on the wire, because even the cheapest rent would be too expensive. Actually, 97 minutes was too much to pay ...
