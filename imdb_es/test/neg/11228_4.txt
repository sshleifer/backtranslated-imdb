"Crimes of Passion" is a film that is disappointing in most cases. Where should I start? The plot? It is desperately simplistic and full of loopholes. The direction? Remember a cheap B movie. The acting? John Laughlin is absolutely terrible in his role as "well-intentioned wife of a frozen wife" Bobby, Annie Pots is not convincing as a "frozen wife" Amy, and is only Kathleen Turner (above average), and Antony Perkins (excellent ) that obtains acceptable performance marks. More specifically, Antony Perkins offers a great performance as perverted Reverend Peter Shayne, while Turner manages to play the roles of the sexy China Blue and the fragile Joanna Crane satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the performances of Turner and Perkins are only insufficient to help the film have a rating higher than 4/10. See if you want to see Turner in some sensational scenes (although even in this account, the movie can be easily combined with his competition: "Basic instinct", for example, avoids).
