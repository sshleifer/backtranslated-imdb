If you read the book before watching the movie, you may feel disappointed like me. The book was great and, after watching the preview of the film, I was sure that the film would also be great, however, I felt I was watching a movie in which the director and the cast did not even read how these characters were . The film is short and never really make us feel that these people were really in love and felt like unique couples. Even if the film was not going in the same direction as the book, at least they could make the romance between these two characters feel more intense. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry, however, they just did not develop a story long enough for us to see how they craved each other. The book was a true love story and I think this movie could have been much better.
