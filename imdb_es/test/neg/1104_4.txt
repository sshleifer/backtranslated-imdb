J.S. Cardone directed a little known 'Nasty Video' in 1982 called "The Slayer" and has since participated in a handful of films; Including the garbage from the 2001 vampire movie The Forsaken. His latest feature film, Wicked Little Things, presents a decent-sounding plot as well as a spooky-looking poster that seems to remind me that it emerged a couple of years ago in connection with a film that Tobe Hooper was to direct. Well, I guess he felt that this was too similar to his stupid zombie mushroom movie 'Mortuary' and that's why he rejected it. I do not blame him either. The plot centers on a mother and her two daughters who move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband. However, what they do not realize is that about a hundred years before; A group of children who were being used as miners were trapped in an extraction well. Naturally, that is not the end of them and they managed to survive their terrible experience and now they roam the area in search of revenge. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a collection of clich√©s; of the smallest child with an "imaginary friend", the mother who rejects him and all the usual garbage of zombies. J.S. Cardone tries to make the terror fans come back to side with the blows and the bloody scenes (mostly with children) but it's not enough. The story does not work very well either and it really reminded me too much of the previous Mortuary, and that's not a good thing (although Mortuary is actually a better movie than this one). Acting is nothing special; Lori Heuring has a decent appearance, as does the eldest daughter Scout Taylor-Compton; but none manages to provide an interesting performance. Chloe Moretz is a little better than the usual childhood actor. The plot is hardly credible and, in fact, the script can not even bother to explain the reasons why children attack the premises. It all comes down to a typical and quite boring ending and, in general, I have to say that if you know your horror movies, you can skip this one.
