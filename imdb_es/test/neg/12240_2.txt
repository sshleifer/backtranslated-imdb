The Comebacks is a parody of sports-inspired movies, and let me tell you that it's not a good one. Tom Brady (the director) probably found it funny to make reference to sports films (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! To The Longest Yard and Dodgeball, yes, Dodgeball!) And throwing a couple of jokes about sex would be what more fun since then. Airplane! Well, I was wrong. They did such a sloppy job, you thought it was written in a week. I have found that if a director loves the genre, the movie will be good. Obviously, Brady does not love the genre he is cheating. This movie is a piece of stale trash that is not worth seeing, so do not watch it!
