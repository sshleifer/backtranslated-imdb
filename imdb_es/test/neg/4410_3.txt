** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> A lucky South Sea Islander is executed by other natives (Caucasian-looking) after he befriends visiting scientists Tod Andrews and Tina Carver. The meddlesome scientists look for it and discover that it has taken the form of a humanoid tree. He comes alive and becomes enraged, and of course, this character of the fifties, the atomic bomb, is blamed for this aberration. Affirm that this particular monster walks as if it had a stick up, its a ** would be redundant. Suffice it to say that the creature continues to advance, like the movie itself, throwing its enemies into a quick sand practice and giving the main characters one more thing to make stupid comments. Paul Blaisdell created the man-tree suit and it's not his best work. Over the years, this film has been the subject of many comments such as "Hell can go!" Personally, I think it's the best movie of walking trees I've seen in my life.
