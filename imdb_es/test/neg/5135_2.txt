Yes, I got to the end. Although it was quite difficult. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wondered if there was even a director on the set. Acting ... well, I do not even know what to say. I thought that the girl who played Emily did everything possible with the boring dialogue, sometimes crazy and predictable. <br /> <br /> I know it was low budget, but the hollow sound and lighting unfortunately made it look like a 100-minute audition tape. <br /> <br /> I'm not even going to talk about the ending ... <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie was the music. <br /> <br /> That being said, I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Even for lesbians who do not have many movies to watch in general, this is nothing to waste time. If you're looking for a sad lesbian-themed movie, check out The Children's Hour, Lost and Delirious or High Art. Everyone will leave you depressed and grim, but you will not have to suffer a cinematic inferno in the process.
