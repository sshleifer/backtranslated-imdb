This was the most disinterested horror movie I've seen to date. The premise is clearly forgotten after approximately 1 minute. The acting is terrible. The most frightening thing about this movie is when the two boys kiss, how disgusting! What were the judges of the film festival thinking when they gave this garbage a 'best movie' notation? The only reasons I did not deactivate this movie were to see what NOT to do as a filmmaker, and if the plot line as thin as paper could really continue as it is. I was not disappointed by this last idea. There was not even a bit of nudity or gore to keep the kids interested! Also, I thought it was in bad taste to use about 3 minutes of "Resident Evil 2" in the movie ... Was that supposed to fill? Because it was the biggest and most interesting part of the movie.
