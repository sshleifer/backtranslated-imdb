When you make a movie with a premise of murderous children, there are two effective ways to approach it; can make it as realistic as possible, creating credible characters and situations, or make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs (something that the creators of "Silent Night, Deadly Night" did, for example, in an equally controversial Subject: a murderer of The people who made "Bloody Birthday," however, do not do any of those things, they simply rely on the shock value of a child's image with a gun (or a knife, a rope, or an arrow) on The result is both offensive and stupid The whole movie seems like a bad idea that hastened through the production (and then kept it up for several years) It is redeemed a little by the good performances of the children, but it is VERY careless.
