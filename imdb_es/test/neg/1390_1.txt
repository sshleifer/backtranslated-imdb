This is a great example of what happened on Comedy Central after Dave Chapelle left. Here is the problem with Carlos Mencia. First, his birth name is Ned Holness, and it was known that until he was 18, when he changed his name to Ned Arnel Mencia. He was born in Honduras, although he acts as if he were from Mexico. He also grew up in the United States. <br /> <br /> You may be able to forgive all that shit, but ... <br /> <br /> has been caught stealing other people's material. Joe Rogan has been his most vocal critic in this way. The Stereotype Olympics was an idea that stole a couple of DJ's from Miami. He has stolen jokes from Bill Cosby. He stole George Lopez's material on his own HBO special (13 minutes). He thinks what he's doing is so original, but Dave Chapelle and Lisa Lampanelli have been fighting the race for years before this idiot (among others). <br /> <br /> This program will crash and burn. The word Beaner can not last long before getting old. He has not done anything new since the first episode. <br /> <br /> "Do you want to hear a joke? A Beaner jumping a fence! It's funny for 3 Seasons!" No. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
