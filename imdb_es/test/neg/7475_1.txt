When the opening shot is the United States Marine Corps that does not respect the US flag. UU., A movie has a difficult road ahead, but unfortunately it was downhill from there. There is an accredited military advisor, who apparently is also a retired US Marine, which makes it even more disconcerting that this incredible infraction of the protocol and the law have gone unnoticed. Even more disconcerting is the way they simply overlooked how a marine is reported as KIA, then buried, in a very short time, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or if there was even a body. The government of the United States continues to find what is missing in World War II, and it has taken months to identify the remains. The downed soldiers remain MIA for months or years and only declare KIA when the remains have been positively identified, or after years of bureaucracy. Here we are expected to believe that it happens in a matter of days or weeks. Maybe this happens in Denmark, but not in the United States. Clearly, none of the people involved has had the least involvement or respect for the United States Army. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, there are a number of other completely Moments of laughter when the characters come with zingers out of the blue. There must have been really extensive meetings between the author and the actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such nonsense. Having a script that worked could have helped, but this seems to have been invented in the place, working from Cliffs Notes. There is no way to know if the script was so horrible originally, or if it was the author, or the middle management guys in the studio who are responsible. Either way, this is a horrible movie that should never have been made.
