Without really revealing my age, I saw this for the first time more than 20 years ago when it first came out on video (maybe it was a beta tape?) And I was old enough to drink (barely) and maybe I had had Unos Few because I remember thinking how great this movie was! Since then I've seen him sober and I have to admit that it's a pretty bad movie. As mentioned in other publications, the plot is absolutely ridiculous and the bad performance makes it worse. It's a bad attempt to fantasize that teenagers can also be "Mavericks" (although I'm surprised to find that they would actually launch at the same time (approx.) As "Top Gun", and that it's not really meant to be a bad imitation ...) But, in spite of everything, it's worth seeing if it's on and I have time. It's one of those movies you see because it's so ridiculous and it's desperately trying to be taken seriously. Like that other "great" movie: "Moment by moment" with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin ... Do not make me talk about that!
