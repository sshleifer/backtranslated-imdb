This is the first porn I've tried to review. It requires a different approach than usual, since allegory will not reward dissection. "I'm American, I'm a prudish virgin." "We are Europeans, we are educated and we are crazy about sex." "It's good when we all get screwed." A lot to talk about! Well, in fact, in some way, it's relative to your average topless volleyball number of 60 years. And the 'class' enervating patina at least offers clean and detailed compositions. But what the hell is that to say about a porn? Well, then: the only scene in which I really (rhetorically) left was the first time that Brigitte Maier intervenes. There are efforts to launch a good variety of races and ages without leaving two men close to each other; the only black man suffers a premature editorial attack coitus interruptus. And several shots or not, an act perhaps indescribable in IMDb seems that it was partially simulated by a surgical hose. Still, I stayed awake, and it was eight o'clock in the morning ... but what does the last shot mean ?!
