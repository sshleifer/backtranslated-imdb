Hollywood has made many strange movies over the years, but nothing is more strange than this. I will never know why this movie was made, nor how Paramount could have thought it would sell tickets in 1947. It's the weirdest mix of genres I've seen in a long time, a movie that really does not know if it's trying. to be a serious war drama or a Viennese operetta comedy. <br /> <br /> Tell the story of a British spy trying to get a poisonous gas formula from Germany in the days just before the start of World War II. Ray Milland, a good actor, is stuck playing the role as a fugitive Monty Python, a very exaggerated dialogue of preparation for the English school. In Germany he meets a gypsy, Marlene Dietrich, who helps her travel under cover as, of course, another gypsy. She plays her role as the typical gypsy caricature of the Viennese operetta, as well as the other "gypsies" of the film. But there are also Nazis, who are not funny at all. And then Milland discovers that he is starting to think like a gypsy, and that is not treated as a joke. Sometimes music is for a light comedy, sometimes for a drama. Every time the Nazis appear, the film's score shows Wagner, which is fun by itself. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a comedy, or it could have taken seriously the plight of the gypsies and have done a serious job of showing how the Nazis treated them. Both are hinted at in this movie, but none of them pursue. What we have left is a really strange mix of genres that should have embarrassed everyone (except the director) involved. <br /> <br /> Bizarro.
