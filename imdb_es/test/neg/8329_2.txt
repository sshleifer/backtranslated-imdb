You would think that a movie about incestuous sisters who eventually murdered their employer could not be more than exciting, but then you would be wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no argument. There is no development of the character. There is no redeeming visual beauty. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of time. The exploration of how the relationship develops between the sisters is null, their sexuality is never anything other than grotesque, class relations are overlooked, and the employer is a silly caricature. not equal depth of meaning.
