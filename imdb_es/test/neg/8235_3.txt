Luther the Geek (1990) is a boring horror movie and is really bad even by Troma standards. It is a monster that bites the heads of chickens, and kills people by biting their necks, and actually believes that he himself is a chicken! Luther leaves prison after 25 years because he has apparently been a "model" prisoner and deserves another chance in life (which is VERY hard to believe after seeing how he acts and treats people throughout the film) . <br /> <br /> After killing an old woman in a supermarket parking lot, she manages to sneak into a woman's car, and proceeds to torture her, her daughter and the daughter's boyfriend in the house of his family in the country. <br /> <br /> Then they invite us to a long and boring movie, with a horrible performance, before a useless policeman appears to try to kill Luther once and for all! Oh, and the movie has a ridiculous and ridiculous ending too !!! I love low-budget horror films and I think "The Toxic Avenger" is an all-time classic, but I'm afraid that Luther, the Geek, is simply boring, illogical and boring, not too much in the way of blood , just a few bloody neck pains and that's it! 3/10
