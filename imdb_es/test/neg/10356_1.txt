I am a fan of this overall excellent show, although sometimes quite boring, but season 3 has taken some terrible directions from the plot. The HERO episode is an example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> The story as it unravels is that the Cylons deliberately allow Bulldog, a pilot captured several years earlier during a black operations mission, to escape, steal a sail on cylon and return to the galactica . The plan is that when Bulldog returns, he will realize that Adama left him to his fate and he will be so enraged that he will kill Adama, which he almost does. <br /> <br /> Now the problem is this: the Cylons installed it so that Bulldog thinks he ran away alone. This means that Bulldog gets off the Cylon ship without help. So he kills a Cylon and leaves his cell, that's what we see. Then, we must suppose that he walks towards the flight hangar, manages to enter a Cylon combat ship and learn how to operate it, take off and fly back to Galactica. A) Yes. <br /> <br /> Now, Starbuck managed to get one of them to work in Season One, which was hardly believable in itself, but she only had to fly it out of orbit before making contact with the Galactica. Bulldog has to program his ship to make several jumps through hyperspace and manage to reach Galactica somewhere thousands of light years away in an unknown direction. How do you manage to program a ship that contains completely foreign technology? The cylons connect to their computers to the touch, there are no visual consoles or keyboards. And having achieved that miraculous feat, how do you know then where is the Galactica, considering that the Galactica took off about 3 years ago and is trying to evade the Cylons since then, does not leave the beacons behind? Even allowing the suspension of disbelief that should apply to any science fiction program, this episode still does not make any sense.
