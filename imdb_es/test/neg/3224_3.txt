This movie could be o.k. If it were not for all the language in it. I think the story itself is not bad, but I would be too embarrassed to let my wife or my children watch the movie. I know that children will learn all the bad words on the road over time, that's true, but parents should not help them in the process by letting them see and hear things in the form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I Used to be like Robert Loggia; It has a harsh and distinctive quality with that harsh voice, but in recent years, all I've seen are roles with a lot of language in them. If we had a prize for the excessive use of the word F, it would have to be a contender. Unfortunately, I think that now he has lost me as a fan. When I see his name in the movies in the future, I'll think twice before choosing that title. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not a whim. I also use language sometimes, in extreme circumstances, but when we are watching a movie it is for the sake of E N T E R I N M E N T E E, something that we hope will bring us some joy and escapism. I do not want to be reminded of what is happening on the streets of big cities these days, and it's a nuisance to have to wonder if a movie is okay for my family to see. <br /> <br /> I also like Matt Modine, but it is a pity that he has associated himself with an image that has left his image in this way. He probably made an o.k. I work in the movie, but I turned off about 1/4 of the way after being assaulted once by the others in the cast. Why can not these actors simply say no when these scripts ask them to continue with this gutter language? Once there are enough actors (especially the big names), fuss about it, the writers will stop putting it in the movies! <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I can not recommend this photo. It's also a shame, because I think it probably would have been fine, if it had been done well enough for decent families to see it! Thank God I just wasted $ 2.00 on it!
