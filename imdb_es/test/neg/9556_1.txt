I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I had fallen asleep. The story line was very thin and the editing team did everything possible to lengthen it as long as they did. <br /> <br /> Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such an unpleasant character that I found it difficult to be. Support from him. Andy's acting ability is good, but not enough to make up for the poor writing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell did a good job with her interpretation of Linda's romantic interest, Gary. I can not say anything bad about Andie, I always enjoy her performance. The problem here is that the romance between Andy and Andie is crazy and incredible. The two do not make a good pair on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was almost as disappointing as the film itself. A nod from the Pope and everything is forgiven, come on. The event that allows this movie to have a happy ending and that the writers expect us to accept is pathetic. Gary does not change and only by the death of a dear friend does his situation improve. <br /> <br /> There are many great movies that should be seen before this one. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br />
