**** SPOILER ALERT **** My boyfriend, some friends and I rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies. We knew what we were getting into. But the lack of plot, direction and special effects really left us with the hope of a great (or passable) fight scene between the two main characters ... the badly represented cobra swimmer and the super violent giant Komodo (who ate to people like pickled ice) cream) ... we got this in the end, but did we have to be interrupted due to possible budgets or time constraints? Its only quality is that it is ridiculously bad, with many details highlighted by other readers. I recommend this movie if you like to cut onions to make you cry.
