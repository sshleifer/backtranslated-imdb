Even though "The House of Adam" is destined to be a conventional gay movie; Anthony (John Shaw), who is curious gay and a great cutie-hunk and Adam (Jared Cadwell) who is openly gay, and a close second in appearance; that there is a whole minute of wonderful, compelling and naked lovemaking (sorry, there is nothing frontal) between Anthony and Adam at 41 minutes of the movie (that alone can be enough for many of us), despite everything that (to which I give a thumbs up), "The House of Adam" is a horrible movie of most film making standards. A big thumb down. <br /> <br /> The acting skills of Shaw and Cadwell are either smothered or suffer from bad script, direction and editing, or rather lack thereof. However, his lovemaking scene is convincing and may have more to do with the fact of being involved with each other, considering the rest of his scripts and his performance. <br /> <br /> The self-congratulation of writer and director Jorge Amer (bonus feature) Regarding his filmmaking skills, he is out of control. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the script and the lack of it is a thumbs down. In general, acting is thumbs down with only the slightest exception for Shaw and Cadwell. Alexis Karriker as Nina could have been the best, except for the limitations expressed above. By far, the worst, and unbearable, was the performance of Thomas Michael Kappier as Albert Ross, the father of Anthony who does not even have the quality of acting in elementary school. He really represents a colossal distribution failure. <br /> <br /> The actors who play the new cottage owners are also worthy of really bad acting nominations. <br /> <br /> If only the production, editing and post-production If they were as good as the trailer, this movie would have been something else. The trailer presents, first, clips of scenes that led me to rent the movie. That, and the hope that this film focused on gay, supposedly was played and promoted in gay film festivals. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is a big thumbs down. <br /> <br /> Is it worth buying / renting and seeing it? Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the nude love scene, and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam. Or if you really enjoy watching bad movies.
