This movie is a mediocre and low budget movie. I've seen it much worse in MST3K, let me assure you, but this is still a pretty horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about Clonus, a top secret government facility in which clones are used to give organs to politicians. In reality, it is an almost Orwellian society: almost (but not entirely) effective. <br /> <br /> The film begins to roll downhill when the main clone (Tim Connely of 'Emergency' fame) falls in love with a female clone (Paulette Breen, who appeared in this and most of the four other films {and this was not his first film}). They begin to suspect something. After finding a can of beer in the nearby river, the plot begins to fall apart. The clone does not receive answers from the chief scientist (Dick Sargent from 'Bewitched') or the 'Confessional', a computer that supposedly knows everything, so it bursts into the main Clonus building and (in a scene hilariously destroyed by Mike and the Bots) discovers the truth (including a cloning video that, mysteriously, shows exactly the same method that was used to clone Dolly five years ago ... and this movie was made more than twenty years ago ...) on Clonus . He is released, pursued by two guards. He has a hell of a time breaking the two-foot-high fences, although he has a considerably harder time climbing some rocks. From there it keeps sliding. Also appearing are Peter Graves ("Beginning of the End", "It Conquered The World") as presidential candidate and Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "Piranha", "Once Upon a Time in the West") and Lurleen. Tuttle (`Ma Barker's Killer Brood ',` Psycho') as the elderly couple who help Clony after he runs away. <br /> <br /> The MST3K version is priceless; One of the best episodes in history. <br /> <br /> Four stars for the movie; 10 for the MST3K version.
