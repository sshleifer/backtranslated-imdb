I was so eager to see the documentary self-immolation of the intellectual author of Boondock Saints, one of the most aggravating and useless films I've seen in my life. But the creators of "Overnight" - friends (ex?) Of the brain in question - also need to learn to make a movie. Several unpleasant comments, screaming obscenities on the phone and enjoying his alcohol make Duffy look like a putz. But it does not yield any idea of ​​why man got a contract in the first place, what is his creative process or vision. What is Boondock Saints about? How hard is it to meet Patrick Swayze? What are these strange institutional machinations in which they trap our disgusting heroes? Because the film does not try to answer these questions consistently, it does not end up having anything to say about Hollywood either. So who cares?
