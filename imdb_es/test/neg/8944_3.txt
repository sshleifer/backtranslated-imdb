Early talkie feature based on a popular play. A murder has been committed and many people hire a medium to hold a session to see who the killer is. While the lights are off, there is ANOTHER murder ... so there is someone in that room. <br /> <br /> What follows is an obvious, boring and squeaky murder mystery. The majority of the cast is overacting to a ridiculous degree. They act as if they were on stage (where you have to exaggerate things) and it seems ridiculous on the screen. The most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before "Dracula") who REALLY exceeds himself as a police inspector. The static direction of Tod Browning (which was always overrated) does not help. <br /> <br /> Only for the Browning and Lugosi finalists. I give it a 3.
