When I saw this kind of movie, I realized that I do not like them very much. Caged Women is another film of 'women in prison', and like most of the rest of the genre; The plot is completely abandoned in favor of simply showing nude women. Now do not get me wrong; I love naked women, but I also like that there is some kind of plot thread that goes with nudity, and how this film has only the basic theme of "women are in prison" that extends through it ( also as the essential escape, of course)), I got bored a little before the end. The film is good because there is hardly a time when women wear clothes, but that is the only positive element. The director (and writer, ha ha) Erwin C. Dietrich delights in showing the close-ups of the nude female body, but it is never very erotic. The director was the producer of several garbage films, including some directed by Jess Franco. In my opinion, he should devote himself to production since his writing talents do not exist, and he does not seem to know how to film a sex scene. This type of material is quite dry most of the time, but I think Franco could have taken advantage of it more. In general, this might be enough for people who are really interested in this kind of thing; But I can not say that I enjoyed it.
