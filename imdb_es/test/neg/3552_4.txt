A plot that is more foolish than belief However, having said that, it must be admitted that the main actors play their roles as if it were Shakespeare. And that is how it should be. It is not his fault that the writer seems to be in a coma. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to what is really a very clever performance by Joanna Kerns. She shows that the fact that she is not on the page does not mean that she can not be taken and assume a role. And she does it with pleasure. Good for her. <br /> <br /> The same goes for Christine Elise, who is called to be little more than confused and tearful, but goes far beyond what the script asks her to do. <br /> <br /> And to Grant Show too. A graduate of primetime and prime-time soap (Ryan's Hope, Melrose Place). It is always versatile and underestimated. Its main drawback seems to be its impossible aspect to ignore. He is a robust and well-informed actor, capable of much more than what he is usually given the opportunity to do. <br /> <br /> The rest of the deal is basically a showcase. <br /> <br /> The address is adequate and the script, as I mentioned, is quite idiotic. <br /> <br /> Look at this to enjoy three good actors on the tracks and delights in performing some much needed stage massages. It's fun.
