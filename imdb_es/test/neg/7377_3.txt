This show has been performed live throughout the country with a variety of models. I saw it for the first time in Provincetown production the first summer that was in P-town (2001), before, curiously, it was banned in that overwhelmingly gay center (the codes that resulted in its closure have already been modified). I saw him again later on the off-Broadway, a long-running production in New York. Oddly enough, the production of P-town was much better than that of New York, fresher, more beautiful, more animated and more fun, but that was only in 2001; The later attempts to clone the production ("Bare Naked Lads" in 2007) were definitely of third category. This filmed production features a production cast by Los Angelos and, as other commentaries have suggested, is not the best. I would classify it somewhere between the first-class P-town 2001 production and the third-category P-town "Bare Naked Lads" show last summer.
