As bad as they are. This film makes the fatal mistake of making the viewer not care what happens with the characters. The two women in this movie are so stupid that you start encouraging the bad guys, so this would end. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few that was so bad that I had to resort to another channel. <br /> <br /> Put in intellectual language, this movie lacks plausibility. The people, not even the people of Ohio, just do not act like that. Well, maybe the writers do. <br /> <br /> There is not enough beer in the world to make this film bearable. <br /> <br /> F903
