A man kicks a dog 2 'in the air. <br /> <br /> A woman kicks a cow out of her bed. <br /> <br /> A man kicks a violin on the sidewalk. <br /> <br /> A woman sucks a statue's finger for 15 seconds. <br /> <br /> A man kicks a blind man in the stomach. <br /> <br /> Jesus rapes a girl. <br /> <br /> There you have it. I just saved you an hour of your life. Surely there are those who could appeal to this "surprising vanguard of cinematographic expression". But it did not seem different to the puerile and disconnected videos I used to shoot with my friends in the ninth grade. Except that we never had a real cow. <br /> <br /> Having heard endless sermons from the connoisseurs of the art of stroking the beard of how this is such an important film, I thought it would be worth it. Do not make mistakes, this is crap. If I hear that one more person calls Buñuel the "father of film surrealism," I think I'm going to hit someone. In any case, he took a big step backwards from the surrealist beginnings initiated by his superiors Fritz Lang (Metropolis), F.W. Murnau (Faust) and Robert Weine (Caligari) 10 years before. This made a joke about the whole thing, as if Buñuel did not have the confidence to truly embrace art without sarcasm, without sabsurdité. It would take Buñuel another 40 years before he refined his style and turned it into something admirable. Skip the first things and jump directly to 1970 if you want to be more impressed with your work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you would agree. In 1977, Buñuel himself declared that he would happily burn all the impressions of his old films. In this case, I would love to pour the lighter fluid.
