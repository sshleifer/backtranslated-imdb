Since finishing the book, `Mrs. Dalloway ', by Virginia Woolf, was excited to see that she was in one of the movie channels last weekend. What I found, however, is a movie that was boring, incomprehensible and meaningless. One can not blame the film completely, he did the best he could with the material he had, but when the original material is Virginia Woolf, and is almost completely written in a current style of consciousness with long periods of internalization and little dialogue real. one would certainly think that there should not be a movie made just because a movie can be made from it. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the title character, does not deserve any blame for the failure of this film, nor any of the other actors. It is simply a film that could not be made intelligible from the story that Woolfe wrote, and that should not even have been attempted. Do not watch the movie, read the book. <br /> <br /> - Shelly
