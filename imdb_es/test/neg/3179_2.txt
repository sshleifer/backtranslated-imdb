I like Wes Studi and especially Adam Beach, but whoa is this movie a burden of pretension. Heavily slow Very cryptic to the point of obfuscation, not because the plot justifies it, but because there is almost no plot. Even less in the characterization mode. This is almost like one of those mysterious mysteries of Charlie Chan (the cheaper versions of the Monogram studio) with a lot of red herrings and strange characters (like the former ex-senator with the checkered past who is now an inmate) and Many people killed About art objects that you would not see twice in the mall. Great landscape, however. Nice hair in the redhead, too, although I never knew what I was doing in all this. Neither could my wife. Sheesh, at least the old B movies had the decency to be short.
