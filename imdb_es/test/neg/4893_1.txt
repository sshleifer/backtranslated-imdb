This movie was ridiculous from the beginning. Let me save you all the time from watching this movie. A woman who sells corn liquor to the locals takes her cousin or nephew and he convinces her to open a coffee shop on the ground floor of his house. She does it and she and the cousin approach. There is a scene later, where she is closing her lips with him. Later, the woman discovers that an old boyfriend is coming back from prison and is tense between them, leading to a fight in the cafe. The cousin / nephew of the woman is in love with the man. The ending was horrible, the story was horrible, and if I could make up for lost time in this movie, I would appreciate it. A definite leap.
