This is a relatively visible movie (+1). After watching UKM: Ultimate Killing Machine, this one looks good, in comparison. There are no obvious technical mistakes, although the vampiric teeth seem strange. <br /> <br /> The story line does not make sense. Let's see. An American GI fights against vampires. Go back to the states and rehabilitate to see ... Vampires. His commanding officer is his ex-wife's aunt. Who is doing research on the biodiversity of the South American area where vampires are? Huh Do not accumulate too many matches. Who cares about the head vampire? Or, your daughter? Or someone in this movie? The only originality in this is that most of the myths about vampires (allergic to crosses and garlic, can not go out in the day, etc.) are wrong. But, they can not be killed except by decapitation or a wooden wound in the heart. Yeah sure. It's obvious that they just did not want to film a dark movie, since this is a movie for television. <br /> <br /> It would have been good for the viewer, if they had hired some actors. Oh, they have Lynda Carter (the Wonder Woman on TV), and a big black guy with a tremendously deep voice, who growls appropriately to show off his prosthetic vampire teeth. But, otherwise, you would never know that they really paid people to read these lines. <br /> <br /> There are more than enough fight scenes, and some vampire blood, but no real violence.
