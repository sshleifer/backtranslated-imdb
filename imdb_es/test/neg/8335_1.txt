Only if it's the last thing you do and your mood evaporates if you ever try to see this. If you do, see it alone, do not invite anyone, you will never see another movie with you again. It could be an excellent tool for that purpose, invite the people you want to get rid of your life. <br /> <br /> Apparently, I need to write more about your movie to qualify as a review. This is a sweet irony for this movie that really sums it up perfectly. After wasting my time, I wasted more time. IT has a function, I take it back. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, I see it, it's provocative, it really sees the movie.
