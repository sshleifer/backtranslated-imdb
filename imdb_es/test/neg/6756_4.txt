How many disaster films can there be before we get tired of them? Come on, we can see them on the Discovery channel throughout the day. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment that the first part of this movie is just a telenovela. The grandson of the Great Predictor makes a prediction and they all begin to moan about how he is ruining the name of the family. The evil mother-in-law convinces the wife to throw him into the arms of her lover, whom she wants to meet. Can you believe it? The wife wants to approve the new wife! At the same time, the lover 'has someone in love with her who does not have a wife, but she sends him packing. <br /> <br /> Now that the telenovela is over, the earthquake appears. <Br /> <br /> The special effects are really good, but the dubbing is bad. That's why I like subtitled movies. All the actors are very experienced and have won many awards, so you can see some of the best in Japan in a story that is repeated often. <br /> <br /> But, the story of the soap opera returns with an impetuous end.
