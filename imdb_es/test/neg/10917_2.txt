It takes an eternity for this typically over-simplistic and idiotic film based on Stephen King to finally get out of the blocks of departure. Approximately half an hour is spent on unnecessary introductions to various boring characters and their small and irrelevant personal problems that could thrill bored housewives and apathetic retirees in soapy dramas, but this is supposed to be the horror genre (or at least that I thought naively). The mutt does not seem so scary, with what Leonard Maltin, the notoriously clueless / desperate and always smiling film critic, would not agree with: he considers Cujo to be "genuinely terrifying". (I often wonder if Maltin is genuinely fat, or just likes to do favors for his Hollywood friends ...) It is illogical and inconsistent how Wallace survives an attack with only a leg injury. And, of course, your car breaks down just when you need it to save your life: this is one of the oldest clich√©s in the horror movie; Trust King to use it to the minimum effect. The premise is imbecile, too banal, even for a horror movie: a rabid dog attacks a family. Is it like that? This kind of thing is just a 3 minute subplot in your average zombie movie. I think that even Cujo must have felt that he was starring in a turkey. The mutes have terrible agents ... But what I really do not understand is how people can throw themselves into the book "Cujo" and read it from beginning to end. These SK fanatics must be immortal: that is the only explanation, that is, why they treat time as a meaningless commodity. <br /> <br /> Bodycount: 3.
