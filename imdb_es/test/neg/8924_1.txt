I came across this movie on a local television channel last night. Frankly, I've never heard of this movie before. I simply lost track of Seagual's recent films, since each one is worse than the previous one. Here, once again, we have a boring Seagal as if his girlfriend was insisting that he make this film and he accepted it with force. The plot is ridiculous, the performance is below zero and there is not a single aspect in which the film does not fall apart. I just have no idea why Seagal made this movie. Man, it's even worse than "Out for a kill"! If you see this movie you will start to feel sorry for Seagal. It seems that you are running out of ideas, enthusiasm and money. Avoid this movie and do something worthwhile.
