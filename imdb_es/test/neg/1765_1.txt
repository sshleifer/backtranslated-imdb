This movie was so bad, I thought I was going to scream in the middle of it. It was all I could do to sit through him. The beginning of the movie where they are at war was promising. He just hit me with "Save Private Ryan" ... or at least an attempt to do it. Only we do not care about these people. There was no build up to the characters. I suppose the child who dies was supposed to make us cry ... but for some reason it just irritated everyone. Then we have to listen line after line of sappy dialogue that tried desperately to imitate "Wuthering Heights", which of course was also cited in the film. Go figure. There was nothing original about the movie, it was like sitting in the most mundane parts of every war movie ever made, with a bit of humor to keep you waiting for it to get better. Unfortunately, it is not like that. 3 hours later, I leave the theater feeling cheated. Anthony Menghilla should be shot for trying to duplicate the English patient, which at the time was a good movie, but now I wonder ... should I rent it and make sure I was not stuck in the HYPE? Maybe I was, but I definitely was not caught up in the exaggerations of this movie. I really went to the theater wanting this movie. I'm a fan of Nicole Kidman. Save your money, keep it on DVD and laugh through it, as I did.
