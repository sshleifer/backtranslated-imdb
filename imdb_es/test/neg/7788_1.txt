It's hard to get over this movie without choking on your own vomit, to be honest. The poor quality of the animation does not help, since it makes it look like a video of decades that you would find in the Morrisp 99p container. Still, it's better than the abysmal script, which occupies about a third of its extension in superfluous extras like Belle's current problems, things about Scrooge's father and lots of fannying charms with - choke - TWO ANTHROPOMORPHIC MICE . These strange additions consume time on the screen at the expense of elements that one would think would be quite important, such as Dickens' dialogue and the key fragments of his plot: the film deceives the game of twenty questions, for example, and sometimes fails. Scenes in the correct order. Absolutely hopeless.
