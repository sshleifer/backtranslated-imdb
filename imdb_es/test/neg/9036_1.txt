I love beach boys and their music. So, being a filmmaker, I thought, wow, a Beach Boys movie sounds great. Well, WRONG! I just turned off HDNET, the channel the movie was playing on, because it was very bad. Someone previously mentioned about the editing ... well, they should have looked at least the monitors while they were filming. I do not know if someone else caught his mustache falling from the face of one of the boys after kissing his wife and then smoothed his hands again. Have you ever heard of re-taking a scene! Acting was terrible. The address was terrible. The makeup was TERRIBLE !!! Possibly the worst makeup job I've seen in my life. The "fat" cheek of Brian Wilson looked like a pl-ado. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is the first time I comment on IMDb, and I know there really is no difference ... but what the hell were the producers thinking?!?! !?
