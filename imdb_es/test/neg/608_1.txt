This is a boring comedy. <br /> <br /> Here's why: A comedy of man and woman. In agreement. <br /> <br /> The husband is a shower bag. The wife is the Einstein. <br /> <br /> How original is that? <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller is the same guy in Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> The gags are lame. Not ingenious of a single line. <br /> <br /> I've had enough. Stop this now. <br /> <br /> The last word: Stupid. The destruction of the average white man continues in ABC. Worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comedian. He simply is not here. Leah Remini is a great treat for the eyes, but it is unpleasant. The wasted talent is the word. Bad comedy
