This was not a very good movie, the performance was pretty stinky and the effects were bad most of the time. But there were some funny moments, but most of them were not meant to be fun. The funniest part of the movie for me was the part where a little boy falls in a wheelchair (that's not the fun part.) What kind of person do you think I am?) Anyway, the child falls and starts screaming for his older brother, well the brother comes running and the way the child runs is so funny that he is stumbling and really acting over, I had to rewind it several times to be able to laugh a little more. so if you're looking for something to rent, but you do not seem to find anything, take a look and see the running part.
