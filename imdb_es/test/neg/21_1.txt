Bloody Birthday is a totally garbage slasher movie from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was pretty good considering the genre of the film and its obvious under budget. I do not know what was happening with the cinematography but it looked horrible. Very saturated. Maybe this is a bad transfer to DVD or maybe it has always been like that, I do not know. <br /> <br /> There are really no redeeming qualities to talk about. There are some deaths but not really bloody. I would not mind if it were you. The best thing about the DVD was the 15-minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg, who was very funny and honest. He had nothing good to say about director Ed Hunt and admits that the movie was a failure, but he would like to do it again because he thinks he has a decent plot. However, he died in 2004, so I guess it will depend on someone else to take on that challenge. With the way things have been going in recent years, I would not be surprised, there is at least one renewal per week at the movies this day. It could not be worse than the original, I suppose, but I would not mind less if it was done again or not.
