Bubbling just below the surface of Showtime is a good idea. Actually, it's more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screen time. This movie not only has its cake and it eats it also; It has the whole bakery. <br /> <br /> Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has a drug bust interrupted by the media and an impetuous actor, police and policeman named Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner is shot, he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of an annoying journalist, and the tiff takes him to a new reality police program produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo). In the first of the many mistakes and rarities of the film, that injured partner is never heard again or alluded to for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> De Niro's best gag is his speech to a small classroom. children to open the image about how the television cops do not act like real cops. The funny thing is that, as the film progresses, his character and Murphy begin to act more and more like the clich√©s with which they supposedly collide so strongly. In a more intelligent film, De Niro's diatribe could have played as an ironic commentary; Here, it is only shown to indicate how truly lax the film is. While a parody of a reality-based police program might be funny, the writing team and director Tom Dey (who made the highly superior Shanghai Noon a few years ago - see that movie instead) seems to be in an insecure position And instead of criticizing In the television industry, they really left them off (the hardest thing they seem to be able to say about network executives is that they like to play ping pong at work). Russo's character has a diabolical twinkle in his eye, but his dialogue and actions rarely coincide with the actress's enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> With little on the screen to keep my attention, my mind began to wander, and that is dangerous in a movie with so many holes. For example; If Showtime (the name given to the police program) is so popular, why does not anyone seem to recognize De Niro and Murphy when they're at work? In fact, if your investigation of the smuggler and all the evil Vargas is being televised, why the hell did not someone mention you that they are following his trail? On the other hand, given the actions of this villain, maybe I should not be surprised; this is the same prankster who is very angry with an associate for using his new supergun without approval, endangering a deal, and then sending it, how? Using about ten of the superguns to level your entire house, of course! That's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, Showtime laughs, but there simply is not enough for the almost two hours of the film. Worse still, the really intelligent gags suggest that this movie could really have been in something, if only they had put some more drafts of the script. Murphy assaults and talks as fast as he can with minimal results, and De Niro looks completely bored for most of this. After a completely unnecessary fistfight between policemen and gang members (which is notably injury-free and without arrests) the character of Russo shouts "That's a great television!" Maybe it's a great television, but it's far from being a great movie.
