Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) catches up with Danny Ocean and his team and demands that they return the money they stole from him (in Oceans 11) plus interest. However, he resists violent action, as he is under the instructions of the world's greatest thief, the night fox. Then the team must make a series of robberies to pay Benedict while testing his skills against the night fox who wants to maintain his position as the best thief of all time. In a nutshell, this movie is a complete disaster. The masses can argue that it is "great" and that Clooney and Pitt did great performances, but these are the same people who have a subscription to the magazine "Hello" and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The story is complicated, it is not complex or intelligent and it has no intelligent twists and turns, it is just a complete disaster that extends in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is great and intelligent (Hello readers of the magazine). However, any respectable movie viewer will see the movie because of the farce it is. While Oceans 11 was not a great movie, it had a decent pace, it was elegant and had some decent twists and turns. This movie loses its way very quickly and then, basically, it gives up. It's as if the director and the cast are saying to themselves, hey, this is really not working, we're just going to laugh! In fact, the cast seems to be having fun, but not me. I will not delve into the plot, since its confused evolution does not justify any examination. The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. The scenes in which Julia Roberts poses as herself (with Bruce Willis assuming a cameo role) while a bit of fun seems to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. The film is so full of holes in the plot that it seems that Arnie has emptied a Uzi 9 mm in the movie studio. You can only give credit to some scenes in which Night Fox uses Caopeira to start a robbery against a funky song, but this is not justification for watching the movie. The final scene shows the team in a senseless drunken stupor; This summarizes the film accurately. Stay with the original.
