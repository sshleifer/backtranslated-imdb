This movie has some flaws, and most of those flaws are the lack of something happening. Possibly the best movie to show the desperation inside Fly-Over Country, "Rolling Kansas" is a movie in which nothing happens and you do not care about anyone. As life begins, it moves, and then it ends. Some attempts at humor are made, but everything falls very flat. The occasional cameo simply reminds the viewer that he could be wasting his life doing something besides watching this movie and the only rock song they bought and used in each instance. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go see a good movie. This is for free and repeatedly on Comedy Central because nobody went to see it, nobody wants to see it, and it's marginally better than dead air. Not to curse with weak praise, but it's worth listening to the only rock song in the movie. Too bad the movie is not worth seeing.
