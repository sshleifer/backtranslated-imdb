First of all, let me start by saying that I have been a devoted follower of Thomas Howell's career from "The Outsiders" and "The Hitcher." It was an emerging star in the 1980s, with hits like "Soul Man" as well. The future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to move on and really assert himself in Hollywood. Put like this: Tom Cruise had a small part in "The Outsiders", while Howell had the lead. Watch the cruise today! But choosing material like this fool will only further denigrate Howell's career, if that were possible. Why do you choose things like this? A small part in a major movie would be more beneficial to him than this garbage. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story here takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone lives underground where chaos reigns. Howell is a shepherd: he protects the flock of several religious leaders by killing undesirables. In other words, he's a hit man. <br /> <br /> The sets are so bad that they would not look out of place in an episode of Thunderbirds. The use of slow motion is unnecessarily repeated throughout the film, but it is well supported by a bad performance (and bad is a kind word here), there is no continuity, scenes that are thrown without any reason, vehicles that seemed manufactured . of a box of Corn Flakes and a direction style that limited with the stupidity. Oh yes, and the plot was also pathetic. <br /> <br /> I hate to write bad reviews about movies, especially those in which I really like the star, but this movie is so bad that I do not believe for a second that anyone could be proud of it. I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director, but I would hide in the sand if I had spent the amount of money and time in this film. <br /> <br /> In summary, this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to SEE this movie. It came free with a DVD player that I bought, but I still turned it off halfway because I was embarrassed by Howell. Come on, C: give yourself some credit and fight away from these untouched wonders and try to ruin yourself and get a good share, however small. <br /> <br /> 1/10 - and only because there is no adjustment for 0/10.
