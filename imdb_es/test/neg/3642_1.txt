The first time I saw Zoey101 with my sister, we thought it was a piece of junk. Nobody is so rich and lives in a bedroom on the Pacific coast. In the program, Zoey is a popular mega rich girl who everyone goes to ask for advice. Zoey is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her, no matter how stupid her idea is. She is always perfect in everything, including her perfect figure. And she is a crazy dieter who talks about carbohydrates as if she knew what they are. When he sees that his friends are eating chocolate, he confiscates it. And another thing that bothers me is that she's always chewing a piece of mint every time you look at her. And everyone wants to have something to do with her, for example, in an episode in which Logan's man offered her $ 4,000 so that she and her friends can be encouraged by everything she does in her pathetic life. And her friend Nicole is a crazy too cheerful that screams a lot. And Lola dresses like a hoochie Houdini. The 80s called that they wanted thick hair behind. They could also shave the hair chase. This program sends a bad message to children around the world to think that if they do not have the latest I-Pods and designer clothes, they will hate themselves. <br /> <br /> This show is a big thumbs down. <br /> <br /> We hate you Jamie Lynn, <br /> <br /> Best wishes, Ryan and Kara L
