I should know better. I've seen too many early works by Rob Lowe to expect something good from this movie, even if it's about Hockey. <br /> <br /> Here we have, once again, another tired sports theme. The child has potential for greatness, seems to go far if his arrogant attitude does not ruin things. And, boom, it comes out of him as the kind of helluva type champion. Is that all you can say about sports movies? Surely, there must be other feats performed by the athletes. <br /> <br /> However, this movie has to be one of the biggest. Everyone's interactions are simply stupid, and not in a stupid and funny way. And I can not think of any of the auxiliary qualities that could animate my position. Not the actors (certainly not Swayze, who plays Lowe's reluctant mentor), neither the story, nor the music, and very little of the skating sequences. <br /> <br /> Normally, I'm a jerk for the 80s movies, even if they tend to be a bit smelly (ie, North Shore, Karate Kid), but this does not work for the good 80's crap . For a good 80's sports movie, check elsewhere. There are many of them out there.
