I like to consider myself a bad connoisseur of the movie. I like to think that the movies that most people rate as the worst of all time I can easily bear. <br /> <br /> But ... there are exceptions. I can only remember three films that I had the misfortune to see that I have repeatedly used the fast forward button for large portions of the story. Those films are The Mighty Gorga, Night of the Seagulls, and this little shit, Deep Blood. <br /> <br /> In the world of Jaws' jaws, this falls off the scale. Deep Blood does not have the realistic story of the original crocodile, nor the incredible effects of the sea serpent, nor the comment of Tintorera. No, instead, we are invited to a handful of teenagers from any public access comedian of the 80s who failed at random, and to the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shark attacks are made through quick cuts of documentary images with actors who fight. The water, occasionally with a little of what appears to be orange paint thrown into the water. There is not a minute of original images of sharks in this celluloid dump. <br /> <br /> Normally, I, or someone like me, would read a devastating review like this and say "great, I have to find a copy of it!" That is the same thought I had when I read the opinion of another viewer in this same place. How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> So ... from one bad movie fan to another ... let this pile up dust on the shelf ... hold on to the depths or the great alligator to satisfy you I need something evil Lurking in the water.
