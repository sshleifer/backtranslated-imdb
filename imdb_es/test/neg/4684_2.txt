This is horrible, you just could not believe it. The score is annoying, the filming is bad, for example, sometimes you see the shadow of the cameraman appearing on the faces of some actors. The quality of the film is ultra bad, it seems that it was made in the 20s. It is terrible. There is a bit of blood at the beginning and through the film, but always too dark filmed. No gore has no effects. The director did a better one as Rites of Blood. But there's a man follower out there, because looking to find this cheap movie is not that difficult, but you have to pay cash for it. Surely this will be placed among my ten worst worst horrors in history, I do not know if I would call it horror. You talk too much, you will thirst for blood after seeing it.
