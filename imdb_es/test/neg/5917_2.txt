In the 1930s, Hal Roach Studios was on top of the world of comedy with stars like Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase and The Little Rascals. Most of these films are exceptional and have withstood the test of time. However, a lesser known Roach product was the pairing of Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts (later, Todd was paired with Patsy Kelly, also without talent). No matter how hard I try, I can not stand these images, they just are not funny. Also, unlike Laurel and Hardy, there was not an ounce of chemistry between Todd and his two co-stars. Before I think I'm a jerk, understand that I've seen and reviewed several hundred Roach movies, as well as many other early comedies, so I know the genre well and, within the genre, this team is among the worst. Part of the reason why I think I'm right about the team is that, as a junior team at Roach, they received all the scripts that nobody else wanted. If Stan or Ollie hated an idea of ​​the plot, they often gave it to Todd and Pitts / Kelly, and usually showed up. <br /> <br /> In this film, however, the team is at its lowest point. It is difficult to imagine a comedy with less laughter and a more artificial plot. The film begins with Zasu on the jury and Thelma as a defense attorney. As for Zasu, she is a completely annoying imbecile. NOT the kind of friendly moron (like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello), but just a totally annoying and annoying person who is aggressive and detestable. As for Thelma, as usual, he is a rather insipid "heterosexual man" and, as such, has little to do but reacts to Zasu's rude behavior. <br /> <br /> The plot involves Thelma defending a client accused of selling explosions diet pills. Considering that the pills are very dangerous, when the lawyer asks Zasu to try to swallow one, it just seems silly. And, while they were called "pills," they looked more like gigantic drops that were larger than golf balls. Swallowing them just seemed artificial and did not make sense, even for a low-brow comedy. When they meet, they have swallowed the pill and it is really explosive, they all panic and run like idiots until the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Like I said, I'm not a fan of this team. However, even for those who like the movie, there is not a single legitimate laugh in the whole short film! When I talked about this review with my wife (who also saw the movie with me), she thought that my score of 2 was too generous!
