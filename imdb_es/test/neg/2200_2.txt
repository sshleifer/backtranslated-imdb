Basically it is a story of persecution, almost identical to the trillions of other persecution stories in terms of acting, suspense, plot, dialogue, characterization (or lack of it) and rhythm. <br /> <br /> The area in which 'The Net' departs from traditional persecution movies can be found in its thematic material: Computers. Unfortunately, the writers clearly did not understand the differences between a pocket calculator and a Cray! <br /> <br /> Computer beginners should not watch this movie, as they will become paranoid about computers. No matter what Hollywood tries to tell us, it is not so easy to erase the identity of someone hacking. There is still too much paper documentation in the world, and even more in 1995. <br /> <br /> Computer professionals should not watch this movie either. I mean, a magic virus that can melt your entire PC when you press "Escape"? Please. And all the virus, including the great multimedia effects of the dissolution of the screen (what is ESO?) Can fit on a single floppy disk of 1.44 mb? Yeah, whatever.
