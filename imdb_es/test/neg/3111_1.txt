I bought this movie for about $ 2.5 at a local market. I thought that with the cast present in this movie (Ice-T, Rob Lowe and Mario Van Peebles are fine), it would be pretty good. Boy, I was wrong. This movie bothered me a lot. Almost all the scenes are prolonged too long. The scene in which Rob Lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever! It was one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in a movie. The rest is nothing special. I guess when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of film, so they made everything last more than 3 times. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: the current rating of 1.9 on Imdb is correct. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Go see some dry paint for 1.5 hours instead of seeing this! <br /> <br /> If you want to see some better movies made by this director, watch 'Mean Guns' (with Christopher Lambert & Ice-T) or 'Postmortem' (with Charlie Sheen) instead.
