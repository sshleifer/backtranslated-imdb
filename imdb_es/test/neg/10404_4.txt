This sickly sweet and laborious 5-reel rhythm is definitely not among the best films of Harold Lloyd. The gags are scarce and mostly without inspiration. The saccharine melodrama is abundant. The configuration takes an eternity, since Lloyd, the unconventional field doctor, but incredibly kind, makes his rounds, bringing a little sun to the lives of children, the elderly and puppies. It's like a version of Patch Adams from 1922. Ugh 4/10.
