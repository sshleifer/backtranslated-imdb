It is not a balanced point of view. The director should not express her opinion as truth. The film has some criticism of Fujimori, but always gives him and his family the last words. There were so few criticisms of Fujimori that it seems that the only reason they were included was to be able to say that the film offers both points of view. But that is not the case. <br /> <br /> The movie just shows one of the massacres that Fujimori is accused of. And he gives credit for the mastermind of the murder of the MRTA insurgents who took over the Japanese embassy. It is well documented that the CIA did the planning. There are even images of a well-known CIA strategist on the site published by Caretas magazine and other newspapers. <br /> <br /> The fact that the director has not used such well-known information offers us some possible conclusions: the director is pro-Fujimori and deliberately and falsely decides to give him credit; the director does not want the viewers to notice that the CIA and Fujimori worked together; or simply because of ignorance because the director is not Peruvian and was not present in Peru at the time the events occurred. <br /> <br /> The explanation provided by other commentators is that Fujimori is still quite popular in Peru. it does not justify the lack of precision and balanced explanations. <br /> <br /> In addition, the statistics provided in the film for Fujimori's real support were the highest I've heard. Most of the statistics of the main survey agencies are much lower. <br /> <br /> Another point to mention is that the intelligence that was key in the capture of the leader of Sendero and the discovery that the secret network was carried out by a police force led by Ketin Vidal and he had complete autonomy with Fujimori and Montesinos. <br /> <br /> The first government of Fujimori experienced an improvement in the general economic trends (GDP), but this improvement was financed by the privatization of several national industries with contracts. That was not beneficial for the country in the long term. In addition, the gap between rich and poor continued to increase during the Fujimori regime. In his second term, the economy was suffering and there was nothing more to privatize and, at the end of Fujimori's second term, the economy was about to collapse. <br /> <br /> In terms of infrastructure investments of the Fujimori regime, they do not agree. The paternalistic pattern They were created to increase support for Fujimori, but they were not meant to last long. These structures needed continuous maintenance, but Fujimori did not provide political power to civilians to demand more investment. In fact, the Fujimori regime was able to destroy most forms of political organization, such as trade unions and popular groups, and the increase in unorganized informal work was immense. <br /> <br /> Finally, the director decided to spend most of the money. The film speaks with Fujimori instead of citing the cases of massive corruption in Fujimori's favor (the media, business owners, the military, etc.) that were so widespread that it was impossible for Fujimori not to be aware.
