I'm surprised that someone seems to Pauly Shore entertaining: it's basically a joke that becomes obsolete * real * quickly. He has his little "Californian" vocabulary and a basic stock of bad jokes. Mainly, he is simply unpleasant. <br /> <br /> That said, I watched this movie because I was sick and there was literally nothing but infomercials, otherwise, I would have turned it off after 30 minutes. Anyway, the movie could have been fine if Pauly could have turned off his speech and played him as a comic actor instead of, well, Pauly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm sure Pauly fans will like it anyway, but if you're not a Pauly fanatic, get away from this manure manure. <br /> <br /> I had to leave this comment after seeing that another user really gave this movie a 10/10! (Maybe it was Pauly !!) Personally, I gave it a 3/10 because they did not have any picture of mike-in-frame, they did not drop the camera and the support cast was pretty good.
