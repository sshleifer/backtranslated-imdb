As a fan of almost any period drama, and that's why a big fan of Jane Austen, I was horrified by this adaptation. As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park, he compared the two constantly and this fell short. He felt very hurried and very one-dimensional, so he became bored very quickly. There seemed to be no subtlety in the relationships, particularly that of Fanny and Edmund, and little atmosphere despite being located in a beautiful place. Despite having waited for Jane Austen's season since Christmas, I turned it off after an hour and went to bed. I will be interested to see the adaptations of Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, of which I do not have a much-loved version, to see if they still manage to bore me that way.
