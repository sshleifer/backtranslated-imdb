This movie was really horrible. It was not in the least frightening, not even surprising. I went to see him with a group of friends and at the end of the night we were saying "The ruins ruined my night". <br /> <br /> I would not recommend watching this movie in theaters, renting it or even watching the movie on television by accident. It is an absolute loss of an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The plot was almost non-existent, the characters were horribly underdeveloped, and they gave no story back for anything that was happening, and then left it completely open at the end as if preparing for a sequel .
