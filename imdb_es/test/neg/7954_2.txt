What's up with Scream Baby Scream is supposed to make me feel like a fool for buying it? I bought it because, God help me, I'm an imbecile to the old B cinema, even without value like this. However, there is something in this movie that irritates me, it is probably Janet, Janet is cold and presumptuous, apparently, with the intention of detaching herself as deep and noble, with a look on her face that screams constipation, it does not seem to be agreement. anything that your tense boyfriend wants. I'm glad that this is your only role. What really irritates me is that this is a 1960s gore movie that has gone terribly wrong, and as we all know, Floridian is "zero vase". It's like the director started with a style of Herschell Lewis but he retired from the bloody scenes when his wife found out, so instead we ended up with one boring conversation after another, and basically, a lot of irritation. In other words, we end up with Florida Bore. Joseph Adler should be ashamed. Janets' boyfriend Jason is almost as ridiculous as her, this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything, now that I think about it, he's probably the nicest, nicest guy in the horror story. The only thing this film really has going for you is that it has that B-gore vibe of the 60s / early 70s that you can find in things like Undertaker and his friends, Blood Freak, or almost anything from Herschell Lewis. Even Rodney of Gruesome Twosome is into this, I thought his caveman comedy routine was irritating, almost everything, from one roll to another, was stupid, even the scene of the trip was stupid. The only positive thing is the small amount of beach landscapes, but that mainly includes Janet complaining that life is not perfect. In the only really ironic twist, Scream Baby Scream becomes even less interesting once the story finally begins, around 45 minutes. If it is indifferent if you can see your entertainment or not, but you feel offended by the color red, you may not hate it. Why does Troma distribute this? Would not this be the Something Weird Video area? Scream Baby Scream may very well be the worst in the horror / gore of Florida of its era, but, I suppose, beneath the unpleasant characters and the incoherent plot, lies the potential. Scream, Baby, Scream really looks like I should follow the Blood Feast pattern, so, to steal Janet's date, "If it does not fit, I'll throw it." 2/10
