Do not pay attention to the favorable reviews of this film here. It's the worst Van Damme movie and one of the worst I've seen in my life. It would be attractive to someone without any depth, which requires nothing more than shots and explosions to entertain. <br /> <br /> When seeing that this is directed by Peter Hyams, I have realized that Peter does not have talent like director. , but it is very good filming explosions and similar. However, movies also need other elements; for example, a story. This one did not have one. This could explain the shame of some of Mr. Hyams' most recent films, it's really no better than this, really. <br /> <br /> One can not help but wonder how someone ever got behind a camera.
