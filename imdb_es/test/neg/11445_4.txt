A young woman, Jodie Foster, is witnessing a mafia murder, reports the murder to the local police and becomes a target of the mafia operatives. A professional killer, Dennis Hopper, hired by the mafia, is harassing her to prepare for the coup, but in the end he falls in love with her. Then, as a parody of the Stockholm Syndrome that defines a case when a kidnapped hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper, Jodie Foster also falls in love with her kidnapper, makes love and both prepare for a break. <br /> <br /> Denis Hopper, the actor, tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of Dennis Hopper, the director. The result is disappointing, and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer like Dennis Hopper. There is no real emotion and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. The film was saved to a certain extent by the performance of Jodie Foster, who is not at her best, but still shines with her talent, beauty and gift. Of historical interest is the brief appearance of Vincent Price and, in a small act, of Charlie Sawn, known for his great part in "Wall Street". <br /> <br /> If you decide to spend 116 minutes to watch The Movie, it's not a complete loss; This film offers easy entertainment, but we would expect much more from the director of "Easy Rider" and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in "The Accused".
