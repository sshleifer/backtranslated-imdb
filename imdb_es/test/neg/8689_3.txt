Uncle Fred Olen Ray, once again, gives us a bit of his "kindness" of Retromedia in the form of this non-classic non-classic Cinemax. through a rotating vortex a "black hole" as the smart dolts put it. Very soon, an attractive girl from the caverns of a million years ago arrives on the timeline and makes her way into the future. Soon, his other half student also makes his way into the future and opens a path through the beds of the future. <br /> <br /> Ray again offers a passable (but barely) feast that has a horrible performance but some decent skin. Yes, it's hardly exciting but heh! If it is worse, insomnia will be cured. <br /> <br /> S10 comments: 1/5 or 3/10
