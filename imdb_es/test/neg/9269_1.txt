It is difficult to decide where to start. I bought this for a few pounds and it is the worst of the few that Iv has wasted. The back of the DVD had no images and some plot summary lines, this should have warned me, but I generally like bad movies to laugh at, so I decided to give it a try. The film consists of three short stories, each of which revolves around someone who was on a particular bus at any given time (it was never clarified what the meaning of the bus is or what city it is in). <Br / > <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS (as if there was something to spoil) The first story is about a man who is persuaded, by a car, to buy it, against the wishes of his wife. The car is something like a demonic Brum and seizes him. his life. <br /> <br /> The second is about a man who never cleans his refrigerator and a monster of bacteria that man gets. <br /> <br /> The third about a woman who goes to a dating agency, only to discover that her date is not so normal. <br /> <br /> In the middle of these, they give us shots of the bus (or a bus anyway) while a narrator analyzes a lot of garbage. relationships (actually, it's like you're on a commission for saying 'relationships') <br /> <br /> The movie does not really have redeeming features at all. The acting, the costumes and the little Spfx are disgus There is no attractive female member to admire. In short, this movie is a debacle.
