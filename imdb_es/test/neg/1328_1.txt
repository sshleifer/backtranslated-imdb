The horror. The movie about the Nazis - the Germans. The killers of babies, the rapists of girls ... Why do they repent? What are you interested in doing thousands of kilometers away from Germany? You do not come to mind is it? Are the fascists now good Samaritans? Think, kill, torture, 27 million people. No, of course, they do not want to. They were forced to Hitler, he gave them each, and they were forced to kill: every fourth inhabitant of peace in Byelorussia, all Jews, Gypsies ... Killing the Slavs. The facts: At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, when the fascists (Germans) made them prisoners, they were defiant and blatant. We kill them all, and so on. Since 1943, when they were captured, they suddenly became antifascists and peaceful peasants who were forced to Hitler, and personally. Because such films must be imprisoned for life for the glorification of fascism. <br /> <br /> If you want to see what they did, but went to Stalingrad, then see the movie "Come and see" (1985).
