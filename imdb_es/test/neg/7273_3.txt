I decided to watch this ultra low budget movie from the studio "Poverty Row", PRC, because it was co-starring the exciting character actor, Lionel Atwill, and I really liked the title. Although Atwill played often in these cheap films, his excellent acting style always made the movies look much better, since his character on the screen was great (his real life is also quite interesting, something like a strange soap opera). The reason I use the term "Row of Poverty" is that it was a nickname given to the cheapest and worst production companies of the era. Many of these were not even real studios, but production companies that rented spaces and sets from the main studios at night! Yes, there is a possibility that it was filmed after normal working hours, which is common for these studies. <br /> <br /> The story begins when Lionel Atwill tells his friends a story about something he has been involved with for years. make. A doctor falls in love with a lady, but he is afraid to talk about him. That's because their job is to kill people in Death Row, it's not exactly a glamor job! The Doc asks his friend (Atwill) for advice on how to tell her, but in spite of that she will not have the man. Later, you realize that it is because their own parents were criminals. <br /> <br /> Later, a man is killed and the lady is involved, although it is obvious to anyone with a brain that his sister was involved (and it's a bit of a nut) and the evidence against the lady was poor. But, apparently, the jury was full of people without brains and was sentenced and sent to Death Row. Even more disconcerting is that her former boyfriend was the man responsible for her execution. Do not you think that someone else might be able to handle this case? Until this fateful hour, her friend (Atwill) spends much of the film trying to prove her innocence and to prove that the scaly sister knows much more about the case than she will admit. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is just a little interesting and a little silly. While it can be seen and Atwill is good (as usual), the rest of the film never rises above the mundane and part of the performance is pretty bad. It is below average and what would be expected from a film on such a low budget and nothing else despite the great title.
