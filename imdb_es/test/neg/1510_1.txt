I got this from Usenet, so I was not prepared for the heavy religious theme (and I mean EXCEPTIONALLY heavy). It's not that I'm one of Satan's disciples or something, but it was very hard. <br /> <br /> Besides that, the performance stunk. It may be because they had to make good kids perform like bad little kids, but it did not work. <br /> <br /> There were some very good films involved, so any fan of the director's style might want to check out, but get ready with the fast-forward buttons. <br /> <br /> There was a bit of carelessness in the editing. In particular, a black Mustang (probably a representation of Satan?) Moves away against a white 240Z. The wheels turn, the camera changes and, what we do know, the white 240Z transforms into a white Civic. <br /> <br /> I gave up at the beginning, so I can not answer for the moral impact of it. But I would like to point out that this type of film is totally preaching to the choir. If the director / writer / producer tried to bring the religion to the masses of constipated unwashed, they did everything wrong. I think I'd rather see a commercial for adult diapers than hear a bible comment about Jesus' death for us. Yawn. <br /> <br />
