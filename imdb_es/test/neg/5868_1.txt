This abomination and the sequel ONCE AGAIN (no, thank you) and the horrible disasters of Jerry Lewis like Do not raise the bridge, lower the water (why not download) forced the owners of the cinemas to close their doors instead of seeing forced to run these movies. It is true: in the sixties, the reserve of films still applied to the unfortunate suburban and rural cinemas ... this means that to get a good movie, the cinema was forced to lead regrettable masters of time like these: I remember well in 1974 with a lot of interest in the screen FIDDLER ON THE ROOF or something good like that, I was stuck in the reservations office of United Artists by a perplexed salesman who waved a sheet of failures before me and I squinted, shouting: " Now, before we get to that, let me see the date these first. " which basically means: "reserve these errors and we will give you a tired blow". This is how and why so many cinemas closed, forced to project and annoy their decreasing audiences with these failures in the assembly line with bored comedians and talents. The owners of the cinemas, exhausted with the discussions, simply closed, sold to a gas station and saw the cinema demolished. These days, the same type of movies (eg: I NOW PRONOUNCE CHUCK AND LARRY) are banished to the 99-seat cinema in a mega google plex. It has not changed much. Freddy has his fingers ... Someone?
