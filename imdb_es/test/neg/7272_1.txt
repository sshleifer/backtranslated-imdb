Finally, I can connect the dots between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace. We see here where Lucas lost contact with what made the original Star Wars films great and began to descend to the plot minus the nonsense that ruined the episodes 1-3. This movie is more like one of those low-budget 80s low-budget swords and sorcerers than anything worthy of being associated with the Star Wars saga. As with the character Jar-Jar, this seems to be aimed at children (and the toy market). The battle scenes are particularly bad. It was depressing to see the incredible talent of Sian Phillips become a waste, after his classic performance in I, Claudius.
