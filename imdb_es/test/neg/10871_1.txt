Larry Bishop directs, writes and directs this gentle pornography, plot fewer motorcyclist movies about nothing to do with anything. Calling this one of the worst films of 2008 is to be kind to the garbage in which I spent money in theaters. It's one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I'm sorry for the girls mostly, who probably think they're in the making of a movie, when they're actually making a porn movie. They walk on the set for four days, say some sexual lines to disgusting old men, thirty years older than them, then take off their clothes and run naked during the four days they are on the set. I can only assume that this was the only way Larry Bishops could have sex. You see shot after shot directly in a girls ass. Shot after shot of Bishop walking towards a random girl and grabbing his most intimate parts, as if he were shaking his hand. How this shit was funded is beyond me. Why Tarantino has his name, is beyond me, but it is slowly fading since 1994, so I can not say that I was surprised. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, you have the horrible feeling that it's just horrible. (and I mean awful) the movies give you. When you see it in theaters, the pain you feel is amplified. After 15 minutes, I wanted to cry for being so stupid and wasting, not only my time, but also my ten dollars. There is no redeeming quality, no moment in the film that generates any kind of reaction or shows any inclination for the fact that these people had some idea of ​​what they are doing. If you do not see naked women so often, then I guess this movie would be for you. If you are eleven years old, you probably like it. You can not even laugh at that, because every idiot who did it laughed at the shit they were doing. The acting is horrible, the writing is horrible, the production is horrible, and the direction is horrible. It's not even worth renting to see the car accident. Stay away, stay far away. You should not even be reading these reviews. I should not even be writing one.
