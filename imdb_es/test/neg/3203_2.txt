Trying hard to fit into the fearsome genre of space comedy, this movie falls into two of these. In fact, it takes place in space, but it's not funny or scary. The plot is grim and the only joke, about the intellect of the computer, is overacting until death. Saying that Paul Whitthorne as Ethan, Angela Bassett as Fran and Brad Dourif as Al Bert make the best of their ham script. The homo-esque relationship between Ethan and Al Bert is insinuated, but never explored, while the attempt at sexual tension between Fran and Rick is so crude as to be ridiculous. In general, this is a turkey that is better suited to nightly television, preferably while doing the ironing.
