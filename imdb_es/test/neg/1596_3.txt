Someone told me that Pink Flamingos was, in a word, "crazy". Now I'm wondering if this guy really saw it, because that's not the way I would sum it up in one word. Disgusting, absurd, um, more disgusting ... I would do it. Every time you think it can not be dirtier, it does. One of my "favorites" in particular was when Divine celebrated her birthday party and when the police came to arrest him, they were killed and eaten by the guests. I admit it's one of those movies where it's so grotesque that you can not just look the other way, but this is not a creative work of art in any way. It is a pure shock value. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, it makes the Jackass boys look like a bunch of pussies.
