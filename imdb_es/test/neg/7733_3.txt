Vendor Lenny Brown (Woods) is rapidly losing his ability to sell proverbial ice cream to Eskimos. Given the opportunity to shine in California for a philanthropic entrepreneur, Brown and his wife Linda (Young) live the great life of investments in tax shelters; a fortune that they lose when the federal government modifies the tax laws. <br /> <br /> Seven hundred thousand dollars in red, and in need of an 'impulse', the yuppies without portfolio begin to snatch large quantities of Colombian marches to sprinkle their hooters, until they encounter pretty hungry monkeys in the back. After cleaning up briefly, Linda's miscarriage caused Lenny, once again, to move like a pinball between the top and the bottom. Follow purgatory in life. <br /> <br /> A contemporary version of Reefer Madness, with perverse echoes of Albert Brooks' Lost In America, The Boost was overshadowed by tabloid revelations about an alleged affair between Woods and Young, and its tumultuous fall out. Woods, then hired with horse trainer Sarah Owen (now his ex-wife), allegedly filed a $ 2 million lawsuit for his discredited co-star for "emotional harassment" during filming, citing late-night Fatal Attraction phone calls his fiancee. and, in one notable incident, supposedly leaving a mutilated wrist on the door of his house and Owen's. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the lack of chemistry between the supposedly amorous cables is one of the most depressing aspects of this last day. exploitation film: the only true passion that Woods shows towards Young is when he is kicking her around the room. The script is also hilariously frightening, perhaps mitigating Young's almost comatose performance when he is given howlers to "stay with me, 'until I fall off the Earth" to broadcast. Also, given Woods' dramatic and nervous personality, his trembling descent loses all credibility when, in fact, he looked like that from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, The Boost must be seen in context: in the 21st century, cocaine use is ubiquitous. However, in 1988, with the United States still embroiled in a "war on drugs" that can not be won, the very fiber of the nation seemed to be in danger, hence one of the most drastic descriptions of drug abuse.
