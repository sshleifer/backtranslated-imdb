This film had all the potential and characteristics of a great sense of well-being, a great love story ... the cast is perfect, the visual work, the original premise works, the work of the characters ... but the story is moves from one chess move to another. the next in the most predictable way ... none of the characters in the film has depth or the director explains it. All we know about the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones is that she is obsessed with her world ... no one can enter and nobody challenges her world ... that's obvious ... but all the remaining characters have their own dimensions that they never really explore or expose themselves ... The character of Aaron Eckhart had much more to offer the story, but it was not allowed, the character of Abigail Breslin is so easy to understand that his performance is somewhat predictable and false ... In the end, everything returns to the turbulent forced world of Catherine Zeta-Jones, of which the public never falls in love ... honestly, her turbulent world is not much more than the portrait of a selfish, selfish and obsessed woman that most of People would not have much time or sympathy in the real world. The director needed to make her a hero and never does ... in the end, it is the character of Eckhart who ultimately wins because he wins. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, just a movie that could have been Much better with more depth of personalities allowed, explained and exposed. <br /> <br /> Regards
