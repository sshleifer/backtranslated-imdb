Maybe the director was trying another PIRATA (good musical by Garland and Kelly), but this boring musical time does not materialize. The voices of Sinatra and Kathryn Graysons do not blend well, and their chemistry as a whole lacks spark. Sinatra's premise as a sweet boy trying to pass himself off as his late "bandito" father is fine, but he seems awkward on paper. What is surprising and wonderful here is how Sinatra can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special: her phrases and her eloquence as a singer make you want to listen to her again. When Grayson sings the same songs, it is hard to believe that he is not singing something completely different and not so interesting. She has her big moment with "Love is where you find it", which adapts perfectly to her and shows her abilities. Photography is playful and both stars are attractive as are the costumes and sets. Support stars Mildred Natwick and J. Carroll Nash put a lot of energy into making the impossible work. Apart from Sinatra's singing, there is a strange menage-a-tois dance with Ricardo Montalban, Cyd Charisse and Ann Miller. It's fascinating and weird. Montalban and Charisse were a wonderful dance team and this number is a real rarity.
