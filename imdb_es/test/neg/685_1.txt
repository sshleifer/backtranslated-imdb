Last fall (of 2001), I took a film class that was taught by the director of this film (Mark Hoeger). His vast knowledge of cinema, his ability to dissect any scene in a film and the fact that he won an Academy Award in some obscure category gave him more credibility than his average independent filmmaker. When he mentioned in one of his classes that he had just finished directing a movie called "Full Ride" and that he was in the postproduction stages, my interest woke up. However, that would be the last time I would listen to that film project. Until last week ... Last week, I saw on a TV listing that "Full Ride" was going to show on the WB network. This immediately led to a red flag, since I can not avoid associating WB with teen exploitation programs such as Dawson's Creek, Charmed, etc. IN ADDITION, the fact that Full Ride was to be released directly to television was not very flattering. But, however, I reserved that time and sat down to watch the creation of my former film teacher. <br /> <br /> After two hours and the final credits began to roll, I thought a lot about what I had just done. seen What he had just seen was a typical WB show that stretched over two hours. In fact, it almost seemed as if this movie had been made with the sole intention of showing it on the WB network. The critique of this film will be basically like criticizing a typical WB show. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The characters are shallow, the story is a clich√© in every sense of the word, the scenes are completely invented and the development of the character is forced and incredible. This movie just screams `unoriginal '. <br /> <br /> The main character, Matt Sabo, is a hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who plays solid high school football as a fullback, but then fizzles in a life of crime . Then you are offered the opportunity to get a full scholarship instead of going to jail. Obviously, without much choice, he accepts to play football with a team of stellar stars, but he is not an exception among his teammates due to his poor team spirit and bad attitude. <br /> <br /> Then comes the love interest. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a nice character, unlike the always so abrasive Matt Sabo, so we almost applauded her when she rejected him at first. But, of course, the inevitable happens. She falls in love with him, changes his attitude towards everything, and everything seems good and happy. But now is the time of conflict! <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, Amy makes it clear to Matt that she does not want to score with him, because it would be "embarrassing" for her and her mother. This is a lot to Matt's dismay, and his football buddies (yes, eventually get hot with him) who bet that he will not get any. But, of course, Matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides that it's not just about the problem. This is where the exciting plot thickens. If you do not want me to ruin this surprise, then jump forward. <br /> <br /> [START SPOILER] <br /> <br /> Matt finds out about some local guys that apparently Amy Lear always tries to score with one player every year from the All-Star team so he can try to use it to escape from the life of your small town working in a coffee shop (which is disconcerting in the first place) and reach the big city. Suddenly, realizing that they used him and that his love was a farce, Matt was tempted to return to a life of crime and leave the football field before the "big game". Amy tries to assure him that she was really in love this time, but he is too attractive to buy it. So, what will Matt do? Will he take her back? Or will he steal service stations again and be a complete jerk? I will not ruin the super-ultra-surprising ending for you. <br /> <br /> [END SPOILER] <br /> <br /> So, if I somehow cheered you up for this movie, realize that That was my sarcasm and not a genuine enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of 'Varsity Blues' or 'Summer Catch'. And that is not saying much. There is almost no comedy to save him and the characters are too shallow to worry about. So what do you have left? Not much. <br /> <br /> What I most disliked about the movie was how much an unflattering image that Hoeger painted of Nebraska through this film. It seems that he was trying to capture the essence of Nebraska's rural life and adolescents in small cities, but his approach is too stereotyped and superficial. The characters' great hopes of becoming "the big city" and the actions they take to do so are very exaggerated, and only reinforces the stereotype that Nebraska's inhabitants are a group of hicks who live in farming communities. I'm not sure if Hoeger's intentions were good or not to try to put his home state in the limelight, but I think he ended up with a very embarrassing product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films, Hoeger integrates it into the Full Ride plot and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he is shooting, that he ends up producing superficial garbage that seems to come from a stranger. If Hoeger really lived here, you'd think he'd know better than that. <br /> <br /> In general, I am completely disappointed with the first great Hoeger movie, and I hope that next time I can combine your Knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and suggestive.
