I would not call myself a big fan of inventive genius, so I might not be the best audience for this show. Although, being critical, I have an idea of ​​what I personally like and dislike, this being the latter. <br /> <br /> The lack of humor is a big change when it comes to comedy, things can be catchy. and perky for about 4 minutes and after that you start getting bored unless it's the badger animation of a couple of years ago (?) This is exactly the opposite, with a stiff script and all the overlapping voices is just dumb and very Bored of being subjected to. Unfortunately, since I had a large market ahead and great potential. <br /> <br /> A waste of time.
