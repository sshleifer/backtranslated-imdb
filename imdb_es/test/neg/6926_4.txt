I was expecting this a lot, being a big fan of the book. However, when it came out, I remember that I thought it was one of the biggest waste of money and time I've spent in the cinema. <br /> <br /> In principle, the performance, the stages and the music were excellent. , and they are the main reason why I rate this one with a 4. <br /> <br /> In this version, Sara is a bit too selfless for my liking. There's no way she would have deliberately lied to Miss Minchin just to keep him from punishing the other girls; in the book he makes a point of describing lies as "not only evil, but vulgar". <br /> <br /> There is also too much of a Disneyfied finish for me; Sara's father returns from the dead and they all trot towards the Indian sunset. While the book has a happy ending (and critics might say it is equally unlikely), it does not leave you thinking: "Oh puh-leeze." <br /> <br /> About the only things that are true to the book were: <br /> <br /> 1. Sara's father is a soldier 2. The lines between Sara and her father ("Are you learning from memory? "/" No. I know you by heart, you are inside my heart ") 3. Sara's friendship with Becky, and her 'adopting' Lottie (although the latter did not develop as much as it could have been ) 4. The change of room when adding several luxury items. That part was brilliantly done. 5. The basic core, a rich girl who suddenly throws herself into poverty, is there, but that's all it is. <br /> <br /> People could say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. Possibly. All I can say is that I have two cousins, ages 7 and 12 respectively, who were great fans of this movie until they read the book. <br /> <br /> If all you want is to feel good. family movie, then this delivers. If you're looking for a movie that really tells the story of A Little Princess (in fact, if you've read the book) do not waste time with it. It is a shame; With a cast like this, if they had followed at least the basic story, it could have been fantastic. <br /> <br /> Am I insisting that you "read the book" this and "read the book" a little too much? Most likely But if someone tries to adapt a book, especially a classic, to a movie, at least they should have done the same. Preferably more than once.
