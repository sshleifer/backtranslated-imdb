I really wanted to see this movie, unfortunately I should have listened to the advice of my daughters. This should have been a parody, but it took on a realism for which corporations had a lot to answer for. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey, after all the work he has done, is still Jim Carrey and his comedy gets nothing. better, his co star could not back him up. His son in the movie was invisible. <br /> <br /> The life of the crime was a blink of an eye, and that was the missing link in the movie. The movie showed 2 or 3 robberies and they were richer than before, that where I lost it for me. <br /> <br /> I laughed in some parts, but it was not good enough, AlecBaldwin felt that I was there to add A little weight for the movie. His character was not strong enough. There were too many gaps to make this a smart and tight film.
