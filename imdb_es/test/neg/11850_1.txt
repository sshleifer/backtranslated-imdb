The worst movie in history, with characters from Carnosaur 1-3 inserted simply to fall into the same disappearance they had in the first film, so that the images and special effects can be reused. debacle. <br /> <br /> Corman is ruining his legacy. He made and produced some incredible films, but that was the end of Carnosaur being his last film "creative in its evil".
