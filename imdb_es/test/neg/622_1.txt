Leave Ed Wood alone. To call "Plan 9 from outer space" the worst film ever made would be to deny this abysmally vulgar heap of Hollywood guano its legitimate title. This pretentious fusion of witty capricious and socio-political "commentary" bat√©tico really seems to form in the line of "Plan 9", with badly organized scenes of actors with bad luck in cheap scenarios interspersed with what seems to be images of battles and scenes of crowds of epic high budget. But while "Plan 9" occasionally manages to be fun when it means being and reasonably entertaining in general, this disgusting parade lacks talent for the basic show, with scenes that range from offensively unfunny (Groucho Marx's disgusting burlesque stealing Manhattan to the Indians) to Low Camp (Hedy Lamarr trying to imitate Joan of Arc when listening to her "voices"). Tedious (Dennis Hopper does absolutely nothing with the role of Napoleon) to the unexpected and moving performance of Peter Lorre as the psychotic Nero. Give Irwin Allen the worst director's trophy, for turning so much into so little.
