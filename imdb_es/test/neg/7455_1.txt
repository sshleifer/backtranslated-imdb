Why is it that Canada can become decent films to good in all genres, apart from the action? I caught Dragon Hunt on TV the other day and it was like a train wreck. I just could not change the channel, it's pure stupidity, it kills my willpower. It's nice to say that the IMDb cast "credits" with this monstrosity apparently never worked again. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad writing, bad narration, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. Go and go. The movie really has nothing to recommend. If you are looking for bad action movies to enjoy laughing, there are a lot of other movies that will not force you to burn your retinas later. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie does not do it. get money from the government to finance it, otherwise I will never pay taxes again.
