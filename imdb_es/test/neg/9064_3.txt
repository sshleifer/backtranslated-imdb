Honestly, this short film stinks. The mannequin used in the necro scene is pretty well done, but it's still fake enough to ruin the visual experience. The unearthed DVD is clear and clear, and I have not decided if this helps or hinders it. If the film was a bit grainy, it could have added some "chilling factor" to what was happening. I have no idea why this film is so enthusiastic about the subject, but to be honest, the scenes of necrophilia in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q, among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this talk about the film about loneliness and every other form of deep philosophy is bull. This is an expensive turd, beautifully filmed. It's not so shocking, it's not so disgusting. If you insist on seeing it, rent it. I give it a 3 for the fact that there are not many people who make explicit movies about necrophilia (definitely there should be a bigger selection for us, sickos, being open is considered gore ...) but, apart from that, there is no Absolutely nothing in favor of this excessive disorder. On the other hand, GENESIS: the "sequel" from Cerda to AFTERMATH (now available as a "double feature" released by Unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, which really shows what a good director Cerda is when he is Give the right material. . Even though I do not care about anything AFTER, GENESIS is so well made that I will forgive Cerda and I will definitely monitor him in the future ...
