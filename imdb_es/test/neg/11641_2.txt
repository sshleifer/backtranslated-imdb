Why are not there good reviews? Because this movie is hysterically bad. <br /> <br /> Located in a Japanese prison camp in World War II, we have Jim Brown as the hero who supports a hysterically incredible racist officer, and just as hysterical is the way. The character of the Japanese brown nose officers Jim Brown. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie that any of these actors have done. Stereotypes not only abound, but they dominate this film. The music of the sixties and seventies may be the best of the film, perhaps because it has nothing to do with the film. <br /> <br /> This is even hard to sit on and enjoy as a mindless amusement. This film is even more racist than the racist message it tries to convey. And believe me, I was alive in the seventies, and we thought this shit was just as stupid. It was never popular.
