The show is at least partially false (so it's not reality, it just pretends to be reality), which makes me believe that at least any faceless person is a fake episode. <br /> <br /> Test in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed. There is already a camera crew in the boat, before he arrives, he can be seen when his boat approaches. <br /> <br /> The actors who play "ambulance officers" did not take off their shirts or expose They wind up anyway to work on it, which would never happen in reality. <br /> <br /> They also parked the ambulance in the parking lot and did not drive to the Emergency entrance (which does not make any sense, unless it's fake and they would not be allowed to go there)
