On paper this looks like a good movie. Michael Caine plays a tough and ruthless boxing promoter whose son is looking for a title eliminator. The pity is that when the story is transferred from the paper to the screen of my television, everything is lost. I expected them to see us emulating their definitive role in GET CARTER and, as the film progresses, it seems that it acquires the qualities of a revenge thriller, but the full tone of the film is so big that you will get confused. as to what gender you are trying to fit. For example, Caine (in whom you can not believe that Billy "Shiner" Simpson, he is simply Michael Caine) laughs when referring to someone like "Hattie Jacques" and then, in a supposedly comical moment, his henchmen break the arm of someone. . Oh, how I laughed. I mean it's supposed to cause a laugh the way it develops on the screen, is not it? But these seem to contradict the way the rest of the film unfolds. <br /> <br /> Obviously, director John Irvin does not know what approach to take with Scott Cherry's script. Irvin is not a bad director and is well regarded for his war films such as THE DOGS OF WAR and HAMBURGER HILL, but it is not suitable for this type of violent drama and one can not help but feel that an enemy has intimidated him a bit. Living legend like Cain. Caine gives the impression that he is only doing it for money and the well-known faces in supporting roles like Landua and Cranham are basically cameos that could be played by anyone.
