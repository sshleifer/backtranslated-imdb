If you like it, enjoy movies with plotting and compelling actors, then Alien Vs Predator-Requiem is probably not the way to go. In short, the extraterrestrial lands in a typical American city, the Predator lands in an American city, both have a bit of fighting, the US government blows up the city, some people run away ... I'm sorry, I think it could have ruined the ending. It is easy to criticize someone who is being critical; People scream, I bet you could not do better! I bet he could! After I made this film, I saw it and then I congratulated myself with a pat on the back and a job well done; Surely there must have been the specter of madness in the room.
