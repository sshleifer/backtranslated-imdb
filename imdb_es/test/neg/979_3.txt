I can imagine what happened to make this film come true: a group of guys from the studio are sitting, drinking gin and tonic, maybe in a joint, and one of them has the idea that it would be great if they could find a movie that cover the generation gap, which at that time was as far away as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that both college-age rebels and their parents would find just as interesting, for different reasons, perhaps, but still, a ticket is a ticket. What interests hippies? Asia, philosophy, pacifism, wild sets and costumes. What interested your parents? Musicals, sweets, script to feel good and nostalgia. Very well, then, "Lost Horizon", the old classic, as musical, in color. You can not miss, right? It was a bomb Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, is perhaps less than a classic, but not a bad novel. In general terms, it outlines a utopian society in Shangri-la, "The Valley of the Blue Moon," near Tibet, inhabited by peacefully satisfied villagers who serve an abbey of long-lived monks. Intruder in paradise is a plane full of strangers from Gilligan's Island (a WWI veteran, a missionary, etc.), each with their own turn in the situation. In the plot it refers to the reaction of each one of them before the presentation of an option to live in paradise, or try to return to the turmoil of the 20th century. Taken on its own terms, it is soft, smooth, illuminated by pop, presenting the British conservative views of Hilton himself with an "oriental" dress, as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie. As captive guests of the monks, the shipwrecked are forbidden to leave the valley, but they are never forced to work or pray (it is not that the monks do that for themselves), they are treated with loyalty and given accommodation. simple but luxurious. Do you want to escape? In this Heaven-in-the-Earth of the United States of America, the monks are cultured and wise, the climate is warm, the food is plentiful and tasty, the inhabitants of the villages are picturesque inhabitants and nothing changes. The nuns are chaste, but they are encouraged to look pretty, and even to flirt a little (the reason given is one of the most hilariously inaccurate explanations of tantric sex I've read). Even their religion is not threatening: revealed as a combination of Christianity and Buddhism of the best of both worlds, there is nothing to offend anyone, except the most hardcore fundamentalist or the bizarre bugs that actually knew something about Tibet (which early thirties was very small number). <br /> <br /> Like a Capra movie focusing on adventure / character interaction angles, it was lovely; and maybe Steven Spielburg could have blown it, had it been close. As a product of the seventies in Hollywood, the adventure ended too quickly, and the updated list of characters was too bland, to make a big impression. Deprived of the schematic and suggestive qualities of the classic B / N, the monastery resembles a luxurious beauty spa in white and pale blue, and while at least some of the costumes of the monks tried to obtain historical accuracy, most of the The rest of the interns seemed on the way to a morning massage and a mud bath, with a couple of golf holes in the afternoon. Perhaps Stephan Sondheim could have restored a bit the arena of history, representing a very real conflict within the reaction of each character; just five years later, Brian Eno would have captured the quiet atmosphere to a T; Instead, Bert Bacherach and Hal David were given the job of writing the songs, which combine melodies similar to those of Muzak with some of the most classic New Age lyrics ever written. Quite naturally for the moment, each song requires a dance number, ranging from the forgettable to the completely boring, and so is the script, which does not have a single line that is worth citing. <br /> <br /> Tie-ins with this film were legions: there was everything from cookbooks to posters planned to promote this film, and such was the exaggeration that I really went out and bought the album sountrack. Almost the only good thing I can say about it is that it impressed me enough to write this review completely from memory almost thirty years later. The next month I read Aldous Huxley, bought a copy of the Bardo Thadol. And that's why I learned about the true Tibetan culture. Groan. <br /> <br />
