Oh, yawn. Not another film for girls where men are all pigs and women will recover because of the abuse they suffered. The only difference is that, in this movie, everyone is a pig or has porridge. I hated this movie because of the moral question of why it is right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he did not commit. It is an act more immoral than his mistreatment and clumsiness. This film shows all the situational ethics of bad writing. I saw it on CBC's "Best of Britain" series. If this is the best in Britain, it is not surprising that the British film industry is in trouble. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in this movie was David Tennant. He plays his character so despicable that I'll probably spit. The next person who speaks with a Scottish accent. Kate Ashfield tries to be the victim, but in the end she leaves as immoral as the character of David Tennant. They deserve each other. <br /> <br /> In the category of brains are the parents who see nothing wrong with the obviously psychotic Brendan. The English police are made to be so incompetent that they are not fit to hand out traffic tickets. The British Police Union should sue the creators of this film for defamation. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth it for the electricity it takes to watch your DVD.
