Most Lorne Michaels films seem to fail because they are essentially extended versions of parodies that barely managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. "Tommy Boy" is a character of "SNL": a great adorable fat (in his opinion) who knows nothing. <br /> <br /> David Spade gets the role of Thankless Overwhelmed Everyman. He is paired with the obese overweight Slob and endure miserable misfortunes while traveling cross country to Save Daddy's Business. <br /> <br /> The plot, to begin with, is really flawed. The whole premise: Dad dies and the rich and stupid son has to save the family business, going back to almost any movie he wants. Like any SNL-style film, it is reduced to a simple motivation: empty, superficial; Just one reason to see a fat and a thin being "funny" together. <br /> <br /> The film's biggest "influence" is the 1987 comedy classic "Planes, Trains & Automobiles." That movie is great because the plot is not obsolete and recycled. It's basic, yes, a boy who travels home for Thanksgiving gets stuck with a bitch. But it's real, damn it. That makes all the difference. The characters are real, the situations are much more real. "Tommy Boy" is pure slapstick and their ridiculous situations undermine the characters: we do not feel anything for them and we do not care what happens on the screen. "PTA" ran the careful line between the outrageous and the most credible and what can be related: "Tommy Boy" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer in the headlights becoming a clash turning into a fight with a dead deer He really is not dead, then he wakes up and destroys his car. <br /> <br /> The whole thing about the wrecked car is completely stolen from "PTA" and it's disturbing how many things in this movie really look like the Steve Martin / John Candy movie. <br /> <br /> Farley is just too nasty to find something nice, I've never enjoyed watching him in any movie and this has not changed his mind. Spade has very little to do and is the most ungrateful character in the movie. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd is wasted as the Evil Evil who plans to destroy Dad's Business. The ending is a joke, and not in a "funny" way. More like a "oh god, are you serious ?!" way. <br /> <br /> Some people dig it, that's great. But I just can not get into it, nor do I appreciate all the things that are "borrowed", not just counting "PT & A", without any kind of credit.
