I get the impression that I was watching a movie different from most people I know who have seen this movie. Actually, it's not that the film seemed offensive to me or anything, just that the script was incredibly amateur for a movie that had obviously been given some money. I really respected the work of Paul Haggis in the Million Dollar Baby script and was very disappointed to see how bad this script was. For me it was clear that I was desperate to be the "racist" version of Traffic, but I do not think Traffic was really a worthwhile movie. <br /> <br /> The worst feature of this movie is the way it shamelessly feeds its audience. Does Haggis really think that we are so stupid as to require a shot of the blanks? Do we really need to see the phone book on Farhad's board, with the address marked with a black circle? Can not we let ourselves do some in logic for ourselves? <br /> <br /> I also had a big problem with the dialogue that was so "in the nose". I have heard a critic say that the quality of the dialogue is deceptively high, because although people may not speak in this way, they certainly think in this way. That is irrelevant. The work of a script like this is to use the dialogue in a way that contributes to increasing the characterizations and the credibility of the situations (in this case, highly improbable) that are configured. All these characters speak using the same voice and all they talk about is racism. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the purpose of a movie like this should be to promote the fact that race should not really be a problem in these situations, but by making it the sole focus of each scene, is not it? is it like that? innately racist in itself? The characters go through their philosophies and conveniently memorize statistics on race relations as if they were regurgitating excerpts from the research essay they just wrote. It is absolutely unconvincing and obvious. <br /> <br /> A film should reveal its meaning gradually, not hit us in the face with it in the initial scenes and then not give up. I can see that Haggis' intentions with this film were honorable, but I dare to suggest that by directing his own script he has not been able to identify and, therefore, overcome his shortcomings. I really hope that the writers / directors will be very careful in the future when they approach this style of "mosaic" narration. It has been done well several times, but it is very difficult to achieve a balance between personal and political rights. And Robert Altman will not be outdone in that department.
