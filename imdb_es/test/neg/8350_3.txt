Although this movie (and I use the term lightly) was made in 1997, we saw it tonight for the first time. My husband commented that a Tommy Lee Jones movie we had never heard of made him a bit apprehensive. I looked cheerfully at him anyway, sure that if Jones was in the movie, at least it would be worth two hours of my time. After all, he has been one of our main actors for years. Although Heche is not one of my favorite actresses, I was also reassured to see another familiar face. The list of accomplished actors / actresses continued to grow, so I endured more and more of this film, with the certainty that if I pressed through enough clich√©s and trite social statements, I would arrive victorious on the other side of the plot. Unfortunately, there was no plot. He seemed to be burned by the lava of death that always oozes. <br /> <br /> The characters were thin as paper. The plot was so full of holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and acting in the movie. Was the fee for a brief consultation with an elementary science teacher too much for the budget of this movie? It does not rain acid ... there are no toxic gases (like sulfur or hydrochloride) ... there is no deadly ash ... there is no scorching heat for the skin just a few feet from the lava. Wow ... it's the friendliest lava in the world! <br /> <br /> The events were no better than the characters. Each incident was so artificial and unlikely ... it's like the writers said "It's okay, we have to get rid of the little girl NOW" ... and poof, she is splashed by a lava bomb that burns her so much that she's taken away to a safe place (not from the lava, but from his own helpless stupor) ... but only moments later in the car he has no apparent pain and shortly thereafter he is running effortlessly through the (moan!) building that ( oh no!) is about to be flown. After enduring all this, your reward is the little boy's line at the end (about all the people who look the same) ... that has to be one of the worst lines of movies I've ever heard. Even if it was not such a painful script, it was a ridiculous timing for all the characters involved. The boy and the policeman aside, as if the mother was still in the area and you just have to point it out because he's just not talking ... what ... he's hoping to slip into the shadows and get away from the little brat at once for all? I do not think so. Obviously, the child's mother would be missing or dead, or would scream her head to find her little one. <br /> <br /> The tough gangsta black token with a soft secret point against the chip on his shoulder. a secret scene of soft spots made my eyes bleed. Even if such characters existed, they would not behave like the movie portrays them given the circumstances. Something about impending burning death and massive destruction tends to surprise people, you know? <br /> <br /> There are too many canned moments from movies like these to mention ... really, it's just a shameful movie to watch. Those poor writers ... where are they now?
