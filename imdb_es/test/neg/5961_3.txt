The back of my DVD describes the plot of "El Chucabra": after its capture in the desert, the legendary bloodthirsty creature Chupacabra escapes to the city creating chaos and panic. While chasing the deadly beast, an animal control officer and scientist, Dr. Starlina. Davide realizes that a vigilante with his own suspicious plan is also tracking the elusive murderer in search of a mysterious research center run by the evil Dr. Goodspeed. This putrid horror movie is a funny thing, if you watch it under the influence of alcohol. The script is completely silly, the performance is wooden beyond what you can believe and the direction is amateur. Two rubber suits from Chupacabra are easily the best of this movie.3 out of 10 and that is extremely nice.
