First of all, this movie has the stupidest argument of any movie I've seen, and unfortunately I had to watch it. One day I was flipping through channels and I came across this terrible excuse for a movie, and it confirmed what I've been saying for a long time. Carrot Top is not an actor, and it is NOT funny in the slightest sense. He acts like he is a great comedian and thinks he attracts the public's attention. Frankly, he has the ability to act as a 10-year-old class clown, scratching that a 10-year-old's ability to compare them to Carrot Top would be a serious insult to his good name. This movie tries to be funny using the boring covers that seem to have been taken out of the 50's cartoons. In the end, I would have done anything to erase my memory of this movie, but unfortunately the memories stay with me. All I can do is warn others not to watch this movie. However, it shows that the true rumors of Carrot Top can not be worth it.
