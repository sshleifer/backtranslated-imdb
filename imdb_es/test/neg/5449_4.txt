The Congo is another multi-million dollar adaptation of Crichton's works. Like Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere, etc., the film violated the book's true meaning and essence. I'm going to do this short and to the point. The landscape is beautiful. The actors, well, it's the best they can do. The script? Try to congest hundreds of pages in an hour and a half movie. In the end, it gets dirty, but what counts is what counts and the Congo falls somewhere below that. There were some silly moments, like why did the killer gorillas decide to jump into the lava? And Amy, raised by humans, surrounded by humans, can you intimidate dozens of murderous apes around you? What kind of common sense turn is that? Which brings me to this. If there was an annoying character in each movie, Amy has one from here. You see that Amy is this nice little ingenuity who can talk with a special backpack and a harness tied to her. Good idea, but it becomes annoying after a while to hear her speak. It is worth seeing the Congo, and it is not deplorable, but it certainly is not a memorable movie either.
