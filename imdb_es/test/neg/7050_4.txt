I had not seen this in many years. The performance was as good as I started this time, I thought: "Great! Another film that I misjudged as a young fool." But then the subject started to be clear and I felt the same. <br /> <br /> This was Hollywood, the seat of glamor; So the concept should not come as a surprise. But it is such a condescending concept that I feel I need to shower after seeing it. In short, it tells us that even physically ugly people can look beautiful to each other and even feel attractive. <br /> <br /> Dorothy McGuire is a nice homely heroine. She seems to have been filmed using a minimum of makeup. Robert Young is wounded in the war and feels marked. His parents can not stand looking at him either. It seems that it has all its faculties and, in part, the notions of disability are outdated. <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall is available as a blind pianist. His character speaks in muted tones and is omniscient. <br /> <br /> Mildred Natwick is the best performer as owner of the title residence. It is bitter and hard, but it is not made of ice. His story is much more interesting and credible than that of McGuire and Young.
