OK, this movie was the worst exhibition I've seen in years. The actors were not that bad (I thought it was a b-movie, so they were acting like b-movie). Anyway, I saw this movie thinking: OH COOL, a UFO science fiction movie. INCORRECT. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to send a message to people. The last scene was extremely messy. That is a horrible thing to do to a person to believe in something. What someone believes is a matter of opinion. This movie only shows how corrupt religion is, especially Christianity. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a B movie, it is not. If you want to see a movie that is TRYING to brainwash the masses. Well this is the choice of the litter. go for it. If you are going to transmit a message, do it, do not force it. Ridiculous, that people abuse the media to such an extent. Especially, Christians.
