This is a good plan for a study of corporate power and the dichotomy between the public life required and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor has been prepared by corporate boss Burl Ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation. He sends him to England to negotiate an agreement, where Taylor is surprised by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he is at it. He returns with empty hands, after having done his duty, but having told the English the truth about his motives. He tries to marry the refugee instead of the chief's niece, and thus begins an attempt by Ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive. It could have been more unpleasant, more unpleasant and less romantic: the amount of time devoted to romance diverts the film of the points it is trying to make about corporate ethics. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the costume design was nominated (not deserved)) for an Oscar: it's all business suits and the two women in the film dress conservatively: the politics of study in Work once more, no doubt. <br /> <br /> However, what is surprising is the cinematography in black and white of CinemaScope, that Excellent - this if something deserved Oscar nom. (It was the first MGM Scope movie at B & W). <br /> <br /> It's not as good as it could be, but it's not terrible either.
