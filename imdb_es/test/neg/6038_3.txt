The 'Snafuperman' by Friz Freleng is one of the short shorts of Private Snafu. A warning of the importance of studying his field manual, 'Snafuperman' makes it rather awkward. The story, in which Technical Fairy, First Class turns Snafu into a superhuman to help him see the error of his ways, is predictable and without grace. The brief "Rumors" of Freleng's Snafu had been full of ideas and laughter, but here the director has a rather boring theme and strives to make an entertaining short film. Even in about three minutes, 'Snafuperman' seems to drag and, unlike the best cartoons in the series, it feels like a first instructional movie and second entertainment. Although they were eliminated faster than Warner's usual cartoons, Snafu's shorts largely maintained a surprisingly high standard. "Snafuperman" is a reflection of the kind of quality one would reasonably expect from a group of less talented talents of creative minds.
