The baby boom was bad enough, basically, to make a series of nightmares of all heterosexual men worse. Yes, seeing a few always made me feel better after a bad day, it reminded me that it could be worse. Guy was rich in successes, single (intelligent man), and dating celebrities from singers to actresses, then his ruckus about a cousin leaves him his biggest mistake. Actually, I would have been direct to foster care, I'm sure, this was definitely an elegant series. Oh, and everything that has to do with the change of baby, most of the time is probably a doll, besides that at that age is nothing more than an accessory anyway. <br /> <br /> In any case, I'm glad it has not lasted longer. of one year.
