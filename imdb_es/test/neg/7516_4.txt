Do you know they want to dig the Moon for real? And in Geneve is the debated project that could lead to making the time machine possible. All I can say about this film that is based on facts about the future (at the time of the film) scientific but real projects. I hope the moon exists does not happen as in the movie. Now about the movie itself, I also saw the original movie and I also read the book. However, I did not like the book, but the film did. I totally agree with a previous comment that this movie was depressing, unlike that of the 60s. That was very good with force, this was just a parallel future of what is good film.
