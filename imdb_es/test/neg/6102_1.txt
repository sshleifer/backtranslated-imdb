It is evident that the director, the writers and all the others do not know anything about their own religion or the people who practice it. This film is infinitely defective and, in general, it is a complete vessel. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a scene in which the rabbi enters the ritual bath of the woman while a naked woman is taking a bath and puts her hand on the head of a woman. There and bless her. This is a complete mockery of the laws, only in this scene some of the violated laws include: Modesty, a rabbi would never enter a ritual bathhouse while there is a woman in it. <br /> <br /> Inappropriate contact, a rabbi would never put his hand on a woman's head, not to mention that it is not the way the blessing is given. <br /> <br /> The ritual bath woman is wetting a naked woman by pushing her head under the water, the laws about the ritual bath require the whole body to make direct contact with the bath water; This means that no one should be in contact with the person who is taking a bath, of course you should not put pressure on them! <br /> <br /> There was more in that scene alone, like getting wet 13 times (where does that concept come from?) Not mentioning the rest of the movie was a total fallacy. It's scary what ignorance can invent!
