"Delirium" is what you experience when you watch this movie and then you think you saw something worthwhile. This movie, which tells of a trio of semi-psycho travelers who are not good somewhere in the California desert, is amateur and just plain stupid. The film suffers from a horrible story, a terrible script and a terrible direction just to mention some of the deficits. If the film has something in its favor, it is the even performance of the diva Rubin of B-movie. Do not waste your time on this turkey. (RE)
