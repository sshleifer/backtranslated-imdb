This is a film as pretentious as I suppose a superficial director like Joel Schumacher could do. A group of medical students take turns to die for several minutes; in the revival they discover that their sins have manifested in one way or another. As some characters are visited by dead people and some seem obsessed by their guilty conscience, it is not entirely clear what the connection is, but the visions seem to be sixth form art films. Why students consider that their experiment is a kind of great journey that will make them famous is a mystery, since the results are totally impossible to prove and, as the movie mentions several times, they have already been documented many times. Still, it's good to see Schumacher practicing for his Batman train trains with some neon paint and colored light bulbs. And William Baldwin is a board.
