Can I start by saying that I am a fan of bad movies? And this is a really bad movie. Indicates in the front 100 passengers, 3000 snakes, but I think it is more accurate to say 12 passengers and approximately 20 snakes. <br /> <br /> Snakes do not do anything particularly interesting, in fact, the whole movie. mistakes with little happening Although from time to time there is a large photograph of throbbing arms and green vomiting (bad films have to have a green sticky substance, right?). <br /> <br /> But then the end comes and it literally hits you. out of his seat in hysteria. and for that reason, this movie gets an increase of up to 2 *. <br /> <br /> There are certain movies about the world that you will want to show your friends, just so you can see the reaction when a particular event occurs in them. <br /> <br /> For example, the arrival of 'Big Man' in R Kelly '' stuck in the closet '' The LINE 'in' Shark Attack 3 '(you'll know it when you hear it) The arrival of the shark mom in 'Shark Attack 3' Almost all the scenes of 'troll 2' The end of 'Dracula 3000' (only by absolute disbelief and confusion) and the end of this film takes pride in this category. It's worth sitting alone for that. So get drunk, be ready, whatever your poison is and watch this movie with some friends. <br /> <br /> In short, if you like bad movies, get this, but do not confuse it with 'Snakes on a plane' ... there is no relationship. <br /> <br /> And do not pay more than one fiver for ...
