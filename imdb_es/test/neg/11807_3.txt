I just watched this movie and all I can say is, where is the unit these days. This seems like it would have been a great second feature on a trip in 1977 (maybe playing with one of those Joan Collins movies), but now it's worth seeing if you feel nostalgic for the 70s. A silly plot that is full of holes , but remember the time in which it was made. It is interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive, although she is not a great actress. In fact, there is not much acting in this movie. It's a kind of adventure for the Dukes of Hazzard without a touch or a 1969 Dodge loader jumping over things in the woods. But there is a Mecrury comet jumping over a dumpster in this one!
