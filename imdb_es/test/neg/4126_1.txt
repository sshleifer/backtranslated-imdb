By far, this has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I see practically all the movies that appear at night (be it showtime, hbo, cinemax, etc.). "Three" AKA "Survivor Island" keeps you in suspense as much as seeing the dry paint just to disappoint you even more miserably. If you want to feel like you've just lost what seems like an eternity in the worst movie ever created, then watch this movie. I must have screamed at least 900 times since the idiot turns. If I had 4 hands, I would give this movie 4 thumbs DOWN. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, I think the only people who would like this movie are those with terrible morals.
