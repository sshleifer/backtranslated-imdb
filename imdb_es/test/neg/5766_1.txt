I am surprised to see that this film has received more than two stars from some people. They must be joking or be totally blind because of the art of acting, directing and other flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I just could not force myself to sit through the whole movie, it was just too bad. <br /> <br /> The first three characters, not including the "digger", were just horrible actors, and I mean Â¡ESTOJAS! Maybe the director did not care, or maybe he's a worse director. It was like watching a bad school play. The movie, of course, was shot with a video camera (lowbudget - it's not a real movie), and the light settings were not very good either. Also, the sound man (if they had it) must have been a novice or a drunk, since the sound was amateur. Even in one of the first scenes of the kitchen (AWFUL by the way) the sound of the dialogue was quite bad. For example, when the woman shook her head while speaking, you could hear her voice disappear and come back. It sounded as if they had tried to correct that in postproduction by raising the volume a little when she turns her head. In addition, he had the continuous irritating buzz of camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> All these squeakers in the first 5 minutes or so. Do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> A good school project or fun project for friends to see, but it should never have been released for a real audience, especially not for an audience PAYING. THIS WAS APPROXIMATE unless it has a very low standard in terms of movies, or just in bad taste. You are warned! SB.
