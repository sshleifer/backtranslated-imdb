Well, this movie was not as horrible as I thought it would be. I was hoping to give you a star. I chose to give him three. Why? Well, for a horror / science fiction movie, it's not that bad. Of course the characters are in bad taste (like their performance, including a young Leonardo DiCaprio), the cheap-looking effects and the monsters ... well, let's say I've seen some more effective Halloween costumes in elementary schools. .. But there was something in this movie that made me see it until the end. A little humor helped a little, I suppose. And if you ever wanted to see an extraterrestrial pass gas, this movie will allow you to live your dream. 3/10
