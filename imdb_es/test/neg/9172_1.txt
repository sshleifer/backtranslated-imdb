This movie is undoubtedly one of the worst I've seen. It was so boring that I just could not wait for it to end. I talked to my girlfriend so she would see it after this site had good reviews and, after 30 minutes, she looked at me like she said "crazy". The scenery was as boring as the movie with nothing more than driving the car looking at the car. Wind blowing bits of bush around. The performance was uninspiring and the film was simply a waste of what has been a good idea in a DVD waste. <br /> <br /> Guy Pierce should have stuck to the neighbors, since he at least washed his hair. All he did was talk on the phone but, nevertheless, he did not sell anything as a salesman. I would have been fired weeks before. His girlfriend (once in Coyote Ugly) should have stayed dancing in the bar, since at least she looked sexy in that. <br /> <br /> The boy who played Vincent (those who saw that he knew) was so upset with his phone calls. that any normal person would have driven to his house and hit him with a little 4 by 2. <br /> <br /> I do not know on this earth what nobody liked. In fact, I want people to see this to suffer the torture I went through.
