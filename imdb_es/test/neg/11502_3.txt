This program is quite good and fun to watch, it is a great program of Disney channels and, at times, entertaining. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the first season but I hated the second and the third season. This show has completely changed. In the first season it was more about science and animals, everything that has gone now in the season and the third season. It's more about your life and dating. Since that gay boy appeared (Ben), this program has been disgusting. The writers took a perfectly good children's show and changed it into a fucking teen comedy. Disney took a turn for the worse. I can no longer bear to watch the most recent episodes, they are all trash.
