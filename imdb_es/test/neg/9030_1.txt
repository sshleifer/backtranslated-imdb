OK, I've seen more than 100 Troma movies, and some of them are pretty bad. "Sizzle Beach U.S.A." It was horrible, and "I Was A Teenage TV Terrorist" could not be seen, but this is the worst movie in the Troma library. <br /> <br /> A group of women are in a prison and are tortured while trying to escape. <br /> <br /> This is really terrible. Even as the exploitation movies go. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor excuse for a cult movie. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br />
