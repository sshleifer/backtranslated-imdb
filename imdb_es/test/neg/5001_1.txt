I'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is, but I could not find it. It's a really long, barely credible, barely lucid conversation between three guys in a series. <br /> <br /> It does not move anywhere, the characters are totally strange, the underlying plot is also strange. I'm lost, definitely a movie to go out. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps you from leaving is the never-realized possibility that you may have some kind of significant point or climax, and the fact that Leaving aside irritation for banal personalities, they are pretty reasonable. But you have to prepare yourself for an interminable dialogue, wishing in many occasions that Teach only closes the% * & * for a moment.
