This is a silly movie with a lot of singing and dancing. Acting is normal, but writing leaves much to be desired. Buddy Epsen has memorable performances, with a brief but outstanding performance by Gypsy Rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy. A totally incredible representation of university life that ends with an excellent ice skating exhibition of Alice in Wonderland. It's worth seeing many parts, but do not be afraid to move through parts of the movie.
