It must be a long time since I've seen such a bad movie. I must say that it is very difficult to make a good and / or realistic movie about the air disaster, but this movie was a waste of time and money. I also believe that this is an unofficial way that tries to get a bad reputation in Airbus. First of all, the cabin looks a lot like an Airbus cabin; second, it has a cane, and the third uses computers to control the rudders / elevators / ailerons through "flying by cable". When I saw this film, I thought that the intention of the film was "not to fly with computerized airplanes like Airbus, use Boeing, instead they have a direct connection between the steering and the rudders". <br /> <br /> Everything you can say: Bad story, horrible acting (most actors), the worst trick in history ...
