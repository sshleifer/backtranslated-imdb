It was as if someone were trying to make a scary video game and a documentary at the same time. The historical aspect was great. Everything else was horrible, the plugs for the other directors' movies that seemed to happen every two minutes, the video of the ghost hunt was edited like a horror movie instead of an investigation, they had house music and sound effects that They distracted you What was happening Thank you for losing 2 hours of my time! When there was evidence, it would fly by! Most were people who talked about the place. The episode of the Ghosthunters show that was there absolutely destroys how this show was. I'm very annoyed with the science fiction channel for playing this, I have not seen it since it aired.
