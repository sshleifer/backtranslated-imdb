I'm still waiting for Peter Fonda to start acting. For someone who comes from such a talented family, it's a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda trying to play another person. And, that's the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of The Tempest. A series of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with Bard's great work is what serves us. The stage is the Civil War and the evil brother of Prospero (here in Guideon) looks like a villain from the melodrama of 1890, with a mustache Snidely Whiplash. I kept waiting for him to say "Uh, ha, ha!" what would have been a high point in this sad presentation. None of the supporting actors was memorable, and the lack of expression of Peter Fonda and the movements of the wooden body made the timid story continue. <br /> <br /> The tempest is Bardo's statement about the rage of man's unfair treatment of man. The only credible character was the Gator man, the Caliban counterpart. The transfer to the swamp had possibilities, but the scene of the Civil War simply did not succeed. In short, a very disappointing production. I saw it on video and I would advise you, if you want a Willy Shakespeare solution, save your money in it. Rent something else, like Much noise and few words from Branagh, or Kevin Kline in A Midsummer Night's Dream.
