BELL WITCH HAUNTING (also known as THE HAUNT) is an American horror film supposedly based on real events that took place during the period from 1817 to 1821. <br /> <br /> This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE , a Film starring Betsy Palmer based on the same events. However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw. I enjoyed the chilling performance of Betsy Palmer on Friday the 13th. As such, I think that even on a bad day, she would achieve a better performance than anyone else involved in the parody known as THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> Regarding my headline, this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing. It is painful to see it because it is simply boring. <br /> <br /> By reading the positive reviews of this movie, I could only identify three possibilities. The first possibility - these authors were involved in the production in some way. The second possibility: the authors were paid, although not directly involved, to write positive comments after the production was completed. The final possibility: none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror films and, therefore, has no experience with the concepts that successful attempts use. <br /> <br /> The plot scenario is Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston receives the visit of two journalists eager to hear the story of Bell Witch. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A series of supernatural events begin to happen in the home of John Bell and his family. It soon turns out that a vengeful spirit is behind all this. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the plot seems to be a standard poltergeist matter, although it is based on real events. <br /> <br /> Where the execution However, as far as the brilliant concept is concerned, almost everything that could go wrong goes wrong. And then some! <br /> <br /> First, the performance. The acting is almost uniformly terrible in all areas. This factor does the most damage to production, undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer. The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenager experiencing adolescent anguish rather than a powerful demonic force expressing a malevolent intent. I almost laughed when I heard some of his phrases. Unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly! I may not have been alive in the nineteenth century, but I find it incredibly difficult to believe that any young woman alive at that moment would talk about the way this "ghost" does it. <br /> <br /> Second, the address. The direction is random and very uneven. Some scenes are promising, but the director, clearly inexperienced, squanders the potential. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or lighting to add intensity to the scenes that pretend to be scary. The environment is equally flat. A vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural events. However, the effects are so incredibly inept that nobody who has seen a suitable horror movie would swallow it. I will give an example. In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. Watch the scene for yourself. It's almost fun, almost. <br /> <br /> Third, the script. While it may be the case that the events shown are true to the real events, it can not be denied that most of the scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to poor dialogue: a dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or the story. This movie is too dependent on conversations to advance the story. While this style was also the case in British films of the heyday of the British horror of the sixties and seventies, it can not be denied that exchanges of dialogue were always interesting to see in these earlier more professional works. Peter Cushing, for example, could read a telephone directory and still maintain the attention of the spectators. The same can not be said for the actors in THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> Finally, the humor. The misdirected attempts at humor in this film are unbearable. An obese child is the target of many jokes. A particularly horrible scene sees this child go to the bathroom outside. This scene should never have been included, but it is complete with sound effects in case you do not understand what you are doing! <br /> <br /> The only positive points about the film are the location and the costumes. The decision to take the photo near the original location helped add some authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen. <br /> <br /> In general, THE HAUNT is an atrocious movie. It's not even in the league "so bad it's good". Instead, it's just boring. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. Do not even bother to see it for free! <br /> <br /> I've never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch. But it really could not be worse than THE HAUNT. Might? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I would advise everyone present to watch some horror movies about ghosts and ghosts. The LEGEND OF THE HOUSE OF HELL, THE CHANGE, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (original Japanese) and A LOST CALL (original Japanese) are good places to start.
