This movie is horrible. The acting is cheesy and laughable. If you know something about Rugby, the action of the game is boring. In fact, any episode of Power Rangers contains more realism than this movie. The 'action' consists of no more than one pass and one shot of an individual landing on the test line or tackling without the ball and the shots of who knows what. It is impossible to say. There is nothing of the excitement, skill and construction of attempting to score that contains the actual Rugby. As for the haka, this is a bunch of jerks that try to imitate a tradition they know nothing about, just like the white rasta character that should have stayed out of the movie. The next time a Rugby movie is made, we can only hope that people who know Rugby will achieve it.
