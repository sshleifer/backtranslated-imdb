Well, first of all, I got lost like the first 15 minutes of the movie, so I lost credits and those things. Then, when I finally got to that, I was like "Who the hell is this guy?" I discovered it was Flex like hours after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Flex did not look like Michael Jackson. Not a bit. I could not dance like him, or move like him, the only thing I almost had was the voice. People commented on Elizabeth Taylor, but I really can not comment on that because I do not know much about her. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was like it was wack. The dialogue stunk. Cinematography - if you can call it that - sucked. The soundtrack sucked. The performance sucked. Yes, even Flex ... I'm very upset about that. I did not want him to suck. I'm so sad that Flex was told he could get away with it. But the whole thing seemed like a disguise. You know? It's like, nobody looked like they were supposed to, except Joseph Jackson. <br /> <br /> The concert sequences just sucked. I'm sorry, but Flex can not dance like Michael. I mean, what the hell was VH1 thinking? The makeup did not even match the time of what Michael was going through. For example, in the movie it was still dark when Neverland was raided the first time. In real life, MJ was white as hell. There was a kind of stupid delay in the discoloration of his skin. <br /> <br /> The movie was not boring, well for me it was not. Actually, it was nothing. I was so upset about everything that was wrong with that. I wanted to see how it turned out and if Flex could redeem himself. Actually he did not. The only part that I found a bit interesting was the whole Lisa Marie thing. When they fell in love That was good. But I had to turn my face when they kissed. Heh And only two parts made me collapse with laughter. The first time was when they cut Michael's short hair, you know the time of the thrillers, to Michael with the long and loose hair of the Dangerous era AND IT WAS YET BLACK! That was fun. The second time I laughed was when they showed all the posters and memories of Michael, but instead had the face of Flex! It was so funny. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was cheap junk. It was just two hours of costumes and they could have been much better. But no, VH1 is cheap. Look if you want But this movie is not funny, considering how ridiculous it is. I left it feeling angry. And when I discovered that it was Flex, I started to feel so bad. So ... look if you want.
