A 1995 film by Wes Craven presents, directed by Joe Clayton and starring Lance Henriksen. A group of scientists save a dying man they find in their outpost of the deserted government of the desert when injecting their experimental virus, of course, one of his colleagues goes overboard and the virus transforms the man into an almost unstoppable monster with them trapped inside. Lance Henriksen interprets the morally offended investigator who leaves the project before all this, but returns after receiving a call for help to save man (mutation of pre-unstoppable death machine). <br /> <br /> The decision to combine two trips in one of them brings his family with him (they go on vacation afterwards) and proceeds to give them access to top secret government facilities, placing them in the middle of internal chaos . In case you can not say, it depends on the viewer to work a little with it and leave out some insignificant details (see: older and flagrant). <br /> <br /> However, in general: you can see bits of enjoyment gently. Note: The Outpost is commonly known under the title 'Mind Ripper'
