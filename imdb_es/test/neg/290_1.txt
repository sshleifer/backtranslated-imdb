As others have said, this is a ridiculously horrible movie (IT'S NOT A MOVIE!). It's not bad in a funny way, it's just painful to try to endure. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak is very hot, but there is a scene where she is in a bathtub, and you can see the wrap that covers her breasts under the bubbles. Besides, she's getting fat. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are so bad you can not see them, if you know or care about martial arts, or even a decent choreography, and the editing / effects are abysmal. <Br /> <br /> There's no reward, it's not going anywhere, and it sucks to get there.
