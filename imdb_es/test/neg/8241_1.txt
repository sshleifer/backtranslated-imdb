Sorry, I could not disagree more, with the latest comments. Frankly, I thought this was worse than Carry on Columbus, he said a lot. The last film of THE usually brilliant Charles Hartrey, which seemed out of place because the humor had moved to the highly ingenious level of the buses, whose films were being made at the same time, was frankly more fun. character as one of your flirtatious friends of moms who still thinks he's eighteen, on vacation with some member of a Scotsman, Rab c Nesbit he is not. The series, miraculously surrounded by duffers like Carry on Behind, and Carry on England. Taking Dick was not bad, but actually with this movie, the end of the series was close, a pity because even this movie I can not think of a bad movie before this.
