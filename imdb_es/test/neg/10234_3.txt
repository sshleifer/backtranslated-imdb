Wow, it was this version of THE RACKETEER hard to see! While none of the other reviews mentioned it, the public domain version that I saw had serious flaws. The sound track was off for approximately 10 seconds, which means that the dialogue and the action were never close to match. Then, you would hear that something happened long before you saw it, a very confusing proposal! The worst is when you hear a shot and only then they hit you and fall into a taxi. <br /> <br /> While this seriously spoiled the movie, it also made it easier to concentrate on the dialogue. -and showed the serious deficiencies of it also. The dialogue was simply horrible, it was often done without almost inflection or feeling. As one review said, it was like watching a play in high school. Part of this is understandable, since the sound was a new medium, but the dialogue of this movie was bad even compared to other films of 1929, really bad. And, like many of these early sound films, the film was too bold, with a boring and excessively melodramatic language and little action. AND YOU WILL THINK of a title like "The Racketeer" that there would be some action! However, it is really a boring romance, with very little action. <br /> <br /> The film finds Carol Lombard astride an alcoholic musician. She ends up stealing to try to take care of him, and the thief, Robert Armstrong, comes to his aid. When Armstrong catches her cheating on the cards, he covers her and then helps the drunken brother to stand up, and naturally falls in love with her in the process. The problem is that once the drunk gets serious, he also wants Lombard and she has to choose between them. Wow ... a recovering drunk or a mobster ... talks about a couple of big prospects! In general, it is a bit difficult to evaluate considering the terrible impression I saw. However, even if you ignore this, the film has many problems due to its misuse of dialogue and its excessive nature. And ... it was too bulky.
