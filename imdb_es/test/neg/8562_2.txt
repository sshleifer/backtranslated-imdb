The Nun is an image of revenge in which a very strict nun is killed by the garbage charges of a rebel trailer and returns years later to recover even when the adults now visit her old school. The line of the story is predictable and you will not have surprises, as it slowly advances towards the end. It is the cry of a movie with a passable performance and a script and script below average. Many of the special effects are low grade and there is almost zero credibility in the final battle. Even so, if you look beyond these there is a bit of suspense and jewels that act. If you like the cries of cookie cutters without sense, you will like this, otherwise you should pass.
