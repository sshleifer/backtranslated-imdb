Carlos may not be the most original comic, but the first series was fun, his direct comments and observations were recent. I missed a couple of seasons, but after all the accusations of material theft, I captured a couple of episodes of Mind of Mencia at the end of July 2007. I see a change! Carlos is much more interested in the bathroom humor and sexual jokes than in the observations of the race. In one episode, somehow, he implied that he was in the same league as Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. I do not think so. Maybe Comedy Central will give it one more season, but the episodes I saw sounded tired and repeated with more words than the Osbournes. Carlos, is back on his feet for a couple of years, gets some new material and tries again.
