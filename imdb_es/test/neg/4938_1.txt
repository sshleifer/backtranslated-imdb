OK this will contain spoilers. Now I've never seen such a large pile of poop since the laxative / food mixes in the elephant enclosure at the zoo! It has more holes in the plot than the lace consumed by the moth and in terms of the "realistic" plot. Well, sexual slavery is a terrible and very real world problem, and this bilge pile uses this plague as a plot to stimulate and mock, embarrassing everyone involved by that questionable judgment. But back to the movie, if you were going to kidnap people from an airport, by the way, some of the safest and happiest places for the camera in the modern world, then why plant a stool inside the van that He does everything he can until The plot needs a turn. Just wait until you leave the airport, take out the gun, wife the passengers, drive quietly to the store and kill the boys, done the job. On the passenger side, on at least three occasions the good guys have the badly disabled and are armed, WAKE UP THEM! Once in a movie it may be acceptable not to put a bullet in the skull of the bad guys, but to turn ON three times! And after he has killed most of you. In addition, the man is willing to lower the gun to stop a scar on his cheek, but kills a girl for a yeast infection that could be eliminated with $ 20 dollars in medication. I could go on and on about the number of holes in this, but I will not waste more of my time. Suffice it to say that I have rarely felt so insulted by such an appalling job and because of the real problem of sexual slavery, girls voluntarily go to new "jobs" in distant lands and are abused, raped and often murdered by the gang. teacher who meets them from the boat / plane and takes their passports and freedom. This is an insult to anyone whose life has been affected by this! Do not waste your time!
