Personally I have seen it by the appearance of Lea Thompson and I really did not expect to enjoy the film as such, but surprisingly I kept seeing it until the end. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, it's just one of the saga stories and it's not particularly original or entertaining, but interestingly it keeps you close to the television. My opinion about Will of Own It would be much better if there was not a point that I just do not understand. <br /> <br /> There is a lovely and very delicate scene in which the Lea Thompson character is running. The street has the baby in its arms, the snow falls, it is cold, it is afraid, it has nowhere to stay, it does not know what to do next. And then, between 10 and 12 years later, when things are better for her, she leaves the same child without any warning to begin the career she was dreaming of. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand it. - I do not see how it was possible for her to do such a thing, it was the opposite action to everything she had done in her life when everything she was doing was aimed at child survival. After this character turn I could not enjoy the rest of the movie.
