After an intriguing beginning, this small drama quickly descends to the ranks of pure mediocrity. At the beginning of the film, two women (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) meet while waiting for their boyfriends to return home from their vacation. Natasha Gregson Wagner is a charming actress and plays Louise; a beautiful girl whose beloved boyfriend is an artist from all over the world; Music, movies name it, it does it. As she tells the other girl, Carla (Heather Graham) all about her wonderful boyfriend, it soon becomes apparent that the similarities between her two male friends are too much ... and it's obvious that the two girls are dating the same boy . Oh darling. Enter Robert Downey Jnr, the mute who has two friends while a poor man somewhere has to go without one. Downey interprets the kind of boy the ladies like, but men disgust him repulsively; He is basically the child of a mummy. The worst kind too; On the phone, the mother sounds all the time, continually bathing her girlfriends with ambitious (albeit empty) promises, etc. It's enough to make a normal boy sick. <br /> <br /> The film knowingly starts a three-way upper love triangle Movies like Jules and Jim. However, this movie does not work; Especially due to the fact that his story is so incredible. Seriously, if two women had just discovered that they were dating the same man ... they would not stay to talk about it. Another reason why it falls is that it is so turgid. There are not endless possibilities for the result of the situation presented by this film, especially with the claustrophobia of putting everything in a small apartment; But everything the film does is get lost in the masses of dialogue; Dialogue poorly written and badly communicated, that is. The movie is also massively overestimated; It is simply not believable that people act as they do in this movie after they find themselves in this situation. Robert Downey Jnr is one of the many things that is wasted in the movie. With Natural Born Killers, he showed that he could offer brilliant and entertaining performances, and that is something that this film could do. The two females are not wasted because nobody expected anything from them anyway, but Downey could definitely have been better used. In general? A waste of time. Do not bother, go to Jules et Jim or Natural Born Killers instead. That is my advice.
