It's a shame that Barry Humphries, the infamous character of Sir Les Patterson, had his film debut in this little comedy / comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of the stinky Beatty / Hoffman, Ishtar (1987). Humphries should have learned from the mistakes that the movie made: if you are going to change course in a concept DO NOT USE SPIES! Like Ishtar, the first 20 minutes or so offers the promise of something different. It would have been great to see Patterson, anachronistic and rude, numb in the world of Australian politics. One of the characters even points out that Patterson is up to date with the current times; One would think that Humphires could have had a field day commenting on the Hawke government (I can imagine a scene with Patterson and Hawkie in a drinking contest). But instead of a film that could have been clever and even a scathing look in that world, we have Patterson running around the world like James Bond trying to save the world from the biochemical weapons that are depleted before the middle of the road. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
