I took my 14 year old son to see this movie. We leave after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely horrible! This movie should be rated R at least. I'm not so strict with movies, but this was too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew that the comedy would probably be crude, but this was much more than raw. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really impressed me) and I could not believe how starkly sexual it was. I could not believe that it would be good for a 13-year-old boy to read and see this content. I do not understand how the rating system works.
