One night on an independent channel famous for showing films from outside the wall this monstrosity was emitted. Although we were tempted to turn it off, we observed it to the bitter end, hoping to see something resembling a redemptive value. Unfortunately, there were none. Absolutely nothing. The quality of the film was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; The edition was ridiculous. On the other hand, there was very little to save. After a few minutes of the medical character of Cameron Mitchell that tells about some patient of his, the viewer is tortured by the plot, the pathetic writing, the abysmally terrible performance and an absolute lack of cohesion and continuity. The rotten cherry on top of this fetid mess was the most horrific "special effect" and "make-up" to dishonor the screen, even for television. The main character stumbles through his paper in a dimestore rubber mask and a pair of dishwashing gloves that appear to have been dipped in glue and rolled into beads. Maybe the poor lighting and the quality of the gag movie were trying to cover up how bad makeup was. We can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was made in the course of this irremediably amateur video. Seriously, a handful of three-year-olds could have produced a better project. In the end, poor Mr. Mitchell comes back (how desperate he must have been for money!) And lets glimpse some nonsense that is supposed to connect this pile of trash with the AIDS epidemic. Please save yourself and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty of sitting through this. It was so bad that not even Mystery Science Theater 3000 could have rescued you.
