Reba is, without a doubt, one of the worst "comedy" series in history. I wonder how there are people who write good comments about "Reba" ... You look "Friends", "Married with children", "Fraizer" if you laugh at that, you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer who is trying to make her way in comedy and obviously has no chance. The actors / actresses next to Reba are fine, so I feel bad for them in a so-called comedy show with the least fun person in the world (Reba). To summarize, I suggest this television show to see how low comedy can be. and appreciate those that can make you laugh.
