If I could give this movie a negative rating, I would. Humor is the cruelest I've seen in a movie. Good things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly for reasons beyond their own. There are 2 pitches, none of which admit half of a movie. Where is the "depth" that others see in this movie? That no good action goes unpunished? That only the soulless can succeed? The film starts well and the black and white is very capricious and well done. The acting is very good and the convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrible. If you think that the 3 Stooges are too kind to each other, if seeing the decapitation of a kidnapping victim with a Bowie knife is a real slap, if you thought that the "Schindler's List" was very funny, this movie is for you.
