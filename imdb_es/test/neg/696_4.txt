If you like to watch movies because they are beautiful, you should be fine with this one. If you like to watch movies that start with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy, then reveal clues about the motives of each one throughout the movie, skip it. By the end of the movie I still did not know why Stargher killed women the way he did. When you set up such a ritual serial killer, it would be good to know where the rituals come from. In Dreams was a nice similar movie with a serial killer that was not the best either, but at least it explained how the girls were killed. They also hinted at a dark background for the character of Vaughn, but they did not explain, in fact they did not explain why Lopez's child psychologist was much more suited to this task than the rest of the people they interviewed, he did not give much explanation. for the problem of the little boy, etc. If the rest of the story is convincing, I do not care about details like how Stargher provided all the sophisticated electronic equipment and underground cameras or why the FBI was not checking if it had any other property or had access to remote locations while waiting for see if everything that went into the murderer's mind would work, but I like to have an idea of ​​what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex way.
