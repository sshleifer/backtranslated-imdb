I bought a DVD of this movie for a dollar in the big store. That is probably the best and kindest comment I can offer about it. At least I was not fooled by the cost of lunch. <br /> <br /> The problem with "Chiller" is Craven's problem as a director. Man has his apologists who claim that his travel documents show that he is a really intelligent guy and a sharp conceptualist. But it is not a secret that, as a director, he has never had an iota of the visual and narrative sense of a Hitchcock. As the "Chiller" vividly attests, he is much closer to that legendary flatfoot Hershel Gordon Lewis. What Craven lacks as a director is the main ingredient that would elevate him from a hired director to a higher shot level. <br /> <br /> Let's be specific. The transition moments of this movie are elegant. The establishment shots give you the feeling of quality production. The film looks professionally as a film filmed by a television director would. (One idea: movies are just a visual distinction, these transitions that at least are handled professionally may well be the work of some second-unit directors). They are the parts between the bridges and the soft transitions, the drama, that do not materialize. <br /> <br /> The core of the procedures is invariably handled in a uniform manner. The critical shots (after, say, the car that leaves goes to the camera well positioned, then we go to the night outside of a hospital, then to the waiting room and the corridor, then to the telephone booth in the corner that will appear ) the next bit of action is quickly distributed so we can hurry up and move on to the next part. Craven never comes close to exploiting the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment. The net result of all this misdirected attention to less important parts, and the difficulty in keeping things moving, is a film that feels like the budding art student's work sharpening all his pencils, adjusting his easel and lighting up, grind all your pigments, stretch and prepare your canvas ... and then have nothing to say. Craven, like the art student, never gets to exercise. <br /> <br /> For Craven's apologists who will point out that this movie was made for television, I will point out Spielberg's "Duel" and say no. Plus.
