Well, this was done in 1993. Directed freely by Robert Iscove and written freely by John Miglis, it is supposed to be based on a true story. It is hard to believe that someone can be so stupid and blind to the truth. Certainly, from the beginning it was obvious that this lady was, after all I could get. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson, looking a little older than I remember, played the empty headed man who sought romance in his boring and empty Life. Well, it occurred to Tracy Pollan, a vacancy-looking girl with perverted sex as a means to conquer her boys. <br /> <br /> Come on, phone sex, even in the 90s was an old hat. . I can not believe that someone falls into that old line. But Mr. Matheson seemed to buy it. And it cost him a lot. <br /> <br /> The most difficult scene to take was when he finally kicked the lady out of her apartment, putting all her trash in the hallway (FRONT YOUR APARTMENT) and then had the stupidity not to change the locks. That's when I got enough of this threshing movie. It made me want to wish the lady had tried it on me so I could have the satisfaction of telling her to take a walk. <br /> <br /> I give this chestnut a 1 in 100. That's how bad I thought. was. I guess you can not blame the actors. But they were horrible. Did you really try to play this with a serious face?
