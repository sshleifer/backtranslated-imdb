I'm watching this movie while I write this. The film is about 45 minutes and there has been a lot of back and forth drama, I do not see where it goes. There are no facts, just enough to leave you making assumptions. The performance of the main daughter is painful. How was this ever done? It is not the best of the movies of a lifetime.
