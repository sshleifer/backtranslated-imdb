"Stick Around" is one of the short series of films that paired Bobby Ray with Oliver 'Babe' Hardy before Hardy's immortal team joined Stan Laurel. Several critics have suggested that Ray and Hardy, the little man without crowns and the big dominant man, were a prototype for Laurel and Hardy, but that simply is not true. Ray and Hardy play well, but they really are not a team; In each of these films, Ray has more images and is clearly destined to be the hero, while Hardy harasses him in a very different way from his last treatment of the character "Ollie" to "Stanley". It is very clear that the relationship between the little Bobby and the great Babe was inspired by Chaplin's previous films, in which the little Tramp was harassed by the huge Mack Swain or the stocky Eric Campbell. <br /> <br /> However, in "Stick Around," Hardy sports a mushroom that is identical to his later "Ollie" title (though with a fuller mustache), and he and Bobby, after passing the Most of this movie as adversaries, end up as drunken buddies. <br /> <Bobby is a papermaker for the Matz and Blatz firm, with Hardy as his boss. When Bobby tries to pretend he showed up right away, there's a smart physical business between the two men that reminds me of a routine made by Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton in 'The Garage'. A little later, Bobby Ray, whose brief career as an actor never firmly developed an image on the screen, interprets an "impossible gag" that would have been inappropriate for Stan Laurel, when he pulls a long ladder out of a much smaller set of tools. <Br /> <br /> The racks are going to work in a sanitarium, and there are the unrealistic descriptions of mental illness: a resident insists on sitting on toast because he thinks it's a poached egg! There are also some howling and racist gags (and without bad taste that are not funny) that involve a black man who kindly allows inmates to open nuts on his head. When you see an * image * of a lion, not even a photograph, look, it becomes very cowardly as if it were a wild animal. <br /> <br /> "Stick Around" is pretty serious. Most of the pantomime and acting is much broader than it should be for a slapstick comedy; Even Hardy, already a very subtle actor in 1925, is wrong with his excessive acting here. There are several bad examples of shooting games. I was impressed by an unusual configuration of the camera, when the face of a fat pedestrian gets dirty and we see a close-up of his reflection in a hand mirror, instead of his real face. <br /> <br /> THE SPOILERS COME. During their brief pairing, Hardy usually played with Ray's boss or adversary or both; Here, for once, they end up as friends. It's a good ending, but it does not make up for what is really a poor movie. My rating for this is only 4 out of 10.
