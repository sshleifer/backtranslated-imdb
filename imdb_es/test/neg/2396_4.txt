"Love and Human Remains" is one of those obviously written, obviously acted, obviously staged movies, which is so obvious that the speed of their devices' escape and fabrication is beyond me. It is not worth explaining, this amateur film tries to group each intelligent line, each misanthropic nuance, each peculiar sexual predilection in a film with a lack of concern for making the pieces fit together. In short, a sensationalist shit without the feeling ... that pretty much leaves the shit.
