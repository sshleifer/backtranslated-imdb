I must say that I found this movie very disappointing. Yes, I know that Maltin gave him 3 1/2 and others consider it very well. But, well, the opera sequences were frightening. I guess Jeannete MacDonald is an acquired taste. Yes, in the short sequences that I have seen with Nelson Eddy, she is immensely preferable to him. But on her own ... God, I do not like opera and I despise operetta, and she is basically intolerable. In a moment I had to cover my ears. Gable is fine, and Tracy throws herself away. The plot is annoying in the JM never tells Gable that he loves him and the opera, and why can not he do both? Instead, she suffers in silence (or not) with the commitments she makes. The cast of support is clearly not memorable. In addition to the three star and Jack Holt (and I suppose his mother), all are just background and forgettable. The equalization sequence is the only thing that the movie saves. And alone. Yes, it's quite spectacular and moving. But the "oh God is great" seems very artificial. I greatly prefer "In Old Chicago" in regards to the disasters of yesteryear. Save yourself in this.
