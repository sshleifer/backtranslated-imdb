If someone thinks that this is a great sports movie, it is probably the only sports movie they have seen. There are different aspects that a sports movie can take. Whether professional or university or high school. Some examples of sports films that I liked (and I have not seen many) are Jim Thorpe: All American, All the Right Moves, Any Given Sunday, Eight Men Out and Rocky, among others. All those films had a little more than simple sports. Be it a man's ascent and then a descent of greatness, or a man who loses a dream by the actions of a vengeful coach, or the effect of money on professional sports. In Hoosiers, there is not much content. It did not even seem that the movie had a beginning or an end. There was no character development, everyone forced us. I could summarize this movie, quoting a very bad trainer: "Go out and try to earn more points than the other player".
