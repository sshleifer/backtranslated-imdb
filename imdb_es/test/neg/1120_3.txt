I'm sorry, Randy. I love your comedy, but in this case you really put an egg 'Golden Turkey'. <br /> <br /> The plot was thinner than a single layer of my skin, it acted more like the wood of a giant sequoia and I think the direction did not exist. <br /> <br /> There certainly seem to be pathetic attempts to take off from other movies, Jaws and European Vacation, to name but two. <br /> <br /> If memory serves me well, Eric Idle played the same kind of character in Nat Lamp European Vacation, but much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo came up to do this sequel. If so, they certainly knew what they were doing when they rejected their parts. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, no one can improve Chevy and Beverley in their roles, since the Griswolds and Randy Quaid complemented them admirably before. films. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid should have resigned from National Lampoon while he was ahead.
