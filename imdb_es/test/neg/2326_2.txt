I bought the video for Â£ 13 at HMV (we paid more in Great Britain) because a friend told me he was highly qualified and that the reviews on this site were generally impressive. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the opening credits were a disappointment ... the dance / music is not very powerful. <br /> <br /> The car ride and the unexpected crash just when the passenger was going to suffer damage was a nice touch, ... something unexpected ... although the way she walked away from the car with her hair perfectly arranged and still carrying a handbag seemed corny to most directors ... but for Lynch it was something else. <br /> <br /> His dazed walking after such an impact was enhanced by a regular low noise similar to the fingers scraping along a blackboard; I thought that another masterful touch of Lynch perhaps portrayed the demons that were bitten in their shocked and traumatized self-consciousness. After a while, this noise became somewhat annoying and, upon further investigation, I discovered the new videocassette. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this chirp took away much of my enjoyment, but this movie became a waste of time. (and money) <br /> <br /> The two female characters had a certain presence and the lesbian scenes were fairly fair, although predictable. There were no male characters of any merit and, apart from a few vaguely good scenes (Hoover's change), there were too many terrible scenes that were simply weak and ridiculous. For example, the coffee being spit on the napkin by the menacing rascal and the silly monster face on the back of the diner. Oh, and what about the paint on the wives' jewelry ... fuzzy and disgusting. <br /> <br /> This whole movie gives you the feeling of the failed genius ... you know when you hear Dylan's worst song and you think, my God, that was embarrassing ... was it really Bob? <br /> <br /> The general feeling is that of a failed TV movie, poorly assembled with some (not many) extra bits to give it a 15 rating touch. <br /> <br /> I turned it on during the last 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Do I give him another chance and look again? If I want to be confused and work hard to understand a movie, I will see Frank Woods' Consolidated Accounting Guide. <br /> <br /> Lynch made a classic: Blue Velvet and Straight Story was fine. <br /> <br /> This, like Wild at Heart, was a disappointment; Its rarity is now predictable and rancid. Does anyone want to buy a second-hand video? <br /> <br /> Give way to a younger, original talent, David. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten (and no more). Sorry.
