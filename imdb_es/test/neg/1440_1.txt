The most worthless film of the decade. Those responsible should never be allowed to film again. I have no words to describe the lack of entertainment this movie offers. You could not PAY ME to see this movie again. Honestly, I think I would be a better person if I had not seen it. If he called it offensive, he would fall into a category of emotionally fragile extremists. I would say that this movie goes so far as to damage the industry. There are movies that I refuse to watch, now that I feel that they can be that bad taste. I feel like an idiot that I did not have the good sense to leave during many of the many moments when I was forced to do so. Yes, I saw the end and I am ashamed of it, as any other person, including the writer, should do. I'm impressed...
