This movie was so horrible ... I want to beat the hell of whoever made this movie ... I was an original fan of all the ghoulies movies ... but when I saw it, I started crying, I could not. Man√©jalo ... There are not even ghoulies in him ... like the original creative monsters ... this is very strange ... I have come a witch ... that's crap, nobody wants to see the witch ... they wanted to see what the movie is about ... "GHOULIES" i meen jeesh Am I right or what? That's what we saw the others ... now we have to endure this horrible story ... This makes me want to eat my own poop after the Spaghetti Monday !!
