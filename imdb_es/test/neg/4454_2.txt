Many of Alistair MacLean's books have reached the big screen. Some of them (The Guns Of Navarone, Fear Is The Key, Where Eagles Dare) have been translated quite well; some (Breakheart Pass, Zebra Ice Station, The Secret Ways) have been passable enough; some (the river of death, the island of bears, the road to dusty death) have been pretty bad. Caravan To Vaccares is another film based on one of MacLean's perennially popular blockbusters, but unfortunately this is another film that deserves to be added to the "rotten" list. Caravan To Vaccares, populated by uninteresting characters who get into situations and adventurous little interesting, Caravan To Vaccares is an absolute failure, as much as a thriller as an entertainment. His only semi-redeeming qualities are: a) which was filmed in very attractive places of Provence, and: b) Charlotte Rampling looks absolutely dazzling (with completely nude scenes) as the main female character. <br /> <br /> Neil Bowman (David Birney), a disillusioned American drillter, travels aimlessly through France when he meets the British photographer Lila (Charlotte Rampling). They decide to accompany themselves, and during their pilgrimage, meet the mysterious nobleman Duc De Croyter (Michel Lonsdale). The Duc convinces the couple to help protect and escort the Hungarian scientist Zuger (Michael Bryant), who is wanted by several troubled parties due to certain information that he carries in his head. The secret of Bowman and Lila is the fact that Zuger has discovered a secret formula for using solar energy as cheap and cheap energy. Does the Hungarian desperately need to take his formula to New York, but the contracted weapons have been put on his way to capture him? presumably so that he can be taken back to a cruel criminal lord and tortured to reveal his priceless secret, which they can then sell to the highest bidder. Bowman and Lila find themselves and their terrified fugitives fleeing in the French countryside from their deadly adversaries. <br /> <br /> The movie seems terribly cheap and amateurish, almost like a very low budget independent film made by a non-professional and crew member. However, a fair amount of money was actually thrown into the film, and everyone involved, at various points in their careers, has done a much better job. Therefore, one must assume that the film is bad simply because it has been written, acted on and directed with a clear lack of attention and interest. The pace is extremely slow, and the plot points become so laborious that the viewer has to work too hard to keep up with the story. Birney's performance is not immersive, and Rampling only creates a stir due to his naked scenes? The character itself is an absolute bore, and the actress looks bored. For those who manage to stay with the movie until the end, there is an unusual scene with some deadly rodeo clowns and a fierce bull (!) Which, while not particularly exciting or well executed, is at least different from the norm. Caravan To Vaccares is a very disappointing film in most aspects, and once again a strong novel by the prolific author has suffered during his transition to the screen.
