Yes, friends, this is undoubtedly the worst program in the history of television. If you want to see a sad, lonely, ungraceful hacker comedian entertain the masses with half an hour of pale, tired social ramblings that your slightly delayed cousin commented on at the Thanksgiving dinner table, then this might be the show for you. This is considered a nervous comedy for my friends, but to be honest, this makes Tim Allen look like Richard Pryor. Avoid at all costs. Unless you're a masochist.
