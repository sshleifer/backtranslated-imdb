The characters were so unoriginal that it hurts. The small, slim dorky geek of computers, the funny African American with great lines of blow, a white and fresh man who feels compassion for the cars and the handsome leader who ends with the pretty girl. The actors are, at best, mediocre. Norton ecsept that does a pretty good job as the bad boy. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is also stupid and a total waste of time. It's all about a group of spoiled children who use the world as their playground where each safe in a large house is what keeps them with food on the table. I mean, why work for a living when you can steal people? <br /> <br /> And ... Who gets entangled with the traffic lights in one of the main European cities? And in the middle of FRIGGIN's day? Think of all the damages and do not say deaths among innocent civilians. What about all the ambulances and fire trucks? <br /> <br /> I did not believe ANY compassion for the main characters, and if Mr. Wahlberg gets his damned gold or not, I could not give a farth less.
