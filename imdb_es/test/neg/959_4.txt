Interesting plot but painfully boring. The script is lacking ... it lacks performance. For me, this movie is compared to "Made for TV" type movies. I was lucky to survive the movie without falling asleep on my popcorn. I saw this movie with my family. It is quite safe to watch with your children. (only 1 semi-sexual scene) If you want to see a young Meg Ryan ... look at this movie. Very 80-ish. You will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at Christmas, alcohol, super glue and tar. Or maybe you're like me ... and you have a higher standard for acting in movies. However, I liked the way the movie started and ended! Brand.
