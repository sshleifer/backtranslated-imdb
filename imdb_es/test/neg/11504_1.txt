When I first saw this program, I thought, "What's this? It's one of those programs where there's a perfect fake world of high school with stupid problems that are considered" huge. "Then there's Sadie. She is completely obsessed with nature, but that's not a bad thing, but she compares high school students to animals, as is that, they also made her another Lizzie Miguire clone. yes, because the world definitely needs another one of those!) She's also very perfect like most of the TV girls that make me sick! So, please, this is a stupid program that does not make sense, just skip it unless that you like Lizzie McGuire or any other program like that.
