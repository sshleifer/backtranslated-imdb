I am very interested in Waverly Hills and I saw for the first time Death Tunnel The Movie. It could not have been much worse. Then I found out that the documentary was coming out and I got excited thinking that, since it was a documentary, it would be more serious and I would not have horrible special effects. as it should be a documentary. Wverly Hills does not need help with silly effects, it's fine as it is. Tours cost $ 20.00 per person and $ 100.00 for 8 hours of research during the night per person. Minimum group of 10 people for night research. Awesome place for the ghost hunter!
