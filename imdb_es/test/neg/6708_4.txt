This movie starts with this creepy song that gave me chills like the song used in "Nightmare on Elmstreet"! Immediately set the mood! The sequence that follows also shows what to expect! We are aware that a ghost is present! The mystery related to this ghost is what keeps this movie together! But the structure of the plot is so complex that it is difficult to make sense of it! The ideas behind the plot are quite interesting! Only the way we are told is too abstract! I understand that the director believed that he had to keep the mystery as long as possible! The problem is that when certain issues are revealed, you never get a satisfactory explanation! The motives of the important characters are omitted and some questions raised in the film are not answered at all. Since we do not learn enough about the characters, it's hard to take care of them! And as a consequence you will lose interest! Just a little bit of fear and a safe spin of this movie becomes a total failure! The spin is interesting, but it's not really surprising! The experienced viewer will see it coming! Some critics complain that this movie is very similar to "Ringu" and is not original at all! Well, it's true that some of the effects and fears are taken from that movie. But there is a main difference! The suspense in "Ringu" was based mainly on this turn where the viewer discovers how they kill the characters. In "Ryeong" (the "Ringu") the spin is used as a spooky effect to accompany another crazy spin. "Ryeong" depends a lot on a complex and structured plot that does not contain enough fears to keep your interest. In a nutshell: This is not a scary movie!
