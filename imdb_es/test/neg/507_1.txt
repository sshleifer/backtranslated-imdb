Let's see. What bothered me the most? The extra long dance scene at the beginning, seeing people spinning around so much made me dizzy ... Without even showing where the music came from ... It was all part of a college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Or maybe it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than necessary. What a drag this film is. And the most annoying aspect is that the bad guys are so bad, so obviously horrible that it seems that the director was making this movie for second graders. "These people are bad ... These people are good." Every time a movie has the heart of the agenda up its sleeve, I'm out of it. There is a scene on a skating rink that seems totally out of place. Long love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute who looks more like a rock star and her sexy groupie. The character of John Hurt, who is part of the starting scene too long, drinks and does not agree with the exaggerated villains. His death scene could very well be the stupidest in history. And I listen to everyone, even those who hate this movie, talk about how beautiful cinematography is. I think it looks washed. Look at "Days of Heaven" if you want to see beautiful backyards. This movie is even worse than the anti-hype. Meaningless. The epilogue, which showed the main character on a yacht, was almost as foolish as the prologue. The battle scenes are tedious and dizzying. This movie is very bad. Avoid it unless you love the bad movies, because this is the king of them.
