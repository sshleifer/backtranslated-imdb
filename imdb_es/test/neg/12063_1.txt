Camp Blood looked great when I was buying it, but when I saw it, boy, I was wrong. It's sticky, the acting is outrageous and the quality of the film is shocking. Being a fan of movies, I usually find humor of tragic horror, but sometimes I could not even laugh. Maybe Camp Blood 2 is an improvement.
