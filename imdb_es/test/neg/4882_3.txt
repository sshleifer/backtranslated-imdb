I think I won the "bargain" contest for this movie, since I got it as part of a DVD collection of "Martial Arts Movie Classics" with 50 movies for 20 dollars, which means I paid something like 50 cents for the opportunity to see the "Black Fist" version of a movie that was released as "Bogard". <br /> <br /> For a basic "revenge" movie, "Black Fist" is not that bad, although it's obviously hindered by a low budget. One of my informal "rules of thumb" for watching a movie is that if the main actor is better than his production and script, the film automatically gets at least three stars. That is certainly the case here; Lawson has a certain presence and some charisma, and probably deserved a better film career than he had. <br /> <br /> The choreography of the street fight (the apparent reason for the movie) will not really impress anyone who has ever trained at a martial arts school or who has been hit in a fight in the playground. the school. I only spent about two years learning basic kung fu, but I would not even fall in love with the front "kick" kicks, the arm traps and the roundhouse hits that are displayed here. But the atmosphere is good: dust and blood and screaming crowds, and the actors put some feeling into the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> Less credible is the plot. Dawson's character, "Leroy Fisk", is portrayed as an astute and intelligent young man who seeks work as a fighter in illegal and unauthorized parties. However, are you surprised and outraged when you have to pay the police? Excuse me, but I was raised in the small town of Iowa and even * I * knew (from having seen "Hard Times" with Charles Bronson) that the police should be paid for this type of action, and that the guys they fought needed the repairers to obtain their coincidences, and that the repairers were worth it. So you have to watch this movie with a kind of voluntary suspension of your critical faculties to accept it as a "repressed black brother" movie. (Most other fighters who are not black in the barn also get punched in the face for the same deal, yes?). <br /> <br /> The film suffers from a short attention span. Obviously, the director did not have the budget to shoot some of the scenes he needed, so he had to fill in the gaps with some pretty ridiculous exhibition scenes ("I killed him, I dined and then I killed him" scene just does not work, together with voices in off and montages that are clumsy and unconvincing.This is especially true with the whole angle of the romance that seems to have been filmed as if it were a last-minute idea.This is a bit of bad quality when you consider that death The death of the wife of "Fisk" is supposed to fuel his impulse for revenge. <br /> <br /> But, once the film changes from "young fighter who rises through the Ranks" to the theme Revenge, take a little steam and play with a little more conviction I'm not sure the final reward is worth the accumulation Roger Ebert calls this kind of thing "a long car trip for a short day on the beach "... but he has That things come together in a reasonably satisfactory way. <br /> <br /> If Sylvester Stallone had made this film with a real budget and with the same cast, games and more polished costumes, and himself as the hero, people would have considered him as the next "Rocky", that will show him how circumstances and chance can wreak havoc on the dreams of possible filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Once to see several decent shots and lines and see Dabney Coleman embarrassing herself on a piece of paper that is under him.
