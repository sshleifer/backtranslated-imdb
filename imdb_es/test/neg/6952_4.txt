Not all movies with lesbian and vampire girls, touching our favorite garbage / cult genre are nice. Unfortunately, this film is original and interpretations do not meet the standards of garbage. It seems that the intention of the creator to do it cult failed. Garbage movies are garbage movies because it happens. You can not create these types of movies on purpose. I do not know if Mr. Creepo is a legend (the first time I heard his name) BUT if it is, I wonder why ... <br /> <br /> It's horrible. Even lesbian scenes are pathetic, so fans of erotic movies of sexual arousal will not be satisfied, since there are thousands of movies better than Barely Legal Lesbian Vampires.
