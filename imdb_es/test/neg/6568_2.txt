Even not being a fan of the "Star Trek" movies or the universe of shows and books and so on, I still find some fun in some of the films that present the old cast and in the case of "First contact", even the new cast a little. . Although this was a bit sad to watch ... it seemed to want to be a lot, but on many levels it was not one of the worst Star Trek movies. The plot is very remote, seems to want to combine three or four stories in a last adventure Trek, but ends up being a lack of grace when trying to be, not tense when you want to be and is not full of action as if trying to be a disaster. of inconsistencies. The whole movie to take a Spock phrase is illogical. The effects are nothing special, since I've seen Next Generation episodes that are just as good, which means that it's fine for a TV show, but not a great movie. The plot is ridiculous, since the gang initially tries to stop Spock's brother and then joins him in his quest to find God, yes, you read it correctly. The Klingons make a sticky appearance in appearance, which will actually set the best Undiscovered Country movie. In general, you know it's bad when the best part of the movie is Kirk, Bones and Spock singing your ship, well, Spock was not really singing, but questioning the lyrics.
