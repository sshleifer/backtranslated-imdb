Making a movie for less than 1 million could be a triumph for a line producer or an accountant, but it does nothing for the audience. The overall balance could have been nice, but the visual experience was bad. <br /> <br /> What will be a triumph for Irish Cinema is when people realize that production values ​​and the script can not be sacrificed. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why people spend the energy needed to put together a movie when the quality of production is worse than in a low quality television program. <br /> <br /> Were mentioned the deficiencies of the plot. in another review on this site and I totally agree with what was written. What I would add is that the film brushed the surface of several genres without even settling on one of them. The film would have benefited either by following the direction of a direct comedy or a social / political commentary. <br /> <br /> My overall impression was that the movie was rushed, thematically developed and visually not up to par. On a positive note the performances and the music were very good.
