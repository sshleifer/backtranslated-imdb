Well then! Now my compatriots have started doing westerns! Is not it enough that our cinema stinks already? Now you need to infect the movies in English with the Polish performance and without any sense? Please stay away from this movie, do not waste your eyes on it. A 5 year old could make a movie that makes more sense. I am from Poland and I am ashamed that this title can be seen by you. Please, I beg you, DO NOT watch this movie and, if you do, DO NOT judge Polish people and Polish films according to what you see there. We had some good movies in our history and some bad, but this is like nothing worse than I've seen in my entire life. Stay away!!!
