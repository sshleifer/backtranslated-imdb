Mateo Aldrich. This is a name worth remembering. This is the guy who took his fingers to the keyboard and created one of the worst scripts of all time. Cliche. Foreseeable. An insult to the intelligence of the public. <br /> <br /> Is he the only beneficiary of the fault? Of course, no. Renny Harlin took this abysmal excuse for a script and turned it into a movie. Sam Jackson and Ed Harris actually read it (or not) and chose to star in it. Guilt abounds. <br /> <br /> This is the Denise Richards of movie scripts. There are not enough Razzies in the universe to recognize how truly horrible this writing is. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Samuel Jackson's profession is incredibly novel and the way it is presented is highly creative, but, at the end of the day, it's all just cuts. Nice cuts. <br /> <br /> Pack it the way you want it: the writing of garbage is still garbage writing.
