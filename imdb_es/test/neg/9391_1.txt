I have to confess that I did not see the whole movie. I missed the first hour during a Sci Fi Channel broadcast. Or did I forgive the first hour? The other reviewers summarize this very well. It was badly conceived. Wrong Wrong Mal Acted. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing for me was the ADR. The whole movie, which seemed to have been folded, looked like it was made in someone's garage. There was a voluminous echo in the words, which only served to make the wrong dialogue hang. And hang up And hang up Even a movie made for television should have recognized this. <br /> <br /> And the idea that alternative dimensions are differentiated by color saturation disappeared in the 80s, folks.
