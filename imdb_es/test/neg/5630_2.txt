THE RIDDLE was written and directed by Brendan Foley in what seems to be an attempt to turn the mysteries of Charles Dickens' novels into a contemporary story, but that attempt is frustrated by choosing to use the two time periods in the format in which that enigma 'unravels. Despite a cast of well-known actors, who do everything possible to achieve this film on DVD, the final product is a long, tedious and amateur mess that can only be considered an entertainment if the viewers are fans of the cast as it is reminded of others. movies <br /> <br /> Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a journalist who merely reports on dog racing events while dreaming of important reporting tasks. A series of similar murders includes an old friend of Mike's: Sadie (Vera Day) who runs a pub on the banks of the Thames, who has just discovered an old and unpublished manuscript of Charles Dickens, and has a heart of gold, sandwiches away to pathetic creatures like an old vagabond (Derek Jacobi). The murder of Sadie attracts Mike to the role of detective journalism and with the help of police Kate (Julie Cox), begins to relate the investigation to the clues found when reading the Dickens manuscript. Interrupting the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of flashbacks for Dickens' time when Dickens (again Derek Jacobi) narrates a rather personal story of peculiar murders. The parallel between the stories and the crossing of actors between the actors may have worked in the hands of others, but the improvement of this type of adventure escapes the writer / director Brendan Foley. He ends his story (finally) with a tired Hollywood ending. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jones, Jacobi, Cox and Day, the film somehow attracted the attention of Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng, PH Moriarty and Mel Smith: their contributions are minimal, but they distract happily. This is a bit of molasses that leaves the viewer wondering how films of this quality find funding. Harp grady
