Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mister Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His patented curmudgeon paper seems forced and even nasty instead of funny. The film itself is full of mawkish sentimentality. In addition, the viewer is presented with numerous references to the religious faith and patriotism of the United States. UU That they are too reverent instead of genuine. Clifton Webb does everything possible with a poor script. Edmund Gwenn plays another jovial cleric and has nothing to do. The protagonist of the child actor is played by a child without talent that shows a flat effect throughout the film. His only claim to fame as an interpreter is, of course, a low voice similar to an unusual bull frog for someone his age. However, once you have heard it, you have heard it and do not need to listen to it again. Unfortunately, he is in most of the scenes in the movie. I find this child so irritating that I help when he appears. As he has many scenes in this movie, this means that he helped through much of the movie. There were and there are so many talented children actors; It's a pity that this movie does not have any of them. However, Clifton Webb in the traditional wide-brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing.
