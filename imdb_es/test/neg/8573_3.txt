I thought that this movie would be totally different from another teenage girl. Well, I was totally wrong. There is a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really strange. I know that Spanish culture is a little different and its movies too, but I did not expect to see a fake Hollywood movie. Although they certainly falsified it quite well. Why did they make a movie without any new look? This is simply boring and had been done totally without any imagination. <br /> <br /> I thought having a nun as the bad guy in the movie would be something really original. It turned out to be a teenage slasher. If this had been ten years ago, it would have been something new. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone, but it certainly has something of comedy value! It is like a parody of terror in some points.
