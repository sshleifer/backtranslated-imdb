Shakalaka Boom Boom is a scam from the movie Amadeus. Personally, I consider Amadeus one of my favorites, not only because it's about music, which is my favorite subject, but also because it tells us the true story of a musical genius who is not only remembered for the voluminous works of beautiful music that produced. during his life, but by his own self-destructive nature and his tragic death at an early age of 35, he was practically not celebrated during his life due to the politics of some people, especially Saliere, the Italian composer, who was Jealous of him. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was surprised to see Shakalaka ..., since the director has invariably copied most of the scenes from the movie Amadeus. I see the worst type of plagiarism in this film and I am skeptical about the type of films that Bollywood continues to beat day by day. The film is a disaster, the two musicians of the film do not give you any sense of being realistic, the film is insipid, meaningless and a total failure in all aspects. The only person who has an impact is Bobby Deol, who at least knows how to act. Otherwise, the entire cast looks like a group of fans. <br /> <br /> The irony is that while watching the movie, the first screen of the movie says that all the characters in this movie are fictitious and that any resemblance to any. It is pure coincidence, which is a blatant lie, because all similarities are very clear and very well intentioned. I would like to take Darshan and Co. to court not only for copyright infringement, but also for mutilating a beautiful work of art.
