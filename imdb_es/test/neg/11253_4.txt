First of all, I am critical of this film because I really had high hopes and, instead, this movie stunk. <br /> <br /> * possible spoilers * (if you have not seen the TV series) Where to start? ? Well, let's start with quality. The film was hardly better than the original television series and the two fight scenes were very well designed. However, the CGI was horrible. <br /> <br /> Then there are the holes in the plot and the questions that still remain after the whole movie has been said and done. This film does not close as a successful conclusion to a very broad universe known as FMA and only returns to expand the universe more before leaving us with nothing but our imagination to decipher what would happen in the future. <br /> <br /> And then there's the biggest flaw in the stories. Adding World War II and Hitler ... WHY? The series was perfect ... and I did not need Hitler. I did not even need Germany. <br /> <br /> In general, the whole film was deeply related to what could have been a real FMA movie and, if I were the director, I would eliminate CoS and make a new one, more "finishing", finishing.
