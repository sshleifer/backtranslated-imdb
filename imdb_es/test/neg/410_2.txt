This review tells the story of 4 little friends who went to see the movie to Angels and Demons the first night it went out, even though it was a school night, because "Angels and Demons are worth it". Two of the four had read the book. Of those who did not, a man, wore tight pink jeans. This was the least hectic part of the night after seeing the abhorrent Angels and Demons. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a laboratory where antimatter is created while another process is performed. And apparently someone knows it or something. Look at how confused I am ... I do not understand what happened: they were just doing antimatter. Vittoria finds her own dead father ... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is a PRINT, not a burn on someone's chest. They take out scene X-33. They take Maxmillian Kohler. They, more or less, take out CERN and the symbology connected to it. They take out the Hassasin and replace it with some religious, British type. They take out the Illuminati diamond. They take the scene close to Vittoria's rape. They get rid of Langond's fight with Hassasin (now a British uncle in crack). They take the uncle out of the press following them. They take the death of the fourth cardinal. They get the fact that the Camerlengo becomes Pope. They take out the great scheme of Camerlengo. They get Langdon to be in the helicopter and land on that island towards the end. They draw the fact that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They take out Langdon's fun and, unfortunately, eliminate Vittoria's sexual appeal. <br /> <br /> In addition to the movie, completely losing focus on the details, the movie is HORRIBLE. Admittedly, however, there were some good things. For example, the recreation of the Sistine Chapel must have been extremely difficult and very well done. The scene of the explosion was MIND-BLOWING. Apart from that, SCREW THIS MOVIE TO REMAIN THE BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO DID NOT READ IT.
