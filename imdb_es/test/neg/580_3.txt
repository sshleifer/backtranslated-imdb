Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: she continues to grow and grow. Although I did not detect any subtext. "The Incredible Shrinking Man" and other films of his style during the period were parables about radiation, nuclear war and other horrors. The growth of Provine is the result of an inept computer / robot. <br /> <br /> And who operates this computer, but Lou Costello! I like some of his films with Bud Abbott. But, although this is a pretty bad movie, it does well without it. And Gale Green is an excellent foil. <br /> <br /> Green is the great pompous of the city. He is Provine's father. He intends to be elected mayor. So when his beloved daughter begins to have problems, he abandons her. He does not abandon her exactly, but abandons her battle against her admirer Costello for a long time. <br /> <br /> This is quite unlikely: Costello is the local garbage collector. <br /> <br /> Special effects are minimal. And the secondary plot that involves the military is extremely poor.
