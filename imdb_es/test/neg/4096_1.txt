Well, for this abomination of a movie, I did not expect anything good. I find Steve Carell annoying, and Bruce Almighty was pretty good, but there's absolutely no reason for him to have a sequel. Somehow, this movie was even lower than my expectations, even when I did not have any. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember the Disney movie Noah with Tony Dance? Well, let's just say that Evan Almighty started it completely in many ways so that the film remains justifiable. Actually, Evan Almighty was given the same EXACT schema that Noah, with the exception of some technical aspects, was nothing more than a carbon copy of a very superior film that was actually FUNNY. <br /> <br /> Another thing, did someone get fed up with the stupidity, without grace, redundant, of a single line of Wanda Sykes that were literally in each scene? It was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie more and more. <br /> <br /> Even though I had basically seen the movie ten years before (Noah), Evan Almighty has to be the most predictable movie I have ever seen. I discovered the whole movie from start to finish in the first five minutes and finally I realized that I was cheating Noah to the left and to the right. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you're a little unsure of whether you want to see Evan Almighty or not, and you're sick of Jonah Hill playing the same role in every movie he's in, he liked Bruce Almighty. , and I do not want to see a predictable, dry and ungraceful movie with Steve Carell trying to act like Jim Carrey, so please, do not see this piece of trash.
