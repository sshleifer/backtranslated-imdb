Okay, I just had to probe with this ... Like a tremendous mental cocoon, I just saw this movie in its entirety. <br /> <br /> You'll notice that the trivia section of IMDB points out that parts of the 747 rise were "borrowed" from the 1977 Airport. This really does not scratch the surface ... Virtually all the exterior shots of the plane furrow the ocean, land, sink, and even the -The rest shots are borrowed from the airport '77. All "magnification" shots are taken from 77, including most interior flood clips, with the exception that Dennis Weaver drowns. I could not help but wonder if Olivia Dehavilland could come floating at any moment, or maybe a "dead" Tom Sullivan. Another eye-rolling: the name of Dennis Weaver in this movie is Stevens, which is to compensate for the fact that the 77 Airport is owned by Stevens Corporation (headed by Jimmie Stewart, of course). <br /> <br /> This is a real calvalcade of actors who do not work much, or at least they have not done it in a while, which could have been the first hint that it was going to be a real bad smell. <br /> <br /> I qualify this movie with a 2 - It's quite worth a "1", but if this movie can not offer any other redemption quality, at least someone helped Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert and Dennis Weaver to make payments on their cars that month!
