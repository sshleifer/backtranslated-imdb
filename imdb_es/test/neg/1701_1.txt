I just saw this "latest" version of Macbeth and I was pleasantly surprised by the solid performance and the obvious effort that had to turn a low budget historical piece into a movie to see with all the rights. <br /> <br /> A note, however, the music was very sparse and did not add anything to the intensity of the film and it sounded like someone with a keyboard and a group of samplers, instead of a full orchestral score. I think Paul Farrer needs to act together !!
