This movie follows the tracks of The Riddle for a British cast of stars in an absolutely horrible movie! Bad effects, poor editions, bad direction, a cast that I hope has been well paid, as this will be a nail in the coffin of many races. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planer should have put on his Neil wig one more time & He left with a laugh at least! <br /> <br /> It was like a particularly long and lengthy episode of "Torchwood" but without the false fake Canadian doctor of the camp ... he had the same music too dramatic, however, It repeats perpetually, in a vain attempt to increase the tension. <br /> <br /> Oh, humanity!
