This movie is, by far, one of the worst B movies I've ever seen. There are no twists in the plot at all. Although the acting is decent, the story is terrible. There are also many errors in the movie, and it was a nuisance to watch them. For any of you who like horror movies, Slasher movies or even B movies, I do not recommend it to anyone at all. Most of the film focuses on killing without meaning, in ways that are not even worth discussing. This movie could very well be compared to a remake of Jeepers Creepers, which was not such a good movie either. For anyone who wants to spend a day at home, watching bad movies, this takes the cake.
