This story is about a safari in Africa that knows a guy named Trent, who convinces them to look for a tribe of white babies. Naturally, they turn out to be Amazonian warriors and capture men. The rest is quite predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything you would expect in a gangster movie in the basement about Africa: the substantial use of often irrelevant footage, the film of animals that are NOT native to the continent. (such as Orangutans, Moose, Coatamundis and Ground Hogs), a white actor with dark makeup who plays a native, bad acting (particularly Trent - a handsome man with the balsa wood personality), comic relief (which sounds like Chico Marx), a guy dressed in a gorilla suit and a white woman dressed in a bikini with permanents who are supposedly fierce warriors, like a tribe of angry Tarzana women. So it seems, my guess is that the movie was made for less than $ 49.95, including the cost of development and the payment of the gorilla suit rent. But, what I did not expect was an IMDb score of 4.9. This is deficient, but not as much as if we consider it to be a disorderly production in every possible way and there is no conceivable reason for the film to have such a high rating. Now, I'm NOT saying that the movie is not worth watching, it's corny and stupid enough to make a nice visualization, especially with friends. Just do not expect anything like a professional or competent film. <br /> <br /> Finally, here is a bit of dialogue from this jungle classic: <br /> <br /> "Oolama as a strong white man, Oolama wants a strong white man ..." < br /> <br /> "oonga-bunga" <br /> <br /> "me-te-tonga ... no, .... keeel ('kill') man"
