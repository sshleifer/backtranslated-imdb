1st seen 04/30/2009 - 4 of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters musical comedy with some funny scenes and good parts, but it was not a worthwhile experience. John Waters directed this parody full of music from the scene of the fifties with Johnny Depp playing the lead role. This movie is very similar to what he did with the 60s parody titled "Hairspray", but this is not as effective. Some of the melodies are sticky, some of the characters are interesting in their peculiar water style, and the representations are fine, although sometimes exaggerated. The story is similar to the movie "Grease", where there is a good group and a bad group. The boy from the bad group, Cry Baby, wow, is a good group girl. The good girl joins the bad group, but once Cry Baby hurts her, she falls back to the good group. This only establishes the end where Cry Baby tries to recover it. Now, one difference that is expected in the films of Water is that the bad group does not seem to be so bad all the time and the good group acts as if they had a pole in their "you know what". I definitely saw this also in Hairspray. However, madness and madness are not so much fun in this movie, and it leaves us with the feeling that the movie could have been much better. The main attraction of the character of Johnny Depp is that he is able to make a tear fall down his cheek (hence, his namesake) on several occasions and makes women fall everywhere for him. This is used in excess and the basic conclusion is that the movie is fine, but it is not so good.
