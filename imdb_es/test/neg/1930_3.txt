**** Possible Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> If you were making a serious movie with a powerful but aging father with three seemingly ungrateful daughters, with actors of the highest caliber, with a great cinematography and a beautiful Midwest environment, now where would you go with it? Of course, you would create a modern tragedy after "King Lear", of course. <br /> <br /> That's what I expected. That certainly was not what I got. What I got was 105 minutes of feminist gut, a long dispute about man's inhumanity towards women. There was not a decent man in all of history. <br /> <br /> From the beginning you see where this movie is going, but you can not believe that someone wasted all these actors and craftsmen in that. Trite scenario: you just want to continue with the theme of King Lear. But it never happens; And if you ask me, there is the real tragedy. <br /> <br /> Apart from the panorama of the glorious rural heart, the only thing that is worth seeing in this film is that wonderful chameleon, the British actor Colin Firth, who practices his Midwest accent. . Now there was a gift. <br /> <br /> 3/10
