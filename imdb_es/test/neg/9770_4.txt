I'm a great fight. As a story that is surreal, this movie could have been great (as good as some qualified here), but mixed with the acting (director and relatives who play leading roles, due to financial reasons, I think) who are here. .. although calling this performance, is not just an extension of that word, it is giving it a new meaning! A new meaning! <br /> <br /> If you like surrealist movies (there are some that I really like, for example, see the Japanese Strange Circus), you can overlook the flaws (see above) and enjoy more. There are great ideas here, after all! Many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but seeing this (with a group of friends) almost all of us, we just could not stop laughing ... it's not the director's intention, of course! Once again, everyone has their tastes, as can be seen from the high rating of this film, but I could only recommend the film if you are aware of the work that Alejandro Jodorowsky has done and / or is a fan of yours!
