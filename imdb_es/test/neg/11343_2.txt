Ladies and gentlemen ... Be sad (or happy!) .. We are in the disgusting forensic series of T.V-ERA! Now count on me and chant our luck: <br /> <br /> "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", "CSI: Miami", "CSI: NY", "NCIS", "Crossing Jordan", "Da Vinci's Inquest" , EVEN "The Cosby Mysteries"! .. We no longer had ENOUGH ?! <br /> <br /> From the late 1990s to the end of the 2000s, we have almost the same sick series about the criminologist genius with a partner (or team) that will solve crimes by scrutiny of the autopsy. and what a nauseating mission to do. So surely you will have many repellent scenes where we will see clearly, accurately and tremendously the most horrible shots in the history of TV. <br /> <br /> OH GOD ... Once we had the wonderful days; the good effectiveness of the police (or detective) like Columbo, Kojak, Magnum and Simon & Simon. Or the good old science fiction ERA, like The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, Knight Rider. And oh, boy, we also have the sexy and sexy: cover up, The Love Boat, Baywatch, even a flop like Thunder in Paradise. <br /> <br /> All those were unforgettable, original, good. .the good thoughts, the action, the women ... Until the X ARCHIVES arrived ... And then it was the beginning of the misfortune or to be exact: The catastrophe! <br /> <br /> X Files Without a doubt, it was one of the biggest, but there were some small disadvantages, we had agent Dana Scully (doctor and FBI agent) in each episode doing an autopsy ... and, of course, his lap (as the series was successful) became part of our living room, so the money-hungry producers loved all the physical terror + the exciting search for the truth. Therefore, they tried to repeat it in another classification not too far away: the coroner! <br /> <br /> But it became so ugly, full of deformation, and very coarse like BONES. More the unattractive gift of Emily Deschanel, and bleeding like David Boreanaz (he was much better in angel), and all these corpses ... To the extent that every time I've seen him I found myself screaming at myself AAAAHHHHHHH! What terrible disgust! ... <br /> <br /> Please, cancel ... You have canceled before good shows like (The Lone Gunmen) or (A Man Called Hawk). Here is a bad one ... So please ... Little Mercy and enough with the ERA of the Bones! .. or we will kill ourselves with Nausea and Monotony !!
