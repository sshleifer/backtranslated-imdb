<br /> <br /> The work has been edited to a great extent and the order of the scenes has been completely mixed. The acting is appalling (especially by Helena Bonham Carter) and the cinematography is deficient. <br /> <br /> The result is a slow, confusing and boring film that will instantly take Shakespeare out of Shakespeare! <br /> <br /> If you can not see a play, at least see the version of Olivier (1948) instead of this drivel.
