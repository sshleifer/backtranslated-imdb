This two-and-a-half-hour movie was shown recently at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in a show at 10 PM. There was a program scheduled for 1 in the morning after that, but I wondered if someone would stay awake to see that until 3:30 a.m. The initial scene is that of a man walking in a field, and lasts four minutes of film. It is an ominous sign of what is to come: a good 144 more minutes of the same. There is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall, standing in the sun. It is repeated 15 times, with very few dialogues. Occasionally, these slow and very long sequences are interrupted by shocking still images, such as a close-up of the female genitals, which are shown for a full minute of the film's time (the audience laughs in the last 20 seconds, as say "what is the message?"). The story resembles Dostoevsky's novel "The Brothers Karamazov," in which a cretin falls in love with a woman of easy morals. In one of the rare moments when the crowd was laughing (more desperate to try to justify having already been there for two whole hours so that nothing happened) was when a British tourist said he could not see things clearly since then . the Eurostar train traveled at 180 miles per hour, was translated by the translator with automatic change of units of measurement of the English system to the metric system so that "they could not see things clearly since the train was traveling at 300 kilometers per hour". The surprising thing about this movie is that the quality of the film reveals that a lot of money has been spent on it. This was not an 8mm film kitchen experiment. It was carefully planned, structured, acted, assembled. However, I have very little of that. Some comments indicated the unbearable details, like the minutes of a key chain of a door that has just opened. Okay, it was pointed out, but what was the purpose? Some choral people in the audience left after the first hour. The rest was out of curiosity: there must be something that happens at the end. There never was And maybe that's what the movie is about. All the movies in the theater are full of action. He wants to be different. Nothing is happening.
