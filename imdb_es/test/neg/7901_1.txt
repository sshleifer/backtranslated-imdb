I gave Soul Plane the benefit of the doubt and I thought I would actually have something of comic value. I'm not black, but that does not mean I can not appreciate black comedy. I know because I enjoy watching the Wayans Bros, Good Times and other series. <br /> <br /> I've seen shitty movies and I'm not easy to refuse. As for Soul Plane, I did not even bother to finish it. I do not know if they managed to land the plane and I could not care less. It would be unfair to say that I did not find some funny parts as I laughed, but I also laugh at the YouTube videos of the skaters that plummet so that does not say much. The men in the film were like a group of howling hyenas in mating season who seek to "get something" when and where possible. And we wonder why all those stereotypes do not seem to disappear. To summarize: Soul Plane makes the series of Harold and Kumar look like The Godfather.
