This is probably the worst movie I've seen; makes Plan 9 of the Outer Space look wonderful. The performance is wooden, the plot silly and the SFX nonexistent. The only good thing about this is the fact that it is not a long movie. The landscape is sometimes quite beautiful, assuming you like trees, if that helps.
