I do not really consider myself conservative, so this film did not personally offend me, but it was quite clear that the plot and the characterization in this film were secondary to the message. And the message is that all conservatives are evil or stupid (or both). The characters are one-dimensional: good freedom-loving Americans, or greedy, greedy and evil conservatives. There is nothing smart or creative, just anti-conservative. I do not really care about the political bias itself, but it should not be the only purpose behind the film. And clearly it is. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the cast is wonderful and Chris Cooper's W impression is funny the first two or three times, but after that it's the same joke that is told over and over again time. <br /> <br /> So if you really hate conservatives, you'll probably enjoy this movie, but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and a story that is less in black and white, then you'd be better off seeing something else.
