The Emperor's dog (Richard Haydn) is committed to Johanna's dog (Joan Fontaine). However, when Virgil (Bing Crosby) arrives in town to sell a gramophone record player to the Emperor, his dog is attacked by Johanna's dog. After an attack of revenge in which Virgil is expelled from the city, a psychoanalyst insists that Johanna's dog must face Virgil's dog so that he can overcome his dog fears. This is arranged and the dogs fall in love. And also Virgil and Johanna. The rest of the film goes through romance and in the end, Johanna's dog gives birth. But who is the father ...? <br /> <br /> The history of the dog is a very weak vehicle that is used to try to create a story between humans. It is a terrible story. There are 3 main pieces of music, all of which are garbage, bad songs and a terrible choreography. It's just an extremely boring movie: Bing has too many words in each sentence and presents them in an almost gritty and irritating way. It's not fun ............ NEVER .......... but it's meant to be. Bing and Joan have done much better than this.
