When I heard that the film was going to be released and the subject of what it was about, I was very curious. But when I saw it, it was the biggest deception of my life. Technically speaking, the sound is deficient, it can be said about the dialogues of men who were remade in the studio that were poorly achieved in the final mix. All in all, the photography is mediocre, part of the film shows some soldiers with night vision goggles, and the way the director of photography manages to make the "dark night" light up everything, as if they were in a military base. real with lights, there is no reference to the light of the moon, my God! Thirty, but not least, most of the acts are really poor, the role of the wife of one of the soldiers is not totally credible, his performance is quite bad. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment, shame of the jury Who chose to send this film to represent Colombia at the Oscars.
