If you watch the extra documentary, you will notice that the director is totally inexperienced and was actually a co-worker of Quentin Tarantinos in a video store. Put two and two together and you realize that Quentin is doing his old friend a favor, even though he has no talent. Was that hard? Well, look at this movie and you will realize that it is not. Too slow at first, too absurd in the middle and too slow to finish. That sums it up. Eric Stolz and Delpy were the only ones who showed some charisma. And Kemp really put in a good performance. But the rest was very bad. An example of stupidity in the plot was when the "lead thief" accidentally took off his mask during the raid. So what happens? Well, the other thieves decide that they can also take their own! What a great thought. The violence was relentless and insane. But not in a "cool" way. Rather in a ridiculous way. I wondered if this was going to be a comedy. Silly Tarantino for having his good name connected to this garbage. More deceive me to see it.
