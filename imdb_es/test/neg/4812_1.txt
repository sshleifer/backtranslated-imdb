Why? Why? Why the hell nobody tells the truth about this horrible and horrible movie? I still get up in the morning and ask God why he did not stop me from seeing this disgusting "comedy". I can not believe I paid to see this offense to my cinematic taste. I'm starting to think that the 5 stars that you have are due to the nudity of Martha Higareda and all the men who can not buy a porn movie and avoid seeing this ... I'll call it "thing" because I call it a movie is an insult to the Mexican cinematographic industry. The characters are a big clich√©, the acting causes an involuntary laugh and the script is ... well, I can not believe that a human being has written this. And just when you thought you had already been tortured enough ... the last half hour is so painful that I wanted to tear out my eyes. The only good thing I can say about this abomination is that it only lasted 90 minutes (it would feel like centuries, but still). Really, AVOID THE PAIN!
