A man comes to the office of the psychiatric Dr. Sammael (Joan Severance) who claims to be the demon Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), the torturer of the 13th level of hell, and he would like to tell strange things. He says that he had made a deal with Lucifer to become human again. He should hit his virgin sister Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) the day her mother died and she should kill six people and free the Antichrist, and then he would escape from the well and be reborn. When Mary Elizabeth becomes pregnant, her stressful and abusive sister Catherine (Denise Crosby) does not believe she is a virgin, but her father and former obstetrician Albert Martino (James Callahan) examines her daughter and sees her hymen intact. Meanwhile, the Church discovers the truth about Mary Elizabeth's pregnancy and sends the priest and former Father Anthony (Eddie Velez) to spy on Mary Elizabeth. She is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver, Lars (Jorg Sirtl), who is the lover of her tenant and friend Jennifer (Azalea Davila), and Jennifer herself, who eat their hearts and drink their blood , but she believes that she has nightmares. However, during the ultrasound, she realizes that she is carrying a monster and asks her father to stop her pregnancy. But it's too late. <br /> <br /> The horrible "Born" is a B movie (actually a Z movie) that he believes is a great movie. The result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and a terrible performance and direction. The plot is a complete disaster: there is a priest who is a hitman and former soldier; A demon in existential crisis goes to a psychiatric one; a father who examines his daughter's virginity; Two female demons (succubus?) that are naked as a statue with both hands covering their sexes; a character who is a whore, and only exists to expose her beautiful body. There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. But the worst thing is the performance: the unknown main actress Alison Brie is histrionic, with ridiculous voices and grimaces. I'm sorry, Mrs. Alison Brie, but I hated your annoying performance. I have not recognized Joan Severance, who has a good performance, since she still had the image of her youth. Denise Crosby plays a hateful character and, like everyone else, grew up, but she is still a good actress. I think if the writer and director had included a bit of black humor and assumed that this movie is a B movie, the story could have worked better and better. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Anti-Christ" ("The Anti-Christ")
