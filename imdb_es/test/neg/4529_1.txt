This movie sucks. The problem was not with the cast. I think the cast was great, a lot of great talent, a lot of great acting. But the script was TERRIBLE! It seemed to be mainly a frame work in which Steve Carrell could do his improvisation. And that's what he does best, but it just did not work here. The script was difficult to follow, the story had no meaning and the scenes were random and lacked direction. In addition, much of the action was extremely artificial and ill-conceived. It was a good effort, but as Max says, they missed it SO MUCH! I'm surprised to see how many enthusiastic reviews there are for this stinker here on the IMDb. Obviously, film producers are making people write many positive reviews about their films and fill out the entries in the IMDb. If you read the positive reviews and compare them with the negative reviews, it is quite clear what are genuine criticisms from normal users. <br /> <br /> This movie was full of problems and jokes that simply did not work. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchor Man, and I like his comedy and style. But I'll tell you I never laughed while watching this movie. Yes, I had a couple of light moments, a couple of giggles, but no real laughs. Nothing that has impressed me. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! A ridiculous scene was when Max had his hands tied on the plane and goes to the bathroom to try to escape. Use your special Swiss army knife ... but instead of using THE KNIFE SHEET, try to TRIGGER the tie with your miniature crossbow. And when the crossbow fails and shoots small arrows in it again and again (almost pulling out its EYE), Max does not give up or test the blade ... no, he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow. What did you really expect to do with that crossbow? It seemed to be the worst option on the knife to try to eliminate the links. It just did not make any sense. <br /> <br /> That is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie. They were ridiculous, badly thought, badly motivated and made of pure nonsense. And that was really annoying. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie was a big disappointment and I recommend that you avoid it. A note to the IMDb: I should do something about these false reviews that people are leaving. The authenticity of the site is degraded.
