I did not get Barnens O at all? It's one of the rarest I've seen. The soundtrack was quite unusual too? Written and interpreted by Jean Michel Jarre, it makes the film stranger than it was. I have to admit that I was almost going to change it and see another one in its place, sometimes the movie seemed completely silly or boring. or confusing. There are enough sexual references in that movie? Through them they are also a little disordered. Probably the only phrase I will remember is: "When you are alone, you can control things". and "I'll show you" - or something like that. The boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of ​​not growing up? "Last summer as a child" he thought once? And I'm sure he lived it to the fullest. So if you have a few hours to spare, can you watch this movie? But you will not lose much if you do not.
