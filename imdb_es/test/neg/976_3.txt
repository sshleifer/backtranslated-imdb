Watching Showtime, I had the impression that the producers had the idea of ​​putting Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy for the simple fact of having a movie that starred them both. Apart from that, I can not think of a reason to justify the existence of the movie. It's not that it's not fun in some places, it certainly is, but the concept is so ridiculous that the laughter is a bit mute. <br /> <br /> What really attracted me was the character of Eddie Murphy. It seems that I can not focus my mind on the concept of someone being a police officer as a strictly everyday job. When I was working as a person on the New York State Crime Victims Board, I had to deal with all kinds of cops and ran the gamut between really dedicated and some real slugs, but I can not think of anyone who thought this was simply something. I do it until I do my career in a very distant area. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or someone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy, not the screen version, just to get a job every day? <br /> <br /> Anyway, DeNiro is your basic and hardworking detective. that is in the way of a major arms dealer. He is undercover and Murphy is part of his support. So what does the Murphy showboating do? He calls a reality-based television series like COPS to film the action. <br /> <br /> So DeNiro's bust is blown very high, but the show's producer gets some good pictures of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new television series based on reality. So these unwilling partners join and try to keep working in the DeNiro case with all the available television cameras. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is a fun guy, he loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in Doctor Doolittle movies, but he did better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro has certainly done. <br /> <br /> I guess Murphy wanted to have the opportunity to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have received a considerable salary to make this movie.
