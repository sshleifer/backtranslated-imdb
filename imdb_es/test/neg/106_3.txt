Dr. Stephens (Micheal Harvey) runs an asylum. He has a different approach to the crazy ones. Conducts unorthodox treatment methods. He treats everyone as a family, there are no locks on patients' doors and he allows some of the inmates to represent his twisted fantasies. Let Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) dress and act like a soldier and Harriet (Camilla Carr) become the mother of a doll, even leaving her on a cot. Dr. Stevens is outside letting Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross) cut a log with an ax, turns out to be a bad move, since once Dr. Stevens is back, the Judge places the ax in his shoulder Shortly after, nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the Sanatorium and has arranged an interview with Dr. Stevens about a possible job. She is greeted by the head nurse, Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and is offered a position on the way. She gets to know and becomes very loved among patients. However, over time things start to sour, phone lines are cut, an old woman named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has her tongue cut and begins to have the strange feeling that things are just not right in some way . Then, one night, all the dark secrets of sanatoriums are revealed violently. Produced and directed by S.f. Brownrigg This movie has a great central idea that is based on a great turnaround, but ultimately it is a somewhat difficult task to bear due to low budget constraints and a rather slow script by Tim Pope. There are too many long stretches of boring dialogue on the part of the inmates, it does not take long until the last twenty minutes. The film does not have a real visual quality, since it is completely set in the Sanatorium and has a base that is basically an empty house in the middle of nowhere. There is no graphic gore in it, a few blood spatters here and there and that's a lot. There is a bit of nudity, but the gore is not much. The acting is quite strong, especially Holotik and Weenick. Photography is flat and unattractive, and I can not even remember what music was like. The end of the turn is great, but it only takes too long to get to it. A movie that has great potential that was probably held back by your budget. Well, I suppose, but I think it would have worked much better if the story had become half an hour in the episode 'Tales from the Crypt'.
