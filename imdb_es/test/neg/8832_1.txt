I have seen THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL with the stated aim of refuting this so-called scientific atheist. I do not know where to start, since it is such a rich source of stupidity. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that he is not a statistician; the chances that 2/1 of it will burn through eternity would have pushed him toward belief in God. <br /> <br /> He considers science a religion and expects us to believe as we do to God. You just have to look at the language used in your applications. <br /> <br /> Regarding faith. This product is widely used in everyday behavior. Just think about it. When you enter an electrician, you believe that you will connect correctly and confidently turn on the switch. When you get into a plumber, pull the chain of your bathroom and wait for the water to flow in the right direction. Regarding faith in science When I was in chemistry class, I believed and was taught that the atom was the smallest particle and the onion skin theory of electrons, which have now been discounted. They taught me this as the atomic theory "written in stone," so to speak. So, why should we believe any scientist, especially when he goes beyond the parameters of his field? Dawkins says that religion will be the fall of civilization. Religion is civilization. Can he, or any other atheist, tell us which civilization was founded and nurtured by atheism, barbarism or savagery, please? Now he lives in the last stages of a Christian civilization and obtains all the benefits of it without any admission of its origin. I discovered that Dawkins was arrogant, dictatorial, critical, an obvious believer in eugenics and a Nazi in his attitude towards young people. How dare he say what a father can teach his son? The child belongs to them, not to the nation and, as parents give their genetics, so do their beliefs. His dismissal of Adam as "never existed" since he has no proof was an example of this attitude. So I have no proof that Joe Blogs lives in New York, but he can do it. I just have not found the test yet. That does not deny its existence. I observe his argument with the Bishop of Oxford that the prelate is selective with what he takes and believes in the Bible. Well, Dawkins does this too. Where do you draw the line between him as a historical document and a religious declaration? It is also selective. I heard what happened when Dawkins came up with the ALTRUISTIC gene. What a flash He is desperately searching for proof of his madness and, as the Piltdown Man was invented, we now have this so-called ALTRUISTIC gene that predisposes us to take care of our young people and other members of our 'group'. The problem is that all animals do this - not just monkeys, and with evolution it is the survival of the fittest. he is not the kindest and, if he really believes that we are being more kind as a race, he is not reading the same newspapers as me, I found his arrogance beyond the belief that, since we only have this life, we should enjoy it to the fullest. So how does he equate this with his obvious position as a wealthy European to a destitute person in Africa who has erased his entire family and was probably raped and starving? Will he help her? I observe that all their opposition to religion is a) that they go to war. Well, G K Chesterton declared that the only war worth fighting is a war for religion b) we are against the use of contraception and abortion and homosexuality. All sins against the 6th commandment. It's funny that. <br /> <br /> As a Catholic, I consider that his dismissal of Pius XII's declaration of the Dogma of the Assumption in 1958 is erroneous. He, PÃ­o, never said that it was revealed to him while he was sitting somewhere alone. In case Dawkins does not know, the Revelation ended with the last Apostle. Pius would have taken years of advice and studied documents handed down over the centuries to arrive at this pronouncement. Also as a Catholic I find his dismissal of all religious people satisfied. What absolute garbage. We, every day, fight against the world, the flesh and the devil. We are the Militant Church. We can also boast in a sunset and admire the beauties of nature, even if we believe in God. The problem with Dawkins was that he interviewed crazy fans and we extrapolated them to all of us.
