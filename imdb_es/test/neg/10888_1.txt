This film has to be classified between "Welcome to the Jungle" and "The Hitcher" and "Dream Catcher" out of sheer pity. You have the most annoying heroine in the history of history and spend most of your time crying, crying and screaming, all the time in the most horrible sleeping stop toilet ever filmed. He never explains why he spends so much time in this horrible bathroom of hell. Even when the usual killer truck driver is trying to kill her, she refuses to leave the shit. When a motorcycle policeman comes to his rescue, the killer truck driver runs over the policeman's legs while the heroine watches. Instead of grabbing her weapon to protect herself, she drags the poor vaga into the tray and closes the door. Then the policeman orders him to break his brains because of the pain. He does so, while he groans, sobs and groans, and removes the back of his head. Then, the policeman, still alive, begs him to shoot him again because he still has pain. He says this while the entire back of his head is all over the floor. The sob, the weeping heroine shoots him again. The movie goes on and on, nothing like that makes sense. Heroin is so unpleasant that you really want the killer to abandon her from the start. I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, so it did not cost me anything to watch, but I still did it, out of sheer fascination for how a movie could end so badly.
