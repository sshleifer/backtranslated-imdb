Never before had such a large cast of ugly people gathered to make an equally ugly movie. <br /> <br /> Something huge and frightening is loose in the waters off the coast of Florida, something that leaves half chewed bodies behind. his wake Bob, dependent on unshaven beer, believes he has caught the "evil voice" of the Thing. The assistant of Bob, Stella, incredibly unattractive and painfully thin, decides to count on the help of Peter, an electrician whose team can help them locate the mysterious creature. But anyone who pokes his nose too far into the mystery ends up dead, killed by a baboon who faces a hit man with a bad permanent. What is the terrible secret behind the killer of the sea? <br /> <br /> Ugly scientists have hot topics, inept cops and doctors baffle the growing number of corpses, Stella and Peter build on the beach and characters who do not care about us are killed or grouped. The Sea Killer, a strange combination of octopus, shark and a couple of large dentures, never seems as threatening as it should be. The conspiracy behind the creation of the monster does not make any sense at all. None of the characters is particularly nice, and those who could be killed immediately. This is a bad shot, badly nicknamed, plot less mess. Everything is so disheveled and smelly that it made me want a hot bath. I have had more shocking sushi dishes than this movie. Avoid it, unless it's the MST3K version.
