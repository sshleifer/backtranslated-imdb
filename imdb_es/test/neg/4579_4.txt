There was enough talent and sincerity to make this film that I wish it would be better. Clearly, everyone is doing everything possible to be faithful to an intriguing premise, but it is too deep a vision, too complicated an attempt to unravel mental deception to survive a transition to the screen. It is an attempt to capture the dimensionality of gauze patterns in celluloid: the result is confusing and slow. I give it a 10 for effort, but a 5 in general.
