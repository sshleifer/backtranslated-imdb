There is no shortage of female meats, but they are still not interesting! Lenzi, at least, is much more capable of reaching a peak in Spasmo and starting with Kiss Me Kill Me <br /> <br /> Hard Gore R2's DVD release can be reduced to 86 minutes, but this movie contains a act of cannibalism a victim: a scene with a native girl that is brutalized and destroyed by the cannibal tribe of which we are warned and that later burns some huts. Holocaust incendiary? Firestarter Fernox Anyone? <br /> <br /> It's certainly not a cannibal movie, but did you ever become a decent one? Avoid.
