I met Yvette McClendon in a movie at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought I was a doll. After writing my review of his film there, I wanted to see more of it! I found this movie, it was pretty bad. It's not your fault, it's only in the first minutes that obviously is the person who stops you to see this bad movie. BAD direction. The scenes are repeated again and again, with all the actresses. Amber Smith has a very bad breast job, but the other actresses looked pretty good. I really like Yvette but, obviously, this was a bad choice for her. I can not believe I hired this garbage to look for it. I hope to find your other movies.
