May 2: someone clicked on 11 NO and then proceeded to do 15 more on my previous 15 comments: almost as fun as this turkey! <br /> <br /> May 1: <br /> <br /> As I write this, I still have the impression of what the funniest thriller I've seen in my life should be. I have an important case of laughter, but I will try to calm down. (It's a bit difficult to write when your nose spills out of mucus and your mouth expels sporadic slime on the keyboard). <br /> <br /> A couple of young women who have just returned from a vacation go on a bus. A couple of young guys join them. But the bus is not really a taxi service: it is a kidnapping vehicle. (Do not tease!) Your driver has been part of an organized gang of "white slavery" that grabs young women from airports, and they have been doing it for FIVE years. (Do not laugh). Five years at the SAME airport, without the police or the FBI finding out. (Do not laugh, please). Apparently, dozens of women disappear in the same place for years and years, and yet no one notices a trend. Is the FBI incompetent? The world of "Shuttle" seems to consist of three types of people: easily kidnapped blondes, stupid / comatose / invisible FBI agents and omnipotent psychotic gangsters (who hate sexy blondes with tattooed assholes). <br /> <br /> The driver has barely stayed alive in this unique mission and, nevertheless, he has done it for, I repeat, FIVE years, without having been killed or lost one of its members. (Stop laughing ...) Did I mention that the driver is immortal? Do I need to mention it? We all know that psycho films have an immortal DNA. You can stab them, hit them against the walls of a bus repeatedly, caress them gently with a hammer, poke nine-inch nails into their ears ... Hell, you could put a hand grenade in the mouth of the average Hollywood psycho, and I'd still escape with only small scratches. No, the driver is not Satan or even a minor demon, but a simple Hollywood psychopath with better survival skills than the biggest and meanest sewer cockroach. <br /> <br /> The basic outline of the plot: a man loses all his fingers on the one hand in a silly scene. (A magical bus that reads and obeys minds!) Passengers try to escape. They fail. They get hurt. They get angry They argue. They try to escape. They fail. They get injured. They argue. They try to escape. They fail. They get injured. They try to escape. They fail. They try to escape. The hostages manage to snatch the gun from the driver! Unfortunately, they do not kill him because Gandhi's Golden Hollywood Rule of Pacifism forbids them to do so. (Do not laugh). One of the other passengers turns out to be part of the gang! (Stop laughing). He is played by an actor who studied at Rob Zombie / John Travolta School of Over-Acting & Silly Mugging. He threatens the violation. Later, one of the girls hits him with a crowbar on the head, a dozen times ... very hard. Only a few seconds later he regains consciousness. Yes, he survives. (Immortal, remember?) He is killed a little later. (I have no idea how, though! You're not supposed to kill.) The kidnapped argue. They try to escape. One of them escapes! Unfortunately, psychopaths are too similar to God in their powers not to recapture their prey. The game starts again: the passengers try to escape. They fail. They get angry They stare at the void. They get hurt. They try to escape. They fail. They get hurt ... <br /> <br /> You get the image. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I think that a drunken, drunken and highly disoriented snail would have escaped these nincompoop captors with ease. There were so many opportunities. At one point, these awkward psychopaths (remember: FIVE years!) Even send one of the abductees to a grocery store! She leaves a message to the police. However, yes ... you guessed it: this fictional fairytale city of the USA. UU He does not have a policeman. <br /> <br /> And just as you thought, the movie could not be more silly, not even if Luc Besson and Brian De Palma joined forces to help out with the script, it does. The girls are kidnapped to be sent to some remote island (?), And this is achieved by transporting them as cargo. Apparently, this fictional America has no FBI, no police, and no border customs. However, he has immortal criminals with more luck than twenty lottery winners. A blonde had her millionth opportunity to kill the driver and yet she failed. How is it that the victims of these silly thrillers NEVER try to kill their immortal adversaries once they have them on the ground and injured? I guess I answered myself: they are immortal! So, why bother trying, she should have thought? <br /> <br /> Then, why one blond was killed to death and the other boxed and sent alive (complete with a litter box for kittens, and the funniest picture since Primary school photos? from Demi Moore)? Could it be the tattoo? I think they killed the prettiest, but it's just me. Was his tattoo so ugly? <br /> <br /> Could it be that I do not care? Why should I look for logic in a movie made by imbeciles (for imbeciles)? Also, how can I think clearly when I'm laughing so hard half the time ?! <br /> <br /> Of course, this being a horror / thriller of the 21st century, the mobile phone does not work ... Perhaps this invincible control of gangs not only the FBI, the police and customs, but also the satellites in space. <br /> <br /> Do I have to explain it? There are much easier ways to kidnap people. And many more intelligent people who should be making movies. Give a camera to an idiot and he will lay an egg every time ... That kind of answers responds to the eternal enigma that was first: the egg or the director with the brain of a bird.
