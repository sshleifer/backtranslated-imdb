Yes, the votes are inside. This film may very well be Plan 9 of outer space for our generation. But while Ed Wood's film, despite all its flaws, retains a certain charm despite everything, this film defines the word "without charm" in the ninth grade. In fact, I would suggest to the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary that they cite this film as a key example that defines the word in the next dictionary update. <br /> <br /> Carrot Top is an interpreter of this type. An abysmal ability that the normally rational people I know once they hear his name turn into homicidal maniacs who are dedicated to wanting to kill Mr. Top as soon as possible. In fact, if you go to Amazon.com and look at customer reviews to see the Carrot Top movie and another performance DVD, you will find several that could be interpreted as death threats for Mr. Top. <br /> <br /> Another Curious In fact about this film, I remember that Mike Nelson, the chief writer of MST 3000, in his book Mike's Mega Cheese about movies, good and bad, said he saw this movie and shortly after He could remember nothing, including the title. Obviously Mike suffered a classic reaction to the trauma. Seeing this atrocity was so insensitive that Mike Nelson had to block it from his mind. (Obviously, in a later chapter of his book, Mike Nelson had regained his memory of this movie.) Of the review he offers, Mike Nelson was definitely not grateful for the recovered memory). <br /> <br /> The only comment I offer about the movie, and it's not a spoiler, it's just the honest truth of God, it's not funny. None of that is, even a nanosecond of that is funny.
