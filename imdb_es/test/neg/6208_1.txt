We talk about acting in excess ... !!!! Not only for Govinda, but also for Salman and Lara ... The direction was horrible. The first half hour you would want to turn off the movie ... because this movie is really stinky (mark my words. <br /> <br /> I liked Govinda in some of his comedy roles like Haseena Maan Jaayegi, Jodi No. 1, Akhiyon is Goli Maare and Jis Desh Mein Ganga is Rehta Hai and this does not compare to any of them, and Salman Khan should not do any comedy role, he sucks, he does not know how to do comedy, the only good comedy role he did was in Andaz Apna Apna, which was brilliant next to Amir Khan. <br /> <br /> There were so many scenes "too stupid and without grace" in this movie that makes you want to leave the DVD and record it so that nobody else in your house see it again.
