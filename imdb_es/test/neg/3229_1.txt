I hated the book. A man meets an intelligent dog, he has a virgin girlfriend, and all the time he is being chased by a hired killer and an ape beast (they both love the dog). Dean Koontz can not really write (I read the book on the recommendation of my sister, I should have known better). When I saw this, (mostly by a morbid curiosity) I actually found myself criticizing it for the fact that it was not true in the book, although this is a book from which it is impossible to make a good movie. I thought that at least, if they were going to make a film adaptation of the worst book I've read, the filmmakers could also be precise. They turned the boy and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother, for some reason, that bothered me more than anything (although I seriously doubt that a boy and his girl had not improved it). Very simple; Bad book, bad movie, I do not see it.
