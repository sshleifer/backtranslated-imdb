It was silly Something like an Adam Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> There were some fun parts but not so funny. <br /> <br /> Although I liked some of the actors. <br /> <br /> There were some Saturdays. Live the people of the night in the movie. But I would not recommend this unless there is nothing better. And it was still better than any Jennifer Lopez movie.
