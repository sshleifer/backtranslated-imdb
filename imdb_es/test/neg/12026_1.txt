You know, I really hate the IMDb censorship system, since my full review almost disappears if you remove the curse. But here we go. Editing time! <br /> <br /> Holy moley is that bad. I thought it could be a great little movie, judging by the plot summary, since I have already blindly rented gems like Frailty and American Nightmare before. But this is simply abominal. He is a murderer who uses the works of Edgar Allen Poe as a reference for his murderous exploits, and the story of a detective who has to stop him. Can not these blithering hacks make a good movie without staining the grave of a great horror writer? I mean, the murders here are completely devoid of thought or originality, and the references to Poe are hokey and false, without thinking enough about them. They are shallow, and they put Poe's work to shame. Full of holes, with horrible sequencing. The performance is also bad, it reminds me of the abortion that was known in some third world countries as "Fear X", with all the lines of pause and not emotional. <br /> <br /> I realize that this is an indie. Movie, but that's no excuse. I've seen the boys in high school perform better than these idiots, and I myself could have devised better scenes of killing and a better plot, given enough time. <br /> <br /> This does not have to exist. Avoid at all costs.
