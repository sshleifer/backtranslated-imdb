I liked the movie a bit, it's just that the characters run without real sense of their madness. As I was saying, poor goat. The goat was not there while the guy was pretending to grind it. I would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic (though not the goat's). Jane Ryall who played Celia only made this movie. She was very naked in everything. This crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful place. I almost forgot about the couple of gay transvestites who are also chosen because they are sinners. If you like crazy things, then this is your movie. 3/10
