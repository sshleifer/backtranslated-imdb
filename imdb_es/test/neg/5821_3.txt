I saw this movie at our crossroads film festival, and I was looking forward to it because it was filmed in Mississippi and starring Karen Black. I felt very disappointed by the awkward script that never flowed and the apparent lack in the effort of the actors and the director to understand something about the culture they tried to portray. How did Lee and Griffin become such deep friends in five minutes? Which of the two was fucking the girl under the tree? It was not clear. And, there seems to be a certain law in Hollywood about southern accents, and you rarely hear anything that comes close to the everyday sounds of the south. In spite of the horrible thing, "this must be how they sound, it simply softens the" r "" approach to dialogue, so many times the actors disappear altogether. Aleksa, in particular, sounded like a New York street during the "emotional" scenes, and no one sounded in any way. The character of Walt Goggins was supposed to be from the city of Morgan, Louisiana, but it was nothing like the combination of New Orleans and Cajun accents of that city. The other annoying point seemed to be the writer's impulse to make us feel that all men must have homosexual impulses within him. Before starting a firestorm here and they accuse me of homophobia, I have enjoyed many movies with themes of gay love, in particular "punks" "when love arrives" and "b monkey". But this seemed to be the desire of some man over all the young people. Well, Tennessee Williams has already covered this field, and did a much better job. So, I wonder, if the Coen brothers can get the regional accent and culture in the Minnesota and Mississippi films, why can not anyone else do it? What a waste of my time.
