I could not. I was bored, not only because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was just a movie in which the whole plot was about cannibalism, but the fact that I was watching a subtitle of a foreign film, which does not bother me not at all, but STILL was bent. <br /> <br /> The "special effects" were terrible. When the back part of the plane separates, you can see that the model is hollow, since it "detaches" in the fake snow. Most of the film takes place in a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play, since you can hear the "sounds" of snow blowing everywhere but not actually the scene. <br /> <br /> "But what are they going to eat? They do not have food," says a soldier (it's never clear what this guy does or why he's in charge), which, I'm sure, nobody said in Reality did not even think about the food, since they were worried. If people were alive, not as they ate. It was simply a stupid line written to indicate that, yes, they will have to eat the corpses to survive. <br /> <br /> When they finally decide to eat the bodies, a man finds a body without a shirt, which despite being in the snow for a long time, does not freeze remotely, in fact, his flesh is very flexible and fresh . He cuts the fresh meat off his back, which again, is not frozen or even cold, and this scene continues for five minutes. That's where I had to stop. The remake "Alive" was a far superior movie about how to try to survive in a horrible situation that I'm sure the true survivors praised, while I can not imagine that any of them had anything good to say about this version. It was simply eating corpses and everything else was secondary. Avoid.
