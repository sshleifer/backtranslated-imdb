This fucking dramatic adaptation scrambles remorselessly the plot of Dickens's wonderful book, replacing the emotional impact with hasty transitions and any exterior location with drawings. It is not the actors' and production team's fault that the budget is so low, of course, but you have to question the point of doing this in the first place when there is no time or money to do justice. Michael Hordern's Scrooge is too soft at first, which makes his transformation powerless, and this is not affected by his lack of reaction when he observes the visions. The other actors range from the acceptable (Clive Merrison, Paul Copley) to the non-committed (Bernard Lee) and it seems that they are about to forget their lines (John Le Mesurier). He does not even earn points for effort, to be honest.
