I do not understand what I like most about this movie! I do not understand why high school kids should see this! I do not understand why this should have made me think of anything in the least! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> When the girl who does not notice is on the way to commit suicide Was I the only person who encouraged her? The clichéd classical music, the long follow-up shots, the melancholy emotion of the film in that stage made me go back to what was intended. It would only have been happy if she had entered the room and the entire cast was there with her scissors to cut her wrists. <br /> <br /> Why? <br /> <br /> Because I went to high school ... and frankly I'm sick of watching movie after movie in Australia with teenagers who rely exclusively on terrible clichés. I have waited years for a younger person to write a movie that I can relate to and this emo rubbish stereotype is what I got. It was like a dark version of a great anguish that needed a predictable end. <br /> <br /> Why are all teenagers in Australian dramas depressed or have really strange problems that simply are not counted in a plausible way? <br /> <br /> On the positive side, this was more fun than "Blurry." And I needed a good laugh.
