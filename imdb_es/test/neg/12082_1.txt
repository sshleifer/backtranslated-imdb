Jane Eyre with full frontal nudity! I was not surprised to see that a woman had a hand in this horrible "woman's photo" and I say it in the worst possible way. The problem is that it could have been so good if only Jane Eyre's things had been omitted and the much more interesting scenes involving the Spanish / Portuguese Jews at the beginning of the 19th century in London had been left. When the music on the sound track is better than the movie, you know you're in trouble. When you advance the video because you can not stand the movie, just to make sure you do not miss anything, you're in even worse trouble. This movie will end in the romance television channel to which it belongs correctly.
