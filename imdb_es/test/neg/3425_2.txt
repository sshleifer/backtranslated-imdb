An interesting concept that turned into a butcher shop ... <br /> <br /> My first feature of Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper), when I became interested for the first time, seemed at that moment an interesting concept ... <br /> <br /> Shakespere + Aussie Film + Gothic architecture + Melbourne Gangland <br /> <br /> A very strange mix that turned into a disastrous piece of Australian cinema that gives my country a bad name ... <br /> <br /> Pros: - Interesting concept <br /> <br /> Cons: - Loss of a good deal - Stuffed and stupid road - Camera angles twisted - There is not much variety of places - Dialogue course Shakespearian <br /> <br /> In general: the worst attempt of a Shakespeare film in Australia, Stick to Baz Lurhman ... or Break Stomper (WARNING: that movie is dangerous)
