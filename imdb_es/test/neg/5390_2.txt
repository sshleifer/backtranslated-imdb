Most other publications outperform this film, and deservedly so. I just got acquainted with the technical ineptitude of the filmmakers. It would have been good if the director had at least had lunch with someone who knew what a weapon was, because he had no idea. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!! <br /> <br /> Stupidity: <br /> <br /> The Spec Ops team gathered from several military units whose members had never met before. <br /> <br /> Maybe two people in the unit had weapons that used the same magazines, parts, ammunition, etc. <br /> <br /> The sniper school instructor uses a sub-machine gun (pistol caliber) instead of a rifle that we would assume would be more competent. <br /> <br /> The night vision optics of a poor member of the team weigh more than the rifle. You can know when it handles it, which is VERY BIG. <br /> <br /> The team leader sends a team member to "challenge" the Skeleton Man when they face him for the first time. Challenge a 200-year-old Native American skeleton with a long spear and an attitude mounted on an undead war horse with severe nosebleed? I do not think so, Bubba. <br /> <br /> The bullets do not light when they hit the trees, Mr. Director. (A couple of people have already mentioned it). <br /> <br /> The "air support" teams consist of a ubiquitous "black helicopter", only this one has a pair of sidewinder missiles hanging below. Someone forgot to tell the crew of helo that the Skeleton Man does not fly, and they are over the heart of the United States where there will be no enemy plane. Instead, they should have brought some air missiles to the ground. <br /> <br /> The helo air-to-ground artillery consists of a door gunner with a semiautomatic AK-47 (or 74?). Needless to say, it only hits the ground. I should have brought a light machine gun with a belt. <br /> <br /> The door gunner then discovers that a grenade launcher is also quite useless. <br /> <br /> A wooden arrow of a cursed recurve bow does not with helicopters, Mr. Director. <br /> <br /> Pretty well I could not take it anymore after this point (about 30 minutes) and I gave up. Seriously, you need a drip of morphine to get through this movie, it's that painful.
