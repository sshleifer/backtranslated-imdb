The empty shortening of John Irving's novel strives to deepen with courage, but ends up being absurd. It is a series of extravagant, ridiculous and bittersweet sketches that try to explain the growth of a man from his birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him. Garp is born of a formidable single mother, Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close. (The different stages of Garp's childhood are played by three young actors before Robin Williams takes over when Garp reaches adulthood). In high school, where Jenny is the school nurse, through her passion for high school: struggle, writing and sex, towards marriage with her high school girlfriend, children, marital problems and a writer's career. Meanwhile, Jenny has become a famous feminist, who defends an unorthodox cause. The plot details a large number of comic and tragicomic episodes and extravagant adventures. Williams gives a cherub face performance. This script was not appropriate for his madness and anarchy and, therefore, his talent was wasted. It's like a wounded bird that goes out of control. The role of John Lithgow as a father as a transsexual, imparting wisdom, does not make sense either. This film was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982, due to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new entry into movies. Williams had recently abandoned his Mork and Mindy activities and had focused more on comedies and movies. Audiences were confused by this film, especially by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.
