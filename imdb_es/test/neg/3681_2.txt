I was hooked on the premise that the show was about demons. From hell. And a door to hell. What I did not realize is that I would be seeing some guys running through tunnels chased by little kids that may / may not have been demons for the whole movie. Of course there was an intermediate dialogue and a large underground stage, but the lack of a plot, the characters developed, any twisting or development in the story was unimportant. Oh, and for interest, there were no special effects. The entire budget was spent on actors' salaries, sets and a lot of time running with a camera underground. <br /> <br /> The ending was one of the typical dull and dull endings that make you say "I endured this boredom movie ... for that !?" If you want to see demons and a door to hell, I promise that you will be better off seeing the trailers of the game Hellgate: London, which although it is shorter than this movie at 5 minutes, includes more dialogues, character development, action, plotting and get satisfactory conclusions that this. <br /> <br /> The second star is for effort, but in general it has a low score for not making a movie that stands out, and for promising in the slogan much more than what was delivered.
