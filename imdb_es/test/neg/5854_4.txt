ASTROESQUE (2 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the title is supposed to be ... even less of an idea of ​​what is supposed to be happening in this movie half the time .. Still, it still kept me somewhat interested. This is a low and low budget movie of "El Mariachi", filmed in 16 mm ... and, for what it's worth, the shots are very well composed and visually elegant. Directed, written and starred by the writer / comic artist Michael Allred ... I guess it's no wonder the movie looks good. Unfortunately, part of the performance is more than bad ... and the rest is competent at best. Allred himself gets better ... but only because he does not really talk much. He just walks around looking great the most of the time ... or running away from crazed rednecks that are trying to kill him. The sound is also pretty bad ... almost as if it was not finished in some places ... maybe they could not afford the music they had planned to use? A strange plot, vaguely science fiction ... similar in tone to "The man who fell to the ground" ... but most of the film is reduced to a standard of bad guys and kill them before. -They kill you. Ultimately, too oblique to succeed, but not without interest for moviegoers adventurous.
