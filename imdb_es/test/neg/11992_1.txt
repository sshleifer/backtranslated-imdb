Mr. "Uwe Fail" attacks again, transformed a classic game into a piece of cheap junk. Bad performance; Poor direction; Horrible adaptation; I mean, the Far-Cry game was amazing, it's like a real FPS game, great weapons and a lot of "point and shoot". In the movie we did not have anything compared to the game ... Well, we had some "point and shoot" but ... I do not know how to explain it, but if you ever saw another "Uwe Fail" movie, you'll understand. If you do not believe me, go to the "online petition" website and check out one called "Stop Uwe Bowl." <br /> <br /> That movie made my eyes bleed, someone must stop it for once. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
