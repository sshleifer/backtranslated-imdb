I'm a big fan of Eric Roberts, I collect his films and until now I've reached 60. But I'm honest to say that sometimes he really makes horrible movies. But that's why I like it, he's entertaining. <br /> <br /> But this has to pay the price, I can not help but wonder why. Somehow they managed to get Eric and also Corbin Bernsen to come on the scene. <br /> <br /> Although Bernsen is simply horrible (I really do not like it), Roberts manages to be the best in the movie (and that does not mean much). Practically it does it in a routine way. <br /> <br /> The female protagonist (Brasselle) looks like a plastic doll and acts as such. And Tim Abell and his crew look like plastic action dolls and they behave like that. <br /> <br /> The plot is really embarrassing. I have not seen any of the Carnosaur movies, so I can not remember the images that have been added from there, but it explains some things. But there are still huge holes like craters in the plot. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> The first attacks are located outside the laboratory in the nearby forest. But in the end, they destroy the whole laboratory and simply relax because everything is over, but they forgot about those outside. <br /> <br /> <br /> When the helicopter pilot eats alive, I wonder how. she could not notice a T-rex getting on the helicopter ???? <br /> <br /> The guys in an orange jumpsuit are my favorites, what are they doing, going for a run or what? <br /> <br /> Of course, there is also a standard B movie sex scene with silicone titles. This time it is Lorissa McComas who greets us. I have no problem with that (it looks horrible), but to look at a guy squeezing her tits and on the verge of climax for 8 !!!! the minutes are too long. <br /> <br /> It's a shame for all of you (including Eric Roberts) - Now I hope to see Con games (I wonder ???)
