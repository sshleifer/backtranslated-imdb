Take it as a cameraman who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and then Warners Bros and Paramount from 1950 to 1993, this is crap. Of course it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party, but trying to sell this on a DVD is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I have seen bad performance in my day, but this is NOT acting. The hero is almost ridiculous and really believes that it is something that is based on his comments on the specials. I hate to see your fan club. The old movies did not match the action in many of the scenes. What the hell was that garden scene with three of the worst actresses. I never saw a garden on a boat. They could not even emote. I would not mind if they could have an ounce of acting, but the only one was the guy with the translvanian accent. I'm sorry, but this is not a smart movie as some people say. I would think that fans of horror movies would be insulted by this piece of film.
