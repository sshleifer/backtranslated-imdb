Probably, the director was still in his early stages of learning when he tried westerns. Take a look at the costumes. Everyone looks well scrubbed, well brushed, well dressed and ironed as if they were ready for church. Even horses look well groomed and bright. This is a western, to shout out loud! It is supposed to look dusty, unpleasant and sweaty. And then there is the amateur performance of the females in this bird. The whole lot, a dozen or so, all pretty and well endowed, were newly raped and widowed, but hardly a tear flows. Instead, they all look with great interest (if not outright lust) at the seven magnificent newcomers who later feed, sell and console with love during their battles with the bandits. The same management criticism applies to Lee van Cleef, who does a good job of reasonable acting. Our Lee, playing the law, has just lost his beloved wife. But Lee, hard as organic rock, shows no emotion and is a few days after the disappearance of his wife in the arms of a juicy widow with whom he, along with his offspring, moves into the future. The cad. And then there is another thing that always bothers me with this kind of movies: it does not matter how many dynamite-induced explosions take place in the middle of a group of about 50 horses, no matter how many shots are being fired. the rabble over them, only the thieves are killed and the annoying always go their own way rejoicing in one piece. (I know ... silly moi ... it's just a movie ...). It's not the worst western ever made, but be prepared for a big yawn.
