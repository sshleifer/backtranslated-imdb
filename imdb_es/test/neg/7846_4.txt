Tycoon will never be listed as one of John Wayne's best Stagecoach post. It is good in places, it has some excellent action sequences in the cave and also in the flood at the climax. But the plot leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> What we have in Tycoon are two men who are completely upset and that dislike prevents them from working as a team. Billionaire Cedric Hardwicke hired John Wayne and James Gleason to build a railroad. But then he refuses to give them the necessary funds to do the job well. <br /> <br /> Things get very complicated when Wayne falls in love with Hardwicke's daughter, Laraine Day. After a night in which they have to spend time alone in an Inca ruin, by convention in South America, Wayne and Day marry a shotgun even if nothing happened. <br /> <br /> What should have happened is that these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours to resolve their differences in one way or another. Their petty spirits cause some deaths among Wayne's crew. <br /> <br /> But what Tycoon is best known for is another piece of pettiness. Laraine Day married Leo Durocher, the manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, when he was filming. It was a constant presence on set, incredibly jealous of John Wayne, who thought he might be having an affair with his wife. None of that, but it made his wife's life miserable. <br /> <br /> It was not one of the duke's best efforts.
