Visitors is a hard movie, difficult to enjoy. It is so slow and slow in its rhythm that sometimes I was moving away during the movie. This was around 11 am on a hot, sunny day, I must add, not midnight on a cold winter night, so it gives an idea of ​​how slow this movie is. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that it is not long. At 100 minutes, it's only ten minutes longer than the average direct video, and only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Dark Wolf I'd seen happily the day before. Simply drag a large amount, enough for you to lose interest. <br /> <br /> When it comes to not confusing the development of S-L-O-O-W with the atmosphere, visitors are good enough in the action to almost excuse the slowness of things. While the flashbacks are cheap and annoying as a way to complete the Radha Mitchell boats, the apparitions / aliens / whatever they are are pretty creepy and effective, especially when their suicidal mother appears and starts moaning at night. An outstanding not to splurge makeup throughout the store too. The boat for a single person is a creepy place and sometimes the film uses all the power of the location and the desolate sea to scare you. <br /> <br /> Even so, I find it difficult to recommend Visitors Not only did I feel like I had just watched a 4 hour film, not 100 minutes, but I also felt that I had been cheated in some way, while offering many explanations about ghosts (mental games? Ghosts? Space foreigners?) Visitors do not choose one to define it. All this seeing Radha Mitchell talking to her cat and Dominic Purcell burning for no obvious reason about some horrible unexplainable event in the past, at all? Say what you like about Shyamalan, but at least he tells you what happened, no matter how crazy / stupid you think it is. If you do not see many of these movies, your new perspective will probably improve things a bit, but this seemed slow, boring and highly derivative. If you want to be scared, there are better places to do it, if you want an intelligent thriller, there are many who are smarter.
