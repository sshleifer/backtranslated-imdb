Not to be confused with the unpleasant parody of Michael Ritchie's beauty contest in 1975, this "Smile" is an example of those good intentions that pave the way to hell. <br /> <br /> The film parallels two stories: an impoverished Chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise an orphan of facial deformity named Ling (Yi Ding), and a Malibu family begotten in the Television represents "Gidget Get Birth Control". Katie (Mika Booram, the third twin of Olsen) plays a middle school student spoiled and self-absorbed, distanced from reality. His teacher (Sean Astin) paves the way for a school trip to China meant to show students how to work with deformed children. <br /> <br /> The film uses deformity as a means of suspense when treating Ling as Frankenstein's monster. Kramer continually masks his deformity through hats, hoods and camera placement. This approach exploits the quality of abnormal spectacle inherent in the material. She may feel uncomfortable with the way society sees her, and Kramer's response is to cover her until the great revelation. Why bother your audience with such displeasure? We see her face briefly at the end and just a few minutes before closing the credit, the snapshots of her after the surgery reveal a swan under the lefty. It is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; what is imperative is that Ling is just as hot and popular as Katie. <br /> <br /> The funds for the film come from a trust established by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They imagined a heritage of quality family films. Give me "Son of Paleface" any day.
