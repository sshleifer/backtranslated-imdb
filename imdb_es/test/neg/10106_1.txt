From the terrible special effects onwards, I was absolutely surprised at how bad someone can make a movie. Let's put it this way, I have absolutely no directing experience and, for the first time, when watching a movie, I thought, "I can do better than that while sitting down watching this dad." The acting in this movie was terrible, I suppose that the best actor was the Lawnmower Man type, but the French man from Aliens3 was so cunning that I wondered how he had gotten the previous work.The story was mediocre and I suppose, like most movies, if the rest had been Well done, I would have gotten up. Normally I do not write reviews here, but after seeing a couple of people gave this movie a good rating (it must be chosen / team).
