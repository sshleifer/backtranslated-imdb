The time travel is theoretical, so I can give the script a margin of maneuver. <br /> <br /> I also understand the concept that by changing a single variable, it is possible to change the way the story was developed. <br /> <br /> What I can not understand, however, is the way the change developed over time. We are subject to a series of "time waves" that progressively retrograde the planetary evolution. While this is a convenient plot device, since it allows our heroes enough time to solve the problem, it does not make any sense. Surely, if a variable changes, and that variable has altered significantly, or even completely, the planetary evolution, then, when it returns "to the future", the evolutionary process will have already been established and there would be no need for waves. ? After all, why would a change that happened 65 million years ago have to wait until now to be effective? The fact that the moth has been projected forward in time may give it some credibility, but the life of that moth 65 million years ago was significantly altered, ergo, any change in the evolutionary history would have begun then, and it would not depend of a return to our current time. <br /> <br /> To solve the problem, the team goes back in time to prevent the change in the variable from occurring. By doing this successfully, we see that the changes in evolution never happened, and that no one even remembers the events! Surely, what works for the solution should it work for the original change? I like a good science fiction adventure, but unless it is established "in a very distant galaxy" it must have at least some basis in the theoretical possibility of making it really entertaining. <br /> <br /> Good premise, bad plot, reasonable acting and, to be fair, just a turn in Jurassic Park. <br /> <br /> Not on my "see again" list.
