This formula film (the hero's girlfriend marries the villain) simply did not advance fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story. Scott seems too old in this, and many times his character moves away from the decisive action, deflating the scenes. It responds weakly to the death of some of their hands; he escapes from the Knox gang by hiding in a barrel full of rain; His escape to the high country and the pursuit of John Russell seem superfluous, as much of the film. The plot could have been tight. <br /> <br /> Important points of the film: see "Tennessee" Ernie Ford without a mustache singing "Man in the Saddle"; The too short scenes of Alfonso Bedoya as cook; The color photograph of the high country and the scene of the fight with John Russell.
