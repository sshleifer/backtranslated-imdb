To summarize, skip the End of Days and look to rent the Ninth Gate of Roman Polanski. This movie is the stereotypical perfect movie of EE. UU Vs Ninth Gate, and it is the perfect European stereotypical film. <br /> <br /> Ninth gate: Noir-ish, intelligent, well punctuated, atmospheric, excellent performance (Johnny Depp, esp), beautiful set design, good cinematography, funny phrases, intellectuals, minimal rude language, stimulating. The only flaw is that some people did not understand the open end and said the film was "horrible" because of that and that there were a couple of questionable scenes. <br /> <br /> End of Days: Overly violent and liberal use of rude language, NO musical score, except for a poor attempt at a commercial soundtrack that was only heard when Gabriel Byrne stalked in New York City like Satan (but all he could distinguish was the unintelligible cry of Jonathan Davis of Korn), sex that I had nothing to do with plot, violence, incredibly predictable, violence, and did I mention much more violence? I guess some of the special effects were good, but that's it. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that Ninth Gate was much more interesting, quirky, original and intelligent. But maybe Americans do not need to need that. * dripping cynicism * Although I am American, sometimes I wonder.
