I remembered this horrible movie that I bought at the Camelot music store in the summer of 1989 when I was visiting my grandparents. It was a time when he had just discovered films like Re-Animator, From Beyond, The Return of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. I was ready for everything the horror / gore genre had to offer ... or so I thought! I was only 12 years old at the time, so I really do not remember it that well. I remember a psychopath running around with a corkscrew killing people, and a couple of cops (I think) traveling in a car that did not really move, but that were moved from side to side to look like it was ... I also remember that it was the worst movie I had seen so far and I quickly threw it away. <br /> <br /> Something this night made me think about that movie (I can not believe I really remembered the name), so I jumped on imdb to see if it was on the list. To my surprise ... it was! And another 5 people have seen it ... incredible. Although I remember hating the movie at the time, I wish I had hidden it somewhere because I would love to take a look at it to laugh (it would probably be a good movie of drinking games). Anyway, I'm glad to be part of the little elite that has seen this little "treasure". I'd love to pick it up somewhere for a couple of dollars ... but beware, this is not a recommendation ... it's awful ... it's just for nostalgia.
