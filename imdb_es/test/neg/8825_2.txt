Othello is ready to burn the eyes of the viewers of this movie. The bad description of the characters of Shakespeare, and the terrible interpretation of the love that Desi and John had, made of this film the horrible shame that it is. By far, Othello, directed by Jeffery Saks, is beyond mediocre and atrocious. <br /> <br /> The movie Othello is an unfortunate drama about the love between John and Desi. Their mutual fidelity will be tested by the friend of man. In the opening scene of the film, it is clearly shown that the love between John and Desdemona is inseparable beyond belief. Moments later, Ben Jago, John's friend appears on the screen frightening the spectators and showing them immediately how lying and power hungry he is. <br /> <br /> By far, this movie was much more horrible than Shakespeare's own novel. That said, it has a minuscule amount of good parts. For example, the love that was shown between John and Desi, was well represented and it seemed that the couple was so inseparable; As explained in the book. Although the love between them was exceptionally good, it still did not show the jealousy that Othello had between Cass and Desi as he should. <br /> <br /> Love, jealously, cheating, this movie is based on the three main themes of Shakespeare's novel. However, the novel really explains how all this came together much better than the movie. For example, the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film. It also puts a lot more detail in the novel. This is the reason why this film is so disappointing, trust me, those who have read it will also find it disappointing. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film was, by far, the most horrific representation of a novel that has ever been published by humanity. By avoiding watching this movie, the spectators will not only save an hour two of their lives, but will also save an eye or two of the unpleasant face of Ben Jago that appears to them.
