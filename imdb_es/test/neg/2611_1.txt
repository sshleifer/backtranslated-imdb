This movie may have been the first Puppet Master, but I got bored to death when I saw this stupid movie, I wanted a refund. This was a bad series for the Puppet Master and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks it was terrible. For some it was great, but for others it was a ticket for snoring and children, are they right? The puppets did not even do anything or kill people. People should not see it, so I warn you not to see it. You will be disappointed even with the fans who love Puppet Master, it was a waste of time and he did not make so much money. Nobody even killed anyone, but one or two, very useless. 1/10
