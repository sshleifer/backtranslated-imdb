I saw it as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they have better films than this, because this film did not offer any of the hopes that the public could have received, from the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt, to simpler desires, like a decent performance, a coherent address. , character development, or real production values. Affected by the effects of film school, such as frozen frames to show moments of emotional distress and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this film failed on almost every level to attract the audience. After the first twenty minutes of trying valiantly to take it seriously, the audience collectively raised their hands and began to enjoy the inherent evilness of the film. I could be upset about having paid nine dollars to see it, and it was two hours that I will never go back, but on the other hand, it was two hours of fun that I will never go back. This would have been a classic episode of Mystery Science 3000.
