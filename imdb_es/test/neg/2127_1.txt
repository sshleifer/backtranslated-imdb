Go <br /> <br /> I have seen quite a few bad movies in my days, many of them in the company of Mike, Tom, Crow and the others of MST3k. This was the case as well, and although the movie itself seemed quite fun, it would not have been so much fun without the MST3k comment. <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent example of really bad films that come out of Europe during the eighties. Horrible music, horrible acting, horrible plot (what little there is), horrible dialogue and really, really, REALLY, horrible edition. Cripes. <br /> <br /> This could be called turkey if it were not for the fact that it is not unique in any way. It's pretty much the same kind of movie that almost all of a director's Italian pirates did. <br /> <br /> Then, try to get the MST3k version. It's a pretty funny episode with Mike and a gang in good shape.
