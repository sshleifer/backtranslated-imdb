First, "the Mexican werewolf in Texas" is not a werewolf movie. This title is bullcrap. The story is actually about a Chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the small town of Furlough in Texas. I guess the distributors changed the name of the original title so that it would earn a few extra dollars or something like that. And I guess it really works because that's the reason I bought this piece of shit, it sounded so stupid. Anyway, the movie is not good at all. Actually it's damn horrible. But I did not expect anything else when I bought it. It's a low budget horror movie with a monster from Chupacabra. If you enjoy the horror of low budget with a bad dialogue, actors and some blood, you should see this movie. But I must warn you that this movie is really baaaaaaad. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the worst performances I've seen in my life. The actors try hard and become completely ridiculous. They almost never say a line in a normal way. They always have this completely wrong tone about everything they say. It is so stupid that it almost looks like a monstrous parody. It's as if they filmed each scene only once and were happy with that. The worst of them all is the blonde girl who is supposed to play a bimbo. She is the worst of them all. I've never seen an actor as bad as her (and I've seen Pteradactyl). Even when her boyfriend dies, she can not help being silly about it. I hate her. <br /> <br /> Some of the shots of this movie were pretty good. Those that were shot during the day are all pretty decent for a low budget project. But most of the film is shot at night when the Chupacabra attacks and the lighting is too dark. The bloody scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and violent. The effects are pretty funny actually, but that's how I like it. The Chupacabra looks pretty messy, and it's easy to see that it's a man in a suit. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie should only be seen by fans of low budget films and it is very important not to see this alone. because you will probably get bored to death. I recommend watching this movie with your friends and a little beer.
