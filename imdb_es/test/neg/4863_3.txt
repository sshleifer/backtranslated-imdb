Would you be surprised if I told you that this movie is about a conspiracy? Do not? What if I told you that the leader was a shadow puppet? What? You do not believe me? ... OK. Yes, I made it up. It's a shame, this movie could have used a sense of humor. I understand that Charlie Sheen did this at that time (another movie matched more money) in terms of Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton ... why? I do not even mean Stephen Lang. It was as fun as the Party Crasher in 'The Hard Way' and now this crap. <br /> <br /> Oh, it does not matter. Everyone involved should feel ashamed. If your goal is to make a bad film and succeed, it is crooked, but I seriously doubt that was what they aspired to. Broadly speaking, history sucks and we are really supposed to take this yak seriously. It makes you wonder if this movie had a glimmer of hope. Seriously, I doubt it and in an industry so tight with the ropes of the bag, how this lit up in green, in the first place, it surpasses me. Perhaps even more terrifying is how this bunch of dogs made their way to the theaters! <br /> <br /> Oh ... Sam Waterson, how big you are in Law and Order. Why are you here? If he dedicates himself to the role of the President of the United States, whom I should add, he can be shot with a remote controlled biplane controlled by the gonzo killer. Once again, this is a masterpiece of the work of George P. Cosmatos whose "direction" credits include Rambo: First Blood Part II among other gems. Hmm .... case in question?
