I must admit that, despite all the promotion of the media and being nominated for the Oscar, my expectation of the film was not so high before I saw it. And I really found what I expected; a film that tries to be nice for both conservatives and liberals in Turkey, which tries to be authentic to foreign viewers and fun enough for everyone. But it must be understood that it is not possible to be favorable for all, therefore, the film remains average for all. <br /> <br /> The whole movie tells a story that happened within 24 hours. To fit the short story to a full movie, some scenes are added without connection to the main story. These are mostly ice cream sale scenes for the local eccentrics (ie, goat herders, old women, etc.), and each of these sale scenes tries to be interesting to the viewers by parodies with comic dialogues. The issue is mentioned as a universal problem: the struggle of a local producer and merchant against holding companies and monopoly, but this was the interesting subject of twenty years before. Most readers will remember the "Hero grocer against supermarket" by Ferhan Sensoy in the 80s. This was the right story at the right time. In short, the story is not strong enough and it's worth being a movie like now. <br /> <br /> Except some gibbers due to the local accent, the performance of the cast is so successful. Turan Ozdemir plays the lead role with excessive body language, but it is also successful anyway. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, against the limited budget, the appreciable efforts of the director and the players obviously give good humor to the film. But this is not resulting in a film good enough to compare it with Italian neo-realists or to be nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Note: In real life, normally the ice cream seller would stop their own production. and be the distributor of one of the competitors of the Manda brand.
