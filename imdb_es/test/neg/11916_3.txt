I just spent the last half hour reading the other reviews and I do not know if I want to laugh or cry. There is no way for ADJL to be like Harry Potter, Danny Phantom, Fairly OddParents, other than a secret magic world, which has been almost exaggerated. Also, by no means is the ADJL anime. Anime is a lot of drawing style (and some will say more, like the Japanese plot and origin), anyway ADJL is not anime, so stop saying it is and if you look for something that is like anime, look in another side, like Teen Titans and Avatar. <br /> <br /> ADJL is typical. It's like all the other Disney shows. An arrogant child of a main character who believes he knows everything and does not bother to listen to people who are older than him and continues to make the same mistakes. The best friends friends. Repetitive plot with a touch of a touch. And the rivalry between brothers. Can not a character who has a brain and is not full of himself once? Can not children respect their elders? Can not you think of something different with the plot? Can not they make the brothers get along and do not hate each other? ADJL is too generic, because you also have bad guys who are defeated and come back again, and they are also complete idiots, who have no background for their hatred. Come on, you will think that someone who is at least 30 years old will be able to overcome a 13-year-old child. <br /> <br /> Watching ADJL is like watching almost anything else on TV this day, the same as before. and again Nothing special, just new character designs and a little idea that has been used again and again.
