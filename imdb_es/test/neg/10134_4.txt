Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark Middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniac partner are chasing you. Where is the last absolute place you want to hide? I would say that inside the strange torture device of the Virgin of Nuremberg, because there is a good risk that you will be brutally killed. And yet, the old woman in this movie stumbles stupidly with her spiked coffin. "The Vampire's Coffin" is a rather disappointing sequel, since director Fernando Méndez does not recreate the Gothic atmosphere of 1957, but rather emphasizes comical situations and dialogues. No more sinister castles with mysterious cobwebs and dark vaults, but confused doctors and clumsy assistants that provoke laughter instead of jolts. The story begins inside the final resting place of the Earl of Lavud, where an eminent doctor and a hired assistant steal the casket to examine the corpse in a private clinic. Naturally, the wooden stake is removed from his heart, and the vampire count returns to live, immediately enslaves the little thief to do his dirty work. The vampire has his eyes on a beautiful patient in the clinic, and it is up to Dr. Enrique Saldívar to rescue his soul and destroy the leech. "Vampire coffin" uses a limited number of locations and there is very little action. The whole movie would be really boring if it were not for a handful of memorable sequences and decent performances. Photography is amazing, however, with the sublime use of shadows and darkness. This is especially noticeable during the scene in which the Count of Lavud stalks a young girl through the deserted streets of the small town at night. It is the only scene that is worth the whole movie, the rest is quite mediocre and déjà-vu.
