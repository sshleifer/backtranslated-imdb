The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover, but we discovered that it was a picture of her from another movie. Unfortunately, she is in this movie very little. However, you can see how far it has come. <br /> <br /> The other bright spot in the film, in addition to its small part, were some of the location scenes, filmed in New York and New Jersey in New York. the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The sound is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so loud that it is difficult to hear the dialogue. Sometimes, the dialogue has been remade without any background noise, which is disconcerting. For example, sometimes when you are in the car, the car noises are too loud and, suddenly, there is absolutely no additional noise. The director likes the close-ups of the faces, and then it is clear that the film has been folded because the words do not match the movements of the lips. Throughout most of the movie, the voices sound as if people are talking in a can. <br /> <br /> Background music, when there is music, distracts rather than adding to the movie. <br /> <br /> The address is laughable. The camera's clumsy angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke, especially at times when tension is supposed to be in the middle of battles. The writing is terrible. There are some subplots that do not make sense, and most of the characters look very stupid because there is no explanation for their motivations. The writer / director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men who were together in Vietnam, but none of that makes sense. These superior assassins and former soldiers do not seem to be able to see other people's shadows or hear other people move. The actors go from calm to panic and return to calm without any warning. It is simply a combination of bad direction and poor writing. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are so bad that at the beginning, we thought we had stumbled upon the film of a student who happened to have Sandra Bullock in it. If you like to laugh at really poorly made student films, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, avoid this movie.
