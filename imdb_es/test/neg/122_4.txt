I had high hopes for this until they changed the name to 'The Shepherd: Border Patrol, the most fervent movie name of all, what was wrong only with' The Shepherd '. This is a number action movie that tilts your hat in many classic Van Damme movies. There is a bit of action in a bar that reminded me of a difficult target and a universal soldier, but directed without any intensity or style, which is a shame. There is a great line about 'being drunk and carrying a rabbit' and some action scenes OK disappointed by the cheapness of it all. Most of the time, the dialogue does not coincide with the mouths of the characters and the action doubles fall dead a split second before being shot. The final fight is one of the best fights of Van Damme, except that the Director tries to go too far, John Woo, and also fails to present flashbacks that nobody really cares about, only gets in the way of the action, which is The goal of Van Damme movie. <br /> <br /> It's not good, it's not bad, it's just an average generic action.
