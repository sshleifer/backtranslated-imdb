Even allowing my blatant love for the first two movies in the franchise, and sweeping away any biased inclinations I might have had for Max's character, I just do not dare to rate on average this waste of cartoon space that So almost It messes up what happened before. <br /> <br /> The unpleasant and resistant streak that brought feelings to Mad Max Rockatansky disappeared, the shocking feeling of desolation disappeared in an apocalyptic world, and more importantly, it disappeared. It is the passion of director George Miller for the franchise . The terrible score matches the heart of the caricature of the film, it seems that the creators really did not know what to do with the amount of money given to make this third (and fortunately the last) delivery. Surely the stunts are right in what is expected for now, and, of course, Miller manages to paint a barren desert landscape by simply lifting up from what he has done before. However, he clearly fought for new ideas with the action, since the glory of The Road Warrior's campaign in the search for Petrol Tanker is repeated here, only that he uses a train !!. <br /> <br /> It's just a very poor show that may have seemed an ambitious turn of events in the mid-eighties; But seeing the three films together now, Thunderdome simply presents himself as a director who loses his avant-garde approach while being caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is that none of those gender biases would have worked singularly, in the context of this series, anyway. I give the movie 3/10 just for a good Thunderdome fight sequence, while the specialists here deserve some credit at least. But this is the third time I try to like this movie, and as a glutton for punishment, as I undoubtedly am, I will never try again.
