Some movies are simply stupid beyond explanation. This is one of them. Words can not do justice to the wooden performance, the stupid plot and the always predictable result. Almost the only thing that makes it worthwhile to watch this movie are the women with little clothes (and the mute boy for you, ladies) that are in it. The leader of women warriors and Valeria are quite attractive to the eye. But that is all that this movie has in its favor. <br /> <br /> Some nonsense at the point: a scene, when they begin to travel towards the Dark's lair, they are moving away from a supposedly destroyed land. But we clearly see a 1980 New York behind them. About 2/3 of this movie looks like it was filmed in a high school basement. The puppets of mortal socks look as scary as a street monster of sesame. I have to agree with Latronic that many garbage films of the 1950s did a better job than this. Almost the only one I can think of that was not Teenagers from Outer Space.
