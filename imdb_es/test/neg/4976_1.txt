Forgiven is Clint Eastwood's last tribute to the once great west. But although I thought this was going to be good and raise the level for future Westerns to come, I was wrong. Unforgiving, though simple in its plot, it falls completely on the characters and emotions, and I would certainly say that Unforgiven is Eastwood's worst film to date. Eastwoods himself seems too old to play the role of acting and directing, which also adds a negative aspect to the overall appearance of the film. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem hasty and uneven, especially Eastwoods. The performance does not seem to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling. The direction is badly fooled by peculiar shots. So, overall, Unforgiven is not the best of Eastwood and, by far, one of the worst westerns in the world.
