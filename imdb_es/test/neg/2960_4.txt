This variegated and careless spy melodrama featuring two Californian children (an idealist and another drug addict) from California who deal with KGB secrets seems to never get enough steam to keep up the tension and suspense before a death dies Very slow two hours later. The finished product of John Schlesinger gives the impression that he was sleeping in his director's chair most of the time as the film is delayed and the actors sleep, except for the highly annoying of Sean Penn's superior performance. <br /> <br /> Children from the altar of childhood and their friends Chris (Tim Hutton) and Daulton (Penn) design a plan to sell secrets to the KGB when Chris gets a job that gives him access to the most secrets of the government. Disillusioned by what he sees as American meddling in foreign affairs, the idealist Chris and the drug-hungry Daulton get in touch with the Russians and begin channeling classified materials. When Chris decides he wants to leave, things begin to unravel at an insecure pace. <br /> <br /> The Eighties were not kind to the distinguished director John Schlesinger. In the 60s and 70s he had a series of critically acclaimed films in both England and America, but then came to the Honky Tonk Expressway in 1981 and marked the beginning of the end. The Falcon and the Snowman, more or less, put a lid on it. Lacking the suspense of Marathon Man and the quality performances (Hoffman Voight, Christie, Jackson, Finch, Olivier) that had persuaded potential customers in the past, Falcon goes in circles most of the way. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn chews the landscape from beginning to end in such an unpleasant way that he finds himself encouraging his tormentors to do more with him. Tim Hutton is governed by his limited acting skills and most of his scenes show the need for more rehearsal time. Lori Singer, like Hutton's girlfriend, remains mute almost all the time with Schlesinger's content to film her vain expressions. When she does it, you understand why. Only David Suchet, as a KGB handler with an introspective presence of penetrating eyes, stays well.
