This movie is total dreck. I love Val Kilmer and I was very surprised this year "Felon" (a good movie!). All the DVD box is deceptive. Val Kilmer, being listed as one of the main people in this movie, is in the movie for about 2 minutes. Even the summary on the back of the DVD is not entirely true. This could have been a good movie, but the direction was horrible and the plot was as thin as a sheet of paper. Usually, when a movie is so horrible, you can sit back and laugh at it. Although this movie is so bad and boring, I actually fell asleep (which I never do during a movie). AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
