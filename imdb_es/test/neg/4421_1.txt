This movie is a mix of several idiotic clich√©s. For example, a rich and spoiled girl can make him fall in love with him by harassing her in college (a backdrop that is widely used in India's recent commercial films). A male chauvinist glorification of sexual conquest. The climax is predictable (it has been used ad nauseam in several other films). As with many other recent Hindi commercial films, the film abounds with the incongruous insertion of songs, which probably contributed to the success of the film more than anything else.
