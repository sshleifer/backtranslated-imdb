boring, horrible piece of Italian euro-junk about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time drinking beer (this is what makes him American, right?) Our scientists spend most of their academic lives out of their minds, That's where all the big theories come from who's studying something (dolphin calls, fish migration patterns, who knows) Listen to a strange sound through your headphones, which shows that your radio is picking up a station In Jamaica, at the same time, a girl from Jack Skellington with one of the worst discolored manes of bad hair of the 80s that I have always had the pleasure of witnessing is trying to calm the dolphins in the Seaquarium in which she works. apparently annoyed by the amount of fish he's been handing out lately The beginning of the movie was a very bad colored story about two very annoying Italian people and very Italian whose boat is attacked by something that is not seen underwater. The whining woman is never seen again (the best part of the story), and the corpse of the boys is without legs. The tenuous alcoholic scientist (who has an inexplicable English-American-Italian accent) and the girl with the hay hair start to theorize that there is some kind of giant monster lurking under the seas of the coast of Italy ... err. .Florida. <br /> <br /> They resort to the help of an electrician to install an underwater microphone, so that the monster can sing karaoke. This guy has a beautiful girlfriend, what has the only drawback is that he pronounces Peter "Pey-tah", but for some reason he is sexually attracted by the anatomical skeleton with frizzy hair, a situation that leaves one blinking. <br /> <br /> The dubbing is horrible, the editor is a spaz and the story is usually a yawn. There's a bit about how this strange scientific corporation genetically designed this giant shark-squid-barracuda monster for some reason that does not make sense, and a really nasty fatty-haired guy goes around killing women, again for no apparent reason. A stupid sheriff and his bulky assistant accompany the police, along with a scientist (we know she is smart because she wears huge glasses). There was a time when the scientific woman faced the huge and terrible monster (yes, of course, the giant octopus of Ed Wood was more credible) with only a small handaxe, and she won the contest. Hurray for the skinny little girls, who obviously make the best monster hunters! <br /> <br /> The solution to the giant's problem is to fly half of the Everglades, leaving a dead zone for several kilometers in all directions. To hell with ecology and the environment, right? We have to kill this giant monster! In the end, the electrician and his love broom ride towards the sunset on his Vespa, which is o.k. since she overcame the death of her colleagues and is not very upset because her girlfriend was hit by the crazy man with greasy hair. Hurray for true love! Wait a minute, is not there something weird about all this ...
