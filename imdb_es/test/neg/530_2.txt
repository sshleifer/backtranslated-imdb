Two things are always signs that you will be watching a bad movie: <br /> <br /> 1) If you are instantly reminded of other movies like THE TERMINATOR, HARDWARE or BLADE RUNNER during the title sequence <br /> < 2) If there is a death during a sex scene immediately after the title sequence <br /> <br /> There is actually a third warning sign and that is a legend that indicates a lazy exposure that warns the ignorant poor Naive audience of the dangers of corporate greed. Guess what ? CYBORG 2 starts with a legend that warns us of corporate greed in the future, followed by a sequence of titles that reminded me of THE TERMINATOR, HARDWARE and BLADE RUNNER, followed by a death during a sex scene! Hey, do not you think I'll be watching a bad movie by chance? <br /> <br /> As you can guess, this is a bad movie. Basically it's a series of action scenes written around a naked plot of a cyborg fleeing a corporate greedy company. It is badly written, directed and acted and, above all, it is poorly lit, which means that it is very difficult to see what is happening on the screen, although I am not at all sure that this is really bad. The only interest that can be had is that it is the film debut of Angelina Jolie, who plays the cyborg in the race and says the prophetic line "They are lovely, I wonder if they are real", which is something I ask. I always see one of his movies
