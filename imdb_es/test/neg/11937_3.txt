I had high hopes for this film when I saw the list and decided to watch it on television, without interruptions due to commercial breaks. I have liked Lee Van Cleef in many movies, but I am afraid that the fact that the other characters call him Chris repeatedly does not make him a reasonable facsimile of Yul Brenner's Chris. <br /> <br /> I found this The film was a complete disappointment: the soundtrack of the music tried to impart the magnificence represented in the original, but it also failed to make the film exceed the standard of the original. The rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing in this film. I guess if you have not seen the original it would be fine. Too many clich√©s and little depth to the characters. He missed humanity and compassion and the three-dimensional characters of the original.
