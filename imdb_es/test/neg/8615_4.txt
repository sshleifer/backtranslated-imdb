I've seen this movie tonight and I need to say it's horrible. I expected it to be great, because, usually, we do not have many films about Asian vampires mixed with Asian culture; but at first it started badly: the introduction of the movie seemed to have no end! The plot is very weak and if you take away the fights and the soundtrack, you really do not have anything useful! The director of this film does not seem to have some important notions about how much time to devote to the introduction and the flashbacks, for example. (Not to mention some other things) <br /> <br /> For people like me, who want to see a great vampire movie, I really recommend watching "Lost Boys" or "The Interview with the vampire".
