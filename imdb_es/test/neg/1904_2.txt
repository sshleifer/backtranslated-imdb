If you need to know if Playmaker is decent or not, look at his star, Colin Firth, who refers to her in an interview as "absolute garbage: I sincerely hope no one will see her". <br /> <br /> The script and the plot are ridiculous, the female lead is not convincing. The only thing worthwhile is Colin Firth, and he seems a little embarrassed at all. <br /> <br /> Only for Firth fans: the shower scene alone is worth the $ 3.99 you might have to pay, if you find it a video clipping tray like the one I did. <br /> <br /> I'm happy for Mr. Firth that his days of taking projects like this are over!
