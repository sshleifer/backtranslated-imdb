In agreement. I admit it. I'm a big fan of series movies. Back when Michelle Bauer, Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens ruled the place. And back then, even bad movies were still good. Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just bad. Even a small cameo by Brinke Stevens (repeating her role as Linda in "Slumber Party Massacre" 21 years earlier) does not help this one. A group of cheerleaders takes refuge in an elegant cabin after their van breaks. A psychopath stalks them one by one, trapping them in various states of nakedness. A bad script, a bad direction and a horrible performance make this clearly bad! Skip this turkey and go rent the "Slumber Party Massacre". 1/2 *
