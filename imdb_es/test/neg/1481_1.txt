A classic of garbage! Basically, what we have here is a story about a couple of American teenagers (a man, a woman and, of course, both beautiful people) who seem to be psychically linked, in the sense that each time they both fall asleep, they can inhabit the dreams of each one and express your most intimate desires ... think that Mills & Boon complies with the X files and will be somewhere near the brand. Actually, it's more like an unhappy hybrid between one of Ed Wood's famous B bad movies and a particularly silly episode of Melrose Place, so special effects are special effects and fans are acting. The actors that live (I would not say they act) in this movie say their lines as if they were reading letters and pouts when they're supposed to be showing emotion, and it's not a big surprise (or a loss to the industry) that from then they have vanished in the dark. All this is just a ridiculously wrong mix of styles that do not go hand in hand, and the end result is an intriguing curiosity that will undoubtedly be dragged down by the suppliers of such bad films that are good in years. come. I'm probably the only person who comments on this movie, but if you're reading and you've seen it, please come back, it feels a bit lonely around here ...
