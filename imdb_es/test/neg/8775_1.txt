Whatever the producer was looking for, he missed it completely. The solitary ranger is not a camp, but "the icon" for those who do good in the whole world. And it's a total violation of the character's spirit that the only real Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore, was forbidden to wear his mask in public appearances when this movie was released. <br /> <br /> Whelp, long story In short, the only salvation from this distortion (and poorly done) was that in that year I had the honor of meeting Mr. Clayton Moore in Columbus, Ohio, as part of a tour that resulted from the bad press about Mr. Moore's treatment. . Needless to say, the character, integrity and presence of Mr. Moore overshadowed the film. Some things can not be done better. There is only one solitary ranger.
