Well, it's terrible, and I mean terribly, easy to disassemble this movie. Wow, what do you expect with the title, synopsis and actors on tracks like Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman and my personal favorite, Roger Ready. Yes, Star B, John Agar is here as a sheriff to rid the Texas landscape of a robot-like ape from a NASA experiment that went awry. The film has terrible performances, terrible landscapes, terrible special effects and frightening lighting. I really can not find anything good to say about it, other than that bad movies can be much worse when it comes to finding something awful. It is tremendously short and has many moments of involuntary humor. Lost signals, faux pas lighting, off-screen horror, an incredibly insane score and, of course, John Agar does his best to be the core of the film with a great performance in the middle of this mud. The beginning is the hardest part to sit on, as it seems that it takes forever for these two teenagers to get their ransom for traveling in the woods on the back roads of Texas, where the great ape will soon reek of his revenge on his own and terrible way ... Yes, of course! Night of fear! Bah!
