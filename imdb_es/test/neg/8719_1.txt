If you have never read the classic science fiction novel on which this miniseries is based, it can actually be good. Unfortunately, if you are a fan of the book, you probably will not be able to see more than one or two hours. All the political intrigue of the film has been eliminated, the most important scenes of the book have been eliminated, the motivations of the characters have been completely changed and the words of the wrong characters have been changed. Where in the novel Paul Atredies was a teenage boy with an incredible political ability and a great understanding of the way the world worked, in this film he is upside down and frustrated. Avoid this movie at all costs.
