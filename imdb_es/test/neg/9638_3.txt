This is one of those movies called "Hollywood Social Comments" that want to have it both ways. And believe me, in this movie, both forms are clichéd and stereotyped. STOP-LOSS is a film by John Wayne of the 21st century that deals with some feelings against the war, but clearly ends with the note that "If you are a MAN in today's society, you act and march to war with your friends". In many ways, the film was a great sequel to TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE, as it represented an equally insane and out of control military man, an almost FAT PARTY / ANIMAL HOUSE extravaganza mixed with a Texas Red Neck world of repressed homoerotic tests of masculinity. This movie had everything in one scene after another of cliché images. And then military rebel deserter Ryan Phillippe makes a "Road Trip" with his best friend's girlfriend, an artificial manipulation of the story to visit dead military families, mutilated soldiers in military hospitals, etc., and finally tackle the issue of flight to Canada or Mexico. . But the masculine honor and patriotism win in the end, as all freshly washed and handsome, heads to the sunset on a bus with his friends back to Iraq and a world that a few minutes earlier assured everyone that never again could tolerate METAL JACKET COMPLETE complies with SANDS OF IWO JIMA. But in the end, John Wayne rides again! And a Hollywood Blockbuster finally manages to keep both sides of his audience in the palm of his hand, at least I'd like to think so. As far as I'm concerned, just take me to the most compelling reality of IN THE GARDEN OF ELAH.
