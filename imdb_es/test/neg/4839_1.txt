Dead Man's Bounty (the American title of the movie) has the appearance of an Italian western classic. The cinematography, the costumes and the sets look great. The cast is sturdy, it's not a pretty face between them. At first, I was preparing for a pretty cool movie, but what I eventually witnessed was an absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The script was perfectly terrible. There was no suspense at all and very little action or a drama that was worth it. <br /> <br /> Despite looking great, the cast spoke (English) with strong European accents that were often unintelligible. <br /> <br /> The final key in his coffin was the broad stretch of pretense that paints most of the picture, focusing heavily on the waitress character who appears in a couple of very clumsy sex scenes. Also his speech near the end was pretty disgusting! <br /> <br /> The only novelty comes from the cast of Val Kilmer in the role of the dead man, continuing his recent series of performances by DOA!
