This review contains a SPOILER --- <br /> <br /> The movie is an American ninja mysteriously trained in martial arts. He falls in love with the Colonel's daughter and goes from the most hated snarl in the post to the "Popular Hero" at the end of the film. This movie is extremely cheesy and very little researched. It is good for people who do not care about the development of the plot or reality. Good for children under 14 years old. The military errors in this movie are comical. I remember that during my three years in the army, the private ones were not required to greet or call "Se√±or" the non-commissioned officers, the film does so in several places. The colonel's hair is too long in the ears. Master Sergent's mustache was against long military protocol. In the mail, the Colonel was the only officer there was. No other officer was shown walking around the post. You had idiotic ninjas throwing swords against troops with m-16, something badly done. <br /> <br /> The people who filmed stunk. Michael Dudikoff is not really that bad of an actor who only has bad scripts. The ninjas were more fun than dangerous. Avoid this movie
