My brother-in-law and his wife brought the film for a night to watch it on video. This should have given me the first clue that it would be horrible. Was. From the first frame to the last, this movie is terrible. It does not even register as a "B" movie. Maybe an N or a P. One of the worst 5 movies I've seen. From the rubber raptor on the stick to the corpses that still breathe in the car to the most horrible closing lines, this movie is not worth seeing if you have received it for free. <br /> <br /> Skip this completely: unless you want to play Mystery Science Theater with your friends, it will give you a good ammo.
