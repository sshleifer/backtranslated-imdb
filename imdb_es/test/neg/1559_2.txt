The aliens let you miss a giant monster called Zarkorr, and then send a hologram that seems to be the case of your stupid average teenager to tell the postman, Tommy Ward (Rhys Pugh, in the only movie you've ever seen him) chosen for fight. Also, if he loses the plant he goes to ruin, then he goes to fight Zarkorr the Invader! This movie is bad, very bad. So bad you need negative numbers just to give him a rattan. Written horribly, misdirected, well below the Power Rangers acting on the wood at the top, you are simply making peace so that a horde of lumberjacks come out of nowhere and eliminate them! And do not make me start with the subject at the end. The people who made this S $ @ # offspring should not be out loud near a camera or anything related to the movies. Zarkorr is a great-looking monster who should have been in a movie a million times better than this one. Do yourself a favor and do not see this movie, it's 80 minutes of life. The actors who are in this never worked again along the way. <br /> <br /> 3/10
