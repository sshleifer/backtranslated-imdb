They make everything too easy in this movie. It reminded me of Indiana Jones, where he hides on the outside of a submarine while crossing the ocean. Everyone knows everything that's going on, it's really easy to get anywhere you want in the White House. I do not even know why I saw half. Because I like Charlie Sheen and Donald Sutherland. I expect the usual ability to dodge bullets from all angles and be able to run faster than a motorcycle (usually, it's faster than a car in a garage or an ally). It was silly, for the most part, and he did not even know he had a ten-story elevator in the White House. Anyway, anything conspiracy is always interesting.
