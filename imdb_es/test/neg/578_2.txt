A divorced single mother in a picturesque coastal town finds an anonymous love letter and allows her to stimulate her amorous and inactive life. Pet project for the actress / co-producer Kate Capshaw, which provides a warm and pleasant modulated presentation, however, this story is so thin and the direction and editing are so erratic that a slight dissatisfaction appears. Initially, Helena de Capshaw conceives several friends who read her love letter (an interesting visual joke), but the first person with whom they make this ploy is Ellen DeGeneres, who does not play a lesbian but who stays as one for this trick. Different ideas vanish in the hope that they stick together, and continuity is extremely choppy. The cast of cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who mostly acts shirtless) is very good, but they can not save the final act, which is disappointing. Low profile, in a peculiar and pleasant way, but it is very kind, nothing more. ** 1/2 of ****
