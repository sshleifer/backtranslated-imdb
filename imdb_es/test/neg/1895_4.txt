While the film was beautifully filmed and reasonably well acted, the script was boring. Obstacles and nothing that we have not seen before. Not once in this movie did I have the feeling that these people were really in danger. There is no remarkable climax and a very standard resolution. I think that these types of movies have been exaggerated and they should be given a break. After all, EVERYONE on the planet did not see the "Schindler's List"?
