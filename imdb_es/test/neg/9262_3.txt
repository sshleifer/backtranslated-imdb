Extremely slow movie There are excellent performances by all actors, so it is assumed that more than 5 points. Surya and Jyo are supposed to be the ideal husband and wife and this is shown to us until it reaches the point where you start asking if there is a story. Then One day, Jyo discovers Surya's diary to find his failed love story in college. The love story of the university is not convincing, since Surya is an arrogant Senior who is always criticizing Bhoomika, beating up her friend, yelling at her in public and in spite of being terrified of him. She falls in love with him. Even after that, he continues to dominate her using rude language. Of course, I can not appreciate the gentle nature Bhoomika plays, I do not think any woman who respects herself falls in love with those idiots in real life. Jyo decides to reunite them and what happens after that is the climax. The story is extremely weak in its characters. An extremely arrogant Surya to Bhoomika is exactly the opposite of Jyo (and there is no reason for the sudden change of character). Once more tame, Bhoomika becomes a great extrovert when she returns. If she had become so sure of herself, why did not she try to find her love because she no longer feared anyone?
