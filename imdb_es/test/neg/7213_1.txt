This movie is a lot of trash, and to try to base it, the first is just a farce, the main thing that disappointed me was the use of the linings of the first, which once said the classical actors. as Sam Elliot can not be reproduced in any way, I mean when Dalton's phones appear on the first, and the call ends calmly, it was great, but when the bell rings, the DEA agent returns home and ends the call with permanence. cool, it does not have the same ring now it really does, there are others, but I can not bother to publish them, but I hope you understand, they should have called this house wannabe route ....... ...
