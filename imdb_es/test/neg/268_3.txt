Seeing this movie brings to mind several words: "sophomorismo", "ridiculous", "improbable", "self-indulgent" and finally (and fatally), "boring". Misdirected, poorly photographed and badly acted, the film is a confusing mess with plot lines (if you can call it that) in all directions. Someone may have used the paint with the fingers of a five-year-old as a template. As punishment for this childish crime of a movie, this cast of "stars" must be whipped deeply and sent to their respective beds without dinner. . In general, it seems that George needed an excuse to meet with his friends for a paid summer vacation and we are the fools that we paid for it. Bad George! Bad!
