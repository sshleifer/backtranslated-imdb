Al Pacino was once an actor capable of doing a role role without having to resort to the constant use of blasphemy. In other words, when he could act, he did not have to talk like a street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he also became a promoter of the word "F". This could be the kind of society in which they really live, but most of us have the common decency to see what we say in a mixed company. I do not remember the exact words that a teacher used to explain the constant use of blasphemy, but it was something like that. "It shows a lack of intelligence, deficient linguistic skills and lack of respect for all who have to listen." Maybe it's time for Al to take some acting courses again to improve his talent. Oh, yes, the movie ... Probably the worst thing McConaughey has ever played. We hope that your next role will be in the company of more talented people. Ren√© Russo, as always, was hot.
