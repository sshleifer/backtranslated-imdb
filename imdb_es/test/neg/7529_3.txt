... but I would be lying. A relative was a member of the crew, and we had to go see the production of this film for a couple of days (and I was an extra). I'm dying and I have a second of time on the screen, it's not like I'm planning to move to Hollywood soon. I just thought it was amazing to see how movies are made and be part of them. Also, I got a copy of the movie once it was finally released. They did not have a study back when they made this movie, so it was really independent. Why writing and acting are so horrible surpasses me, but the main character "Cherry" is the director's sister, so I could be part of it. But the cinematography was good. :)
