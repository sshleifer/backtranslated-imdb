For a long time I have tried to understand why people like Shakespeare and every few years I give him another chance. I was hoping that this play / movie (my sixth Shakespeare play different) would unlock the lucky chest and marry the wealth of this literary demigod. Bah, I clearly chose the wrong key. <br /> <br /> Once the phrase "pound of meat" was uttered within 10 minutes of the film, the main parts of the plot were transparent, which are ground together with a languid script. And the lifeless performance. In each step, the plot presents two scenes in advance. The concept that a dying aristocrat would persuade his daughter to choose her future husband through a lottery is incredulous. It is not surprising that he wins the matrimonial jackpot because Bassanio is the main character of the play ... and he is the third man to try ... and there are three coffins to choose from ... and his friend risks his life to pay the dowry The only genuine surprise I had when seeing this movie is that it did not end immediately after the resolution of the trial. However, as soon as the betrayal of the ring began, it became evident what would happen. <br /> <br /> Well, then I know that millions of you love Shakespeare not because of the surprise in well-known stories, but because of the depth and passion of the characters. But I did not feel anything for the characters. Instead of clinging to suspense and admiration during the court scene, I sat there waiting passionately for everything to end, soon, please. <br /> <br /> One day, maybe you will find a play by Shakespeare that does something more than boring. I.
