I was looking forward to this based on comments about this and pretty good rating. This was a big disappointment. This does not contain a candle for contemporary zombie films like Shaun of the dead, day of the dead, land of the dead, etc. Horror movies sometimes take a while to leave, you have to build the characters so that when they turn them off, you feel some empathy, etc. but still, there is a total of 45 minutes to sit here, even before you smell a corpse, until that moment, it's like watching a bad soap opera, nothing of interest or relevance happens, and if you are If you are going to see this First time, you can honestly start looking after 45 minutes, you will not miss anything in the plot. When things start up, everything is well below average. Some of the murders and makeup are done well, others are done very badly, lack consistency here and there are some really shocking continuity errors and some of the most sensible performances I've seen. <br /> <br /> All this could be passable if you really believed that all this was happening on a plane, but with the guns fired, the firebombs turned off, there are no pilots in the cockpit in a violent storm, but the plane stay in the air, come on, come on. Not all are simple. <br /> <br /> Oh, and does it really take a full minute for the missile of a fighter plane to hit a plane that is a few hundred meters away? I know it's a zombie movie and you have to stretch things out, but this movie, along with the other major flaws mentioned above, has no credibility. One to lose.
