WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, my expectation was that if it was a vampire movie, it would be amazing considering how Rodriguez and Tarantino helped make the film. I started in about 15 minutes and I was already hopeful in this movie, which surprised me. First of all, the story I was going with was not at all attractive, anyway possible, and simply boring and unsatisfying to the point where I just wanted to turn it off. I was getting more frustrated with this movie as it got longer, but I think I was hopeful it would get better ... then, when it was finally shown to the vampires, BLEW MY MIND, in a VERY bad way. I thought: "Well, this movie started with a horrible story about these two criminals, then it slowly became a vampire movie that I thought it was going to be from the beginning, in the last 30 minutes." To add to that, they try to make the main characters are great and great, and they mean the end when they just are not; A bunny would have been more intimidating than these characters! This movie is a horrible piece of shit! From dusk to dawn, I disgraced myself and left a terrible taste in my mouth, with discouraging thoughts in my head, and I left my body unable to move from the horrible impact that I just wasted 108 minutes of my life in a horrible movie. I do not understand how George Clooney, Quentin Tarintino, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, all the good and honorable actors that they are, could participate in this useless garbage. In my opinion, From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the worst movies in which I have seen my eyes. Do not see it, you will be doing a GREAT favor ...
