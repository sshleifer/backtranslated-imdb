So you have a series of models on an island, and one by one they are selected in the Agatha Christie style. We got someone lost in the sea, pushed by a precipice, poisoned by a solvent, expelled by a precipice, flown, etc. Nothing terribly graphic. <br /> <br /> Before all this starts, a woman inexplicably has a dream of a killer with a strange human mask. <br /> <br /> The owner of the magazine is a mute who had a love affair, and someone took pictures before he was of legal age. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's all about business, or something like that, <br /> <br /> There's a montage of 80's style photos, most of the swimsuits are from One piece, surprisingly. A couple is quite translucent. There are clicks of the camera during assembly where the camera frame appears as a square or white rectangle within the image. The photographer is pretty bad in the frame!
