This is a disappointing adaptation of James Lee Burke's novel "In the Electrical Fog of the Confederate Dead." It is something badly acted mainly due to the misinterpretation of the main players. Tommy Lee Jones, a normally good actor, simply does not capture Burke's "Dave Robicheaux". As the main enemy of Robicheaux, John Goodman does a careless job as the "heavy". The guy who plays Robicheaux's actor-actor does not look like an old "A" leader. The rest of the film is broadcasted primarily with unnamed locals that simply do not do justice to a great novel. <br /> <br /> Jones' film and performance are too hasty for one thing. Robicheaux, in Burke's series of novels, gives one the feeling that he adapts well to his surroundings most of the time, resting and moving slowly. This is the same as in southern and southern Louisiana. Then sometimes Robicheaux is almost manic in his efforts. Jones simply moves at a rapid pace through the entire movie. The non-variant Ned Beatty is wasted. Mary Steenburgen is out of place. The only good thing about this is the scenario. In general, the film gives the impression of a television movie.
