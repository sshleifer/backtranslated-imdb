Basically, a terrible farce about a young man who refuses to conform or, better yet, uses nonconformity to achieve his goals: to deceive his parents so that they think he attends a university. The truth is that this imbecile has been rejected by all the schools he has requested. After seeing this garbage, you will see why. <br /> <br /> What a ridiculous name: South Hampton Institute of Technology. You do not have to be a space scientist to discover the initials of this school of nonsense. The problem with this type of film is that, in the end, the non-conformist becomes the accepted mode. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the reality world and call this film what it really is: excessive and manipulative garbage!
