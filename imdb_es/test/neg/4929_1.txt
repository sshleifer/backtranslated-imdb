"Shuttle" is / was more than a boring movie that had an interesting start, but after half an hour it ended up in the most difficult way to imagine. This movie has lost its history, if it can be called a story? ... after half an hour. All the following scenes are totally out of proportion. The driver is a kind of superman, because he survives all attacks with a weapon, a knife, etc. Even after stabbing him in his leg he could put it in the box. But what a coincidence there was a box in that garage. I really felt sick and cheated when the movie ended. It could have been so good if the story was much better. In my opinion, even a child would be a better story. And why send the girl with water and food. I gave up counting the holes in the plot in half. And when the film reached its final turn, almost admirably sickly, I had surrendered completely (it is better to say "vomit"). The worst thing about Shuttle is that it really can not be worse, worse than worse. Maybe The writer / director Anderson will learn from this lesson and provide us with a decent thriller next time. Think that you will better move to a different gender. I keep my fingers crossed. But from now on I will read the commentary on his future films. First before looking. A waste of time.
