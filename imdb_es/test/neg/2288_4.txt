Sad in every respect, this poor excuse for a career boost for Connery was neither that nor what Warners wanted it to be. With a duration of 20 minutes and full of embarrassing moments for everyone involved, this film and "Robocop 2" are proof that Irvin Kershner had no real control over "The Empire Strikes Back". Connery had not been in a coup since he retired from Bond in 1971, but this did not bring him back. "Octopussy" was released several months before this movie, and easily surpassed it. Imagine that - a Roger Moore Bond is not only better than a simultaneous release of Connery, but surpasses it (and compared to "Never ...", "Octopussy" is on a par with "2001". <br /> < br> The worst theme song by Bond, even worse than "The man with the golden gun", meaningless scenes that go on without meaning (with the worst example of that ridiculous sequence of video games - MY GOD - TO WHOM IT MATTERS!), And the most atrocious collection of No talent in regards to the legendary "Bond Girls." Does anyone seriously think that Kim Basinger is attractive in this movie? There were girls in my high school who could never have Quotes that looked better than her in this, and Barbara Carrera - just stupid - but the way Kershner has directed her to walk all the time did not help her at all, it is the seedling that would become the impressive "Onatop", that was the best feature of "GoldenEye". "But that does not mean anything while You struggle laboriously in this movie. <br /> <br /> Casting Leit er as a black agent was an excellent idea, but it is assumed that the interaction between Buddy and Loke that he and Connery have is very bad. Two actors never appeared so awkwardly united among themselves: witnessing the scene in which, to escape the local authorities, they strip naked before their boxers and pretend to be exercising. I can not imagine another scene in a movie that has tried so fiercely to get a laugh. .
