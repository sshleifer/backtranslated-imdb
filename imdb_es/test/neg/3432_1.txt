I must say that Krasinski is the only reason why I even saw this movie. He is good. However, everything else about this movie is so below average that it is not worth the time and effort invested in watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This film has many technical and aesthetic problems: namely shot selections, framing, camera movements within sequences of monologues, extremely bad editing (probably due to the total lack of fluency in and between takes), and in general terrible performance (except Krasinski). <br /> <br /> It was too theatrical (in performance and presentation) to develop any kind of suspense moment in this movie ... which is surprising, since it is a bank robbery, which should be at least a bit exciting. <br /> <br /> How is a movie so bad? Are they made, and then published, AND THEN distributed? <br /> <br /> It reminds me a bit of the thesis project of a C film student, although it probably is not even that good.
