Ok, it was a "risky" move to rent this movie, but I thought I had nothing to lose. Well, I was wrong. This is, together with "Bloodsurf", the worst "horrormovie" I've seen. Actors of bad taste, technical production of shit, history of shit, etc. The soundtrack, however, is not bad. That's why I give it a 2 in the voting and not just a 1. And, of course, cats are a positive surprise. By far, the top actors in this movie ... Do not rent it or buy it. Stay away and wait for this horrible and horrible movie to disappear into a dark existence and not become a "cult classic". Definitely does not deserve any recognition.
