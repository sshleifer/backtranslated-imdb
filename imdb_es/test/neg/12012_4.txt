Junior and his dad start a new life in a new city. It's the same life because Junior has not changed a bit. He is still the same rotten brat that before has only gotten bigger. This time he has a friend named Trixie and she is a little worse. Junior does not like his father to go out and ruin all the opportunities he has. Then the grandfather moves and the dog comes. I thought the two would have made a good movie, but they did not even make friends until the end. This is a movie for the most immature people. It has diapers, farts, doggy do and toilet humor. Only one person under the age of twelve would find that this is super hilarious. I hope that when I have a child, it's exactly the same as Junior.
