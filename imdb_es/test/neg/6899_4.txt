This movie seemed to be put together very quickly in both the plot and the graphics. My two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the movie, which rarely happens when we go to theaters. This was a Nickelodeon production and it would have been better if it had been released on television. station. The animation itself in some parts was o.k. But the plot was horrible. The classic tale of a son who tries to satisfy the expectations of a father is used in many children's films, but the animation or graphics must be really good to maintain a child's attention. This was not the case with this movie. There were also uncomfortable elements between the main male character and the main female character that the plot could have done without him.
