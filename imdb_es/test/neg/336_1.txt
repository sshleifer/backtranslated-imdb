I take pride in being able to sit through everything. I think "if I paid the rent fee, at least I'll keep an eye on it". I have found the exception to this rule: the planet. I do not know what the exchange rate is, but when I read the other comments, I can only assume that Â£ 8000 should be around $ 150. I'll go with myself, but this movie reminds me of the old Steve Reeves movies of the 50s He was a bodybuilder turned actor. He was in these really frightening films, nicknamed in Italian, starring Reeves as Hercules or some other muscular hero. As a child who saw them, I could not explain why these movies stank, I just knew they did. Mike Mitchell is the new Steve Reeves. That's all ... that's what it really was: a new narration of an old Italian movie "Spaghetti Sand and Sandals". And, kid, where was Reeves born? Glasgow, Montana. This movie is not so bad that it's fun to watch, it's just bad.
