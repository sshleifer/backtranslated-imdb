It says a lot about the United Kingdom when TV shows like this one are not only made, but also run for three series. Without grace, politically correct to the point of getting sick and wrong and written. Meera Syal has not been funny or accomplished anything she's been in, tell me I'm wrong, and Jasper Carrott, the fun guy he is, has already passed his best in the eighties. This is such a bad comedy that it could have been done by ITV, but even smelly like The Upper Hand and James Bolam's as a parking attendant look like Fawlty Towers compared to this garbage. I would love to sit down with the writer / director of this program so they can point out the humor in this program. It is true that the majority of the population of the United Kingdom is made up of chavs with little education, but this would not tickle their funny bones. That's if they could separate from Big Brother or their mobile phones, but that's another story. Complete and absolute dirt!
