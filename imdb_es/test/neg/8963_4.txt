**** MILD SPOILERS _ BUT YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE TERRAIN **** <br /> <br /> The woman is raped and decides to take out her rage on all humanity. Oh, did I mention that the rape victim was mute? That's the problem with EM 45, Thana, the rape victim, decides that he's going to kill men, but is there any logical explanation for this? Surely the whole movie would be better if Thana would give us a voice on why he is colliding with a man he meets. There just is not enough development for this plot. <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a Ferrara movie, it is not a total waste of time. It's much better than what I put in your grave and the pseudo intellectuals will have a field day pointing out the irony of the woman holding a knife like a penis while Thana goes to a kill at the end. But the script is somewhat silly and underdeveloped and hinders any serious comments that the film could have made.
