OK, I saw this movie through Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I saw it, so I thought about leaving a comment about it. I just love once again how Joe gets the disastrous roles, while his brother and nephew are only getting the Oscar winning roles from left to right. Soultaker is technically what you would call a movie that was meant to be good. It seemed that the director and the actors simply took this film extremely seriously and had very cheesy effects, a story that did not make much sense, and not to mention the rather unpleasant acting skills. This is one of my favorite episodes of MST3K, simple because a lot of what they mention is what we are thinking throughout the film and I will explain why in a moment. <br /> <br /> Natalie and Zach are a couple that Broke and now they are trying to fix things. But since Zach is in the upper lower class and Natalie is in the middle class, it just is not going to work. But on the way home, they and Zach's friends get into a car accident and now the Angel of Death / Soultaker is behind them to meet their assault quota. But it also seems that he has had some other kind of life relationship with Natalie and it seems that he can not move forward. So now Natalie and Zach must compete against the clock that appears every time five million times per minute to save their souls and their lives. <br /> <br /> Well, I suppose Zeppelin was wrong when he sang that there was a stairway to heaven. I wonder if Black Sabbith was also wrong, hahaha. Basically, there are many plots in this movie, as no one can see the characters and they can not be killed, but somehow, can they still press buttons and open doors? The Angel of Death had a very strange face and distracted the story itself. Soultaker was just a bad movie that was rushed and makes you feel so bad for Joe, the underestimated brother of Sheen / Estovez. <br /> <br /> 2/10
