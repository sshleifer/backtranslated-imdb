I grabbed this pile on a Wednesday afternoon when my mother-in-law was watching it. Basically, I can not forget someone who is doing a remake of a high budget Hollywood failure ("the NUCLEUS" with actors dragged like Luke Perry). If the HIGH budget one flopped, what makes people think to do the SAME movie 2 years later with NO budget going anywhere? I was laughing through most of the movie because of how incredibly similar it was (in fact, I'm surprised it was not published in Legal instead of broadcasting on TV), and how it was basically the script of the CORE simply redone, which if you've seen "the Core", you know why doing it worse is fun, since the NUCLEUS was already so bad that it was fun. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy laughing at REALLY bad movies, this will be right in your alley. The only thing I can say is that I wish Luke Perry could have a career, because he is not a horrible actor ... he ends up with horrible roles. Crappy, made for television movies that will only be aired on daytime television, is practically one step closer to the end for him, if it were not for 90210 he would have a career.
