This movie is absolutely terrible ... Definitely a bull story and even worse acting. Too bad that Charlie Sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has made a couple of really good movies. <br /> <br /> Special effects are the 'A-team' standard with the classic car. shoot and then turn around with a small fireball under the hood. <br /> <br /> Of course, the enemy is represented as a total of idiots and dies as fast as you can say '-Die American evils''. Br /> Unless the Braindead movies are your game, do not spend 113 minutes of your life in this garbage. Collect 'the platoon' or 'Apocalypse now' instead.
