Well, here's the thing: for this movie to work, you'll have to accept the following: a woman who was murdered is alive again at the end of the movie, a detective stops questioning the dead woman's fiancee because a journalist asked him no, and that same reporter, beaten by a beautiful blonde who was taken to the night court for suspicious behavior, ends up marrying her in exchange for the judge leaving her alone. Are you following me in this? I can not say how many times I paused and rewound the image to repeat scenes that simply did not make any sense. In the end, the blonde (Claudia Dell) and the journalist (Richard Hemingway) remained married, but I have no idea how they came to that decision. In fact, I can not understand how the filmmaker made the decision to make this film. Oh, I guess there's some entertainment value here just for the sheer sense of it all, but it would have been nice if a couple of pieces fit together. However, I am not ready to add this to my list of the ten worst worst. I think the nightclub scene with the feathered ladies could have saved her. But why was he in the movie? I just do not know.
