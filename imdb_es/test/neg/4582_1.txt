Greyfriars Bobby was NOT a westie, Bobby was a skye terrier. The highlight of my day trips to childhood in Edinburgh was going to the Bobby Monument. I grew up with the story of the brave and loyal little dog, like all children of my generation, and I remember being in line with my mother outside the cinema, with many, many other Dundee children and their mothers, to see the wonderful Disney movie. How could a movie based on such a wonderful story have been made with a Westie, for God's sake? It's like making a film about the life of Robert Burns, for example, and portraying him as an Englishman. I say, give Bobby back his race!
