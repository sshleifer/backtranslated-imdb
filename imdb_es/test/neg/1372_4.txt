This program reminds me of an episode of "The Simpsons", in which Mr. Burns had just dismissed Smithers and was forced to live a miserable life on unemployment. Everything he did while the hours were up for drinking and watching Comedy Central. The implication was that Comedy Central was a pathetic television channel for miserable people who had nothing more to occupy their time. "Mind of Mencia" is a bit better than most of Comedy Central's programming, but it still serves as an example of why this channel is a low quality fill for people with absolutely no life. <br /> <br /> To tell the truth, Mencia is a fairly competent comedian who throws soft and soft ethnic jokes and takes advantage of the stereotypes of people based on their race, gender or economic situation, or a combination of them. Two out of three of these characteristics. If you have heard one of these jokes from one of your friends in a bar or at work, believe me, you have heard what happens as a comedy in "Mind of Mencia". Carlos also tries to make fun of current events, but lacks creativity or originality. This does not mean that Carlos is a wash all the time. I found some of his funny parodies, like his rap portrait as an oil sheikh. If you find an insipid and common comedy in your alley, you will probably enjoy "Mind of Mencia". For those people who are tired of the repetitive, the pedestrian comedians who jog the same old jokes, move away.
