The only reason to see this movie is Sung Hi Lee, the stunning Korean actress and model who plays "Muka Laka Miki" (give me a break) in this movie that would otherwise be bullshit. <br /> <br /> He is given a pretty important part in this movie and seems to handle it well, although neither part is really interesting or well written. Even for a National Lampoon movie, it's really stupid. Stupid humor is one thing, but stupidity is another. I may have laughed once, and that probably was just for being polite. <br /> <br /> Warning: Watching this movie can be bad for your health in two aspects: 1) It's like it totally sucks. 2) Sung Hi Lee is so amazing that I could blow your brains from the back of your head at first sight. <br /> <br /> So do not say I did not warn you ...
