The Great Rock N Roll Swindle is not only totally inaccurate, but, in short, is not very interesting or entertaining. Apparently, Malcolm McLaren squandered most of the profits of the Sex Pistols with this waste of film, which makes it much more unpleasant. The intention, from the beginning, was to create a monument to the "genius" of McLaren, who to this day has all the credit for creating punk music, creating the Sex Pistols and, sometimes, even writing all the songs. The spectators follow McLaren to several places, where he tells his story to his companion, a dwarf, and simply credited one thing after another. A particularly irritating scene has McLaren in a hangar of abandoned planes, waiting for a plane, being harassed by reporters and telling them their "great story". The most entertaining elements of the film are the animated short pieces, however, even these stink to the great dominant importance of McLaren. <br /> <br /> Even as a farce, this movie does not work. Little is entertaining, except Steve Jones, who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo detective type person. 20 years later, Julien Temple, who wrote and directed this film, also directed the Sex Pistols documentary "The Filth and the Fury". While that movie is much better and more interesting than "Swindle," it's still full of "artistic adornments" from Temple that just do not work, like interviewing band members in the shade, as if they were some kind of witness to a crime trying to hide his identity A little curiosity: the film critic Roger Ebert was one of the original writers of the film "Who Killed Bambi?", which eventually became "Swindle".
