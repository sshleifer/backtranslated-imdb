Oh darling! This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is incredibly repetitive; Each scene seems to consist of people who are shot down, running screaming or being kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very boring. I would not mind if the fight was good, but it is not; the main character, Phillips, pushes the various thugs with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he stays within sight of the Tracker, they never hit him, even though extras and minor characters are being shot and exploited around him . I've rarely seen a worse cast of actors (especially Don Wilson, if you can call him an "actor"), but that's not really surprising, given the dialogue they have to work with (sample line: "Computers killed to my brother! "). The plot is a scam below the pair of the excellent Terminator; The special effects are laughable. In general, this movie is absolutely terrible. And why does everything explode?
