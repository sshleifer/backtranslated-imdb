Ok, I'm 26, so I've gone through all the hype of the action heroes of the 80s, and Chuck Norris along with Seagal, Van Damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes, fighting the bad guys, firing dozens of bullets from one. just round;) I saw the announcement of this movie on TV a couple of days ago: Chuck Norris was throwing fireballs from his fingers. WHO! "That's a fucking movie that has to be seen," I said. And indeed it was. Only much worse. It is very difficult to see the whole movie, full of religious thoughts, ridiculous monsters of zombies, that serve Satan, the whole idea of ​​a plot in a forgotten community, which represents all humanity, is a burden of Christian fundamentalists. wet dreams. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Christianity, not even in movies, but this one does not like tastes, it lacks almost everything that connects with common sense, come on, Chuck Norris playing a ÁNGEL, Whose job is to take care of the small city, where Satan lives? The whole plot is so fucking straight and boring, not to mention its foolishness (yes, it's not stupid anymore, we're talking nonsense like ... like a joke of a retarded child). Make a terrible film, made as far as I suppose for the old man. people very dedicated to the Catholic Church, because the young spectators laugh at almost all the scenes. Technically it's wrong, the special effects are worse than the ones you saw in the early 90s in the TV series, the plot seems VERY stupid, the actors could easily be exchanged for cardboard stands, not to mention the music that, so I've heard, was Played on a child's play piano. I've seen many movies, even the worst ones (those on the bottom list of IMDb) like 'Space Mutiny' or 'Hands - hands of fate' BUT, I think nothing compares to this ridiculous, terrible, quasi-acted horribly. Film that brings to mind the joke films of some students instead of the regular production. Avoid it At all costs avoid it. There is not even something to laugh about. Chuck Norris has officially finished his film career.
