Are you kidding me? This is possibly the worst amateur movie I've seen. The cast was horrible, the performance was worse than horrible and I'm sorry, the guy at picnic speed who carries his plate full of food did not make any sense and the demon and potty that chased Drew was nothing but comical. When I blew on the bell witch, I wanted to believe. I read some literature and I thought it sounded as if a plausible story was possible. But this movie just destroyed that. Ric White (Director, Writer, Lead Actor, etc.) takes himself a little too seriously and I think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves ... Do yourself a favor ... skip this one.
