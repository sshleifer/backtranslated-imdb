Schoolies is a meaningless exercise ... Go to Gold Coast, get drunk and have sex. It's worth the ambitions, but maybe not very intellectual. The plot is as simple as a few sentences assigned to each character and no one is helped by the clich√©s that are published here. <br /> <br /> Something that would help is the casting. Everyone seems too old. These characters are supposedly innocent, embarking alone in faltering steps into adulthood, but they all seem too old to be credible on paper. <br /> <br />
