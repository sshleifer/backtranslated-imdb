I just finished watching this movie like I was on TV and I had nothing else to do. We went right here to IMDb, I also looked at the trivia page and observed the comments of the users. And what do I find? Every foolish idiot lifts this movie to heaven! I would not even have written anything, but when no one else takes the time to get the word out about this fucking movie, I thought I could do it. <br /> <br /> The performance was very good for everyone in the cast. The worst was the guy who plays Brian Wilson (I think I guessed the name) because he was exaggerating, especially when he was drugged. The rest was not as bad as him, but nobody was good either. I'm not an expert on beach boys, so I really can not complain so much about the story ... except that it stunk. There is no motivation for the decisions of the characters most of the time, but hey, maybe they were idiots in real life. And the worst thing I found was that I thought it was going to be a movie about the beach boys, but in reality you only understood some of the characters. I hate when they do that in movies, the same at the doors, even though I like that movie more. I do not have the energy to write more ... it sucks! Do not buy it or look at it!
