Watching this movie really surprised me. I have never stopped to watch a movie in its entirety because 3 dollars to rent a movie is a good amount of money and, damn it, at least I should see everything and get the value of my money. I overcame the 30 minutes of this absolutely horrible movie when I thought to myself, now I'm a little more foolish after watching this movie. I can not believe that the director and the actors in this film actually had such low respect for themselves to allow this to be released! <br /> <br /> There's nothing I can say that has not been said by the other critics, but even in the worst of the movies there's usually one or two decent performances ... not in this pathetic crap. I have seen better acting in secondary works. Everyone, and I mean that each 'actor' is bad beyond what can be believed, and what is really surprising is the uniformity of evil ... God, must have been the director. Where did you get these people? <br /> <br /> This is possibly one of the worst horror movies I've seen in my life. Although it is entertaining in places because of its ridiculous script and its even weaker performance, and I use that term in a very general way, it is unfortunate that this film has not been sent to the hell of film B for all eternity. What could have been a good idea has been ruined by an ultra-low budget, poor sound and effects, and actors who probably won their wings on children's television, and on children's television. <br /> <br /> Please get away from this movie. It's not even worth a minute of your time.
