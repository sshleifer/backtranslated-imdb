The Italian horror master Dario Argento is called a lot of bad things by non-fans. And he absolutely does not deserve any of the backlash. In fact, every time I hear something bad about Argento, I think they're really talking about Michele Soavi. He just does not get the same attention because his films were never as successful in theaters. In fact, his best film, The Cemetery Man of 1994, was probably his least successful. Or he just did not get the attention he felt he deserved, because after that, he left the movie and started directing television. He has never returned. So people do not really know how inferior their other films are because when they've seen them, they're already fanatical about the aesthetics of Italian horror. Which means you have to accept the fact that they have almost no sense and are usually unattractive movies. This is where The Church stands out from the pack. Because visually, it's so cheap and old-looking, you can smell the dust. But it also has its charms, although they are few. The camera work is really impressive and the musical score is extremely elaborate and grandiose. <br /> <br /> As Argento is the reason why people have seen all of Soavi's work, I do not know anyone who has trapped The Church before Suspiria. and Deep Red. Soavi is a bit of a hack. Something like an Italian Mick Garriss: the most outstanding example of a director who prefers style over substance. The defects of the Church are constant and abundant. The film begins with a rather interesting prologue that shows knights on white horses charging through a peasant village similar to those seen in any adaptation of Robin Hood, in a century ago. These scenes are intense, energetic enough, and quickly reach the point. Then, we move on to the present, where the style of the film takes over. Yes, the movie is good to watch. And for about 35 minutes or so in the present, in the 1980s anywhere, Italy, the film is interesting enough to take us to the horror elements that slowly reveal. So now we know that the purpose of the film is the accumulation of its horror. And it's a decent build, for the most part. But as the movie gets closer to the middle of the road, we realize that the movie is driving and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. I think. Two people who work in a church, one as a cataloging of books and the other as a restorer of the works of art on the wall of the building, discover a parchment / writing that man thinks will lead them to some kind of buried treasure or invaluable artifact that can sell. and get rich from. So he follows his "map" only to discover a force beneath the hallucinating church, while slowly becoming a demon that will make everyone else hallucinate. So while he is doing his demonic work, someone to whom the force passed is killed in a way that traps everyone in the church while the demon "contagious" spreads to everyone, leaving a black preacher and the little girl who He escapes from the church every night to go clubbing as the only 2 people who can prevent the plague from spreading beyond the walls of the church. That probably sounds full of action and Soavi's style is much more lethargic than Argento. But never before had I seen an attempt at a surreal film so agonizing and boring. It is not a joke. Absolutely nothing happens in the whole movie! I've seen Expressionist films before (or impressionists, I'm not a super-graduate of film school), but most of them actually show that things happen (John Carpenter's Halloween for one). <br /> <br /> It is closely followed in the footsteps of Lamberto Bava Demons's films (from the Argento co-production). They show us a place where a group of people meets, one becomes a demon, all the others are isolated, that person infects all but a couple of survivors, then the demons come out to infect the world, or the survivors get when the demons die. This movie puts all those elements in its place. Except that, unlike Argento's work, nothing happens. Okay, some things happen. But only a strange sequence has the touch of Lambert's much more fun Demons films. A random woman's neck is impaled by a demon using a section of the fence that starts from the floor. What's strange about that, you ask? It happens in front of about two dozen people. What do they do? Nothing. She dies, her head drips blood in the foreground. But all those people do not even notice it, although it happens to the naked eye and not less than 8 feet away from them. Maybe 4 people notice that the devil runs to stab whoever can while running towards her, so they get out of the way. She died and in the shot after dying, everyone is sitting, quiet while a child plays a saxophone. It is not a joke. That is what happens. That's more than logically incoherent: it's stupid. <br /> <br /> The scene suggests that the woman simply disappears and that no one saw her death. Everyone gets up and they forget about it. And this 15-second thing is absolutely the only event that takes place in the movie. I'm not saying it's the only violence, blood or murder we see. It is not. It is the only thing we can say that is happening. For example, in one scene, a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror that looks old and ugly. She begins to tear the skin off her face, but when it reappears minutes later, no scratches. People are devoured by fish and their faces are crushed by subway cars. But later they appear as members of a possessed cult, who have not suffered any harm, in a scene that commits the last heresy of terror, copying a famous scene from Roman Polanski's masterpiece in 1968, Rosemary's Baby, the best film of terror that has been made, shot for shot. Even if Argento did that, he would be furious!
