For starters, I did not bother to watch The Grudge. The previews of that movie did not make me jump, they did not scare me or entertain me. But when a group of friends asked me to go see The Grudge 2, I accepted the invitation, a little curious about what this movie would be like. Mainly I went for my friends. Not even 5 minutes in this movie, I realized that I shot $ 7.50. The performance from the first moment is horrible. At first, the students seem as if they have never acted in their entire lives. Then, the plot of the film takes over. Let me tell you that I could not stop laughing the whole movie. It is so stupid. I'm pretty sure they tried not to be afraid. They do not make anything jump or anything. Show the children, then show them "attacking." It is based on that, it is not a "sudden" thing. And even in the middle of the movie, the core of the movie, the acting is still horrible. Leave so much time between the dialogue for someone to add their own comments. Honestly, this movie is one of the funniest horror films I've ever seen. Wrongly written, horrible acting, horrible script, horrible cast "unable to act" and a horrible concept. The film fades and changes situations more times than you can count. Each part is finally played and then linked to the end of the movie. Never again would I pay to see this movie. I would not even see it on cable, for free. This movie is a joke. PLEASE DO NOT WAKE UP YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE!
