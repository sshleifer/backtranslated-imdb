I watched this movie when it first premiered in Pittsburgh Pa. I had traveled from Youngstown, Ohio, at a distance of approx. 85 miles. I did not know anything about the plot or the players. I had not read reviews or talked to anyone who had seen it. Believe me, I will never make that mistake again. I think it was the first full-length movie filmed in the new 3D process. That was what encouraged me to make a round trip of 170 miles. <br /> <br /> There was a waiting line two in a row that stretched (no kidding) 2 or 2Â½ blocks long and moved very slowly. I could wait strong to be seated. If only he had known at that moment what he would soon know, he could have been on the way back to Youngstown when the show began. <br /> <br /> By the time the first 3D scene was shown, I was already nodding. The novelty was worn out quickly and, from then on, it was pure agony. <br /> <br /> Without going into unbearable details, I can only offer the following advice. If you've ever seen the famous movie PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, supposedly the worst movie ever filmed, in my humble opinion it's way above this garbage. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this has ever been shown on television, if I do not know why. If you ever have the opportunity to see it, do something else. Go for a walk, mow the lawn, wash the dog, ask someone to whip him with a rubber hose. ANYTHING. Your time will have been better spent. <br /> <br /> This has been my first movie review. It might well be the last, unless a worse movie appears and I would not make the book happen. <br /> <br /> Bill <br /> <br />
