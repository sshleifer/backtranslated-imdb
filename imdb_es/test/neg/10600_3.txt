This film had great production values, good lighting, wardrobe, stage, cinematography and acting. But someone, somewhere, took the script and replaced all the dialogue with the barely literate writing at grade level. I felt that my IQ dropped points every time a character spoke. <br /> <br /> Did they do this on purpose? Was this just an accident of Brain Dead Studio Executives? At this time, we do not know. <br /> <br /> All I know is that this movie was a big mistake from start to finish. We did not even get to see how the squad became a cop, so instead of any character development, we get what looks like a bad 1960s television movie. Or whenever you want. <br /> <br /> Find the writers, beat them with a sock full of coins. All the rest, good work, but read your scripts next time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
