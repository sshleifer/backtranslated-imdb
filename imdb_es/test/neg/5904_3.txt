Robin Williams is excellent in this film and it is a pity that the material is not enough for him. This can work if you buy in the "U-S-A! Number one!" Mentality but as for the story does not happen much. Really a shame, since the movie is really trying to say something, and it says it honestly. It just does not have enough emotional impact.
