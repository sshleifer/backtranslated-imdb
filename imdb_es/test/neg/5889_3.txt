Having been born and raised in Odessa, and having graduated from the "other" high school in the late 70's, Odessa High School, I had many emotions about this movie. I no longer live in Odessa, but I will always be a Texan at heart. I did not like the way this city of more than 80,000 inhabitants was represented as a very poor little city. If I'm wrong about that, feel free to correct me, but I think OHS also plays in the city stadium, and the sign "Home of the Permia Panthers" that was shown in the stadium that used to be in the practice field in Permian. I would have liked to have seen a bit of recognition about the rivalry between cities of the big city game every year, OHS vs. Permian. I'm curious about the reason why the result of the game was altered, I think it would have been so dramatic if the real result was portrayed. In general, the film was good, it made me feel a little nostalgic, remembering the "good old days" of MOJO.
