***** Classic **** Excellent *** Good ** Regular * Tragic <br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> Oldboy is not for everyone. It is a generalized violence, it feeds on live octopi and it is an unimaginative story. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a man who has been kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find out what he should do. Find your captor in 5 days. Now, although the story may seem exciting, but once you see this festival of bloated and original blood, it becomes a bitter blood pur√©e and a blunt film. <br /> <br /> His address is on par with the average and by no means the standards of what a South Korean thriller should be. The action scenes of the Oldboys are in parallel with boring humor and a badly written script. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, Oldboy presents performances of fine straw with which one can only feel embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Verdict: <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, but its scope and vision are not clear enough to see beyond the gray abyss of fog. <br /> <br /> * Tragic
