"Rise of the Footsoldier" follows the relentless cruel journey of gangster Carlton Leach and his associates through drugs, violence, sex, violence, weapons, violence and did I mention violence? <br /> <br /> Protagonist Carlton Leach (Ricci Harnett), member of the ICF (Inner City Firm); a group of soccer hooligans turned into professional mafiosi, guides the public through the events that led to the 'Range Rover Killings' of 1995, in which three gang members were victims of especially violent "professional successes". Leach's success as a janitor and talent to locate fit and violent friends to control undisciplined gamblers at a local nightclub launches him into the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters who profitably benefit from the scene and culture of the drug trade of the 1980s. 90 <br /> <With the opening of brutally realistic shots of the dead, the viewer is left thirsty to understand what happened, but remains completely dissatisfied. The next 2 hours meander through a series of innumerable character presentations. Each of these basically establishes another typical "hard man", shows him assaulting the victims they do not deserve, before reaching an even more unpleasant ending. The little emotional understanding that the audience is allowed to form for some of the characters (for example, a family man blamed for missing drugs) is quickly destroyed when they are killed in an anti-climatic way, or their story is left unresolved. The insinuations of a plot introduced at the beginning are inadequately concluded with vague impressions of how the murders occurred, since events are placed in their place with little reward for persevering in the confused confusion of previous events. <br /> <br /> This film was made with a standard formula in mind, for an audience that prefers violence and slang "ard nut" to a true story. "Rise of the Footsoldier" takes too much of "Football Factory", leaving aside the good details, showing that there are no moral ramifications of the hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the protagonist. The violence, although brilliant, seems excessive and implausible because nobody is close enough for the audience to form an emotional bond. The implication that gangs are untouchable by the police is fair enough, but doormen with machetes who regularly commit blatant murders in public places push the imagination even of the most willing viewer. The audience is puzzled as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that had no impact on the final conclusion. The attempt at "harsh realism" is further destroyed by a substance called "truth serum", which the Turkish Mafia uses to persuade honest responses from individuals who are unwilling. This is NOT the genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs, and makes the interrogation almost absurd. <br /> <br /> Actual scenes of violence (before they become repetitive) maintain a certain tension, linked with rapid flashes of color or End of a film roll. The perfectly choreographed fights together with the work of the compulsory but effective shaking hand camera save the film, but unfortunately the plot (or lack of it) limits it to a demographic niche. <br /> <br /> In essence, the events of this film are based on the fact that they are not deservedly represented, and a suitable sequential plot is sacrificed for the stereotyped characters and a non-original plot. This movie has a place in the market, but if you like a little brain with your brutality, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/
