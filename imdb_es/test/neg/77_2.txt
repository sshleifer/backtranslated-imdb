OK, so my summary is a cheap trick. But the film is full of them and is praised in an absurd way, so ... <br /> <br /> I caught this on TV (no cuts, since the television here shows all the movies, that's for the Americans who could say no I do not like it because I saw a cut TV version (fortunately that's just one thing from the United States), and I had no idea what it was. I turned on, I got the last minutes of a program and started the In a minute, I begged it to be a comedy, given the particularly ridiculous clich√© (yes, it's a bad movie in the movie, I know, but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested! I do not even know why not And, yes, in fact, the film turned out to be a comedy, although not intentional. <br /> <br /> Marina Zudina is pretty enough, but, what a horrible performance! she is smart enough on the paper (she does not speak so good, goodbye to the language barrier), however, I'm sorry, Marina, interpreting in silence does not mean impersonating Harpo Marx. His acting is involuntarily funny in many moments, just look at it when he draws an X in the air while being harassed by the killer. He wants to kill you, it's not time to play Zorro. We get a lot of things "running up" through the tension, like in the worst pitchers, and things like throwing a rug and a bad guy shoots the other. Ugh! Will he ever learn Hollywood? However, the best / worst pearl is electrocuting a boy in a bathtub and ... Well, I've never seen anyone electrocuted to death in a bathtub, but I'm sure you can not see the blue rays of cartoons on the real life. , You do? And what if we immediately trust an evil guy because he SAYS he is a cop and does not ask him to show him his credentials? OK, then it turns out he's a real cop. But even so, not asking for the badge does not make sense (as far as the plot is concerned, we could always think that the credentials may be false or that it could be a twisted cop.) Writing 101). And what about the big turn? Do not tell me you did not see that from 200 miles away ... I'm sorry for poor Alec Guinness and his useless archival material. Now that I think about this, what's the point of giving a credit of "Mystery Guest Star" ... in the titles of END? The film is over, there is no mystery, and everyone and his brother have identified Guinness (even movie fans will not recognize "the old man from 'Star Wars'"). However, better this way, we can pretend that he is not the great actor who died. <br /> <br /> People keep comparing this with, of all people, Hitchcock. I suppose it has to be John Hitchcock, the milkman, since the late Sir Alfred would be embarrassed to see this, let alone do it. And this gets a 6.8 / 10 ???? It's bottom material 100! But then, we are talking about a classification system that allows 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' to appear as the third best film ever made (mark the 100 best), so ... <br / > <br /> 2/10.
