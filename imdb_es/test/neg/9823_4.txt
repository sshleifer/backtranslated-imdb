Hellboy revolves around the story lines of comic / action / classic superhero. Essentially Hellboy is a kind of demon that has found its way on earth. He is raised by a child by a priest and within a government society and has chosen to protect the people of the earth from the supernatural, instead of being a threat (the normal career path for a demon). <br /> <br /> The configuration of the story involves creative uses of history, combining the Nazi experiments with the occult. It is absurd, but so is the idea of ​​a demon wandering the streets. I find the explanations of the characters, who they are and how they handled themselves very well. The sequences are to the point and very entertaining. In fact, the opening is the best part of the movie, that's where the problem lies? <br /> <br /> Essentially Del Toro, who writes and directs this piece, bottled it. The film is absent of any tension or major conflict. Hellboy is essentially established as invincible in the first act and, therefore, the rest of the film consists of scenes in which any conflict is automatically quite coarse because we know that, inevitably, Hellboy will be fine and that the bad guy will die. I hear you cry that this is the case of any action / hero movie. Well, yes, it is, but once we are attracted to a well-made action movie, we can not help feeling that the hero can die. Die Hard works because John Mclane seems to die everywhere. He escapes death by the thinnest of margins. The bets are high since his wife is also in danger, etc., etc. Terminator and Terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far superior to the hero. The threat and tension are constant. <br /> <br /> Some of the other important weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of using deus ex machina. The characters generally disappear and reappear as their skills within the story are needed. The villain appears in perhaps three scenes. He has no reasons. It appears unexpectedly and inexplicably. In one scene, Hellboy seems to face a real threat (groups of monsters): a character unleashes his abilities: the screen turns white and, inexplicably, the monsters are dead, but everyone else lives. A secondary character established in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film. Your character is so thin, the relationship so underdeveloped. It is clear that she is just a kind of support to push the plot and make everything make sense. I do not want to ruin the end of the movie, but essentially a character that is dead is miraculously and incredibly restored to life. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from a poor dialogue and a line that is not. Do not be smart or funny. After a while, everything begins to take shape. <br /> <br /> What's more, Del Toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired images. And whoever has made the creative decision to turn the hellboy's main weapon into a weapon instead of his clumsy arm, must be fired. Essentially, the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film, degrading the fights to nothing more than a shot on one side. <br /> <br /> The few positive aspects include: The cinematography is very good. At all times, dark lighting and a palette of darker colors establish a sense of state of mind. As well as the use of interesting places. However, maybe everything is a bit similar. <br /> <br /> The use of CGI and Fx is well done. We never get an overload. When the effects are used, they are used well and the feeling of realism is maintained. Rather similar to how Nolan used FX in Batman. I much prefer this method to the overlapping effects we see often. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a pretty bad movie. The real shame is that (despite not reading the comics) I found that the film wasted a lot of potential. Hellboy as a character has many fascinating seemingly instantaneous dimensions that are completely unexplored. The film has observation capacity, in the sense that if it appears on television and there is nothing else worth seeing. But in any other situation I would not bother about it.
