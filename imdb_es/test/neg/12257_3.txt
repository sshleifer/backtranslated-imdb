A mix of really strange and surreal visual ideas that probably seemed extremely disconcerting on the printed page; just what attracted Robert Redford to the project, one can never know. Sidney J. Furie leads this incomprehensible journey of a selfish motorcyclist who takes a youthful milquetoast under his wing; the child admires this antihero and, finally, begins to imitate his amorality. Unknown and unpleasant, although for some, the sight of Redford undressing, being about to undress or have undressed could be enough to justify attention. Lauren Hutton also gets naked, however, all sexy flashes are just a teaser for the smartest. there is simply no history. Maybe Furie was making an esoteric comment about the irresponsible wheels and his flock around 1970. If true, this previous approach to the Blank Generation failed, since the movie was not a success. * 1/2 of ****
