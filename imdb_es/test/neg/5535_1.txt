The Gun is probably the worst movie I've seen in my life. The direction of the comedians is very poor, the dialogues seem to have been written by a teenager of 13 years, the plot (what plot?) Is another "suspense" in which it is very difficult to get involved. Finally, nothing in this movie is good. A big thank you to all those involved and particularly to the Montreal film festival that presented this film IN COMPETITION!
