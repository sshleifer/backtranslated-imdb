Obviously, he never consulted any book about Lucille Ball, especially his autobiography. I have never seen so many mistakes in a biographical film, from his early years in Celoron and Jamestown to his final years with Desi. I could write a complete list of factual errors, but I would continue on the pages. In general, I think Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply can not be represented by anyone but themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be furious at the amount of mistakes made in this movie. The filmmakers tried hard, but the film seems very careless.
