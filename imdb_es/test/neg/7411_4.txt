A big waste of time is all you'll get from this bag. I rented this with the hope of a thriller with maybe some credible scenes, but I was always disappointed. I think the title should have been "Camping 101", or something similar. Well, anyway, get away from this movie. It numbs you to death. Do not be afraid of the big foot, be afraid of this shit!
