This was one of Christie's later stories. Throughout his long career, he was interested in the changing narrative and the notion of agents in conflict. Both are essentially the same and are reduced to questions about who controls or creates the situation. <br /> <br /> In detective fiction, the game is a matter of conflicting realities. The murderer tries to change the reality to deceive the detective, the writer tries to do the same with the reader. Both the reader and the detective are in similar battles to create what they see. That's why his stories often include a writer. <br /> <br /> In her work, she explores every combination of tricks she can think of dealing with this. On the way, we often have bodies that are not what they seem, and times, and intentional victims and so on. But the true magic of books is this notion of control. In 'Bertram's' it was literally a building. <br /> <br /> Here, he is a dead man. Well, sometimes that happens, but not like that. It's as if the writer was the famous Mr. Rafiel. This is particularly sweet for Marple readers who recall this same character from the "Mystery of the Caribbean," which was also framed in some way by his nephew. In that story, Rafiel was the transporter of the story to the authorities. <br /> <br /> The producers of this series have an almost crazy commitment to use a different creative team in each one. Sometimes a soft job occurs. The episode of 'Bertram' was staged brilliantly. This is the most luxurious of all, and has an active camera. But unlike the work of 'Bertram', it has nothing to do with history. <br /> <br /> The camera moves and captures simply because it can. The quote from 'Citizen Kane' at the beginning was a bit too literal and direct. This story is good, but the adapter took some pretty critical things, and that irrelevant camera bothers. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of Ted - 2 of 3: It has some interesting elements.
