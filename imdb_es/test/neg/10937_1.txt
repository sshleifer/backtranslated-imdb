Uwe Boll, seriously, just ripped off Se7en's basic idea and dialogue? Why is it so hard for this asshole to be original? He even mentioned in an interview with Gametrailers that he chooses things like games to convert into movies because the characters, the arguments, the background stories, etc. They are already there and they are ready for you to play. <br /> <br /> I guess not. It's not a stretch too big for me to steal another movie altogether ... <br /> <br /> I mean, really, what the hell ...? Here is something I did in the "honor" of Uwe ... <br /> <br /> http://zuucka.deviantart.com/art/Uwe-Boll-is-a-Douchebag-70369862
