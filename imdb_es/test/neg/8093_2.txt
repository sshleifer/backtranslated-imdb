Highly flawed but almost like an observable comedy that runs as a rejection of the Farrelly brothers. The most criminal of this is casting. I could not believe for a minute Jerry O Connell and Jake Busey in the role of superstuds, that I could attract any woman lightly, nor could I believe Shannon Elizabeth (the very beautiful one) as a street cop. The story is predictable, but it manages to raise the tone on some occasions, although the "disgusting" scenes, meant to be "comic shock" (one involving one amputated testicle and another in a sperm bank) ) They are simple horrible. If this movie is on TV, then it's probably worth watching if it's too boring, but please, do not waste your money renting it!
