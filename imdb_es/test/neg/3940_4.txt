Stay Alive is an insipid horror film about a video game that kills people in the same way they die in the game. Friends who play this game soon realize this, and then realize that they must beat the Blood Countess of the video game or accept their fate. We have had video tapes on The Ring, a deadly website on FearDotCom. Now it is in video games. Stay Alive does some things well; the development of the character is much deeper than it would normally be in a horror movie. We really see some of the feelings and the past of the characters and we know them quite well, so the audience can get some emotions for them. The movie is also very suspense. The tense and disconcerting moments are often reproduced in the film, accompanied by disturbing and spooky music. There are a lot of jumps and jolts for the viewer. This may be ideal once or twice, but these false fears that Hollywood seems to enjoy too much in horror movies today, fade into Stay Alive. The camera will tend to provide sharp angles or quick flashes to give viewers a very quick view of a demon or witch, and try to scare them with this sudden explosion on the screen. Why? The blood is obviously very weak due to the film's certificate. The script of Stay Alive is very cheesy and quite ridiculous, and the characters tend to interpret it too melodramatically and confusingly. In addition, clich√©s come from all directions, for example, people who wander alone looking for a strange noise or if they have seen a figure in the dark, will investigate. However, the computer graphics used for the video game segments are quite impressive and they look colorful and sharp, working well with the other parts of the movie. But in general, there is not enough with this movie. Stretching in a little over a hundred minutes, it will not be a battle to Stay Alive, but rather, Stay Awake.
