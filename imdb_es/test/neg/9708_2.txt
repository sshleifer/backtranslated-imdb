Well, Wright could have made a description of life around 1800, as he does repeatedly and anally because it was written instead of published, but it is not Austen's and it should not pretend to be an adaptation. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Bennett looks like a rural laundress. This is a spoiled woman: they have servants (do you remember the scene of the book with the servant wearing the hair, etc.)? But Wright portrays her with a rough and reddened skin all over her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs roaming! If he wants bucolic, I should try Tess. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett: the script is too cute and modern and ignored the weakness in it. It is assumed that the scene in which he stops playing Mary will make you tremble, not pass in seconds. If you do not, do not include it. <br /> <br /> MacFadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some sort of Pride by acting the numbers. The first proposal seems a nervous schoolboy instead of a man who overcomes his pride to make a proposal under his post. Most of his lines, he could also be reading a shopping list. <br /> <br /> Lydia is horrible. Completely above with excessive shouting and jumping. In fact, Knightley plays Elizabeth more as the smiling character in which Lydia is actually in the book, sometimes. <br /> <br /> And Elizabeth. Knightley, half the time, clearly imitates Ehle's voice and intonation: close your eyes to see what copy he is. And in your paper, you see Wright's big mistake: THERE IS NO PREJUDICE. <br /> <br /> From the first encounter with Darcy, she clearly likes it. When he tells Bingley about the attractiveness of women in the corridor, she initially looks hurt, not surprised or offended. The latter must establish the prejudice side of things. And when she and "Caroline" are wandering around the room, she runs into a joke, obviously about him. And by virtually eliminating Wickham, it is not possible for Elizabeth to invest enough to establish the damaging aspects of that relationship. <br /> <br /> And apparently, it's Caroline, not Miss Bingley. And Mr. Bingley wanders happily in Jane's bedroom. And y Wright can boast how good he is with the period he wants. But a few panoramic photos of rural life (showing a preference for Hardy) do not excuse him for the dazzling mistakes of the whole place. <br /> <br /> The director of photography, who clearly wants awards, should have stopped. He swerved between Bronte and Hardy throughout the film, and was not Tess's last shot / lighting proposal? The need to see Darcy walking through the landscape with the sloppy shirt was simply silly. But the most important thing is that, when going between those 2 very different landscapes, they forget the most important one: Austen. (He would have laughed out loud at Elizabeth = sad, therefore = rain, running through picturesque madness, Darcy's wet garbage). <br /> <br /> I admit that I found it impossible to watch the movie without using the Book as context. I was prepared to give him some room for maneuver, since he had to provide the story in a short space of time. But forgetting completely half the core of the book in prejudice and Darcy was more constipated than proud, made it almost impossible to see. I could only see it as a disaster with generally deficient performances (when Knightley was not imitating Ehle, she was slouching or jumping or both and just calmed down a couple of times to indicate that she did have some promise, but she was making a joke transmitting emotion is not a substitute for a poor script and a poor address), although for some it was simply a case of bad script. <br /> <br /> Only Tom Holland would escape censorship. While softening the comedic aspects of Collins, it became a very interesting approach. Dench does magnificently what he can do while he sleeps, either here or at Oscar Wilde, but this was supposed to be Lady Catherine De Bourgh NOT Lady Bracknell. I was too crazy <br /> <br /> The reduced length could have been handled by a competent scriptwriter, right? Not the characters filling gaps in the story and helping the audience all over the place. Elizabeth could not have reached the figure of Â£ 10k. And while they wanted to waste time with their learning of Darcy's involvement in Wickham's marriage, the lines did not fit with Lydia. It was the worst case of an incongruous exhibition in the piece. <br /> <br /> It really is something awful. Anyone who reviews it by saying that it works well in the context of the book is someone who, frankly, I do not think he has read or understood the characterizations of the thing. Wright seems to think that his characters are in the 1990s, not in the 1709's because of his behavior. I am not convinced that you have read the book, you certainly do not understand it. He does not understand the ingenuity or lightness of Austen's touch; Of course, he made a boring and heavy film. <br /> <br /> What is possibly worse was the sad and pathetic need of the chick lovers to need the 'I love you, I love you everywhere so they can sigh and get off. The fact that it has no place in an Austen work is apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Someone who reviews it as a movie alone? Well, more difficult for me, except that I would notice the bad performance, the weak Darcy, and the agitation, skipping the inane irritation of the whole thing. If you are going to adapt, you can change a lot, but if you lose the spirit and the key motivations, then do not insult the book by taking its title.
