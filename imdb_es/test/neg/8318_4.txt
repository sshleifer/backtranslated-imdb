I am very disappointed because I expected a real trip as promised in the many comments. The script is very bad with many holes and the direction too. The director completely failed to develop each violent scene with emotions and suspense. Try very hard to follow an aspiring thriller. Therefore, I had to see how each bullet was spent without giving me any sense. I always wondered what kind of movie I'm watching. So I did not like that she aggressively smoked one cigarette after another, but maybe the movie was supported in part by the tobacco industry. The ending is also very disappointing. I can not understand how Jodie Foster could have been nominated for the Golden Globe in the worst role of her life. Jodie, that's why I really liked the PANIC ROOM or the FLIGHT PLAN. This is definitely one of the worst I've seen. 4/10.
