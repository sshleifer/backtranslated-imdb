This movie was not the best ... but I had some good actors in it. Isiaiah Washington was quite good as a homeless person, Guy Torrey was good as his disabled brother, Ice-T was humorous as the owner and, surprisingly, the actress Tami Roman was good as a judge in the movie. I did not even know it was her and I'm a big fan of the Real World. She was totally believable. Hopefully this film does not hinder the development of these actors. I know that Isiaiah has left this film far behind with the success of Gray's Anatomy, Ice-T with her regular role in the Special Unit of the New York Police and Tami Roman has got a recurring role in Sex Love and Secrets (the new telenovela of UPN). I wish the same for the other actors because a bad movie does NOT make a bad actor.
