This movie is just silly. Do not bother looking at it; Believe me, it's better. <br /> <br /> Long and short of the plot: a defense lawyer represents a man who murdered his son and other children. When defending it, it is with a wood doll of Pinnochio. She takes the doll home. Pinnochio is possessed and begins to kill people. <br /> <br /> This movie moves very slowly only to have such a weak ending. The plot is very bad and Dennis Michael Tenney's musical score is pitiful. The story, written by Kevin S. Tenney, has no meaning and does not evoke horror or fear. This is far from his work in The Night of the Demons and the Board of Witches, which are decent outlets but nothing great. His address is fine, but with such a bad story, nobody could have made this movie so good. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: 2 out of 10, maybe the most bland and boring movie I've seen all year.
