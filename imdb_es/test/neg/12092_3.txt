First, what is really great about this movie: <br /> <br /> - Ryan Reynolds, excellent acting! There are very few actors that I really like and for now he is one of them. He has an incredible ability to pose as characters. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack! Very good music played at the right time. <br /> <br /> - The idea of ​​a nine lost in his own world, unable to leave. <br /> <br /> However, I give it only 3 out of 10 for certain defects: <br /> <br /> - Second part horrible. It seems that the director was very anxious to do something new, but despite the efforts was really boring <br /> <br /> - Melissa, a very annoying character. He could not stand the scenes with her, that is, he was constantly upset. She represents everything that is wrong with the American woman. <br /> <br /> - Terrible explanation of the numbers. The director was so busy with the development of the character, that he completely missed the point of a good story ... excuse koalas? brr ... terrible! <br /> <br /> This movie had great potential. The filming is well done, the music is really good, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> See it only if you're a Ryan Reynolds fan, or have a lot of free time.
