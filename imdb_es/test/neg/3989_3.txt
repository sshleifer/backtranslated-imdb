The film is visually impressive: from the dusty interior of the church with the stove on, through the drizzly street and the ruined garage to the fire that is the highlight of the film. It also has a wonderful sense of time, both in the 1950s (the opening of the film) and in the 1960s. All the performances are first class, especially Mathew MacFadyen as the psychotic preacher and Gerard McSorley as the father who finds his own intolerance terribly magnified by his son. What a pity, then, that the story is so ridiculous. To begin with, by concentrating on the relationship between Gabriel (McFadyen) and his family, he does not fully demonstrate how he has managed to maintain so much influence in the community. In the church, we see five or six of the main characters in the front, and another two or three in the back, but the rest of the congregation could be mannequins: they do not show signs of listening, paying attention or dissent. of the; in the cockfight, no one says yes or no when he interrupts the proceedings, but no one applauds or condemns when Caroline throws a pint over him; A situation that results in a stone thrown through the pub window is mysteriously resolved by the onset of labor pains. Second, Middletown (which is not really a city, but a small village) seems to lack some essential services, such as the police and the fire service: murder can only be dealt with by a family member with a lever ; residents see a hell that threatens to engulf the entire city as if they were in the movies. In fact, everyday things, like telephones and newspapers, are notoriously absent, the rural community is strangely devoid of farm animals or wheat fields, and most disconcerting of all for a "typical" environment in northern Ireland, there is only one Christian community - not even a couple of Anglicans to spice up the mix. Even if you are willing to suspend disbelief, the story itself is rather threadbare, a pale imitation of an A.J. The melodrama of Cronin. And music? Well, it's beautiful during the first two minutes, but when the same four chords are repeated non-stop for 90 minutes, it becomes more than a little irritating. My advice: look at this with the sound off.
