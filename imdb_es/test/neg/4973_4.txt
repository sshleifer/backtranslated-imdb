Now it's 2008, who really cares about a guy like DB Sweeney, even back then it was not a big problem. <br /> <br /> Two tickets to Paradise is a summary story that is well and true when three friends hit the road in each of their personal circumstances. Once again, a proven plot. The problem with this film, apart from its title "so bad that it is convincing", is the script. <br /> <br /> Cliché after cliché three guys do the same thing you've seen in all the other road movies ... and blow up Vanna White's house. <br /> <br /> John C. McGinley's acting work is excellent, especially compared to that of the late DB Sweeney's. (His career is dead, hence the delay, although I heard he is moving to television, it's good for him). In addition, it is likely that John C has the least horrible character in the movie. <br /> <br /> The score is so generic that it actually looks like you're watching a third-rate movie since 1993, or Jeff Anderson's movie, Now You Know (It also delayed me a few years, but at least that was I want to say, yah, I think I enjoyed some of that, but the nerd guy is upset, DB tries to be this great unsuccessful guitarist (with some approximate influences, like some of the worst in classic rock) who has a strange relationship with a stripper, and John C is a player who is his wife and The boy left him after the death of his father, as well as the visit of one of the henchmen of his betting agent. <br /> <br /> I still think about ways to improve this film, but I think that burning the script would have been a good start. <br /> <br /> But, as I have hinted all this time, it is not the worst movie in history. that I have to see McGinley in a leading role, I'll take it. Let's start getting some better projects.
