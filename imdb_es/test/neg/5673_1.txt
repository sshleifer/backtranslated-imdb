Look, I practically lost all hope on Nickelodeon after seeing their new "success", the show of The Naked Brothers Band, and "ICarly" is no exception. If you have not noticed, ICarly is now number 1 on comedy television! After hearing this, I decided to watch some episodes myself to see what the hype was about! I have one word to describe this program in general ... "NO EFFORT!" I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT DAN SCHNEIDER WOULD LEAVE THIS LOW AND DO SOMETHING CRAPPY! IT IS AWFUL!!! Let me give you the details ... <br /> <br /> ICarly's cast begins with a girl named Carly Shay, played by Miranda Cosgrove! Carly, unfortunately throughout the episodes, does not really have personality, so to speak! I guess she's supposed to be the average girl in the program (because MANY people have an army veteran for a father, an artist for a brother and a popular teen program recorded and produced with thousands of dollars in equipment!) And for say the most about Miranda, YOUR ACTING IS PATHETIC !!! It sounds like a 3-year-old girl with Tourette's syndrome in half the time without sugar! <br /> <br /> Then, we have Sam Puckett (my God, where do they get these names !?) played by Jennette McCurdy! Sam is the "CO-HOST" of Carly's web program! (Wait a minute, if Sam presents the show with Carly, should not the program be called "ICarly and Sam?" I bet Sam feels he's been cheated!) Sam is supposed to be the bully in the cast! (Yes, because EVERY stalker girl wears skin-tight shirts and pants with blond hair extensions!) Also, I think, she's also supposed to be a Tomboy. This would be a bit funny to me, but it's his cliché ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡That his cliche destroys him! The word game "Give me a bucket of fried chicken" is over used. TOO MUCH !! Give this girl a script! and GIVE HIM A COFFEE because, do not get me wrong, Jennette's performance is fine, but throughout the middle of the episodes, she seems to be falling asleep. <br /> <br /> Then we have Freddie Benson, played by Nathan Kress. Freddie is the technical producer for the Carly and Sam show! There's not much more to say about Freddie other than the fact that he's a techno freak and he's in love with Carly, which never works! HERE WE GO AGAIN WITH THE CLICHES !!! DO NOT STAND UP? Nathan's performance is also good, but sometimes it seems excessive! HE IS TOO BORED !!! <br /> <br /> Finally, and my favorite, we have Spencer Shay, played by Jerry Trainor. I want to make this perfectly clear; IF IT WAS NOT, THE THIS GROUP OF STARTING A SHOW WOULD BE MUD! Spencer is the one who keeps the show alive! Spencer is Carly's older brother! If you had a 5-year-old little boy who was at the same time with high and constipated caffeine, you would have this character summarized! Spencer also earns money for being an artist! (Hmmm ... I wonder ...) You would think that a professional artist would make promising sculptures ... yes, I love sarcasm! His art is quite small! I mean, what kind of sculpture name is "MERRY SNIFFMUS !!?" WHAT!!? ESEO IS AS MUCH OF A MUCH CREATIVITY AS A HILLARY CLINTON DISCOURSE ABOUT DRUGS !!!! IT IS STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> PLOT ADJUSTMENTS AND MORALS ARE POOP BAGS WITHOUT EFFORT! These programs now tell children that stealing, lying, and being an asshole to your parents is a GOOD THING! IF THESE ARE THE AWESOME BLADES CLASSES THAT ARE TAKING THE CHILDREN THESE DAYS, I DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN LOOKING AT ANYONE OF ALL! THIS IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF SHIT I HAVE SEEN ON TV! WITHOUT EXCEPTION!!! NICKELODEON, "¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡! 10
