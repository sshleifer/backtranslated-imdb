Is it me or the fact that the evil racing team is Japanese and that their arrogant star driver is German seems a little exaggerated? Maybe it's like that on the international racing circuit, but if all the United States represented them are fools like Cody and his mechanic Chris (Peter Berg, who must have been still learning how to act), then he would be encouraging another country. Formula movies can be good, but the characters must be nice and nobody meets that criteria in this movie. To put it succinctly, a very bad movie.
