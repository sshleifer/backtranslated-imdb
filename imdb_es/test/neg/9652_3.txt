Oh, what a disappointment this movie is. I can not believe it was directed by Wajda. There is practically no argument, and 90% of the movie consists of several people going in and out of the screen, trying to interact weakly while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes right at the end, but in that moment I simply stopped worrying when trying to suppress my yawns. <br /> <br /> Almost the entire film was shot with a handheld camera, which is supposed to be conveying the feeling of "personal immediacy" but there is nothing personal or immediate in most of the film. Instead, the constant shaking of the camera made me dizzy. To be fair, there are also some great shots (no pun), but nothing that makes you "Wow!". <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with the Katyn massacre, the movie will go by scratching your head. If you are familiar, you will also scratch your head, although perhaps for different reasons. Basically, the film states and reaffirms again and again that it was the Soviets who murdered thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This point is repeatedly insisted on as if someone in the audience needed to be convinced of this basic historical fact. However, the film never tries to explain WHY they were killed. After all, tens of thousands of Polish soldiers in the other Soviet prisoner-of-war camps were not harmed and were released in 1941. Nor is it adequately explained HOW MANY people died, although the figure of 20,000 is thrown a couple of times. <Br /> <br /> The performance is appropriate, since only Komorowska (old lady) and Chyra (Lieutenant Jerzy) give remarkable performances, but they can act for about 10-15 minutes in total. Certainly not enough to carry the whole movie. Many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their morning appearance than for their acting skills, but I will not mention their names. Suffice it to say that they are definitely not Oscar material, so any claim that this film was "stolen" from the Academy Award is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The tone of the movie is also wrong. On the one hand, it tries to be a precise historical drama; On the other hand, he resorts to cheap anti-Soviet propaganda, such as showing a Russian soldier tearing off the Polish flag and using it to clean his boots. Then there are some puzzling scenes that have no connection with the plot, such as a couple climbing to a roof or the liquidation of the University of Krakow. <br /> <br /> There are many missed opportunities to make this film more interesting, such as adding a political angle to the story, or showing the German discovery of the tombs, or even portraying Anna's journey from the part occupied by the Soviets until Krakow occupied by the Germans. All of these aspects could have been most of the movie, but instead, they have been reduced to a couple of minutes. In the end, we get a collection of boring, confusing and boring scenes about the reaction of the Poles to one of their greatest tragedies of the Second World War. Not very convincing and not worthy of Wajda at all.
