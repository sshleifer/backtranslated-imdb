I wanted to like this movie. I really did it. I was so excited when I saw the preview, which scared me so much. But when I saw the movie itself, I was disappointed. The acting is forced, and the comedy attempts are unfortunately misplaced and forced. And I'm sorry, but a boy who is chased by a turbo in a potty is not funny or scary, he's just stupid. I grew up in the legend of the bell witch, so I know quite a bit about it. Many facts in the film are right, but this movie should have been much better. The whole scene of the birthday party, for example, lasts about fifteen minutes, adds nothing to the plot or the story, and should have been left on the floor of the cutting room. A stronger editor could have been able to get a decent movie out of this mess. <br /> <br /> Please understand, I am not involved in any other way or form with the other Bell Witch movie. and I'm not trying to "attack" this IMDb listing. I only say it as it is.
