Warning It may contain spoilers <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I spent $ 5 on this movie on Amazon and I wish I had never spent it. I've never seen sucking horrible special effects, or acting. I mean, Jack-0 is just a laughable monster and his disguise looks like something you could buy at a Halloween store or make yourself. The acting is just horrible, especially Sean Kelly, I mean, he's so pathetic with his little lines "COme get me PUmpkinman." I laughed so much that it's stupid. I want to say that the movie is so horrible that they had to put a few minutes of nudity so that people would not turn it off. I think the most ridiculous scene is when the woman puts a butter knife in the toaster and is electrocuted. I mean, they see that it looked so fake and the mannequin could buy it at any Halloween store or do it myself. Well, I recommend not watching this corny movie because it will be time for you never to return.
