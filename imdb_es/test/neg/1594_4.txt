I have seen most of John Waters movies. With the exception of several of its first that are not available, I've seen almost all, so it's obvious that I'm a big fan and it's true that I have a great tolerance for the rude and irreverent in his films. . While I was above and disgusting, I adored the FEMALE PROBLEM and the POLYESTER, two monumental tributes to bad taste and excess that are very funny movies. Therefore, I'm certainly not picky and I can take advantage of most of what Waters has to offer. However, at PINK FLAMINGOS he has created a film so repellent, so funny and so offensive that I could not even stand it. In his other films he made before it became more popular, they were fun. However, here the humor is simply not there, since it seems that the intention is to surprise the spectators and not to entertain them in any way. I'm glad that after making this film, Waters' sense of humor improved, since the faeces of dogs that consume Divine (as in this film) are shocking but not at all entertaining. My advice is to skip this movie and pretend that it never happened and then watch its infinitely better films of the 70s and 80s.
