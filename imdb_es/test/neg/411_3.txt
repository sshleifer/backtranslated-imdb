A book EXTREMELY fast-paced, stimulating, interesting and rich in details. It is a pity that the film does not have any of these qualities. Not only was the smooth behavior of Tom Hanks or Robert Langdon Laughable, but the name changes to key characters, great deviations from the line of the original story and poor Irish / Italian accent of Carmalengo. FOREVER. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of A & D the book, I had high hopes of a more luxurious film and faithful to the detailed book, where I would start and end just like the book did, leaving me wanting more. <br /> <br /> The movie really depressed me in the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> The awesome thing was how ... I'm sorry! I could not even finish that sentence without laughing. <br /> <br /> in a few words: Vittoria was the chip hottie, a second for Audrey Tatou and there were some very nice Alfa Romeos. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading the book to understand that, if Ron Howard should insist on making ANOTHER book to film, I would be happy to save my Â£ 6.40 for a Kinger Zinger meal and some chicken wings, much more entertaining and much more satisfying!
