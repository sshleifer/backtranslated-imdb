I guess you could say that this movie has great potential, but nothing more, because the filmmakers did it wrong. The plot is practically incomprehensible, the rhythm is lethargic and the performance is pathetic. And what the hell is a commercial rat? Worst of all, however, the climax of this film is the anticlimax of all anticlimaxes; In addition, the title does not seem remotely accurate. The only redeeming feature of this movie is the pretty dark-haired woman ... well, the blonde was also pretty, but she was annoying and not as good as the brunette. Anyhoo, as in many movies, this will be seen only in MST3K.
