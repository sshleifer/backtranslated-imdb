This video has audio intended for someone to hear while they sleep. And the same can be said about the video. <br /> <br /> Does Morgan and his wife intend to work at minimum wages? With a camera rolling? And his little wife who complains? Give me a break. Both are rich. They are sitting in their fake apartment of $ 350 / month filming this with their $ 1,000 / month each video equipment of 12. <br /> <br /> I used to respect Morgan, but now his experience of "30 days" it is nothing more than trying to deceive any willing spectator who is willing to be cheated. <br /> <br /> Come on, Morgan, they're filming you doing a $ 6.00 per hour job and you're getting paid by naive employers who do not see that big camera filming the whole thing? And should not we think that they are not paying you under the table?
