The first third of this movie I loved and I thought it was going to be one of Truffaut's best films. I loved the plot in which a pen pal marries a man from half the world: unseen. Especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the true pen pal so that she could take her place! Then he cleaned up the husband's huge bank account and disappeared! I was really hooked and I wanted to see more, ... <br /> <br /> And then, the movie collapsed and it became completely stupid! Although she came from New Caladonia (an island in the Pacific) and he from Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean), when she travels to the south of France, he finds her almost immediately. Hmm, ... the odds are 187,000,000 to 1 but he finds it. Then, instead of killing her or delivering her to the police, he forgives her, even when he recognizes what he has done. Well, this is hard to believe, but it's okay, but then he helps to hide it from a private detective by killing him! Nobody is so stupid! Yes, the character played by Catherine Deneuve is quite beautiful, but, friends, this is nonsense. Also, if he only wanted her as a sexual object, then why would he do this for a woman who is often frigid and completely selfish and evil? <br /> <br /> This movie, because of its very ridiculous plot, yes They do not deserve such high ratings! Unless you're a Truffaut fan, try another movie, even one of Truffaut's, it's NOT.
