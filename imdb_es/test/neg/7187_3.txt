There is not much to say at the end. One would have expected much more from a director who made much better films in the past. It just seems that he did it without really worrying. The actors are doing their job (although Belmondo is far from incredible), but you just do not get hooked. In a word, it's boring. This is even more disappointing as I heard several times that this movie could be considered a reaction to all the great American blockbusters, which are considered a threat to the French exception by those who simply can not admit that they should resort to other work. . I tell you, if that's the best reaction we're supposed to have, boy, I'll get very depressed soon ...
