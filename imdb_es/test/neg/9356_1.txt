I can not believe some of the comments here in the reviews. The film is dated, of course, and from our comfortable point of view in the CGG era, many of the special effects are now very unconvincing. But even with this in mind, Helen of Troy is so bad that it's almost laughable. <br /> <br /> The script is horrible, just horrible, without any characterization. As a result of the performances, you can see how Hardwicke and Andrews writhe in an agony of shame, as they offer the most ridiculous shallow trivial code snippets. The writers seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a terrible didactic script that allows the viewer not to decide anything for himself. The beginning of the film explains the historical background as if no one had heard of ancient Greece; I know they had American audiences to take into consideration, but the fatherly way we are told everything twice to make sure we understand the action is really horrible. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not believe the previous comments that describe this. The movie as a great epic movie. Even taking into account comparatively primitive cinematography and the relative sophistication of today's audience, this movie really sucks.
