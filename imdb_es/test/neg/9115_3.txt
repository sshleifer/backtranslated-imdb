The configuration of "Nature of the Beast" is ingeniously simple, and is fraught with limitless suspense potential: the beset vendor Jack (a very tamed Lance Henriksen) gets into trouble in the form of hitchhiker Adrian (Eric Roberts), who he seems to be in possession of incriminating information against jack. Oh, and more than a million dollars have been stolen from a casino and someone nicknamed 'Hatchet Man' is dismembering people in the desert. It sounds great, right? Something like "The Hitcher" meets "Psycho". One or both of these men have a secret, and nothing is what it seems! Well, unfortunately, the writer and director Victor Salva (from "Jeepers Creepers" and "Powder" fame) does not have enough ideas to continue the film, the scenario does not arouse tension or suspense (poison for what is supposed to be a "thriller") , and the inclusion of an underlying homoerotic tone seems out of place. Henriksen evokes an unusual Everyman, who is not very attached to the earth (even with a good instinct), but Roberts is as threatening and terrifying as an extra in "Death Wish 3"; we are never dragged to the point where we really CARE about what is happening, and the conclusion slides into unlikely territory (I kept thinking it was going to be "Fight Club" again, but I was wrong). Too. "The nature of the beast" could have been something else ... instead of nothing else.
