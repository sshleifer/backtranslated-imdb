"Frightmare" from 1983 is a strange little movie. The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of the classic horror movies of the 30s and 40s with the impact factor of the then explosive genre of the 80s. It is not totally successful (mostly due to very obvious budget constraints and the unprofessional caliber of its cast of young actors) but still has its moments, mainly due to the classy presentation (more elegant than the film deserves) by the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays a former movie star of terror (wing Vincent Price) called "Conrad Ratzoff". At the beginning of the movie, we find the horror star who has been filming a dental prosthesis commercial and we quickly learn that old Conrad is a little crazy, prima donna jerk-off. Just when you think it could not be more unpleasant, the commercial director berates Conrad for blowing a shot for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him from a balcony until his death. Well eh Conrad then visits some fans at a horror movie club on the university campus, unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech and finally ends up returning to his mansion waiting to die. Still a fighter even at Death's door, he manages to get rid of a despicable business partner by suffocating him with a pillow before finally giving him a kick himself. Then, Conrad rests in true Hollywood style in a high-tech neon tomb with video screens over the coffin, which will play personal video messages from Conrad himself for visitors who come in to pay their respects. <br /> <br /> It is at this point that the children of the Horror Movie Society University decide to visit the tomb of Conrad after visiting hours, burst into the grave and take his body home for a party that lasts all the night. (It's not exactly my idea of ​​fun, but hey, these are characters from an 80s horror movie. Logic has no place here). The college students spend the night dining with Conrad's body sitting in a place of honor, posing for photos with and even dancing around the room with him, before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to return to his crypt by the morning. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ratzoff, distressed by the theft of her husband's body, called a psychic friend to try to "get" Conrad through a session. You can decipher the rest from here. As Conrad was not a very nice guy in life, it is not hard to assume that he will not be more friendly with death. Psychic Lady gets in touch with Conrad and he awakens in a predictably marked way, then spends the rest of the movie walking through the corridors of the ridiculously huge student house, and takes care of catching the young grave robbers one by one. This is where the movie falls apart. Endless scenes of teenagers wandering through empty corridors that say "Hello? Is there someone there?" are interspersed with occasional outbursts of violence (we get a pretty twisted decapitation scene, which is the film's climax) before the last two survivors finally realize (much later than any semi-intelligent person would have discovered the same) thing). ..but again, we're in an 80s horror movie!), that the only way to stop the chaos is to return Conrad's body to his crypt where it belongs. The slow rhythm is completed with a lot of strange lights and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack composed almost entirely of sound effects instead of music (thunder, moans and moans, howls, etc.) that They become very annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend "Frightmare" to anyone who has not grown up watching cheap movies like this one on the 80's nightly cable. Fans of "Modern Horror" will undoubtedly find "Frightmare" incredibly slow and ridiculous. However, if you came of age in that magical decade, you may get a burst of nostalgia for "Frightmare." Fans of Jeffrey ("Re-Animator") Combs may also want to take a look, as the future Dr. West appears in one of the first roles here as one of the unfortunate film students. <br /> <br /> I will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the EastWestDVD label (combined with Roy Ward's "Vault of Horror" and sold in dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. I have been told that the movie has got a luxury release through the people of Troma, which seems appropriate. If you are a type of Troma person, then "Frightmare" will be yours.
