Tom and Jerry are visiting Africa and disguise themselves in the manner of "Amos-n-Andy". They even act and speak differently, with the standard degrading use of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotyped image of blacks portrayed in many cartoons of the time. Apart from the offensive images, this cartoon is not very good. Why did they go to Africa in the first place? Apparently, just to provide the audience with another Amos-n-Andy and the additionally used cannibalistic portrait of the African natives. The only reason we got a 2 instead of a 1 is that there are a few decent seconds involving an octopus. <br /> <br /> It's worth a view, that will still leave you with your head wondering how ignorance could prevail ... <br /> <br /> (Note, I think some cartoons that contain stereotypical racial images They are very good, everything depends on whether there is a good content around the cartoon, or if the only reason for the existence of the cartoon is to make it In other words, if you get rid of "Mammy", shuffling, poor grammar and the black face with images of giant lips, is there anything left? In the case of "Plane Dumb" there is no.)
