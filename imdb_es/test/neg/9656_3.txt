I can see what this movie intended to do. Unfortunately, it simply never completes the deal. The "crime of reality" aspect works well and the shots are first class. In fact, some of the scenes are incredibly evocative in a somewhat capricious way. It should be noted the silhouette of the detective who talks to the beaten woman, the scene of the detectives going through the trash and the father tying flies. Sometimes, some scenes get stuck in too much dialogue. Instead of showing the viewer, the writer treats it too much like a book. But the real problem lies in the edition. The story does not flow. It fails to make a whole of the sum of the parts. In the end, you are confused as to what is really happening. Those who like this type of detective movie like to follow, putting together the puzzle at the same time that the main characters do it. With such a poor edition it is difficult, if not almost impossible, to do this.
