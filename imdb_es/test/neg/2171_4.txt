Elderbush Gilch was a big disappointment to me. I heard how good it was, how important it was. It just did not hit me. He had an unintelligent story line, plus some sadistic and sadistic Native American characters that are completely offensive by today's standards. While the majority of D.W. Griffith's films have depth and intelligence, this feels more like a program image based on a formula. <br /> <br /> I loved seeing Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh in the roles prior to the birth of a nation, plus part of the staging of The battle scenes were pretty good. According to Griffith's future cameraman, Karl Brown, the audience was standing in their seats and shouting once that the cavalry came to an end. I did not feel anything. And believe me, I'm looking at Griffith's first works in Biograph. This movie is not what it used to be. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is that, for all its faults, it has many of Griffith's touches. It manages its main actors quite well, in addition to the scene in which the Indians are surrounding the cabin, which recalls the climax of the birth of a nation, a very superior film that would send shockwaves through America a little over a year after.
