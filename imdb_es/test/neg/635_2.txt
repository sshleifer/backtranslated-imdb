See ALIEN EXPRESS inspired feelings of amazement, shock, sorrow and, yes, sheer terror. To think that actors who have done a good job in the past should come up with something like this. The horror, the horror. <br /> <br /> Tell me if any of this sounds familiar to you. <br /> <br /> A train specially created for a political campaign is on its way to Las Vegas for a big rally for the candidate, a senator from Texas (Barry Corbin, the only actor with roles both ALIEN EXPRESS and WITHOUT COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in the same decade). At a railroad crossing in Utah, a meteorite incinerates a car waiting for the train to pass. <br /> <br /> The train stops. The local police is summoned. Oh, can it be? The senator has a lovely young woman (Amy Locane from CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who, by chance, was married to one of the officers who answered the 911 call. Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND DELIVER, LA BAMBA) is the ex husband. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, eeeeevil foreigners have managed to save on the train. <br /> <br /> The train leaves. Lou gets his friend to pilot a helicopter so that Lou can fall on the moving train (approximately 70 miles per hour) so he can save the day. As a reward of the friend, he crashes the helicopter against the mountain. <br /> <br /> This is another example of how badly written ALIEN EXPRESS is. The comrade of the police hero must die, we all know it. But he is supposed to die near the end of the third act, usually at the same time saving several lives. <br /> <br /> Once on the train, Lou manages to lose his shirt to be able to channel Bruce Willis in DIE HARD wearing a women's shirt. Yes, Lou is 46 years old but goes to the gym. It's not worth bothering with the role you're playing, but you're in good shape. <br /> <br /> The senator will have an afternoon of pleasure with Miss Utah, but the extraterrestrials intercede and both he and the woman are young enough that their granddaughter pays the final price. <br /> <br /> Soon we have bomb threats, we multiply the extraterrestrials and, of course, the train goes out of control and rushes towards its destination date, while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFFERENCE STROKES) tries to save as many lives as possible. <br /> <br /> There is exactly one surprise in the whole movie. At the beginning of the story, a couple raised wine glasses to celebrate their thirty-fifth anniversary, with hopes of thirty-five years more together. The guy is beaten, but he and Ms. Both live. Maybe the writers just lost track of them. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you would love to be a fly on the wall. These actors who have done a better job (and, really, deserve much better than this) are probably happy about the work. Did they really believe that they were working on something worthwhile, or were they crying (and / or drinking) to sleep at night? At the end of the story, the survivors (quite numerous, all of them considered) gather in the last carriage of the train, which is disconnected. The other cars pass by a cliff, but the one that contains the protagonists stops a few centimeters from the cliff. <br /> <br /> Lou and her ex meet. Happiness reigns. I thought that the first thing they would do was get off the train to have solid ground under their feet, but I am rambling. <br /> <br /> Someone looks out the window and sees a shot. star. Look, make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. The Earth is being bombarded with meteors that will open and the soft and creepy hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere. <br /> <br /> It has reached the point where, seeing the words "The Sci-Fi Channel Presents" appears The "original" movie tells us that we will be happy to have Ti-Vo so that we can move quickly during the next two hours. Or, better yet, just go ahead and erase two minutes of the story and spend that time more intelligently.
