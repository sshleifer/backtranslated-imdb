I was extremely disappointed with this one. I just read the wonderful story of Oscar Wilde, I hoped that at least some of the magic would be translated on the screen. Well, there were none. This version was played like a condensed and meaningless Reader's Digest movie. Not only did he feel rushed, but he was cheapened and unnecessarily rewritten. The main characters and the points of the plot were changed or eliminated completely. I appreciate the difficulties in trying to bring a novel to the screen, especially on what could very well have been a limited budget (TV), but there is no excuse to make a great story in this way. I recommend reading Wilde's story about the depravity that exists even in the most beautiful outdoors. But I can not advise anyone to rent this farce.
