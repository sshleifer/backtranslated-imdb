****** Spoilers in ******* What a snore-fest is boring, predictable, not scary. The film had no character development: I did not feel empathy towards any of the characters (except that it may be the little boy), and I did not care what happened to any of them. The movie had so many clich√©s, or items stolen from other horror movies. <br /> <br /> The movie was very predictable. Many times I said to myself: "Let me guess, {fill in conjecture} happens later?" Yes, he was right. Even in the opening scene, I predicted that the "attack" on the family was committed by a man, probably the father (because only the wife and children were attacked). Indeed, that is what happened (of course, you must wait 79 minutes to find out). And, of course, another "evil man" scenario. Why was the evil and killing his family? Because he is a man, duh! <br /> <br /> As someone else said, this movie can scare someone under 13 years of age, or a movie from the 1970s, but it's far from being a 'scary' movie by the standards of today. And, like so many horror movies, many of the threats were "false." Scary music, scary music, scary music and ... A raven suddenly flies to the window! Wow, terrifying! <br /> <br /> How did the old man at the bank manage to cross an open lot a couple of times without the father seeing him? I thought, sure, that the old man was a ghost. No, just a fucking movie. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie with 2 out of 10, because it kept my attention enough to sit on everything.
