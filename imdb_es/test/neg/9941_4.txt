I have read several reviews that ask the question "Why was this movie made?" I myself found that question in my mind while the hour and twenty minutes function seemed to crawl near the middle, only to give the feeling that it was filling up with steam at the end, when in reality I was not doing any of that. Then, "Why was this movie made?" I think that's a big question for those who observe Heftig og begeistret to wonder. This critic is proud of director Knut Erik Jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope, brotherhood and inspiration with this male chorus, but I do not think Jensen did enough to bring an exciting story to the table. Let me ask you this question: "Do members of the audience need more in a documentary than just a direct story to keep the interest"? My answer is yes, and this is where Jensen failed. Heftig og begeistret was a good documentary, but it was far from excellent. Jensen did a horrible job with the history and dedication of the subjects. It was great to listen to the songs, but over time, those songs seemed boring, overwhelming and a little precocious. From the opening scene where our men sing their hearts in blinding snow, I knew I was hooked, but as the film developed, I lost interest. Why? Jensen never took us, the members of the audience, to the next level. He maintained the level of the playing field and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film. Was this a movie about music or about men in the choir? Maybe the world never knows. <br /> <br /> Once again, I would like to say that Jensen did a phenomenal job finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen difficult times and how they managed to cope with them. music, but it was as if the whole male chorus was a group of the most boring men ever created. Jensen gave us the music magnificently, but it was the characters, the subjects, of whom I knew nothing at the end of the film. In the mix we had a 97-year-old man who still had his driver's license, we had a big man in a tub singing classical American songs, we had old men who in his youth were in the past, some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers, and we even had a former drug addict who had only been clean for eleven years. Did Jensen develop these interesting stories? No, he left them on the table. It was obvious that these singers were willing to talk more about the subject (see the politician who had missed his political days), but Jensen seemed to get away from those sincere moments and head directly to interesting places where he could make the chorus sing. For me, the music was defined at the beginning of the film, I wanted to be presented and listen to the stories of these individual men. They were all captivating, but Jensen seemed to ignore them completely. <br /> <br /> By ignoring the main themes of this documentary, Jensen failed to create any kind of tension towards the end. Without giving the ending away, I felt that Jensen was coloring the lines. Instead of being bold outside the lines, he chose not to create any moment of sympathy, emotion, nervousness or sadness. Jensen took our subjects from point A to point B to point C without asking us to get involved in any way. I can see how the national feeling had made this movie a great success in Norway, but for everyone else watching (ie, ME) more was needed. I wanted to feel for these guys. I wanted to know if they were going to do well while traveling, or they would just find themselves loved in their own city. There was no history, especially in part to no development of the subjects. When you look at modern documentaries (curiously, this movie was made in 2001), you want it to be reproduced in a similar way to any Hollywood movie. He wants suspense, realism and drama, unfortunately, with Heftig og begeistret he does not get anything like that. <br /> <br /> In general, I have to ask the question again: "Why was this movie made?" My final answer, Alex, is that Jensen wanted to show how difficult times and a changing economy can produce happiness even in the coldest places on Earth. I think Jensen wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population. That said, Jensen demonstrated this perfectly in this film, but he did not create a good documentary. When you make a film of this nature, I feel that you should look inside the group, examine the choir participants and listen to each of their stories to achieve an ending that will take over your heart. The only thing that caught this movie was my attention span, since I was trying to get out of the room at the speed of a rocket. Once again, I do not want to seem negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men who sang provoked a feeling of honesty, but I needed more. With documentaries becoming a more important element of the film community, one waits a little more than Heftig og begeistret gave us. I want to see reality and people, not just another song and dance routine! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of *****
