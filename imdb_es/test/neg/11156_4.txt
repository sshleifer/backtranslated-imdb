End of the day, it starts pretty well, Arnie plays a fallen cop and out (a character very similar to Riggs in the lethal weapon) and the story looks like a kind of action thriller that will be good entertainment. <br /> Unfortunately he does not meet, Arnie is as good as we expected, but as for Gabriel Byrne, I hope he chooses his roles more carefully than this. cast as the devil This is probably the weakest representation of the lord of darkness. <br /> <br /> This movie becomes too silly for me, and the final sequence, besides being very weak, is visually one of the worst i 'As I've seen in recent years, CGI has been better than this since the early nineties. <br /> <br /> It just is not good enough. 4/10 (Look at it if you've done it too, but do not expect too much, it will not work)
