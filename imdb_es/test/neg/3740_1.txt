I honestly do not understand why people love this show so much. A friend of mine looks at this and, as I like science fiction, I tried to follow the current because the plot of the program sounded promising, but in truth it is a very boring program. The only thing that will keep you awake during this show is the CGI effects of video games and the excessive use of muppets. Keep in mind that I call him muppets because they actually look like muppets, not the aliens they should be. <br /> <br /> Speaking of that; The muppets and makeup effects are horribly overused in this show. You have this guy who could best be described as a dwarf alien / hybrid, you have a pale girl who looks like a corny vamp, you have a floating potty-alien frog ... It all feels really good. unnecessary and also to the point that you feel distracted from the whole story about a lost astronaut. <br /> <br /> Each episode is also too independent. The creators of this program directed it in such a way that each episode almost resembles another program. At least to the point where you see again the main characters / muppets, that is. The whole plot about the main character that is returning to the ground is too pushed to the bottom in the points. The acting is also pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: if you want good science fiction, look elsewhere. In my opinion, this is not even real science fiction, since the show is more aimed at fantasy elements with all the puppets and strange dreams that occur. And if you just want to see muppets, I suggest you watch the Muppet Show and be happy that this abomination of a show has come to an end. <br /> <br /> By the way; Does anyone have dejavu's with the concept of a living spaceship? Ohyeah that's right; Doctor Who started that concept almost 30 years ago! This show is like a collection of 'science fiction' leftovers. Scripts and events that were abandoned for a good reason, only to be picked up by this horrible show.
