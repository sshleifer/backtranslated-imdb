A flagrant "Air Bud" scam, this movie is REALLY about parents who care too much about parenting. All the weaknesses of the characters (eg, adult trainers who do not know the game) are taken to the extreme, so much so that they are totally incredible, not fun. <br /> <br /> Here there is no appearance of reality, friends and they will not develop sympathy for ANY of the characters. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the attractive kits (uniforms) of the opposing team in the first game the dog plays. Perhaps chosen because the stage is supposedly near Arlington Heights, IL, the home of Columbus Crew franchise player Brian McBride.
