Considering the subject, I thought that this film would be at least pleasant, if it stopped a little less than a masterpiece. I was wrong. I was still waiting for something to happen and it was over. I thought the end was what happened before it got exciting. The only reason I gave him 2 instead of 1 is because the effect guys deserve some recognition.
