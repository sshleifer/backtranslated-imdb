So you're a giant mantis and you've been in the Arctic for a while, and you're tired of the Eskimos hitting you with snowballs. What is a giant mutant insect to do? Go to the big city, of course! See the sights, maybe see a show on Broadway. But wait! Just when you find a nice and cozy tunnel to call yours, some annoying humans start attacking you! Argh! It's time to crush! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a step forward in most of the other giant bug movies, because it has pretty decent effects for 1957. But that's it. Avoid unless you really need to see another great insect crush things, or see another Perry Mason actor in a B movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
