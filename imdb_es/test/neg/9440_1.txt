... I can not believe there are people here who recommend this movie ... This is a slow selling point that is not going anywhere. Oh, yes, it's okay, it goes somewhere, but you see it comes from miles away. Acting: Really very bad, maybe the barman was something good. Edition: BAD! I guess the editor was told "we need at least 90 minutes", because half of all the scenes could have gone to the trash. Music: do not make me start with that, the worst music I've ever heard. Who is that song in the last scene to shout out loud? Directing: oh my, IMNSHO David Lynch stinks, but someone who tries to copy it sucks even more. Skip this.
