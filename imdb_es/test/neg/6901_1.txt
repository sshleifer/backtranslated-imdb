I went to see this on my own first to make sure it was appropriate for my child to see. <br /> <br /> Thank God I did it because I certainly would not allow any child to see it. Why? The violence, the death, the funeral. If you are not ready to explain these concepts to your children, then keep them away. <br /> <br /> Why the hell are these issues treated in a children's movie? Especially one that has a label of "The original party animals.". It could also include an execution of ganglandas in a Hello Kitty caricature. <br /> <br /> As for the laughs, they were very few and far between. Speaking for myself there was none. Cows looked remarkably like cows in The Far Side comics. I suppose there is nothing original in this movie apart from the addition of ridiculous violence and antisocial activities for all young children to enjoy.
