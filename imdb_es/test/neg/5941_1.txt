I really liked that movie! It is the best parody of Russian cinema to date. Who more than Sokurov could deceive Tarkovsky so brilliantly. Did you think "Stalker" was slow? Well, step on the plate. "Mat i Syn" makes "Stalker" look like "Raiders of the Lost Ark". No way should you miss this movie! There is no excuse: even if you live a busy life, you can still enjoy this movie to the fullest by pressing the fast forward button on your VCR. Sokurov has given us the first feature film that can be seen in 12 minutes. <br /> <br /> I suppose that the next great masterpiece of form will come when someone has the vision and courage to exhibit a film consisting of no sound or image at all: 45 minutes of a silent black screen (Was this not explored in "In The Soup"?). <br /> <br /> Apparently, the filmmaker (and the fans) have forgotten that "motion" is the first word of "motion picture". <br /> <br /> ¡¿¿ ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿What is the movie about? Here is a step-by-step guide: <br /> <br /> 1. Find a talented photographer. <br /> <br /> 2. Find some themes and a picturesque landscape (think of Tuscany!). If you need inspiration, look at some advertisements for luxury cars or perfumes. <br /> <br /> 3. Shoot about 3 rolls of film. <br /> <br /> 4. Photoshop the results to play with saturation, blur and aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> 5. Now simply take out your movie camera, shoot 40 of the best images and have your "actors" mutter their lines off the screen. Do not worry about writing it in advance; just let the actors say what they want (lines like "Do you want a drink?" and "Let's eat something" are really all you need to fill about 8 minutes or more). If you can not think of enough dialogue, there's no problem! Just have them repeat what they say a few times. If that's not enough, just let the camera work anyway. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, another masterpiece! As an added benefit, if you want to distribute it over the Internet, there's no problem! Static images will be compressed to zero with the standard MPEG encoding: a 73-minute movie is likely to last approximately 2-3 megabytes, even at the highest quality levels.
