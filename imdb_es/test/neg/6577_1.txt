What about studios like Paramount that have a successful series of proven movies in their hands, and believe that it can ruin the budget and the formula? Paramount spent less on this movie than on TMP, which does not sound bad until you realize that there is a gap of 10 when the movies were made. The cost of $ 40 TMP to make would be equivalent to about $ 75 million in 1989. This movie is the reason why Shatner has never been given a fair chance to direct other films, too. Each time he turned around, the study reduced the budget and demanded the story. The fact that this was the only story in which Roddenberry and Shatner could agree for the most part made the first-year director's job hard enough, but after all the machinations, everyone ended up with a Unequal history and a load of poorly executed. Special effects not worthy of the original series, much less a major movie. The most obvious examples: - All the effects of the Phaser were severely hidden and of false appearance. - The shot of the Enterprise that entered the great barrier was, obviously, a fixed frame shot that was moving away. At least the popsicle rod that held the Enterprise was successfully removed. - God "chasing" Kirk up the mountain ... Egads, you may have also taken photos of Godzilla climbing the volcano at the end of "Godzilla 1985", and used thumbtacks to scrape the emulsion of the film to make the electric beams out of their eyes before Captain Kirk in danger ... Yes, friends, I have a real problem with the appearance of the last scene, especially. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Star Trek VI was such a redeemer of a movie ...
