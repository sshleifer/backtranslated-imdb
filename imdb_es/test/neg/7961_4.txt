If there's one thing I want to distinguish myself from all the other big critics here, it's that I'm the Queen of Find Strange Movies in Thrift and Dollar Stores. That said, you can not imagine how happy I was when I found this one. <br /> <br /> I can even remember that Saturday morning when * all * stations broadcast it simultaneously, so you were stuck if you wanted to see something else (again, I think that was the idea). When I was a kid, I did not know if I liked the way all the different characters were stuck (there are some crosses that just * do * not * work). But I suppose the special had its intended effect. Do not use drugs because you will have nightmares about the Muppets. <br /> <br /> Now, if you see this as an adult, on the other hand, you'll be treated to the most bizarre anti-drug movie * This side of "Reefer Madness." I think I'll leave it like that before I get into trouble.
