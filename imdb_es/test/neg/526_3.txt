I finally got a DVD copy of this production and was stunned by curiosity, as I had read a lot of people praising the heavens, particularly the Angela Lansbury performance of Mrs. Lovett. A few months ago I saw the Tim Burton movie and thought it was exaggerated and too bloody; Fortunately, this version is not so scary, but it suffers dramatically in many other ways to make it as satisfying as possible. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the casting. George Hearn is suitable and, at least, shows a certain expression (unlike the endless wooden face of Johnny Depp in the film). Angela Lansbury is simply annoying. At least she has enough power in her voice to convey the message instead of Helena Bonham Carter's small, expressionless voice, but the subtlety seems to be just one word in the dictionary for Mrs. Lansbury. One can not get involved in the story when one of the main characters spends all his time storming and winking at a "look, mom, I'm acting!" Fashion and being too aware of the audience. This is not typical of theatrical productions, God knows: I have regularly attended many productions at the Stratford Festial for many years and theatrical actors do NOT behave in that way as a rule (at least those who want to continue to find regular employment, not !) ... <br /> <br /> Betsy Joslyn. Oh heavens, oh heavens, oh heavens. Did anyone besides me realize that she can not sing this role even in an appropriate way? And his interpretation of George Hearn's daughter is creepy, considering that she was married to him at that time. Is not she supposed to be a sweet sixteen-year-old girl? Yes, I realize that it is about acting, but not once did he convince me that he was less than thirty-five years old, and the phrase "lamb dressed as a lamb" seems to have been coined only for her. His "Green Finch And Linnet Bird" butchery made me grind my teeth and I was ready to turn off the DVD player immediately. That song was made so well in the Tim Burton movie, and this was a sad blow. The song requires the vocal range of Julie Andrews in the 1960s and a purity of voice that is only comparable to that of a soprano child. Any vibrato kills him, and Mrs. Joslyn spent all the time mixing so hard that I thought she was about to fall off her ladder because she was shaking from the effort of holding the coloratura notes with a voice that is a mezzo at best of the cases. Let us skip the show of your vibration of at least a quarter of a tone on at least three of the highest notes ... This is simply not a coloratura role and perhaps a demanding director should have told you that, but the fact of that she was married to the star could possibly have tied the director's hands. <br /> <br /> Cris Groenendaal was adequate, but obviously she is too old for the role and there is no chemistry between him and Joslyn, which makes the whole secondary plot fall completely flat. They remind me a bit of the past theatrical productions of the Wagner's Ring cycle where, because of the vocal power needed for the singers to shout about the sound of a complete Wagnerian orchestra, they would have to emit based on their ability to vocally penetrate instead of any appearance or ability to act or even a good voice, so it has the caricature of the huge Brunehilde with mountainous Viking horns with a triple chin and a beard, when the script asks for an ethereal beauty that is eternally young and bewitching. The launching of the "juvenile" cables is exactly like this: if you close your eyes, you can almost believe in Mr. Groenendaal's Anthony, but as soon as you look at the screen, the illusion is shattered. (And at no time can you believe in Johanna from Mrs. Joslyn ...) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost because three of the four main characters were so obviously wrong. I can not give an adequate review of anything else because they distracted so much that they ruined the rest of the production. I really can not understand why people get excited about this poorly made and timid filming of a play. Surely there is more camera work in the cinema than simply throwing a camera in the front row? If I want that, I go to a decent play, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where they at least work together for production and are not constantly assaulting the camera. I only give it three stars because the quality of the production, apart from the antics of Lansbury and Joslyn, seems adequate, if not spectacular. <br /> <br /> Probably, the best thing that one can do is to buy the soundtrack of the film and a reproduce the recording of this work, and then combine the two to make a whole bearable. That's what I'm going to do, and try to forget that I ever bothered to rent this completely bland production.
