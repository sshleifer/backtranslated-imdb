That growl ... <br /> <br /> That frown ... <br /> <br /> Acts of random violence ... <br /> <br /> The guttural voice ... < br /> <br /> Fetish wear ... <br /> <br /> That shaved head ... <br /> <br /> It can mean only one thing ... <br /> <br / > GRACE JONES IS AGAIN! <br /> <br /> Actually, my sources tell me that the main role in Blade was not played by the diva of the 80s, but by Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Blade is an adaptation of a comic character; Somehow, in the transfer from the simplistic and two-dimensional world of the printed page, it has become even more simplistic and lost a couple of dimensions. <br /> <br /> The plot is trite almost without believing and does not add anything to the vampire. The genre, in fact, like Nosferatu, seems to take the life of the audience. In short, the rising vampire in motion wants to be more powerful, but opposes Blade, half human, half vampire, all annoying. Everything comes to a climax with Blade in a vampire juice press, some bad martial arts and the most pitiful CGI since 1968. <br /> <br /> Blade has to be the least empathetic character since Dolph Lundgren's Punisher (also a comic adaptation, maybe there is a tendency here?). Surely the audience is destined to be on the same side as the 'hero'? And although a vampire may be a tragic character, this is not true for Blade, he is relentlessly cruel, disdainful and not much better than bad guys. <br /> <br /> I suppose that Wesley Snipes has a 'Act in the race purely so that everyone else can be compared favorably. As you make your way through your movie, you find yourself looking for a stake, even a pen, anything to put Blade in the grave. <br /> <br /> As a piece of narcissism, Blade is quite unbeatable, we give away the endless shots of a newly made Snipes in the gym for no reason. In the same way, no other actor is given the opportunity to give a reasonable return; the likes of Steven Dorff * CAN * act, but they have to be the second role of the tedious performance of Snipes. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson used to appear in good movies, here he is reduced to a partner who only knows he will not reach the final. And what happens when Blade finds out? Yes, you guessed it, he rushes to the scene to take revenge on the villainous underground den. <br /> <br /> Why can not domination of the world take place in a quiet country house? They always advance in underground cathedrals where Albert Speer would have wondered if they would be a little grandiose. Many of these plans could be stopped right now if local councils pay more attention to plans to expand sub-basements. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is just as boring and unimaginative, with nothing new to add to the genre. The vampires have finished sinking and maybe they should rest for a while, at least until someone can find some way to make them interesting again. <br /> <br /> To finish, there is * is * a Grace Movie of vampires of Jones, it is called Vamp and it is ten times better than this.
