I bought this movie in Blockbuster for $ 3.00, because it sounded interesting (a little Ranma-esque, with the idea of ​​someone dragging a skeleton), because there was a cute girl with a miniskirt on her back and because there was a restricted display label on she. I thought it was going to be a sweet story or at least a sincere one with a strange indie edge. I was 100% wrong. <br /> <br /> Having seen it, I have to ask myself how it got the restricted sticker, since there is almost no rude language, little violence and the closest thing to nudity (Honestly, normally do not go around waiting!) when the girl is in a nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties in this movie, because no matter what, she wears a miniskirt of some kind). Even antireligious humor is meek (and lame, caricatured, insincere, derivative, unoriginal, and, worst of all, not funny in the least, it would be better to just listen to Ray Stevens' theme: "Would Jesus use a Rolex in Your Television Program "). This would just qualify as PG-13 (not qualified), but Blockbuster refuses to allow anyone under 17 to rent this, as if it were pornographic. Any small child could go there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream, but insist that Zack and Reba are worse. <br /> <br /> It is, but not in that way. <br /> <In a way, this worries me: the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of ​​suicide at the beginning. If someone needs to watch movies with suicides portrayed honestly (not in this case, but in better ones like The Virgin Suicides), they are teenagers. If both of these films were rated R simply because of the suicidal aspect, then I have little chance of converting a story I've been writing into a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the three leading causes of death among adolescents (I believe it is number 2), so it is likely that most adolescents have been or are affected by it. <br /> <br /> Just say no to this movie, though. 2/10.
