At first glance, this movie seems like it could be really good, it's not. <br /> <br /> The cast is pretty good, but most of them seemed embarrassed by the whole thing. The real disaster in this film is not the deluge, but the script. Try to include every clich√© in the book, all incredibly badly done. The ending is very abrupt, but this is a blessing in disguise. Congratulations if you get that far. <br /> <br /> The three main male actors (Carlyle, Courtney and Suchet) would surely agree that this is the lowest point in their careers. I hope they have paid a lot of money in cash, because none of their reputations is intact. <br /> <br /> The special effects are pretty good, but the same thing was done much better in The Day After Tomorrow. . <br /> <br /> In short, a meaningless exercise. Do not waste your time.
