I saw it mainly to see Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel, two of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The plot has many twists and turns, it's not as bad as a direct mystery aboard a train. <Br /> <br /> But why throw in a circus train and an escaped gorilla? I can mention this without being a "spoiler" because the shock of the circus train and the gorilla have nothing to do with the intricate web of mystery. <br /> <br /> The bad person who tries to kill good people has many tricks His sleeve, but the shock of the circus train was pure coincidence. Allow a single scene with a menacing gorilla, but then return to the murder mystery!
