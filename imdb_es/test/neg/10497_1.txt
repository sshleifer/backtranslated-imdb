Incredibly, "Vampire Assassin" is significantly worse than the atrocities like "Tequila Body Shots" and "Zombie Nation", and those movies are TERRIBLE. The writer / director / star Ron Hall lacks charisma and acting ability, and is also clearly incapable of the most basic management concepts. Possibly the worst camera work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and wrestling choreography I've seen in a movie. Rarely do two shots together, nor can you see much in the lighting beyond the dim. The terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a cast without talent, extending the film to 87 minutes almost deadly. This is a really ridiculous shame for everyone involved. Obviously, the fans of the terrible film production will want to see this, but it is very difficult to sit down no matter how experienced the viewer of the bad movie is. The fact that Ron Hall thought that this was actually liberable is amazing. If you are a film director, and you really think it is okay for the opening credits of your film to include some frames of the words SLUG before the title appears, remnants of its preliminary edition, and apparently can not gather the energy to edit those frames, then their standards are obviously so low as to be insulting. I'm surprised that Lions Gate / Maple has agreed to release this movie on DVD. Despite the short cameo of Rudy Ray Moore, this film is a work of supreme self-satisfaction on the part of Ron Hall. Clearly, he thinks he is a formidable actor, and he must also believe that he possesses superior writing and directing skills, but the film is so incredibly inept that it is hard to believe that he really wanted people to see him for fear of being brutally scandalous. I'm doing it now. An amazing movie, incredibly terrible. I'm not kidding.
