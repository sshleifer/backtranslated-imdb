1st Seen 3/17/2002 - 2 of 10 (Dir-Mario Pinzauti): Silly, teacher and slave full of sex that has too many intimate relationships movies. This movie seemed to care more about sex than history and the story about sex worked. Dubbing in laughter of the original Italian language in the version I saw with a ridiculous ending in which you try to give an anti-slave statement (or should I say a line). What a waste of time for everyone who watches over this garbage.
