It is terrible garbage. I liked 'How Do You Want Me', 'Father Ted', 'Green Wing' and Bill Bailey's stand-up act, but I present this with 'Hippies' and 'Planets Of The Apes' (reimagining) under 'Great Pedigree' ', it went wrong. "My guess is that it attracts the same people who like' Withnail and I. 'It is overwritten, but until the end, a luvvie air impregnates it and Bernard Black is simply a less-campednail withnail. I was self-indulgent even before Dylan Moran became the writer, however, the setting limits such comedic potential that during the first 2 episodes I did not realize it was not the least possible. <br /> <br /> The things they are saying / doing * should * Be fun, but somehow they fail to register as something more than something fun or "I can see how someone who writes this could have thought this would be fun." What I am trying to say is that the situations / comments are slightly c omics and, however, too mundane / friendly / consciously surreal to be worth creating and describing in a sitcom. <br /> <br /> Life is too short. Avoid.
