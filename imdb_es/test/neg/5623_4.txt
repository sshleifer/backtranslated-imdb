Roger Avary (co-writer of "Pulp Fiction"), partner of Quentin Tarantino, ventures on his own (the QT will be the executive producer this time) for this overloaded French thriller. is Zed, an extraordinary and safe cracker who has moved to France from the USA. UU at the request of an old friend. There he joins a heterogeneous group of drugged hippies who, with little or no planning, believe they can tear down a vault of a bank full of gold ingots on a French national holiday. <br /> <br /> Avary has reworked the Theft went wrong of the topic that Tarantino developed so well in "Reservoir Dogs", only that "Killing Zoe" is not good enough to survive only with the strength of this, for what Avary has thrown a pretty beautiful distraction. Julie Delpy is Zoe, an entertaining student who entertains Zed on his arrival in Paris. A surprising distraction that it certainly is, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> I suppose our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme, but unfortunately the movement did not help to add the depth of his superficial plot so desperately needed. There was never a story in this idea, which was not more than that, an idea. Even the surreal journey in the sordid dives of Paris is uninspiring. I imagine that one would have to admit that there was never a great movie in the history of a gang of gangs that shoot each other for a booty of failed jewels, that is, until you add intricate characters and quick dialogues. "Reservoir Dogs" had it, "Killing Zoe" no. <br /> <br /> Stoltz's strong interpretation of Zed and Jean Hughes-Anglade's dubious interpretation of the obsessive ring leader does nothing to lift the case. In short, Avary has tried unsuccessfully to conjure up entertainment from nothing. <br /> <br /> Friday, September 15, 1995 - Teatro Astor
