Sorry, this was an unfortunate excuse for a movie ... a plot so holeya that it resembled a block of Swiss cheese and a tangle of characters that seemed totally devoid of interpersonal relationships. Lee-Miller, who could have sworn, was destined to be in love ... Unlike the union of Tyler and Miller that were for the most part, like the rest of the movie, absolutely unconvincing ... although the final product It was not captivating and fun for all the wrong reasons, the production values ​​were high and deserve recognition ... but unfortunately the end result was a rubbish ... what were all the people involved thinking about? They definitely should have packed early in this ...
