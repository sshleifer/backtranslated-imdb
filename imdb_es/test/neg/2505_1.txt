First of all, I refuse to even consider this work as a music video ... I consider it a short film that uses excerpts from the song "Thriller" in its soundtrack. For me, a music video should not be longer than the song itself, and the song should play the full length of the video. Calling this a music video is like calling The Great Gatsby a poem. Besides this ... let's be honest ... "thriller" is a boring 14 minutes, including the transformation of the extremely old-fashioned werewolf, the poem by Vincent Price (just because VP recites it does not mean it's not boring), and Los Less threatening zombies than I've ever seen. Of course, this was certainly a cultural phenomenon, but do not forget, this also happened at the same time that Team A was the number 1 show on television, so do not give too much credit to the culture in that ... One the last point about the impact of this film on the media in the music videos ... what exactly was added to the equation that "Billie Jean" and "Beat It" no longer added? As far as I can tell, only the practice of stopping the song for some dialogue, or a superfluous dance scene was added ... so it could be said that this whole video really was to give Puffy the inspiration to make more music videos annoying It is not my definition of great
