Margaret Mitchell turns on her grave every time someone sees this disaster! The good costumes and sets can not even begin to overwhelm the mediocre performances of Joanne Whalley (as the character in the title) and the always bland Timothy Dalton (as Rhett). Even worse than the performance, and perhaps partly explained, is the script, which is surprisingly clich√©d and predictable. Add to that infernally bad script a score that will shake you, and you will have a disaster you would not want for any viewer. SCARLETT is incredibly bad, and I can not imagine how it was done, let alone in video.
