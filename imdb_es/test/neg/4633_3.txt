I rate 'The decline of the American Empire' almost below average, as it was not terrible, but it was not great either. I liked the very open conversations of people so incredibly selfish and ugly inside and out. That was probably the most original aspect ?? A small sexual film based on dialogue with people who are extremely far from the models. Apart from that, it seems ironic that these French-speaking Canadians have a film about a neighboring society that, well, is on "Rejection" when their own actions are their own demise. A group of male friends spend half of the movie laughing at their infidelities and acceptance of such behavior and the other half "intellectually" talking about how powerful they are for their speech and their actions. These are the normal objectives in typical comedies that are mocked by the main characters at parties that are mainly occupied by university professors. Unfortunately, it's not your "intelligence" or "history" domain that bothers me. It is your pedestal made of ego and a more powerful attitude than you that moves me away and I can not relate to any character, nor do I like it. When one cries, I do not care less? It's your bed When you complain, I hardly shudder. What made me skirmish was a character, uh, pissing in red. (Another example of playing with fire.) Of course, I understand what happens to some people, but it was difficult to see. And I sincerely expected him to wash his hands, since he had no problem cooking again for everyone. At the complete opposite end of the nose educators above, they introduce a stereotyped nomad. This made me tremble as no one seemed real; All were as superficial as their laughs in society. Unfortunately, with no one to unravel, you're as empty as the souls of these characters.
