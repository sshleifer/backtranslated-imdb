Positively ridiculous movie <br /> <br /> If Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight persist in these types of films, they can send their retirement documents and collect full-time social security. <br /> <br /> While the idea of ​​a 35-year-old video game swinger losing his apartment and being forced to move in with Grandma Roberts and borders with Jones and Knight, this is foolishly treated . Imagine that the 3 bags are full of things that the grandson Alex has left at home and Jones goes to bed with someone who can qualify as his grandson! movie. The variety of characters Alex works with is amazing, as he enjoys his weed habit along with others. <br /> <br /> Terrible best describes this miserable movie.
