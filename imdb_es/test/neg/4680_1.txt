Recently I have become a big fan of Patton Oswalt. I think he's the most delightfully original comedian of all time. It's refreshing and audacious in its routines, spanning the gamut of themes, from how much Bush reeks of the outrageous exploits of producer Robert Evans of the 1970s. I'm a fan of Maria Bamford and her innocent schizophrenic routine and with the eyes wide open Every time she effortlessly changes her naturally sharp voice to one that is clipped and guttural, I can not help but laugh. I liked Brian Posehn long before he knew he was in "Just Shoot Me," and there's something innately funny about his aging nerdy personality. These three talented and unique comedians head "The Comedians of Comedy," a Netflix documentary about their tour of the United States. They really deserve to be stars, and this tour gave them the recognition they deserve. I thought, no, I KNEW I'd like this movie ... <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. Instead of the three comics each having their own routine segments, "The Comedians of Comedy" is jammed by boring and boring documentary scenes that contain no humor, no intuition, no real interest. I think there is a total of 30 minutes of intermittent stand-up routines in the 109-minute movie. What a scam! Come on, is there anyone really interested in seeing our stars joking in their RV? Where is the humor to see Posehn in a game room and a comic book store? Does anyone find scenes of random diners particularly fun? If this movie could not show our comics about your stuff, at least do it about what life is like on the road. It's not even about that. Worst of all, comics never seem to really enjoy themselves. Oswalt admits how boring an interview on the radio is, Posehn confesses timidly how much he stinks when he goes through his house, and Bamford improvises nervously every time the camera points at him, and his mood is only sporadic. /> <br /> Sheesh, these guys deserve the opportunity to show the world their unconventional, incredibly crafted humor, which is a refreshing change from the brainless entertainment of traditional comics like Dane Cook. Instead, we have to sit through their daily, everyday routines on the road in a hole below the norm of a movie whose quality could easily be surpassed by any student movie. If you can locate any of the performances of Oswalt, Posehn or Bamford on DVD, do it without fail. Your talent should be a joy to behold, not a task like the one here.
