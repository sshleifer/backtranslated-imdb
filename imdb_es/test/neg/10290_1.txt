I'm not sure who recommended Surveillance, but I think I have an idea: one of the "Caps in the movies". The person said she was amazed at how cool it was and said it was one of the saddest and most disturbing movies. (I paraphrase and do this only by heart, so forgive me if I quote it wrong). Anyway, I made the decision to see it. So I blame myself for my own miscalculation by watching one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen. Strange, I doubt that I ever called a movie "stupid", but that was the first word that came to my mind about a third and remained in my mind until the end. <br /> <br /> Where to start? A premise and incredible reactions, incredibly cerebral characters (could blame the writing or the actors, or just blame both) and act enormously wrong. I'd rather believe Bill Pullman as President of the United States than an FBI agent here. (Of course, there is a reason for that, and I will go into that). And to make matters worse, if you can not understand the so-called "turn" surprising in the first 5 minutes, you must have arrived late to the theater or entered the room to see it late. Do not worry, they will tell you the "turn" every five minutes thereafter. <br /> <br /> There have been some loose serial killers in the most depressing city in the county or the world. But there is more in history! Some imbeciles and corrupt policemen like to turn off the tires for their own fun. Could there be more? Oh yes, there is a family, well, maybe not, but there are four humans, a boy, a girl and an adult couple. The girl says she sees things with much less conviction than Cole sees the dead in The Sixth Sense. This has to be more than what I mentioned! That's what makes a movie interesting! The way forward is to add as many subplots that may or may not develop! It's fine, then I'll continue. We have ridiculous FBI agents that made me laugh. A couple of drug addicts who laugh, initially surprise their OD distributors but then resort to theft. An excellent cop who must have been put in search of comic relief and who is always fighting an angry / suspicious cop. And finally, (poor, poor) Michael Ironside, who not only telephoned his performance, he just sent it by mail. <br /> <br /> None of these works. All are counted in various forms of presence or flashbacks, and believe me, you will lose all sense of concern after the first of many subplots begins. In addition, the reaction of some of these characters is the most shocking of all. I guess I'm referring mainly to the police, but mainly to the girl who did or did not lose her family and barely blinks. <br /> <br /> This stupid, stupid movie stinks. It's just bloody as the person who recommended it said it, unless your exposure has been limited to the Goosebumps stories. And what about the title? Surveillance? Oh I understand; it's because it was used in 1/50 subplots just to shoot interviews. Since it is so random, it could be called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Just stay away from this horrible disaster.
