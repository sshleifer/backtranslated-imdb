First of all. I do not despise Americans. I know many people who are smart people in the United States. But this movie is so bad that I had to comment on it. <br /> <br /> First of all ... The films are far from the truth. This movie is not an exception. Many scenes are incredibly false. For example the exit of the 2 spacecraft. You see them drop the full tanks in space. Only a small distance between them. Do you remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past? Only a part of winsky that came out. Here, it is common to drop fuel tanks that are as large, if not more, than the entire ship. What idiot would let 2 spaceships get up and at the same time do that? The second is that the Russian station is a piece of trash. I hate to ask you this, but astronauts today go to Russia. Since his team is much more reliable than NASA. The space shuttle is retired. And NASA uses it just to pay the bills. And there is no better alternative for it. And the whoppers list goes on and on. This is truly an insult to people who take space travel seriously. And I know half of these guys. But the most annoying part (read: the whole movie) is the propaganda and the shit of patriots with which you drown. OMG !!!! I thought I was watching a CNN commercial for an hour. The actors solve their small problems by shooting at each other, giving the middle finger to everyone who is face to face, start fights, ignore the police, etc., etc. But when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives, all of a sudden they all line up to commit suicide (bomb detonator)? Maybe I need the feeling of being a true "Patriot", who can sing the national anthem upside down in Swahili. While driving with George Bush behind the wheel of a golf cart, drive in circles until the battery is empty. But this movie was too much for me to also handle. And when I finally grabbed and pulled the flagpole and the fabric of the American flag of my hiney. I realized that I was glad that this movie was finally over. I do not know why so many good actors participated in this propaganda film, stereotypes and narrow mentalities. But I pity them. This represents a country where you can escape with murder if you have money or power. As long as "Uncle Sam" thinks you're a good patriot. Where everyone is happy, while another country that has been devastated, nobody cares.
