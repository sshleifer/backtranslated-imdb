This is such a horrible movie that I have no idea how it got to the shelves, they must have paid the movie store to put it there, really! The story does not make any sense unless you're taking some seriously heavy drug, you definitely should be taking something to be able to see this whole piece of junk, so much that you would not mind what was on TV because it's almost in a coma. It was made by a 5 year old child and the acting is worse than in the works of the primary school. The horrible special effects they were trying to make seemed so stupid, how much did they spend $ 5 to make the whole movie, do you think so? Oh, that scene with the old lady who has a hairstyle from the 80s and the ugly girls with the rubber suits, my friends and I laughed so hard. Did anyone really think it was a good idea to turn this into a movie? I find it hard to believe!
