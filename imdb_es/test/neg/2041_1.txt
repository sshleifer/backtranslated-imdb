WOOHOO! What a horrible and horrible waste of time it turned out to be this atrocity of celluloid. I remember seeing it years ago and thinking it was fun, but now ... it's silly. Not to mention the fact that it is a flagrant theft of "The Exorcist" to the point where it was reissued at one point under the title "The Sex-orcist". The only real difference is that the producers have the gall to further discredit themselves by slapping the claim that the events in the film are REAL! Who in their right mind would really believe such a bold lie? To make matters worse, there was a cover video release with cover that tried shamelessly to take advantage of the "Rocky horror image presentation" by throwing a couple of lips on the cover. How low could one sink? Do not be fooled by false claims, blatant lies or the title scam because you will be very disappointed if you do!
