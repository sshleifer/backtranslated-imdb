This was not a good movie. Written and acted deficiently: the concept was not new, the effects were deficient and it was not a showcase for Arnold Vosloo, who is actually a half decent actor. I observed this under a certain protest and I only remembered seeing it before towards the end, it is so forgettable. The performance seemed to consist of a series of looks and looks devoid of sincerity. I kept hoping that this really got going and in a short time I just hoped it would end. As for the medical bits, well, I did not expect a real version of the ER events, but this was just funny, I'm a Dr., so I know what I'm talking about, and the operational bits were just dumb. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your valuable time, unless you have nothing else to do, get out, call a long lost friend, look at the dry paint, order your sock, do some housework. AVOID at your own risk.
