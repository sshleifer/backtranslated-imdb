Think "Bewitched" with testosterone instead of estrogen and you will get the general idea of ​​this image. A very unconvincing story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax ending to allow the door to open for a part 2. Let's hope someone has the sense to spend their money more wisely. I would suggest a 'Charmed - the movie' because compared to this 'Charmed' he gave a kick in the ass and I only saw that show to please my girlfriend !!!! Wait and veil on DVD on a rainy Sunday when you have nothing better to do. Or better yet, download it so you do not waste your money. The first 15 minutes were good. But the funniest line of the film and also the only highlight of this film is when Reid says: "Kiss my ass to Harry Potter", while driving down a precipice. Although they are not worth kissing Potter's ass, because Potter is much cooler and at least his movies have a story. The cup of fire was even more terrifying than this!
