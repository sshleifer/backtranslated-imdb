As a Bruce Campbell fan for almost two decades, I was delighted to have the opportunity to see his latest film on the big screen with the same man he attended. Unfortunately, "Man with the Screaming Brain" was in itself a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Located in Bulgaria, where the science fiction channel makes its original films on Saturday nights, "Man with the Screaming Brain" is a curious mixture of horror from the B movie of the 50s, Comedy to change body, violent movie of revenge and exaggerated slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If that does not make sense, well, neither does "Man with the Screaming Brain." Campbell is the executive director of a pharmaceutical company that visits Bulgaria with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the half-finished metro system of the former communist country. The two are related to a former KGB agent who became a taxi driver, and the three finally meet with his death at the hands of a vengeful gypsy. <br /> <br /> A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and his foolish assistant (Ted Raimi), who has developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection, steals the bodies and places a part of the brain in the brain. driver of the cabin in the damaged skull of Campbell. In addition, they put their wife's brain into a robotic body that they simply have on hand. Campbell escapes, and with a hastily patched skull and the voice of the taxi driver, whose brain tissue is transplanted. he controls the left side of his body - echoing in his head, he sets off to find and kill the gypsy. (His robot wife does the same thing.) <br /> <br /> But first, there's an attempt to emulate Steve Martin / Lily Tomlin's "All of Me" when the two Campbell personalities fight for mastery of a dinner at a restaurant. Just as he was playing his own evil hand on "Evil Dead II," Campbell is an expert at making his body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, "Screaming" is closer to another Steve Martin movie, "The Man with Two Brains", as it also has a foolish approach to the science fiction cliches of the 50s. However, he tries too hard to get a very small result, and that doubles for the semi-understandable Bulgarian muffin by Ted Raimi, who has too much time on the screen. (Nothing against Raimi, it's just that it's better in smaller doses). <br /> <br /> In the end, it's not outrageous enough (or fun) to satisfy like a parody, nor is it serious enough to enjoy it as a pastiche B-movie. I was glad that Campbell had already left the screening when he stopped, as he was afraid he had to say, "Wow, Bruce, that was really ... something". <br /> <br /> Maybe the best compliment I can give you as a film is that at least the images stick to the emulsion. And it was twice as good as "Alien Apocalypse".
