This film is slightly entertaining if one does not recognize its numerous incongruities of the plot and its absolute lack of credibility. Bruce Willis as "The Jackal" never seems to live up to his reputation as a cunning brain of the underworld. Instead, he rummages in broad daylight, parading with a mix of shoddy disguises. Why this man has never been captured before (or even identified) is beyond me. Not once is the public impressed by his cunning or audacity; Considering the price it demands for its services (an exorbitant $ 70 million), its methods are decidedly low budget and stupid. <br /> <br /> As for those who persecute him, they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior. . They do not show any sense of experience, but rely on a half-hearted conjecture that makes them cross the country at will. Incredibly, these crazy assumptions (maybe he bought a boat, maybe he's in Chicago, etc.) invariably take them directly to the Jackal, who once again escapes his clumsy dominion. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere, whose Irish accent fades in and out like a distant radio station, plays the unexplained role of an incarcerated convict who is released from prison to work with the FBI. He really makes a compatible partner, if only because his means are as amateur and inept as his professional friends. At one point, he actually confronts the infamous Jackal, but unfortunately the FBI, although they trust him enough to leave him out of sight, do not equip him with a weapon or any means of communication. What kind of operations are running here? <br /> <br /> The film also seems to be too dependent on frightful violence, which is totally superfluous and does not provide any suspense. The supposedly stealthy jackal acts more like a senseless and senseless serial killer, eliminating people for sport and writing on the cheek of a bloody victim. <br /> <br /> The action scenes in the film are predictable and unrealistic, and many moments are ruined by the melodrama. This film is poorly executed on many levels, the only bright spot is the always consistent Sidney Poitier. Avoid this movie if you feel like thinking while you watch it. <br /> <br />
