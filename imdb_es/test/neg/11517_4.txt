When I saw this movie three years ago, I thought it exemplified many of the features found in the films of the Singaporean art house: slow movement, with a minimum of plot and dialogue, depending on the composition of the film to make it work. <Br /> <br /> During that time, among local filmmakers, the inability to appreciate "Be With Me" amounts to criticizing "Citizen Kane" or any of Ozu's latest films. I have no idea how "Be With Me" reached such high levels in the cinematographic consciousness of Singapore, but I always felt that "12 Storeys" by Khoo is a better movie, although this last film does not have a cinematographer as good as Adrian Tan., DP of Khoo for "Being with Me". "12 stories" has a story that relates better to most Singaporeans and also has something that does not have the jitters of "Be With Me". <br /> <br /> "Be With Me" is basically a trio of barely interrelated stories collected in a Khoo film and its screenwriter Wong Kim Hoh. He is a security guard who falls in love with a girl he only sees in the distance; Two girls in a horo-erotic relationship; and the story of Teresa Chan deaf and blind. <br /> <br /> "Be With Me" is very well filmed by Tan, using a Varicam camera. The compositions of the film are masterful. The film, almost silent, almost has no dialogue. The characters move, not in a realistic way, but almost as if they were models under the direction of a director, almost always looking at the screen and feeling emotions: loneliness or sadness. Unfortunately the characters do not act against each other. This type of film has been seen many times before: in the films of Tsai Ming-liang, in the protégé of Khoo, Royston Tan, "4:30" and in other places. Unfortunately, its ultra-slowness (essentially the least plot) and the use of a slow piano soundtrack just do not appeal to me. <br /> <br /> Criticizing "Be With Me" seems almost to deny the inspiring story behind this. , that of Teresa Chan, who is blind and deaf and, nevertheless, lives a full life in spite of all this, but I am afraid that this film does not help me much. I am willing to applaud the constant and courageous march of Chan in life and the surprising cinematography of Tan, but for a better take on the same subject with more flesh (without the other two plot and subtracteric plots), try the "Land of Silence" and darkness "(1971).
