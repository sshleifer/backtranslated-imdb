I rented this movie with the impression that it was "Scarecrow 3: Dark Harvest", thinking it was a continuation of the Scarecrow Slayer series (another series of extremely laughable and all horrible movies). Although I was not disappointed. It was so horrible, if not worse, than I expected. I laughed throughout the whole movie. Every piece of bad acting, bad shots and cuts, and terrible special effects is what makes it worthwhile to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> Special features include a pathetic vision of the six months of casting the cast and crew. <br /> <br /> Favorite line, "The sins of my ancestors! You have arrived at this precise moment!"
