Victor Jory never became a big star. He is better known for his roles as later characters than for his first characters. But he was very handsome and an excellent actor. <br /> <br /> His love scenes with Loretta Young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate. His kisses look very real. And very modern. <br /> <br /> Vivienne Osborne is also highlighted here. She plays a woman with a reputation. But the character has a good heart. <br /> <br /> The impression I saw was unclear. But what a joy that weird films like this one are showing up! And they are, in some kind of observable condition, still intact. This is nothing really special. But if one is willing to filter the films of his time with equally interesting titles, he is likely to find some extraordinary films.
