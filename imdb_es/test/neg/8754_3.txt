Hollywood had a long love story with fake Arabian Nights stories, but few of these products have stood the test of time. The most memorable were Jon Hall's films, Maria Montez, which has long since become a camp. This one is full of dubbed songs, anachronistic slang and slapstick. It is a truly abundant crop of Mesopotamian corn, and almost intolerable today. He was nominated for his imaginative special effects that are almost imperceptible today, and consist mainly of trick photography. The only outstanding and positive feature that survives is its beautiful color and clarity. Unfortunately, of the many films made in this genre, few of them approach the original "Baghdad of Bagdad" by Alexander Korda. However, almost any other Arabian Nights movie is superior to this one. He is a loser
