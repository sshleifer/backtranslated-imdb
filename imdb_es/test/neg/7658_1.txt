Actually, this monstrosity was not funny at all! This movie was a complete abomination. The absurdities in this movie almost make me want to throw up! I think the people responsible for this movie took advantage of their audience. They took a series of relatively decent films (I said it was decent, IT IS NOT GOOD!) And they totally destroyed it trying to put money in their pockets. The manufacture of the plane! Hollywood was a way to make up for this bad movie. Worst of all is that, in 1979, no one noticed the stupid events of the movie (like Concorde's door jumping to an ungodly high altitude or Patroni firing a gun through the window at Mach 2 to avoid a NUCLEAR WARHEAD!?!?!? .... What were you thinking ???) were totally unreal or just did not care! I think it's the last of the two. The writers and directors of this "movie", if you want to call it that, really tried to suck the airport dynasty with this shit!
