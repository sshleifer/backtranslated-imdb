This movie has a rating of 7.0 in IMDb, so I even felt something rotten in its synopsis, I decided to try it. What a waste of 100 minutes. First, the 1980s were not a good decade for crime and suspense. Most of these, in those days were poorly made with an absurd plot (if they had any), so there are very few who can excel, and even if they were good, they are still not very good. The blow, however, suffers from everything that made silly images of foolish crimes. It has a poor character development, an unlikely plot and it was not written or directed in a decent way, and when you have such flaws, acting does not help. Stephen Frears often tried to emulate a new French wave in the creation of English-style films and the two do not coincide. <br /> <br /> First of all, Terence Stamp has been hiding for 10 years because he testified against some of his former colleagues in crime. It hides in Spain, of all places. Finally he meets him, and then he is kidnapped by a group of dumb-looking Spanish thugs, only to get away from the two hit men who are supposed to deal with him. These two are John Hurt, who is supposed to be boiled, the stone killer and Tim Roth (in his first role) as an apprentice to the devil. They do not kill Stamp immediately, first they get rid of the "three Amigos", they should not have hired him in the first place, and then, they're driving Stamp to Paris, because one of the friends he testified does not want to. confront him Ok that's possible But even though Stamp was such a dangerous figure that they had to hire four men to dominate him, they do not tie him up, they do not incapacitate him in any way and they drive with him, as if he were one of the friends. Stamp does not object and is happily going to Paris to be filmed, without using any half a dozen opportunities, these "professionals" offer him the opportunity to escape. It seems that Tim Roth is just a school bully, which makes the idea that the crime boss becomes a strong man like John Hurt even more unlikely, especially in an important job like that. But, as John Hurt is not so hard in himself, he spends twenty minutes of the film, killing or not killing the totally surplus Australian, played by Bill Hunter, whose only purpose in this film is to present the charming Laura Del Sol, his lover. (who says she is 15 years old, but she looks more like 25), and whose role in the story and acting skills suggests that she was offered the role, just for being the director or the producer's lover at that time. After much deliberation, Hurt kills the Australian but carries his lover for no apparent reason. Of what he wants to kill her, but Roth with his "subtle ways" convinces him not to do it, so even she kicks him, bites him and scratches him through the whole movie, he stays true to that human side deeply buried of him. <Br /> <br /> What do you have totally idiotic scenes, like when Hurt and Roth block the car from the outside, trying to keep the people inside out? Anyway, the movie is prolonged. Tim Roth falls asleep, protecting Terence Stamp with his gun to his chest, and Stamp simply waits there watching the waterfall. Then, all the chaos of a plot reaches the point where everything we've seen in the last hour and 20 minutes has just come out the window. Let's recap, the fact of not killing Stamp immediately (except for having a movie) is to take him to Paris, so his former partner will have one last word with him. And the fact that he does not escape is that he is ready to die saying, "It's just a moment, we're here, then we're not here, we're somewhere else ... maybe, and it's so natural." as breathing. Why should we be scared? "But, my friends, this is where the plot twists, Hurt kills the man when he is still in Spain, and we asked why bother and drive for days, could have done it in the first 15 minutes, and against his philosophy, the seal is very scared of being killed, so we ask again why he did not run, and he had a lot of possibilities Roth is also killed, but he should not be in the movie, and Del Sol, well, she has promised a role in this movie just for romantic reasons (for sexual reading), so he's still alive again, he even attacked Hurt for the 15th time in the movie.He killed everyone else, but not her, she must have the maximum appearance of The film was made with a shoelace budget and shown, but when it does not have a characterization of the story and the board of cards, it shows even more, and yes, Fernando Ray appears and traverses the film like the star invite a, with a single audible line of dialogue.
