Evil Behind You, was created with a specific purpose in mind, to push the personal opinions of writers / directors about who walks in the water or who dances with the devil. Unfortunately, it seems that the creators were so focused on expressing their point of view that they eliminated their power completely by forcing their viewpoint on the viewer. The way your message is presented Almost reminds me of the stories I've heard of the Spanish Inquisition! From one real Christian to another, avoid this as the plague, scare tactics never work when it comes to sending these kinds of messages! <br /> <br /> The performance was horrible, the selection of Muslim terrorists was racist and unfair (they are terrorists so they must be Muslims). The premise of this was good, the story provided a great conduit for his message, however, it was the execution of these ideas that fell short, which made it even difficult to separate the messenger's message, so to speak. <br /> <br /> It would be better to dust off your old "Ghost" DVD with Mr. Swayze to better receive this message. At least that movie did not try to get in the throat. Or if you like Good Christian movies with a powerful message, try "End of the Spear"
