This adaptation contains two parts: <br /> <br /> 1. The moment "now", when Gulliver is at home in England and soon is put in a mental asylum by the evil Dr. Bates <br /> <br / > 2. The "described" time, in which Gulliver describes his travels. <br /> <br /> Times intermingle with a very choppy rhythm, which makes the suspense of disbelief much more difficult than it would have been if the movie simply did it. I discarded that part, and followed the book as it is written. In the book, there is no Dr. Bates, no asylum, and Mrs. Gulliver receives very little mention. The trips, in plural, are represented as one in the film. There are several films that cover the topic of healthy people thrown into the asylum by some unpleasant person out there, look at them if you want those things. The part of the time "now" adds absolutely nothing to the value of the story, it is a complete invention of the movie adapters and it takes a valuable time from the real story. All the time this happened, I wanted to see the next real trip. <br /> <br /> A lot for the inconveniences. The parts that are really part of the real story are well made, and the CGI is really well done for its time. Many small parts (and some medians) of real trips are simply cut out, but that does not stop the story. This is the only version of AFAIK that describes the four trips, and for that, the film should receive a special mention. <br /> <br /> The two interspersed parts get approximately the same time. I rate the first part 0 of 10, and the actual trip coverage as 8/10. With an average, I give it a 4/10. If only they had trimmed the garbage and centered the 99% in the real trips, since that cut would have freed much more time spent in filling in the details of the trips. <br /> <br /> Why some adapters think he has enough talent to improve Swift's work, I do not know. My best guess is that CGI was so expensive in 1996, so the film company felt the need to incorporate a large amount of filler that did not need elaborate sets, GCI, etc. to keep total costs below some limit, while at the same time producing a miniseries that was recorded in a certain number of minutes.
