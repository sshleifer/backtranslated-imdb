The adventures of Sebastian Cole is about a boy named Sebastian (Adrian Grenier) who thinks he is a writer at some point, given that he really tries to achieve it. This film is, presumably, the years in which he gets his material to write, the years of adventures, hence the title and the previous appointment. In it we experience the very typical stories and warnings of love, drugs and sex ... changes. Yes, there is a slight twist here that is very interesting, and that is Sebastian's stepfather (Clark Gregg) makes a rough decision to have a sex change that has a great impact on Sebastian's family and his relationship with his step. -dad. <br /> <br /> Clark Gregg plays Hank / Henrietta, Sebastian's stepfather and is very good on paper, very credible without exaggeration, which is a route that this film could have taken quite easily. Fortunately, they did not. Adrien Grenier, with whom I'm only familiar with Entourage, is also very good at his part as Sebastian, and together, he and Gregg have a great relationship on the screen. It is always quite attractive to see the relationship of these guys (?) As it develops and sometimes it is really heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> And that's the best of what this movie has to offer. Unfortunately, it brings with it some mediocre camera work, direction and cinematography. Not bad, but it is far from being good or memorable in the least. The characters are also written thinly, and it is clear from the beginning how most of the arcs will develop. The only really fascinating character is Clark Gregg's Hank / Henrietta. I've already said that Grenier did well in terms of acting, but Sebastian's character is not only not attractive, it's completely unpleasant. Honestly, I do not see why someone in the audience would direct his character in everything he does. He laments, moans, cheats, lies, and lacks any other aspiration than a total laziness. It would be different if he were maybe a secondary character or a comic relief, but have him as the main focus and ask him to take the character seriously? Let's go. <br /> <br /> And I really do not compare it to this movie, but I just want to say ... choose a different song in all these movies, Hollywood! No more "Where Is My Mind" by Pixies, we all know it's a good song, stop using it in all the other movies! <br /> <br /> I feel like I could keep breaking more and more of this movie apart, but in all honesty I did not hate it. I just did not care, and I would not recommend it to anyone. The adventures of Sebastian Cole is not a bad or boring movie, nor is it a very good or attractive movie. It is very uneven and the script could have used a bit of work. I suppose that the objective of the film is to be a kind of loose look at the life of a writer before it did, and it worked ... if that writer published pieces of fiction that he did not want to read.
