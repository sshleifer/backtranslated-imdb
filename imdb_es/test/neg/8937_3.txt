A hunka less waste than redemption that fortunately is free from the ravages of competition. Some idiots from the north come to the deep south in search of some Confederate rifles hidden in the legendary Whiskey Mountain. They are threatened by fearful mountaineers, in a broad nod to "Deliverance"; But it turns out that the hicks are in front of a tough guy of marijuana traffic in the north. This comes to light as soon as it is not even qualified as a turn. Women are locked and raped in catatonia; Instead of rescuing them, the boys go down to the city to look for the sheriff, who is lazy and does not believe them. I think if my girlfriend were being raped I would take the shortest route to hiding anyway. However, it's okay because as soon as they appear to soften the bad guys, the girls get happy and jump from one side to the other, if only the trauma was like that in real life. It also has a boy with a bush with a beard who laughs a lot. Not exactly bursting at the seams with ideas.
