Approximately 20 minutes of this unconvincing excuse for a movie, I realized that it reminded me of one of those annoying people at work who are always telling really bored jokes or doing very funny things, because they think it's funny and they're trying to entertain everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie is cataloged as having been starred by Traci Lords, she is not that bad actress, but her lines are not funny and SHE IS NOT THE STAR <br /> <br /> The acting is part of the Most frightening I've seen, except for Lords, the girl who plays Casey, and maybe the Colonel, who seems strangely out of place. I can not imagine why a retired military colonel would want to start a SNOWBOARD ACADEMY. They even exist? <br /> <br /> The budget would have been better spent on persuading these women to make a complete porn movie. <br /> <br /> "Freddy Got Fingered" currently has a score of 3.5, "Frostbite" has a 2.7. I'm baffled that these two movies are within a 1.0 of each other, FGF is "The Godfather" compared to this crap. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars
