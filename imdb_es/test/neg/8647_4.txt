The four Los Angeles policemen in fedoras drive around a big black convertible with a slightly absurd look, and even more ridiculous when it turns out that Nick Nolte, the dumbest of them all, is in charge. The writer never manages to create a spirit of camaraderie among the members of the squad, and the director does not manage to get the article of the mountain-man Nolte. Foprget questioning anyone. The character of Nolte lights a cigarette, gets angry and hits the interviewees. His methods do not take him anywhere, until at a moment of action he is wandering from the residence thrown into the residence thrown with his mouth open and his brain closed. Destroy an FBI squadron and throw two military officers from an airplane in flight, with only a vague report of anger at the headquarters and without any punishment. At the end of the movie, he is as immaculate and muscular as he was at the beginning. How he made a beautiful whore fall in love with him is a mystery, as is eternal devotion and the tragic sense of betrayal expressed by his wife without work. Two interesting shots in the image: one, of an atomic explosion, the other of a gigantic crater, apparently caused by a bomb. It's almost as ruined and bloated as Nolte's face.
