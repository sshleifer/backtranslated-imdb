I laughed at the movie! The script, the performance please, do not we deserve something better? But now filming, some of the camera angles were interesting. I enjoyed the movie, but it should not be taken seriously. I liked. If I had a new cast and a screenwriter it would be better than good. It's worth taking a look!
