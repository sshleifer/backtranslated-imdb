We were happy to rent this one, after reading some reviews and seeing that it had such a high score here. Well, we got it at home and we could not believe what we saw. Basically it comes out as if it had been written by a perverted and hard old man who could not avoid inserting his frustrations and sexual fantasies in an anime movie that really lacks plot and humor. The main character is everywhere ... for a moment, he's like an immature child, the next moment he's mature and intelligent, then heroic, then a perverted stalker. <br /> <br /> The worst part is all the sexual content misplaced. I have no problem with sex and I dig a movie that has good sexual energy, but this is presented in a way that is creepy. The nipple slips, the close-ups of a crotch of girls (many times) in white panties, or a swimsuit. It was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it tried to live some fantasies through its cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> We were expecting something of a mature nature, but we kept looking at each other and wondering what on earth was the point of this ... besides the cartoon boobs and the poor dialogue. If you want to see some cartoon characters neckline and crotch ... this is for you. If you look for something beyond that, this movie was empty. The characters and the dialogue were simply irritating. <br /> <br />
