An airplane that carries some scientists and a prototype of a DNA machine, a powerful and revolutionary invention, fall into a jungle in the Pacific. The insurance company sponsors a rescue expedition, commanded by Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), the owner of a large corporation, owner of the prototype, and father of one of the scientists. There, the group finds the remains of the plane five miles from the expected location and the machine and the remains of the people. Also, they realize that a Sasquatch, a kind of Big Foot, is chasing them. This movie is so ridiculous that I do not know what I'm doing, spending my time back on this crap. The direction is horrible, the actors and the lines are horrible, copying parts of 'The Predator' and even 'The Blair Witch Project'. To summarize how bad this film is, its best scene is when Marla Lawson, the character of Andrea Roth, is injured and the expedition guide says she needs a tetanus shot. Andrea takes off her jeans and the guide says: 'Nice asses, but the shot should be in your arm'. Ridiculous! My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Sasquatch, O Abomin√°vel '(` Sasquatch, The Abominable') <br /> <br />
