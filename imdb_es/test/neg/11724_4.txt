Do not get me wrong I have a considerable weakness for the works of Charles Band, both as producer and director. But you have to raise an eyebrow when the man who was willing to put his name to "Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys" puts a pseudonym on anything. Like some bad movie fun, "Head Of The Family" is pretty deficient, although it's better acting than you'd expect. Jacqueline Lovell is a definite talent that deserves more than this kind of movies. J.W. Bitch is also quite funny as the titular monster, although for such a super intelligent being he goes mad quite easily. You know, I'm doing it because the rest of the movie is so neat and witty, of course ... <br /> <br /> And have a main character named Lance Bogan? Good guys one We did not know that Americans knew that piece of lingo!
