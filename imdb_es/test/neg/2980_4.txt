Not finding the right words is everyone's problem in this vaudeville urban comedy. They do not know what to say, and they do not know how to say it, so they embark on the potentially humiliating venture of pre-established speed dating. Unfortunately, they all appear as cardboard characters instead of real people. The story follows a conventional structure of three acts: meet the important cast in their sad and single lives, the real dating circuit and a final stretch of romantic rain, showing some of the follies of the new couples. Because everything is very predictable, I would say that as a narrative, "Shoppen" is a failure. As a comedy, most of the time it's too ridiculous to be really fun. Thumbs to Kathrin von Steinburg. She stands out from the crowd of telenovelas like Miriam, independent and wealthy. Great makeup also for her (Verena Wei√üert): the thick eye shadow is combined with the lip gloss of the tone of the skin, creating a bohemian and bohemian effect, although feminine. We also thank Stefan Zinner as the Bavarian love machine and Tanja Schleiff as the nutritionist. They avoid the challenge of communication through the timeless body language of copulation.
