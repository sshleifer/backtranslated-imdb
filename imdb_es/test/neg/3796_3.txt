... a good script or director could not fix it. <br /> <br /> The original 'Poseidon Adventure' was a story of human courage that triumphed against terrible odds and a personal tragedy. The survivors were guided by a charismatic figure of great spiritual strength who would take whatever God threw at him. <br /> <br /> The tracking tries to recreate the mix but fails through a script and a pedestrian direction. It is possible that Irwin Allen has been a great producer of disaster films, and he has done a good job directing the action scenes in 'Towering Inferno', but he simply can not bring human depth to his characters. If the characters are not credible, the danger they face also deflates. <br /> <br /> The script also tries to copy the original too obviously. So we have Peter Boyle doing Ernest Borgnine being tough and nasty (but he has a tender heart); Karl Malden is the moderating influence of the Red Buttons (and he has a terminal illness just in case); Slim Pickens makes comic relief for Shelley Winters, and so on. <br /> <br /> To make history more contemporary, we have a weapons dealer ready to launch weapons-grade plutonium to the highest bidder. A really nasty job that ruthlessly abandons wounded men (the actors who play their henchmen were probably paid as extras because they do not seem to have any lines) and a woman was shot in the back, what a hip! Thank God, the French rescue services made the hole in the Poseidon's hull twice as big as in 1972 (and on the other side of the propeller shaft) in order to take out their assets. And while we're on the subject, how did they make the boxes become * the ... oh, forget it? <br /> <br /> I actually paid a good amount of money to see this when it was launched. Given the current reputation of the film, this may seem strange, but it actually received mixed reviews at that time. Some said it was garbage, others said it was as exciting as the original. It does not matter, nobody can be fine all the time.
