Eugene O'Neill's 4 1/2 hour play in 1927 hit the screen in less than two hours. The combination of symbolic dialogues and Gothic melodrama of the work has not aged very well and the cast has some difficulties, especially Nina by Norma Shearer and Marsden by Ralph Morgan. Clark Gable as Ned Darrell comes out better, but especially because he is a brusque character that is not given to the philosophical reflections of others, which best fits the Gable range. Once the plot is established in the love quad and the audience adapts to the voiceover to the side, the movie becomes more enjoyable. The technique used here for the asides is another problem. On stage, the action froze as the actors expressed their thoughts to the audience. Here they are done as voice-overs. You would think that would work better, but since the action no longer freezes, the actors are forced to pause to talk and grimace at the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts. Also, it's hard for any movie buff to watch this movie and not think about the hilarious version of Groucho Marx in "Animal Crackers." In addition to these drawbacks, some cuts are included for reasons of censorship (Nina's promiscuity is mild and it is not mentioned that she has had the abortion that is most important in the work) and an unfortunate (uncredited) score that sounds like music from background to Weepie of the beginning of the century. O'Neill called this movie "a frightful tremor of attempted condensation and idiotic censorship", and although "Strange Interlude" is not as big as its later "The Iceman Cometh" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night", it certainly deserves more than this.
