If you are at home a weekend, very bored and without the will to move, with nothing better to do with your life for the next two hours, you could enjoy making fun of this movie. The acting and the script and the making of films in general of this movie are not so bad, so it is possible to ignore this. This is definitely a movie they would show in the high school health class to teach the dangers of premarital sex. Or they could also show it to teach the dangers of very elusive music: that the "rock" band Brian Austin Green is really terrible, I think it is a much greater threat to society than the unmarried parents.
