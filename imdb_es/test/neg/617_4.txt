'Felony' is a series movie. No doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you take a look at the cast lineup, you could have high hopes for its entertainment potential. This movie is full of all those wonderful actors that you grew up with, those with faces that you recognize immediately, although you probably do not know their names. It is surprising that the filmmakers were able to bring all these people together in a single project, almost as if they decided to make a meeting of actors in series B movies. The cast includes even a couple of top-level actors: David Warner, whom the Most people will recognize 'Titanic' (although my favorite of their roles is Jack the Ripper in 'Time After Time') and Lance Henriksen, and many will. Remember as a bishop in 'Aliens'. These two actors have done an excellent job in their long careers and made some very good films. <br /> <br /> However, however impressive this collection of actors may be, their talent never fully manifests on the screen. The writers of 'Felony' spent a lot of money to put together a cast of the dream team and then lost their golden opportunity due to one important factor, the common denominator of all the B movies: a silly script. <br /> <br /> We start with a silly premise. The bad guys are trapped in a film committing a frightful murder and they chase the film crew relentlessly to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence. But honestly, why bother? In the time it takes to track the film crew, one thousand copies of that tape could be made and distributed to all law enforcement agencies and media outlets. The criminals do not seem to realize how useless their effort is, and they talk as if stealing and destroying the only original videotape would solve the whole problem. Silly ... but I guess if the bad guys were so logical there would not be any movie. <br /> <br /> Then there is the dialogue. It is sometimes silly, sometimes clich√© and sometimes unbelievable ... everything that can be expected from a B movie. Of course, I have always believed that good results can overcome many weaknesses in the material. This cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances, and although some of the cast members are not good actors at all and have achieved B-movie status quite deservingly, one could still hope that the part The strongest of the cast are capable of infusing a little life into their parts. However, it is disappointing to see that few of the actors in this movie really seem to take the movie seriously enough to give their best. There is not much obvious inspiration in these performances, but again it is an uninspiring script. Now, I'll admit that some of the most colorful actors in the cast manage to add a certain amount of enthusiasm to the delivery of their lines, but honestly, even the very good actors I mentioned above seem mostly disinterested and not involved with the story . <br /> <br /> Speaking of the story ... even if the performance had been of a caliber high enough to make the dialogue seem a bit less corny, it still would not redeem 'Crime' from the fact that its writer commits the last false step of the scripts of low-budget action films: a plot with as many holes as a block of Swiss cheese. You can watch this movie hundreds of times and you still will not discover how everything accumulates. In an effort to create suspense and always keep the viewer guessing, the writer introduces all kinds of surprises and unexpected twists in his script and ends with a puzzle, but when you reach the end you discover that there are a lot of pieces. That simply does not fit anywhere and others that are missing. I admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing, but creating twists in the plot that exist only to confuse them and that are not consistent with the rest of the story is amateur. There was so much that it was never explained that in the end I felt extremely frustrated. If you decide to see it, be prepared to be confused. <br /> <br /> I have not even mentioned other silly things about this movie, but I will not bother. The funny thing is that despite everything I have said, I must admit that I can not give 1/10 stars to 'Felony'. Although I can not pinpoint exactly why, I actually thought that this movie was something nice. Stupidity can be fun sometimes if you're in the mood for it. Also, I really like some of these character actors, and although their performances are somewhat mediocre considering their talents, I still like to see them. <br /> <br /> Now, I realize that I have qualified it. Film from the point of view of a serious spectator. It is completely possible that you have completely lost the point. It could be that the intention of the filmmakers was to make a series film. Maybe stupidity is completely intentional. If that is the case, and if I had to qualify it in those terms, I would have to say that 'Felony' is a classic in the ironic action film genre. Movie B fans will love to see all their favorite actors together in a movie, get some laughs from the script and be entertained with the healthy dose of weapons, explosions and chases.
