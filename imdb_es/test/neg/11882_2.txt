In terms of historical accuracy, this is the worst Roman movie I've ever seen. The list not only of the errors, but the ideas of the plot that are completely impossible would last longer than the three-hour movie, but just to give you an idea ... <br /> <br /> Julio César and Augusto they present themselves as liberal Democrats, putting themselves on the side of the "people" against "the nobles." This is evidently absurd. The Caesars were as noble as you could get. His interest was to consolidate power and stabilize a country that had been destroyed by 150 years of civil war. There were reformers, especially the Gracchi brothers, who lived about 100 years earlier, and to a certain extent advocated the rights of ordinary citizens. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that are completely ridiculous, if you know something. about the period. "Cleopatra", with Richard Burton, will give you a much better idea of ​​how the events developed, although it is a fantasy. <br /> <br /> Historical precision is one thing. Acting and dialogue are something else, and here this film is dangerously close to being a bad secondary production. I laughed several times, especially when Julia, Augusto's daughter, meets a lover. They cling passionately, while she breathes: "My father ..." "Ah, your father, your father ... your father would disapprove". Peter O'Toole is at his worst, forced to gnaw his way through some very pompous and silly lines. The actor who plays Augusto when he was young is a boy, and the character is written as such: it is impossible to imagine him as the cunning and clever Machiavellian politician who created the Roman Empire. In this case, he is just an addict who has to be told what to do most of the time. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Rampling manages to leave a secured role as Livia, Augustus' wife, with dignity. If he had been given a more complete role, he could have rescued this production from the absurd. <br /> <br /> There are some nice pictures and battle images, aided by a lot of CGI from standard problems. Interestingly, this was done for British television (and it seems to be a British-Italian co-production) but it is labeled with an "R" rating. <br /> <br /> The image of the DVD is excellent and the soundtrack of Dolby Digital is very beautiful, although you only notice it during the few action sequences, since the film is mostly a talk. <br /> <br /> Almost any Roman film, including "Cleopatra" or "The Fall of the Roman Empire," has more historicity, not to mention compelling drama, than this bizarre adaptation of Classics Illustrated, Jr. gives a new meaning to the abused phrase, "Based on a true story". In this case, they could have said: "Suggested by real events".
