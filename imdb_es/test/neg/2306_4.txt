Although this movie was not anything special, I am attracted to comment on at least one factor that failed in its favor: that of the female protagonist of the film, Dyan Cannon. Despite the ridiculous story of the film and what she has lived here, hers was the best actor work in the film, making the incredible seem more plausible. His scandalous scene with gay photographer David Hemmings must be seen to be believed. Good job, Dyan.
