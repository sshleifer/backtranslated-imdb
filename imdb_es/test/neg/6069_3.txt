I am a music lover and I was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I was ready to go out in the middle of the movie. I did not identify with any of the characters, which meant that I did not care what happened to them and lost interest in the story completely. On the good side, Ed Harris looked exactly like Beethoven, and the Ninth Symphony is always a pleasure to listen to, so that made part of the film bearable. Also the parts where they talk about the bridge almost redeemed the whole movie, but could not sustain me until the end. The actors did what they could with what they had to work on, but the script simply was not adequate to make it even remotely interesting. The part about "washing" was a complete rubbish. I wonder how many shots the actors would have to do with it (I would not be able to say those lines without bursting out in laughter). Anyway, a pity, it could have been much better.
