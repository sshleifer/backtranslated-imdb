Two popular actors are paired in the showtime as De Niro and Murphy playing a policeman and an actor. Although they share the most screen time together, they do not achieve the expected performance in movies like Analyze This, Meet the Parents, Dr Doolittle and Nutty Professor. The movie starts interestingly, but it becomes a thin and ordinary comedy that is quite disappointing. It feels that especially De Niro does not like to be on Showtime. It's a shame because it really shows your feelings, that's what I think. Unfortunately, if the idea had been used intelligently, this could have been a more interesting work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I do not think there's a sequel to this, at least, again, for De Niro and Murpy. ** outside *****
