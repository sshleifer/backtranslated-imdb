This miniseries / movie was so terrible at times that I almost collapsed and turned it off. I am a big fan of the novel, however, this film suffers from a multitude of problems. The costumes are poor, and many of the scenes more charged with emotion are faded. Deviations from the novel are badly chosen, significant nuances are lost or rewritten. <br /> <br />
