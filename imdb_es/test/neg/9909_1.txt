It contains Major Spoilers, on the off chance that you really care about the story. <br /> <br /> Okay, we have storms that destroy a city and a hacker that attacks the electricity network. <br /> <br /> Schlock predictable from the start, and if that was not enough, the 5 seconds of action between the film and the commercials kill the little suspense that could have been. For example: will they arrive at the airport on time? Things look dark when we go to a commercial and the action before the ad shows them bouncing inside the plane! Well, I guess they'll make it, after all, but, again, they had to because they're good guys. <br /> <br /> The performance was not very impressive (exception and welcome relief: Randy Quaid (as Tornado Tommy), the effects were a bit slow, the bad guys understood it and the good ones came in. The real disaster of this movie It was the script, especially the ending, not only wrapped things happily as fast as a soap opera 24 hours in advance of the cancellation, but also glorified the hacker as if he were well intentioned, so he caused a death of bazillions? He had good intentions and, of course, an edifying final television report about people joining in. Barf was all I expected from the commercials, and I'm glad I wasted my time watching him Tomorrow will be a great conversation at the dinner table lunch. <br /> <br /> Is CBS insulting us doing this? Of course, but we saw it, right? Did you count many announcements that there were for backup generators for the home during this pig? <br /> < Here is waiting for the next Plan 9 from Outer Space (which improves with each visualization). This is not. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
