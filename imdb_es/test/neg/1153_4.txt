If good intentions were enough to produce a good movie, I would have called the "Focus" turgid, heavy and obvious a little higher than 4. Macy's best effort, but as a previous poster commented, Miller's little parable asks us that we suspend incredulity very often Maybe the novel gives us a little more history about Newman, so that we can understand how someone who obviously does not lack intelligence could be so dense when perceiving the attitudes of those around him. I agree with another critic that if one is not aware of how fanatical average US citizens were during this period, then this movie could be a revelation. I grew up in the fifties, and the "good" pastors of my Lutheran church found nothing wrong with having a picnic on a commercial beach, whose sign prominently indicated that no Jews or blacks would be admitted. It is difficult for young people today to understand that this was the norm, and not only in the South. In 1964, when I graduated from a public high school in Baltimore, something racially integrated (but sexually segregated), my black classmates could not attend the traditional "father and son banquet", as it was held in a facility that did not admitted blacks Sadly, it was an establishment owned by a Jewish family. The theme of "Focus" is important, and we should never forget, despite the persistent signs of racism in modern America, how truly repulsive were the attitudes of that earlier generation (the "greatest generation", in effect). Therefore, perhaps this film is something valuable to counteract the recent wave of sentimental junk about the forties of Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokow. But in the end, as in "Far from Heaven", the good intentions of the filmmakers are undermined by having a protagonist so ridiculously alien to the social conventions of his time.
