There is not much to be said apart from a lot of Wire-fu and supposed Sholin monks who dispute the ego over Kung-fu and the caricature of the Japanese trying to take over China. All this would not be so bad if it were not for the fight with totally false Japanese swords. If you saw one or two Samurai movies, you can say that the "Japanese" who fight in the movie are just the same "Kung Fu" tricks (circus acrobats) who do the same things except with a Japanese sword. However, there are a couple of funny moments, like when a Japanese ninja takes off her clothes in mid-flight to disarm a monk and catches him with a fishing net. In the sense of history, there seems to be a bit of schizophrenia as to whether the Japanese should be shown as completely contemptible or if there could be exceptions. The "Japanese" protagonist is largely honorable but not beyond unjustified cruelty, such as when he murders a sedated monk so he can have his duel. Very disappointing with a very silly ending. It does not evoke for a moment the appearance of the idea of ​​an epic battle.
