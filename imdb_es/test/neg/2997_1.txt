This is a good time to say how well I think of this site: it gives me the opportunity to feed back all the frustration I experienced for two hours, waiting for something to happen, to say something, to show, to insinuate itself. Subtly, for a symbol, an idea, whatever. No, just long, endless violins, alternated by a tired piano. Tired voices, tired actors and boring characters and situations. Bored is the long death of the mind, and this movie is, from that point of view, a public enemy. How many thousands of hours of life will be stolen from thousands of innocent bystanders. I do not claim to get my money back, just for my time and the time of the people I invited to see this ... My God!
