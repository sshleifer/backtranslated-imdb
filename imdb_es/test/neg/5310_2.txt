That film, although slightly defective, was entirely entertaining. About half an hour into Be Cool, I started having flashbacks of Hollywood homicides. But guess that? This is worse Even the dance number is bad. I like most of the cast in this movie, so it makes me feel bad for writing a negative review, but I feel compelled. The Rock, Andre 3000 and Vince Vaughn were in a comedy. Nobody else seemed to decide what genre of film they played. I feel bad for Travolta because he brought the same Chili Palmer from Get Shorty to this movie. It was totally consistent on paper, but this movie is so different from the original that the character stands out like a sore thumb. I was going to give this movie 4/10 because I really like the actors, but there is a conversation in the movie about a certain song that is so stupid that I could not believe the actors really said it. If you want to go to the movies this weekend, there should still be some Oscar hopefuls. That would be a much better way to spend your time.
