When teaching Mrs. Tingle, all I wanted was a fun and funny comedy for teenagers that would entertain me because of its time of execution. Despite a fairly good first half hour, the film quickly dives into a dull, messy clich√© that is as entertaining as pulling out lashes with tweezers. Oxidized pliers, to that. The writer of 'Scream' Kevin Williamson wrote and directed this film, and showed that Scream could have been a coincidence. Most of the elements of this film have already been seen a million times in other films; and while it was okay, stole items from other films in Scream, because it is a tribute slasher; Here, it seems that he has run out of ideas completely. The plot follows the most intelligent girl in the school, played by Katie Holmes. After being caught cheating along with two of her friends; the three decide to take the teacher who took them hostage in their own home. However, this is not just a teacher; It's Mrs. Tingle, the worst bitch in school. She is also not sleeping with the bed lying down, as she starts playing mental games to face her captors. <br /> <br /> The plot is very similar to the 1997 film 'Suicide Kings', and a whole series of previous films. Actually, it's not a bad idea for a movie, and if Williamson could have populated the movie with interesting characters; It could have worked very well. The character of Mrs. Tingle is the most interesting of the film, but it is massively one-dimensional, and like all the other characters in the film; It is merely a caricature. The acting is largely diabolical, with the exception of Helen Mirren in the title role. She is suitably evil on paper, and although she does not have much to clench her teeth; she clearly enjoys playing the central figure. It's not worth mentioning the cast of teenagers, with only Katie Holmes standing out; and that's just really because of his star profile, not his acting talents. Williamson has covered almost all the scenes with soft and boring rock music, which would be really annoying if the movie was not absolutely terrible anyway. Honestly, this movie has some moments that are pretty good; But basically, if you want to see a good example of teen comedy, this is not the movie you want to see.
