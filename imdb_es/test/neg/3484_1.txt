One of the worst surf movies I've seen. This movie is so bad that I do not know where to start ... Well, let's start with the premise: a guy from mainland China who barely knows how to surf, travels to Hawaii and participates in a big wave contest that he more or less expects. win. A good analogy for those who do not surf would be that of a heavy smoker with excess weight who is slapped with a pair of shoes and enters the Los Angeles Marathon with the expectation of winning. No way! And, the contest takes place at The North Shore, which evokes images of waves of more than 15 feet, but on the day of competition the waves are perhaps 6 feet. The acting? What to do If you must see this picture on television, do not lose your money when renting it. If you want to see a pretty good surf movie, but it's wrong, but that's another story: rent Big Wednesday.
