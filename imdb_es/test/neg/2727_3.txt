It is at times like these that I would really like to be a more avid reader of Clive Barker's literary repertoire, since very few things feel worse than not being able to fully comprehend a film of this incredibly "visual" caliber. Based on the novel "Cabal", the story of "Nightbreed" involves a gigantic amount of creatures and luxurious and strange environments in a clandestine society of demonic demons. A normal man is linked to the strange world, called Midian, through his dreams and his psychiatrist forces him to believe that he is responsible for a series of gruesome murders of families in recent months ... Thinking that this is true, he He withdraws Midian - located under a rural cemetery - where he is reluctantly accepted. However, the psychiatrist is right in the cures of Homeboy with a diabolical scheme to bring down the Nightbreeds community ... <br /> <br /> Wishing so much to love this movie, in the long run it disappointed me a lot. Sadly, I have not read the story, so Barker's fantasy world and its purpose and all these monsters were terribly confusing and the premise was painfully uneven. I understand that the final cut was cut in cubes to hell and even Barker Show moderately disliked the product in general, but I just did not "understand" it. Even if reading the story is crucial, I think it should at least be translated into a movie in a way that is understandable to those who are not familiar with literature. If "Cabal" is as intricate as this movie, Barker really milked a dead concept. I could not help but feel a little bored after a while, especially when things started to get more and more ridiculous (somewhere in the jail scene I realized how bored I was), as if a police department was to the war with Midian as if it happened every week. ! Nobody seems to think that the idea of ​​immortal monsters is a bit ... strange. I liked the visual effects and all that madness that happened in Midian, especially that porcupine lady and that big head SOB ... Without a doubt, an epic movie when you consider the enormous amount of effects and a convincingly morbid decoration. David Cronenberg occupies his position well while the madman shrinks with his zippered head sack of potatoes, but we ALL wish he had done a little work behind the camera to help save this pile ... <br /> <br /> So, if you like the Clive Barker material and you understand what exactly Midian is, why do they show the creatures during the opening title sequence (what a terrible idea!), and why they reside there and how a punk guy shares a telekinetic link For this, you should probably check "Nightbreed". I will look for "Cabal" one of these days and I hope to get some perspective ... Or maybe I completely forget this parody ... Until then, this is a mess of a badly constructed and quite tedious movie. . Watch "Hellraiser" instead.
