Seriously, science fiction needs to stop making movies. They are all horrible. And this one had John Rhys-Davies in him, and he could not help the movie. Dr. Pe√±a (Giancarlo Esposito) captures Mexico's legendary goat-eater, the chupacabra, and takes him aboard a cruiser of Captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies). The creature escapes and begins to kill crew and passengers. Captain Rudolf and the crew go after the creature with their weapons on fire. But they can not stop it. That's what they call it in the navy. They can not stop it either. Then the thing kills 5 (or as many as there are). Then, the captain and his daughter, along with some other guy, discover how to kill him. Stay away from this movie. The chupacabra looks incredibly cheesy, the navy men shoot at the slightest movement, throw grenades at the ship and the performance is horrible. 3/10.
