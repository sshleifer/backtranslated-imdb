Maureen O'Hara is always beautiful and attractive. Here she plays an actress with a terminal illness. We do not know with what. He is a bit of a forerunner of "Love Story" in that sense. <br /> <br /> William Bendix is ​​good, as is most of the cast cast. John Payne is destined to be in mourning, but he seems to be asleep. The child who plays the child he and O'Hara adopt makes their best effort with an artificial weft device: Of course! Adopt an orphan. She will live after the death of your wife. It's a sweet movie but it does not feel sincere. I expected to be moved. I was, because of the gentle performance of O'Hara. But I do not like to feel manipulated.
