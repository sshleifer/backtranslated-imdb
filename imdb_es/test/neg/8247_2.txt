I sat through 2 hours of sheer boredom. I look here in IMDB, although it's not on the top list, it's in the top 250. It surprised me a little. Although, yes. I am very impressed with the acting skills of Robin and Matt, they still did not save the movie. I'm not sure what I really did not like about the movie. Maybe it's because I have math. Maybe it's not too much to talk badly for 2 hours. Even though I loved "American Beauty", but that was it. I just want my 2 hours back. It was a great waste of my time. If I'm missing something in this movie, please send me an email. I'm curious to know why this is among the 250 best. And do not say "because it was a good movie". <br /> <br /> 2/10
