If you saw the grudge, another film of mediocre ghosts, then you should know what to expect, only worse, much worse. This time, instead of being in Japan with all English speaking people, we are in Spain with all English speakers. It is interesting that not a single shot of this film really looks like Spain and could have been shot completely in a studio on a lot. Oh, and a place with swings, because there are about 5 minutes of footage of swings without anyone, oooohhh what a chilling thing. <br /> <br /> This is terrible in every conceivable way. The performance of the lameinator mom and dad does not help at all. Anna Paquin is the only person who offers a decent performance in the movie, but I hate Anna Paquin, so you can imagine my own private hell watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There is a good time in the film, however, when a villain tries to explain the intricate plot of Anna Paquin's character and she does not understand any of that, he asks a lot of stupid questions and he says " IDIOT, you have not understood anything! " hahaha Well, I understand that this movie is a piece of garbage. 0 stars
