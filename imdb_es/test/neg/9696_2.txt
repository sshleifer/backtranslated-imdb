I will dispense with the obvious revision of factual inaccuracies. They are too numerous to name them. A much shorter list would be what they got. 1. Friend named Noah. 2. Ark with animals in it. <br /> <br /> If you want a much more accurate representation of Noah's Ark and the destruction of Sodom, go to "The Bible" (1966). It represents the story of creation through Abraham who tries to sacrifice his son Isaac. It's a much better movie, and it may be that the abomination called "Noah's Ark" (1999) has taken you to look for that movie. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/ <br /> <br /> I really could not stand watching the whole movie. When I read other comments, I can see that even atheists found it extremely inaccurate. As a Christian, it was intolerable for me. Possibly the worst movie ever made. There's also no real point in this movie, except maybe to show your computer animation below average. <br /> <br /> Was it a complete waste? Maybe not. God can use evil to do good. <br /> <br /> Romans 8:28 says, [28] And we know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose. <br /> <br /> Genesis 50 says: [20] But as for you, you thought badly against me; but God did it for good, to carry out, as it is this day, to save many living people. <br /> <br /> In the second example, Joseph's brothers had the intention of killing him, but God turned his evil into a great good. It is possible that he did the same with this movie. <br /> <br /> People were so amazed by their lack of biblical foundation, that they probably pulled out the old dusty Bible and read the story for themselves. To find out about Lot and Sodom, they would have to go to Genesis 19 before God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah. By then, they have read almost half of Genesis, so they may want to finish. The next book is Exodus, on which the film "The Ten Commandments" was based (and with much more precision). If you have seen that movie, then Exodus becomes an easy read. So now you have read at least two complete books of the Bible, just because you saw a pathetic film about Noah's Ark. I'm sure this really happened to someone. <br /> <br /> God works in mysterious ways.
