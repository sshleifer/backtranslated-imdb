The title of the film makes it look like a porn movie, but it's not even a sexual comedy. In contrast, Hot Summer in Barefoot County is an officer sent from a southern state to a small town to locate and arrest those who were in charge of the war. However, the light of the moon comes from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters. Almost everyone can guess what happens next, but interestingly, the film is very docile. Almost does not qualify for a PG rating. What's more, the low budget is obvious in almost all shots and the acting is very amateurish. This movie was probably intended for the drive-in crowd, but it's unlikely that it would have satisfied it, even in 1974.
