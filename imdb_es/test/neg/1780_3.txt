Some giant scorpions are in a submarine and kill everyone. Two months later, some marines and the scientists in charge of the scorpion project go to the submarine to recover their cargo. After finding 200 corpses, the Navy commander tells the doctor "I need to know if there is anything down here that could be a danger to my men." Uh, gee ... do you think? She refuses to tell him what's down there, citing "need to know." Yes, that's fine enough. One of the scientists is apparently a kind of wise idiot, very heavy on the idiot, light on the wise. He has the task of fixing the lights. Find the lights control panel, cut a wire and squeak like a banshee. Then he does it again. Then take a hammer and break the control panel into pieces, which makes all the lights of the submarine begin to work. <br /> <br /> And so it is. Apparently this was done in Sweden; I'm not sure if Swedes have a really strange sense of humor or if they're really horrible filmmakers. I am inclined to think that they are terrible filmmakers. If you guessed that there is a big explosion at the end of this thing, well, I'm sorry, but it's a necessity, but I can not tell you. <br /> <br /> If you've absolutely seen a giant scorpion movie, let me suggest Tail Sting, which is a cheesy and funny movie about scorpions on a plane, or Bugs, which is a pretty descending movie about scorpions in a tunnel. Watch this movie as an absolute last resort. Oh, it's visible, it's hard to deactivate it just for the sheer madness of that, but that's all it has to do.
