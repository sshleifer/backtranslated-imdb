From the fertile imagination that brought you the irresistible HERCULES (1983), arises its sequel even more absurd (read ridiculous): from the beginning, we get another difficult prologue of "beginning of time" that even contradicts completely contradicting these same events as put in the first film !; A condensed montage of highlights of the same is soon followed by a sequence of shift credits similar to SUPERMAN. As far as the narrative is concerned, here we have four rebellious gods who stole the seven rays of Zeus, all of great importance (but poorly animated). A crime that, on the one hand, sets the moon adrift on a collision course with Planet Earth! Faster than you can say "nepotism", Zeus (once again played as a bearded man with white hair by the relatively young Claudio Cassinelli) sends his champion. Who has now legitimately taken his place among the elite thanks, presumably, to the almighty tasks performed in the first film? to find your blooming thunder and avoid calamities in the store. <br /> <br /> Just Hercules (Lou Ferrigno, as if you did not know) touched the earthly surface that comes in contact with two attractive maidens. (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) in need of me to take them out of anguish; the first (who would become a personality of Italian television) apparently has the ability to talk to the Little People (!)? who look amazingly like the little sisters of GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA (1964) !! So that they can swindle as many unused images of the first film as humanly possible, the divine villain quartet resurrects King Minos (William Berger again) from his dream skeleton and confronts him once again against his eternal enemy. Typically, Hercules is made to encounter a number of potentially deadly enemies, including a Gorgon. a tremendously underproduced sequence that should have led to a game of infallible plagiarism made the filmmakers behind the very superior CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) bother to watch this movie (complete with the same "reflection in a shield" that was presented and preceded by the muscular man who lets the public know about his tactics before executing them as if he were going to show us how smart he is)! And just to make it clear that he has his influences in the manga, Cozzi makes Hercules and Minos become a cosmic version of "King Kong vs. Godzilla" for one of his battles and, later, King Kong faces a Big snake, a meeting straight out of the original 1933 classic. I swear: this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth! <br /> <br /> As had been the case with the first film, the cast is full of old reliable characters, such as the aforementioned Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (as a sorcerer with a day of really bad hair) and even And coming starlets? not only Carlucci, but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (as younger Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and, once again, Eva Robbins (whose costume here easily surpasses her appearance in the first film); for what it's worth, Pino Donaggio's score for this is recycled from the musical signals that appear in his soundtrack of the previous film. If you've stayed in this review so far, you must have realized that this is one of those films that is so incredibly bad that a critic is forced to choose which course to take: dismiss it in an unflattering sentence or spend a quantity of time that does not deserve the dissection of its defects. I'm sure I've put aside some of his ineptitude, but I would not forgive him if I did not mention the strongest example of laughter in the whole movie that almost made me fall out of the chair (yes, he even overcame the aforementioned animated duel to me), that is, the decoration of the lair of the rebellious gods that has the shape of a giant marble boiler !! <br /> <br /> At this stage, one might well wonder why I gave this film (and its predecessor) a grade instead of a BOMBA (not entirely unjustified); In the past, I've had several lengthy online discussions about whether the star rating of a particular movie should reflect the overall artistic quality or its entertainment value? but these are two cases in which I consider it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter to establish my final qualification. I do not know: maybe it's because I'm in a "sword and sandal" mood right now (with 10 more respectable examples scheduled for the next few days!) But, after all, oddly enough for, I decided to add these two movies to my DVD collection just for the fun I had with them in this recent review? And that should only count for something, right?
