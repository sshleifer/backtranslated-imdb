All the way, even though I was thinking to myself "Oh God, why!" At first I thought "Right, it could be normal", but the acting and the plot in most parts was atrocious. <br /> <br /> Each part of it was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed to bear a strong resemblance to the ring, it was a decent half movie, but this seemed to take all the good things from the first and he made them terrible. Some fragments made everyone in the audience get wet, for example. The part where Geller fell off the building had me in stitches. My girlfriend had to tell me to shut up. They told me about what was going to happen next, and more times that less was right. <br /> <br /> Why does going to the house make her go for you? It does not make sense It was a bad excuse for many murders, and no depth was really seen. <br /> <br /> You can see everything that is coming, what leaves you with the feeling that there is no point in looking. Oh, she's behind her ... she did not see that you were coming * yawning *. <br /> <br /> Surely these people should have thought of ... Oh, I do not know, carry a knife around or at least try and fight, instead of being eaten but someone hair? At best, during the film I was a little scared (and I mean a little), I was just screaming for the credits, as they rolled I exhaled a brief "Oh, thank God". If you have not done it yet, do not waste your time and money on this; meaningless, plot less, sorry excuse for a sequel!
