The incident inside and outside Mountain Road is the entrance of Don Coscarelli in the series Masters of Horror by Mick Garris. Coscarelli is famous for being the man behind cult gems like the Phantasm series and the strange Bubba Ho-Tep; but it does not bring any of the qualities that made those great movies for this TV episode. The plot is a race of the mill that follows the routine idea of ​​an innocent pursued by a madman. This time, it's a young woman driving on a mountain road. After a head-on collision, she is harassed by a white-faced maniac. The whole chase sequence is really ridiculous, with the young lady who stops every so often to set traps; only for the maniac to appear seconds later, and this is cut with scenes that show her with her husband, who by chance has a lot of information on how to escape crazy killers; with lines like "expect the unexpected". The only highlight for me was the presence of Phusm's Tall Man, Angus Scrimm. Coscarelli does everything possible to implement as many horror images as possible; with things like a rotten corpse of a dead baby, but because everything is so dumb in general, it's hard to take this piece seriously. This is the first episode of the series, and the first I've seen; I really hope they improve.
