There have been some great television movies in that past. Epics such as "Roots" and "Lonesome Dove" come to mind. Category 6: Day of destruction will not be remembered for advancing in the cause of movies made for television. A ridiculously bad story, surpassed only by the horrible script, Cat6DD, as I like to call it, inspires more sympathy for the actors involved than the terror in nature that was supposed to take the film. That sound you hear during the movie is supposed to be the sound of the wind, but it's actually the Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy and Thomas Gibson (Greg, from the Dharma and Greg duo) racing plummeting faster than the houses, trucks and cows. You can fly away from one of the 15 tornadoes that we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The movie was announced as "nature has gone crazy", instead we get a boring story about how 15 different weather systems conspire to produce 150 days of degree in Chicago, then a snowstorm the day after a hurricane that it was combined in the Gulf of Mexico with a Canadian storm system, but in reality it had its origins in a stream of jets changed by global warming ... ENOUGH! It did not matter what the story was, the acting was terrible, the words the actors said were silly, and 13 scientists from all over the country had coronary arteries after hearing the dribble that came out of the movie. I did not care what happened to any of the characters, the special effects were sub-par, even by standards made for television, and the story lines made no sense. In general, I really do not like this "television event".
