I just heard "Goodbye to the king" on the cable, and maybe just because I'm a girl, but I thought this was on the craptastic side. The script and the direction are pretentious (once I discovered that John Milius was responsible, everything was clear). The supporting actors were not really bad, James Fox was outstanding. The biggest disappointment was Nick Nolte, whom I generally enjoy. Once he becomes a native, he begins to speak very rigid and forced English, and half the time he seems distracted, as if he had just smoked something of the bounty of Borneo's rainforest. And then the end - What is it? It turns out that Learoyd is in the same boat as The Botanist (by the way, has the Botanist thrown out the bride, or what?) The ship has just run aground conveniently near a mature takeover of the island by a crazy defector from Anglo headhunters?
