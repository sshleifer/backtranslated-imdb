In a world full of movies, like "You Got Served", that surprises you with its huge mistakes, you would never think that there would be worse movies ... until now. Ron Hall's "Vampire Assassins" do more than cheese. KNOW you're angry with that. First: there are no murderers in this movie. In fact, there is only one good guy fighting in the whole movie. Second: the location ... is basically a location: the house of some jackass (or basement, it's up to you). Third: special effects (expressed abruptly) can kiss my ass. Fourth: the performance exceeds "Plan 9 of outer space" in the category of worst performance in history. Ron Hall can not act to save his life. Finally (and definitely not the smallest problem): THE EDITION. The person who edited this movie hopes he never finds it. The cuts and shots are HORRENDOS !!!! Other problems: Lighting (virtually none), the fact that the guy on the cover is not even in the movie, and the fact that this movie exists. <br /> <br /> To summarize this movie, simply say that I tortured the DVD copy before going back to the Hollywood video (do not worry, I used the MVP membership, so it was free!). NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE!
