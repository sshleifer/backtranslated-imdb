Ty Cobb is by far the most interesting and belligerent athlete in history. His career in baseball had no parallel in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy and pure violence without adulteration. Every game he played in was a show of human skill and cruelty. So, of course, the film about him does not deal with any of that, but focuses on the writing of his biography by the author Al Stump. Now, this is not such a horrible idea in theory, as Cobb himself slipped further into paranoid dementia as the years went by and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as an older person are shocking even by standards desensitized today. But instead of focusing on these events, which I think were simply too interesting, the film is a pseudo-fictional road movie with cliche, a clich√© argument that will make any Cobb fanatic cry tears of vinegar. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones does quite well as Cobb, but somehow he manages to exaggerate his cartoon animation. Most of the stories about Cobb are hardly credible, but making it even more crazy seems impossible and unnecessary. Robert Wuhl, who plays the writer Al Stump, is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent. He sucks the life out of each scene, trying to make this movie his own Nagasaki. There is a reason why we never see him as an important man (Arliss does not count, it's just a show). Even the inevitable "reversal of roles" of Cobb and Stump at the end is worsened by his sheer inability to utter words that do not sound like a bad book in the voice of tape narration. <br /> <br /> Despite all the horrible writing and insipid filming on display, there is a sequence that stands out as being superior to the rest of this flaw, which is almost impossible to accept from the same movie. A hypersilized flashback sequence that shows Cobb's overwhelming psychology and brutal athleticism while playing baseball is pure brilliance. The camera moves strangely and the whole event looks like a dream due to the unique playing style of the Cobb monster. Each slip, hit and tackle become even more blunt due to the improved sound, and Tommy Lee Jones OWNS the intensity of the master player. It makes the viewer revel in the possibilities of a true Cobb biopic at its best with the same actor. It's worth watching the movie just for these incredible minutes, just to see what could have been. <br /> <br /> It may be a little unfair with this movie because of my own knowledge of Ty Cobb and wanting it to be something that it is not, but making a movie so boring and married about this maniac makes no sense. I'm glad that Ron Shelton's career has slipped since then.
