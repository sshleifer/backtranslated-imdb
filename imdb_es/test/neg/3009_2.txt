Most of the films that I really like are those of the house of art and rarely appear in the top ten list at the box office. That said, I found "Northfork" completely incomprehensible. I have no idea what it was. When writing in the New York Times about a different film, Stephen Holden once observed that some people seem to think that they can throw anything on the screen and that it works like a fairy tale. I thought about that revision several times while watching "Northfork". <br /> <br /> On a scale of one to ten, I gave him a two.
