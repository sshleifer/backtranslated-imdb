Against my own better judgment, I went to see this movie today, and God, I wish I had not. Horrible. The first AvP movie looks like a classic compared to this, it's SO bad. These guys really make Paul WS Anderson look like a master narrator. In fact, this is what I would expect to see an Alien and / or Predator movie if it were made by Uwe Boll. This movie really offended me, and Lord only knows what would happen if Ridley Scott or HR Giger were forced to see this shit. I can not understand how any fan of any of the franchises could like this movie. <br /> <br /> I really do not know where to start. I mean, the first AvP was pooping, but at least it's a semi-interesting story and scenario, and sometimes some genuine tension. He did not take himself too seriously and at least he could enjoy himself almost exclusively as "leave your brain at home." But this, it seemed to me that the people behind him thought they were doing the next masterpiece of terror. One after another was a scene of artificial "suspense" in a dark room or in a corridor with spooky music, essentially hitting the head saying "be scared right NOW". As James Cameron once said, you can not be told to be scared, you can only increase your own senses. The guys who made this movie, obviously, did not pay attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to be afraid instead of letting you reach that level yourself. It's a clich√© for internet nerds to say "God, I was so bored of this movie and I wanted to go", well, that's how I felt, even in the middle of the action scenes. They took this film totally seriously, which eliminated any possibility of enjoyment. Even the joke about how governments do not lie to their people was played without a hint of irony. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, I knew that human characters were going to be completely useless for this. Film, but seriously, if they are going to be on the screen, at least make them do SOMETHING that is relevant to the story. I do not care that this boy is beaten by the boyfriend of his dream girl, I do not care the mother that "her own daughter does not even know her, boo." (A pair of night vision goggles for a gift? Give me a break!) Or the freed criminal who is trying to make a decent living and give an example to his brother, what kind. Hell, even the mandatory moment of hot-chick-in-panties was more artificial than usual. I have the feeling that they expected the audience to be so surprised by the end, as to see the stevedores get out of the children, the future mothers raped and so on, that would make up for everything. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Then we went to the stars of the movie, and again very little to highlight. Were the aliens well designed? I would not have a clue because you can never see the damn things. All he sees is one of a mouth, a head, a tail or a really unreliable cg contour going up a wall, and barely enough to process what is actually an extraterrestrial before Mr. "I cut Marilyn Manson and NIN music videos, think I'll do the same here "The editor does it with the division tool. Also, do you look at how pirate action directors always put their movies at night and in the rain? Hmmmm The Predator may have been fighting giant sea monkeys for all we knew! Yes, the Predator was more impressive this time, and I thought some of the new weapons were great, but that was all. Also, since when does a Predator sound like a dinosaur from The Lost World? However, there were a couple of things that I liked a little. One was the use of the sound effects and music of the original movies (I also laughed a bit at "Get in the helicopter!"), Although other references were stupid (the main character's name is Dallas, give me a break ). I also liked the visual effects for the Predator's vision, as well as the aspect of the hybrid alien (no doubt beat the Resurrection). But really, those are the only positive things. <br /> <br /> In general, I found this film inanimate, meaningless, insulting and, above all, offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures. That they have left the door open so that another one leaves me almost depressed. <br /> <br /> If they had any decency, they would eliminate Dan O'Bannon, Ron Schusett and HR Giger from the credits of this film. They have not done anything to deserve this.
