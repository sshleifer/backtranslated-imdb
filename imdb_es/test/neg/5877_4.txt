You can see that if the movie is not directed by his brother, this is the best he can do. And sad to say, your best effort just does not cut it. "Ice Cream Man" is a very strange horror movie, it's a real wonder to see if you're in a good mood. In a bad mood, people are known to violently attack their loved ones, so please observe with caution. <br /> <br /> The stars of Clint Howard (Is there really something starring Clint Howard?) As the "evil" "psychotic" "strange" (Yes, everything in quotes, it's none of this, but it is approaching) ice cream man, who tortures local children with bombs that are really melty and ice cream that have been broken humans and dogs in them. Ick. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot is just an excuse to show the ... well, the ... um, well, it's an argument. Oh, wait, I know! It's an excuse to show off all the cameos of the losing actors! Are Jan Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II (the sequel?) Like policemen tracking the elusive man or 'ice cream'. And even Doug Lleyweln appears as an employee of a supermarket. <br /> <br /> Even better than that, are some of the strange mistakes in the movie. I really like the fact that, for some reason, instead of hiring a fat actor to play the unhappy "fat" group, they only have this child carry stuffing under his clothes. And the whole premise that anyone would do it by ice cream balls of an ice cream man. Who buys scoops of ice cream from the ice cream man? Then there is the whole scene of the psychiatric ward, in which the performance of Jan Michael Vincent goes from slightly interested, to boring beyond the state of consciousness. These are the policemen who also track the place of the Ice Cream Man in search of clues, but manage to complete the luster on the ice cream truck (where, of course, the various bodies and others are kept). Oh, well, better luck the next time the troops. <br /> <br /> Howard himself exaggerates as if making sure that people in two villages can see and hear him. Everything is simply silly. And quite fun to laugh in the fine tradition of The Pumaman or Gymkata. You'll have a good laugh with the right sense of HUMOR. I love that one <br /> <br />
