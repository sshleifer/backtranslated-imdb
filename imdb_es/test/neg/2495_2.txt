I have read almost all the important books about the Manhattan Project. Most people know what it was, but few people understand the depth and breadth of the project. Its reach was immensely massive, rivaling the history of the USA. UU Maybe only because of the space program of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There were, literally, MILLIONS of people involved from all walks of life in numerous places (mostly clandestine) throughout the country, each one involved in a specific and different aspect of the project that could not refer to the person sitting in the cubicle with them, let alone their family. The logistics are overwhelming, especially considering the considerations of communication, safety and transportation during the war in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> As an example, my colleague's father was a carpenter who worked for one of the companies that had a contract with the federal government for the Manhattan Project. His job was to supervise a crew of about 30 other carpenters, who were responsible for making concrete pouring forms for the massive research facilities in Hanford, Washington. That's "everything" he did, six days a week for almost two years. These carpenters needed food, housing, sanitary facilities, hospitals and materials, as did Oppenheimer and his people at the top of the pyramid. Just think about it! That said, it's simply impossible to do justice to the subject in a 2-hour movie. In defense of Joffe, however, I would say that they had an impossible task, particularly because he chose to have a diverse script with multiple arguments, multiple angles and multiple characters. What exactly did he think, and how could he be so arrogant in thinking that this would work? I think that's Hollywood. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY has so many flaws that it would take a book to list them all. Horrible casting. Terrible (and politically motivated) writing. Bad science The representations of Groves and Oppie are particularly inaccurate and frankly annoying. Despite the script's all too obvious agenda, STILL is incredibly insipid and sloppy. <br /> <br /> These flaws have been included elsewhere in IMDb, but I was especially surprised that the scientists had so much time. in their hands: softball, horseback riding, parties, semi-formal dinners, ballet, etc., not to mention the romance and, of course, the political requests in circulation. According to FM & LB, if these big brains had gotten out of their duffs and spent some time in the lab instead of seducing Laura Dern, we could have won the war before D-Day. <br /> <br /> One final complaint: - FM & LB mentions that "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" were the code names of the two atomic bombs, but does not mention that these names were a semi-kind blow in Groves ("Fat Man", for heavy stature ) and Oppenheimer ("Little Boy", for his slight stature). Another reason why Paul Newman should not have been in this movie ...
