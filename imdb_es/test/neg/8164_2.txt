I love movies, all genres and from big dollar shows to small independent projects. But even taking into account that this piece of scrap is 25 years old and its attempt to pay homage to the 1950s, it only suffers almost one aspect for which we judge movies. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I remembered several "student films", I have had the opportunity to see, efforts where creativity is required to fill the gaps where funds are needed. <br /> <br /> In general, there may be 90% better uses in your life. <br /> <br /> 2/10
