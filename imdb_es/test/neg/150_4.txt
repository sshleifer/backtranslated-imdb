It is not as well made as the "Guinea Pig" films of which he was inspired ("Flowers of Flesh and Blood" or "Devil's Experiment") and does not convey any real philosophy, this feature of the video, which is barely long, adds hardcore sex (With mosaic censor) to his inspiration. Special make-up effects, which include cutting and peeling the stomach, are pretty good, if they're endured. The amateur feeling of production is a distraction. Everything looks cheap and lazy. The lighting is hard and the sound and editing are neglected. The simple story involves a porn actress who ends up starring in a real snuff movie. Just when she gets tired of being abused, the real abuse begins. In the scene of the hero of the film, an actor cuts the stomach of the woman in a graphic close-up, puts inside his member and proceeds to do his thing. I did not find "Psycho - The Snuff Reels" shocking. On the contrary, I found that it was a desperate attempt on the part of fans of a "Guinea Pig" and its bloody blood. Interestingly, this was distributed by Aroma, a leading fetish producer.
