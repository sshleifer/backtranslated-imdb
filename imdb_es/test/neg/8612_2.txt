First of all, I admit that I have not seen Vampires: The Dead, but I've seen the original Vampire movie and I love it. I rented this movie without having heard anything about it. I did not expect to be impressed. It was not. <br /> <br /> I love the idea of ​​changing the action to the Far East, which should have opened up a lot of new avenues for the action sequences and the story line, but not enough. I was made of this. . The fighting scenes and the motorcycle chases were painfully boring. <br /> <br /> There were some parts that I liked, such as how the killer team did not show up as good heroic guys, like in the first movie. <br /> <br /> I had been waiting since I saw Hammer's old movie, The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires a few years ago, someone would one day make another good vampire movie based in Asia. This was not all.
