Fatal contact: bird flu in America: 3 out of 10: this movie is funny and sad at the same time. The fun part is pretty obvious, since it certainly is not a sober look at a possible impending crisis. This is a modern version of The Swarm. And like those killer bees (and the so-called killer bees crisis that caused them), bird flu joined a pantheon of scenarios inspired by the end of the world (SARS, Y2K, Global Warming) that simply refuse to make reality. /> <br /> The sad part is the flagrant attempt of the filmmakers to inspire panic. Pandemics of diseases were historically quite common after all people did not die at forty due to heart disease. Even recent pandemics, such as AIDS, reflect the old VD crisis (Think syphil) that used to kill more soldiers than bullets. <br /> <br /> The flu pandemic of the early twenties was an unpleasant affair that killed millions, but honestly life went on. I wonder if our more dramatic media and power-hungry government allies would allow such a normal life nowadays. <br /> <br /> The film itself deviates violently from quite competent scenes (Triage at the Great Central Station) to the ridiculous (Rednecks try to ambush the National Guard in Manhattan). <br /> <br /> The scenarios themselves are quite useless, as the filmmakers do not seem to decide exactly how contagious the bird flu is or whether the symptoms are an Ebola-style collision or just a long illness. In fact, one scene will show everyone in biohazard costumes and the next nobody will have to wear a mask. <br /> <br /> The film also refuses to give practical advice on what to do in an avian flu crisis. . (Outside of washing your hands, what is a tape?) The acting and direction are competent for a television movie, but the script is on the entire map. Finally, the movie has a strangely non-exponential total of deaths that runs at the bottom of the screen. As did the Swarm.
