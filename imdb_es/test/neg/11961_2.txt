I saw the first scarecrow movie and I did not take it out, although I knew it was a bachelor who actually had some decent blood and the guy who was playing the scarecrow was an amazing acrobat and had good skills. The effects were better and the disguise looked much better than this movie. <br /> <br /> I borrowed this with an open mind, I am also a fan of ken shamrock (former UFC Superfight champion) and I hoped it would be like that. a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I was wrong, the movie was bad, the monster was pathetic in its appearance and it was really scary, the story was so predictable that it was like watching the movie in preview mode, since I already I imagine what will happen, the music was so bad, with a horrible lip sync song that made me want to mark the screen. <br /> <br /> In general, avoid this fucking movie. <br /> <br /> Save some money.
