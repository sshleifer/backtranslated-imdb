Shot in my old hometown by a couple of college students, this film centers around a monster called "luther". Luther, recently on probation (revealed by a parole board that discusses one of the most incredible scenes of all time), goes crazy at the local Kroger store by eating the neck of an old woman with her metal teeth . <br /> <br /> Luther runs to the farm where he eats a boy, steals a car, ties an old woman, is persecuted and killed. Oh, and the girl from the TV show SUPERBOY gets naked.
