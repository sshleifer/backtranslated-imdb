The book of revelations begins very well. Daniel, an egomaniac dancer is kidnapped, mistreated and sexually raped by three masked women. <br /> <br /> After that, nothing else really happens. There are some signs of rediscovery, but the film gives neither explanation nor a real ending. Daniel's reactions after the abuse are very basic. He stops dancing, has sex with all women and finally begins a relationship with a very simple and common woman. <br /> <br /> I have seen a good part of the art films, but this has something that was missing. <br /> <br /> The main cables are fine; But some characters do not seem to be completely defined.
