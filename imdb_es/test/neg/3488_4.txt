One thing I've noticed about the British horror films of the 1970s is that they do not just see each other again and again. THEATER OF BLOOD is an example of this, as are all those Amicus anthology films. Add THE WEDDING BEAST TO THE LIST <br /> <br /> Much of the drama in this film revolves around the accumulation of a revelation of the plot at the end. Once you know what the revelation is, this becomes a fairly flat movie. It opens with a pretty good hook, but after that we deal with long, boring sequences of two old women who talk in low voices. Correct me if I'm wrong, but how many people watch a horror movie waiting for a couple of old women talking in low voices? The only type of interest that can be found in THE BEAST IN THE WINERY is the anti-tobacco stance. Some people have mentioned that it is a film against war or against the military, but look closely and you will see that every time a squadron is turned on for a puff of fly, they kill it. Rather strange considering that smoking attitudes were not as hysterical as they are today
