Ru Paul plays a secret agent called Starrbooty. She joins another drag queen agent to fight the evil Annaka Manners (Candis Cayne) and recover her kidnapped niece ... or something like that. Seriously ... I had trouble concentrating on the plot! Apparently, the movie is directed by someone with severe ADD: fast camera cuts that prevent him from focusing on anything. The dialogue is incomprehensible at times and when you listen to it, you wish it was still incomprehensible! The acting is actually pretty good, except Ru Paul, who exaggerates to an embarrassing degree. Also, the movie is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is simply disgusting and not even remotely fun. After 30 minutes I had to leave because I was bored, sick and I could not take it anymore. I take pride in sitting through anything, but this goes beyond my limits! People are comparing this with the initial work of John Waters. I do not agree. Waters' work is sick but it's good, he's just sick. Avoid.
