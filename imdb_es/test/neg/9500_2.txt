Yah I know. It has the name "Sinatra" in the title, so how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, trust me! I rented this thinking it was a movie I missed in theaters. It is not. It's a "movie" of garbage made by people on Showtime (cable station). Wow, these cable stations earn a few dollars and they think they can make the garbage movies they want! Not good. I'm a Sinatra fan as big as any sane man, but this movie was just dumb. Boring. Boring. Unfunny Uninteresting. The only redeeming quality is that (assuming they adhered to the facts) you do learn about what happened to the captors of Frank Jr. Otherwise, it's just a stupid movie.
