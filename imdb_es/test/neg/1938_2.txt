I have not seen all the episodes of Jackass. It was a little entertaining if nothing else was going on. But after seeing Jackass # 2 I liked Bam and Dunn. They had a good attitude in the movie, so I thought I would tune into the Bam. Chico was wrong Seriously, you could put together a group of 2 'degrees, give them the same budget and I bet they could achieve something more creative on the screen. I mean, C'Mon MTV !! At age 23, where most people are tuned in, you give us this crap. <br /> <br /> Everything seems so forced. You do not know the characters because there is no attitude. You can not appreciate Bam or Dunn, or anyone, for that matter. If only there was a small and small amount of thoughts. Everything we will not forget as soon as the next shot is started. <br /> <br /> They finally manage to create a good shot and you like what is happening. You sit there, waiting for your reaction, and then an imbecile closes the scenes with two boring phrases and bang. Was that the closing of that shot or what, please? If I had been there I would go crazy and laugh. Do some crazy things and make my adrenaline jump, but these guys ... Only stupid reactions with a script. <br /> <br /> Yes, they get some laughter from the public for cheap jokes or gigantic jokes that, in my opinion, are such a waste of cash. <br /> <br /> Many normal humans who were not captured under the Jackass wing could write a much more fun script in an instant. Or impress with visual camera work. Even the spontaneous aspirants, the great guys without a script would get a better job. MTV could on a whim bring more soothing material on the screen. You just have to fire the writer of this stupid show. <br /> <br /> Some scenes require a bit of courage and, therefore, 2 stars.
