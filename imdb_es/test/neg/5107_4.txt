When I heard for the first time that there was going to be a videogame of The World is not enough for the Nintendo 64, I was so excited. When it finally came out, I was one of the first to rent it. I rented it for 7 days, and I exceeded the whole game !!! The game was easy and he gave too many tips. A majestic disappointing GoldenEye sequel. Follow my advice and DO NOT RENT THIS GAME. <br /> <br /> Surely the guns and the devices are great, but one gets tired of a watch that seems to have been taken from GoldenEye with the exception of being a red one. color instead of blue, a bad excuse for a dart gun, a horrible stunner and a stupid hook hook that can only be attached to things that are yellow and black. This game instead of EA, which should stick to games that do well, such as sports games, should get away from first-person shooters and let teachers do the work.
