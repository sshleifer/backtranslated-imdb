He had potential ... he really did. But there's a lot about the movie that was ridiculous and ridiculous. I'm a fucking horror movie and I thought I was stupid; like my 13 year old son! I expected to be at least scared. And, yes, the coarse factor of the twisting vines in the people was there; however, the previous path to reach the ruins is simply silly, foolish, silly. <br /> <br /> I mean who goes hiking ... in a jungle ... with a total stranger ... With a little water and some sandwiches ... IN FLIP FLOPS, NOT LESS? Puh-lease! Better yet, who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an interpreter or can not speak a little of the language? Are these people complete idiots? <br /> <br /> Does the German's brother have no news and does not ask for help? Who does not do that? Did you just find some Greeks and Americans to go find and find?
