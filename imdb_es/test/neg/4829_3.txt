The speed that I think is a direct copy of the Hollywood movie (I have not seen it) gives the impression of a test match that is very exciting in the first four days, but in the end it ends up in a very boring drawing. Today I saw this movie on January 12, 2008 in rented VCD. The release date is October 19, 2007. But fortunately for me, I did not know or hear much about this movie, except that it is a failure at the box office. So in this situation when I see the film, I feel that this movie could have been a very good one, but then the director falls back into the trap of the Bollywood traditions and has lost a very good opportunity. <br /> <br /> Of course, like a Bhatt movie, it should be copied from another place. But now days do not matter to me, if I have not seen the original movie. I just found the main theme very similar to 'Nick of Time' and 'Badshah'. In the film, Sanjay Suri is shown an intelligence agent, but his wife believes he is a chef. This brings back the memory of 'True-Lies'. The only new part was the use of the telephone. But that I also discovered is now taken from the movie Cellular. So, when you make a movie with the mix of so many other movies, the future is quite clear. <br /> <br /> What I like about the movie is its rhythm. As the name suggests, things really happen fast, and there's not much time to think between the scenes. But this is broken in the last 20 minutes, so the film presents the traditional Bollywood style of Dhishum dhishum. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is also quite interesting. Three parallel stories, one after the other. One of the kidnappings of Urmila, the other of the Zayed that tried to help Urmila, and then the assassination plan of the prime minister. These three stories mix naturally when the movie continues. <br /> <br /> But very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style have killed the spirit of the movie. Except Sanjay Suri, nobody else impresses. This is true even for Urmila, who always promises in RGV films. Due to this ordinary performance, some scenes do not really convey the feelings that the director wanted. E.g. The scene at the end where Urmila leaves all hope and cuts the phone, should have had a good impact. But instead, we simply wait for the end of that scene. <br /> <br /> Besides acting, a little unnecessary love for style demoralizes the movie. Showing such good villains is good for Hollywood movies, not for Bollywood. The London fund is also just for style and you can not see a big smart advantage of this fund. Especially in the end, all those dhishhum-dhishhum were absolutely unnecessary. It may be that the director has the impression that the climax in Hindi films should have such fights. They look unrealistic, increase the duration of the film and ensure that people leave the cinema before the film ends. <br /> <br /> Again and again, the movie can be seen once. If it comes on television or you can get it in the rent, it's fine. But again, make sure you have the remote button and the forward button at hand. Next time, when the movie is on TV, you can see other channels safely.
