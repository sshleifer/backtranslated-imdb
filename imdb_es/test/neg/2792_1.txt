Bad script? Check. Terrible effects? Check. Horrible actors? Check. Lick address? Verify <br /> <br /> After seeing the DVD box in a highly successful video and being a fan of the horror genre, I placed my $ 4.28 on the line and rented this "movie". My girlfriend was out of town and bored me, so on Tuesday night I decided it would be the perfect time to see, what appeared to be (based on the cover) a horror movie. What I got instead was the worst movie ever made. Until that moment, he had always declared "Slumber Party Massacre 3" the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> If you're the type who wants to see a movie because you heard how bad it is, this is for you. If you do not want to lose $ 4.00 and 80 irreplaceable minutes of your life, stay away from this trash. <br /> <br /> An additional note: I noticed that some of the "actors" come here and post comments. on the bulletin board. How can you boast of being in this movie? All of you were horrible. I mean very badly. If there was an American Idol for the actors, they will laugh at you in the first episodes. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Sutter Cain
