Check out the 3 series again and do not go see this movie, the trailer is completely deceitful and the 3 weakest characters in the series extend a 25 minute TV episode badly thought in the most painful 2 hours of my life, a movie really horrible tubbs and edward are in this for a few minutes, micky has 1 line, and his lipp has just rolled up the same old tired word games, also the mr briss accent changes about 5 times in the movie tons of badly acted extras, and really Some laughs that seem to be recycled for 2 hours. Honestly, I feel that this series has been completely ruined by this terrible crap shit .......... Batman and Robin, everything is forgiven.
