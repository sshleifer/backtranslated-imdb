Typical food of Steven Seagal: it sucks. The plot is based on a series of incredibly improbable coincidences; there is a heavy dose of conspiracy theory that would be much more acceptable if we did not know that Seagal takes everything literally; and once again, the multimillion-dollar movie Seagal tells us all about the ills of The Rich. <br /> <br /> The survival of Seagal is based, as usual, on the fact that Bad Guys never shoots his weapons from the reach arm, and I always like to give a short speech of "I'll kill you" before blowing a man's head. <br /> <br /> Watch this right after the worst * Fire Down Below * and notice how the carpet in the Keenen Ivory Wayans apartment is more flammable than a large puddle of gasoline. <br /> <br /> Oh, and look at the scene of the final fight the Incredible Disappearance of the Wound of the Forehead, which is probably the most entertaining thing in the world. movie.
