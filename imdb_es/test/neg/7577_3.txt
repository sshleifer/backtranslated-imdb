I have seen many Japanese horrorfilms and I have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are all more or less the same. This is no exception. The ghost is a black haired girl, who scares her victims by doing nothing but walking and looking dead ... the difference is just the reason for the obsession. the rest is the same as in all occasions: black haired girl, strange things that happen with some means (photos), creepy performances. While watching this movie, I constantly wondered why I was wasting my time seeing things that someone else had done much better before. Some scenes were quite good, however, I will give 3 of 10
