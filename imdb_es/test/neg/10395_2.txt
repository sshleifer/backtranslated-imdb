I just rented Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the cover and the images looked terrifying, and I usually do not see movies that are automatically released on DVD, but I found this very interesting and scary! I was very in the mood for a good scary movie and for me, possession is one of the most fearsome topics to watch or learn. Just look at The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose, both great movies that made breakthroughs not only in horror, but also in history. <br /> <br /> Blackwater Valley Exorcism is about a girl, Isabelle, who from The Go Go automatically owns herself, so we can not even say what kind of person she was to start with. But is an ex-wife beater turned priest in the case with a gardener ...? I know that I know. Then they go into other stories with the priest and Isabella's sister, and the priest hit the sister and got into Isabelle? I'm not sure, then we go into a story with Isabelle's father and his questioning of his wife's fidelity to him. <br /> <br /> I mean, the story just takes too many directions and it was not well developed. absolutely. Not to mention that the exorcism did not seem authentic at all and more than just scare your pants with the kind of movie, which I did not like at all because I could not take it seriously. Whoever directed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to direct the story well, so I really would not recommend it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
