Greetings, movie fans! While watching Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus / Croc / Dino Horror genre. Many viewers can blame the bad performance, the meaningless script or the poorly constructed plot as the reasons that make the TOC movie weak. These reasons can be factors of difficulty, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming a TOC movie that is at the heart of the limp. <br /> <br /> You see, technology does not yet exist to make a realistic image. The full-size TOC and CGI technology currently used by studios lack the ability to integrate seamlessly with real-world environments and characters. Even with intelligent cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea / semi-dark forest / semi-dark cave / semi-dark corridor so many times before the science fiction fan gets bored of the genre completely (the TOC subgenre, that is. <br /> <br /> What can be done, questions? I would not suggest that the genre surrenders to cheese, but it is necessary to explore another way. We can not really go back to the days of the "Fade -to-Black "indicating that someone has been killed, or can we? If we can not reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, insinuations and photographic ingenuity. <br /> <br /> It will be through ingenious and alternative methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the subgenus OCD, will be cured.
