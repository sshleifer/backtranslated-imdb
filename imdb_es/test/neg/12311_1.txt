Holy cow, what a piece of shit this movie is. I did not know how these filmmakers could take a 250-word book and turn it into a movie. I guess they did not know either! I do not remember any farting or belching in the book, right? <br /> <br /> They took all this children's classic of all time, added some farts, belches and sexual inuindo, and prostituted it in a KAKA joke. This should give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood producers think. I must say that it was visually interesting, but the brilliant visual history is ruined by the humor of the toilet (if you think that kind of thing is funny) I do not want the children I know to think that it is. <Br /> <br /> Do not take your children to see, do not rent the DVD. I hope the ghost of Doctor Suess Ghost comes and chases the people who made this movie.
