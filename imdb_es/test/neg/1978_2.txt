Pretty pictures and many fights are not a good movie. And that is precisely what happened here. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me admit that I am still about to play FFVII (I intend to ask soon). However, I did an investigation to familiarize myself with the characters and the story. However, not everyone has the luxury of time to investigate things like this, and Advent Children requires knowledge of FFVII. <br /> <br /> Despite incredible images, I can not say there are too many things. new. We have seen it in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and apart from a better movement, I can not say that they have done many super daring things with this. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes - Well, they're a bit of fun. Still, how could we doubt the outcome of any of them? This was a boring classic: there were three fights with the bad guys, following the standard procedure (the hero, Cloud, is crushed, then almost comes and crushes, and finally wins). The reason why I say it was a boring classic was that it is used a lot, but in this case it is badly executed. I will refer to that later. <br /> <br /> The dubbing in English seemed good to me, although I did not see it in Japanese, so I will not judge the doubled in Japanese, but only English. I will say this: I have heard many better ones, even in my limited repertoire. <br /> <br /> And now, the plot. Ummm ... what plot? Let me be frank, this movie is just a service for fans, the opportunity to see the characters of FFVII on the big screen with lovely eyes. As I said before, fights seem to happen for no reason. The opening fight is never explained, Kadaj seems to have no ambition to destroy the world or a real motivation to do something unpleasant. Cloud feels depressed throughout the film, and almost everyone else gets a mandatory cameo. <br /> <br /> Actually, FFVII was a piece of set. The children of Advent is anything less. If they had managed to give everyone a meaningful role in the story (Star Trek: The first contact showed that it was possible, I might add), then this could have been much better. Naturally, that would also have changed the plot, which, let's be honest, is almost ready to be better than the one we got. <br /> <br /> The characters in general were either not used or practically forgotten. Avalanche members (that is, the group that Cloud worked with in FFVII, for those who do not know) get 2 scenes (3 in the case of Vincent Valentine, and some get even less). Hell, the bad guys have more lines than these guys, and that's pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The music ... well, I do not care if Nobuo Uematsu is God himself, he ruined this movie. hour. Advent One Winged Angel was the only decent piece. Otherwise, I could not decide whether to be epic (and orchestral) or funny (with an electric guitar). When you switched from one to the other, you felt as if you had taken a hammer in your head. <br /> <br /> And that last point about whether this movie was epic or funny ... Sean tried both, and failed miserably. Honestly, you can not please everyone and do everything. The movie also tried to be profound (you can be epic and deep, or fun and deep, but all three are too much), but it also failed here. The last scene, reminiscent of a baptism ceremony, was thrown there for what seems to be the reason for it. You do not need to be a Christian to just shake your head and cry there. That scene just did not belong to the movie (and not to the frequent appearances of Aerith, she's dead, Jim!). <br /> <br /> Considering how fantastic I've heard of Final Fantasy VII, this movie is nothing. less a gigantic disappointment. Due to the beautiful images, I give it a 2 out of 10.
