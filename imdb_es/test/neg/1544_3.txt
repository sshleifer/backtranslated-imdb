It's hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now it seems that he only does it "by the numbers" of Hollywood thrillers. <br /> <br /> This is a very light material of John Grisham, crossed with the plot of a television movie. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a criminal and independent investigator specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is his reserved police partner, Sam Kennedy, and together they form an uncomfortable duo. Not good, when two unbalanced university maladriots (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them on a wild goose chase - planting very clever and deceptive forensic evidence at the crime scene. <br /> <br /> Fair enough, but while Bullock and Chaplin can not create sparks, we also have to endure several melodramatic flashbacks that illustrate an important event in Cass's story. Then, of course, there are the frequent takes of a log cabin on the cliff side where there is no doubt that the OTT end will be established. Oooh ... the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Instead, watch any episode of CSI. It is to the point and much more exciting.
