After consuming "Human Chork Chop" and digesting it correctly, I felt urged and obliged to inform potential viewers, that chewing this product is NOT FUN and its substance of low nutritional value. <br /> <br /> According to the boring nature of this movie, the following will be a WARNING rather than a REVIEW. This is the first time I want there to be a "I do not care at the speed of this movie" button in IMDB, because the only reaction to this boring part of TRASH is stasis and indifference. All possible classifications would do an injustice with all the other elements listed here, anyway a "10" is out of the question, "1" could persuade some readers that this is one of those cases where "it's so bad" which is really VERY bad. " that's very good! ", and" 5 "is also unsatisfactory, people might think, it's a good movie and it's fine if you want to have fun with a little cheese, which is not ... Honestly for God, it's not even a" 10 ", a zero or a 5, it's nothing, a black hole, A STRONG JOB CONCEIVED BY AN EMBRYO.I bought the region 3 DVD, which was cheap (7 dollars!) At least and of good image quality, I bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews posted below my own entry Oh boy, if I was going to be disappointed This movie is neither shocking nor disgusting nor disconcerting nor ... it's not even ridiculous, it's not taken too seriously, but it is serious enough not to be funny, a truly passionate, amateurish effort, the only sequence I found when MILDLY DISTURBING is when two bullies who laugh, put an ugly dog ​​in a bag and hit him against a brick wall. .. but even such a cruel premise just cond It leads to poor execution. The lower it is quoted TOILET SCENE is unreal and filmed without any sense for suspense, suffering or humiliation: the feces look like painted marshes! There is a butchery scene at the end of a long 85 minutes where three men dressed in plastic raincoats (a configuration also found on the DVD cover) begin to get rid of the female body. It reminded me of "American Psycho" and "Shallow Grave", now it's worth seeing these movies and true masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Let's be REALISTIC for once and do not rush to make a myth with every aspiring Asian. scary-movie, as it seems to happen lately ... <br /> <br /> If you're looking for some oriental horror, try Danny Lee's masterpiece about the same title (in English) "Ba Xian fan dian zhi ren rou cha shao bao "(Human pork chop) is from 1992 and has been compared, not without reason, compared to" Henry: Portrait of a serial killer ". There is also a similar film that tells the same story of a different film crew called "Ren tou dou fuu shang" ("There is a secret in my soup") of the same year, a kind of rival production. It is available as a DVD of Region 3 and for the majority it is considered superior to "Peng shi zhi sang jin tian liang". I could add a few more words about the special effects ... what special effects?!? ... there are some severed limbs, they look horrible, in a wrong sense, probably "Made in Hong Kong". <Br /> <br /> This is all the information I can share on this subject, hopefully it will be useful ... ENJOY YOUR FOOD!
