It seems there was some money behind this movie, but it would be impossible to imagine a film so badly planned and executed if I had not started watching it. <br /> <br /> To begin with, once we're in the cavern with the characters (the usual stereotypes of young adults we've been meeting in horror movies since the early 1980s), the film was filmed almost in its entirety in the foreground. Since the actors wear helmet lights, this means that all we see are dazzling lights that alternate with absolute darkness, we never see what the characters see; So when they shout "Look there!" They let us pray "What ?! Where ?!" Ultimately, the movie has a nauseating and confusing effect of strobe light, meaningless until we reach the end. <br /> <br /> And I will not tell you what 'the end' means, but you will. Recognize if you have ever seen the former Arch Hall's Laughter Festival "Eegah!" with Richard Kiel. <br /> <br /> But how crazy would you like to make a variation on a song like "Eegah!", long remembered as one of the worst movies ever made? But that's what we have here, friends. Except that, unlike "Eegah!", "The Cavern" is not an idea of ​​silly fun for anyone. It is unappealable. (I did it at x2 at normal speed, just to get over it, hoping to see something at the end of the movie, but when I did, it was stupid). This movie gave me a satisfying moment, however; Since it only cost a couple of dollars, after removing it from the DVD player, I was able to break it with my own hands, what a relief!
