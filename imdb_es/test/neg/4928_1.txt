I just watched this movie at the Fantasy Filmfest BERLIN. I'm not impressed <br /> <br /> As for the story. Brides also return from their vacations in Mexico. While they wait for their luggage, they meet a couple of children, who then take the last one and, of course, the wrong bus to the city. On board there is also another older man, so portrayed in a strange way that you instantly assume he is one of the bad guys. The other is the driver. <br /> <br /> The ferry takes them to the industrial land and then, one after the other, they get some blood, some limb cuts, some violence, mostly playing with the fear of the girls. final, after some ups and downs, here they are, and some, not too new moments of fear, all are dead, but the driver and the girls. The girls end up in a garage, where one of them is murdered, after confessing that she had slept with the boyfriend of the other girlfriend. The other girl, which is the conclusion, is sold by the remaining kidnapper (yes, the one who killed the rare ones) in some cargo box to Asia (the last image is a cargo port). First. History. Tons of gaps, questions that you ask yourself, loose ends and a conclusion that is not a good revelation, but a total disappointment. I can not see how an unprofessional loser is supposed to have kidnapped dozens of women (as indicated by a drawer full of driver's licenses ... aha) Second. Interim. Mediocre at its best. <br /> <br /> Third. Fear factor IN AGREEMENT. but I AM rejected by torture as a means to nothing but himself. Trading with humans could be a good reason for a horror movie, but it is not used as one, only as a background. <br /> <br /> Fourth, Music and Sound. Some nice attempts, but the sound possibilities of the industrial landscape, the warehouse garage and the sounds of the trucks have not really been explored. Music? It would have been worse without him, but other than that. Some themes of pseudo movement of synthesizer for emotionality when the girls arrive at their final destination. OK, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Verdict: AVOID IT!
