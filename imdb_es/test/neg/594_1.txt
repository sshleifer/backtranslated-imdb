Do not waste your money or your time. Terrible movie Bad acting, plot all over the place. Really, very bad acting. Man, this movie is just bad. I turn it off after 7 minutes. The script is bad, the direction is bad, it seems to me that a high school group got together to do a project for their drama class. Yes, it's so bad. The performance is not convincing at all, keep in mind that I only saw 7 minutes. How this movie came to DVD, is beyond me. <br /> <br /> It should have been left in the editing storage room. I saw the cover and I thought it was very good, I'm sure I will not do it next time: _)
