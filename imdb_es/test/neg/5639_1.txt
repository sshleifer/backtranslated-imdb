While I listen to my parents see this (after 10 minutes in the movie), they have no idea what is going on. When "Charles Dickens" looked at the camera, I almost expected him to become a demon (yes, he looked like one). Unfortunately, that did not happen. <br /> <br /> This movie had several reasons why I did not finish it: one, it was unbearably slow. I mean, seriously, it was slow. You can only understand 10% of what is said, and the characters were poorly presented. <br /> <br /> If you have an English accent and you really like LOTTT to talk, do nothing, act terrible, laugh with cheesy, and the same music / sound effects played over and over again, then this it's THE movie for you ... <br /> <br /> 1/10 - completely horrible. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
