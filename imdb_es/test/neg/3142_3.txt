I rented this movie in a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book on which it is based or the film itself, simply because of the possibility that it is one of those rare and overlooked gems that one can discover from time to time and really enjoy . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not one of those movies. I'm not sure if this is a film driven by sentimentality or, worse, by a deliberate agenda, but certain elements of it made it impossible to submerge it. It is supposed to portray a community of immigrant workers with difficulties trying to cope with the difficult realities of their lives. That is a good premise and it could have been an exciting story, but the execution made me alternate between getting angry and having fun before the ridiculousness. <br /> <br /> Here we have a community of simple agricultural workers. who emigrated to the United States in search of employment and who are repeatedly mistreated by evil white men. And when I say badly, I mean EVIL. All the targets in this film are sinful, racist, sadistic and abusive demons whose only purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with the exploitation of poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it were not so grotesque and therefore hilarious. <br /> <br /> The portrait of immigrants is also an example of exaggeration worthy of a poster, except that it goes in the opposite direction. The immigrants are holy, clean and could serve as an ointment for boos and grandmothers around the world. I could not help but laugh when I saw these "field workers" presumably digging in the ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and haircuts chiseled from a top-notch hairdresser. A bit of moderation and a more impartial hand at the helm could have made this a much better movie that evokes some intentional emotion instead of sarcastic mockery.
