<br /> <br /> ********** SPOILER ALERT *************** <br /> <br /> If it turns out that you like the JURASSIC PARK 1, 2 or 3: <br /> <br /> If you appreciate really bad movies because of their great entertainment value if they are not for their quality (case in point: DARK STAR by John Carpenter, highly recommended) <br /> <br /> If you like movies about dinosaurs in general- <br /> <br /> THEN AROUND THIS CRAPSICAL PIECE! <br /> <br /> The shameless use of CARNOSAUR file images 1 and 2 make the most of this miserable attempt at a dinosaur / slasher movie: take the scene, for example, where the security guard find your destiny in the jaws of Alpha T-Rex. For some reason, it drops 50 pounds and looks 10 years younger. Why is that? Simply because this scene was removed directly from CARNOSAUR, which to begin with was a film of poor quality. <br /> <br /> The ending was a carbon copy of CARNOSAUR 2, for those unfortunate enough to have been sitting on that video loser. Once again, we see that Mr. Rex is fighting a bulldozer, which it alternates like a forklift, through the miracle of -ta-daa! - archive images of the aforementioned CARNOSAUR 1 and 2. Of course, the end is exactly the same. The beast falls to his death just as the complex catches fire. <br /> <br /> A true insult to anyone's intelligence. <br /> <br /> But it's still better than seeing the ROSIE O 'DONNEL SHOW. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of ***** <br /> <br />
