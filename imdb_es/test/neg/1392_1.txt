What happens today when minority comedians feel it is okay to slander the minority and hope to get away with it? <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not George Lopez. There is a difference. When I see the comedian Carlos Mencia, I think he hates his own people. And more than that, I think he was forced to model his program as the "Hispanic / Latino / Spanish" version of Dave Chappelle's program. What a horrible mistake. (Note to Mencia: Please, do not do a "Block Party" movie.) As much as I would like to see Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Agullaria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and the "Xica da Silva" cast reunion. on a stage, no.) <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia likes to use the word "beaners" as much as Dave Chappelle liked to use the word "n". It is neither fun nor acceptable, even if it comes from "your own people". Mencia's carols also like to say: "If you are offended, very bad". It is not the offensive, it is the defense due to what is said and asked to be accepted. <br /> <br /> Carols Mencia goes further: he does not respect everyone for what he considers a comedy. It's not comedy, it's not funny. There is a delicacy in being able to look at yourself and make others laugh at comedy and do not laugh at enforcing the stereotypes that other races believed at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Mencia's mind needs to be polished because Carlos Mencia needs polishing. Find out what is fun and not what will cause more bias in movement and then do it. Until then, the show, Mencia de Mencia is a pass.
