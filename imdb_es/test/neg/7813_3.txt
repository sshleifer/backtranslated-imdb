"There are some things you just do not do," says the label line of this, a 2003 David Zucker comedy about a young man caught in a horrible situation after another titled My Boss's Daughter, and it's the label that must speak so much for the people who made this scrap as for those who contemplate seeing it. In fact, there are some things that you simply do not do, with the placement of almost all the type of content found within My Boss's Daughter counting as elements that you should not do in the cinema when including them in your photo. . My boss's daughter is a sordid one; horrifying; Grotesque experience, a clumsy and heavy piece that is childish beyond words and disgusting beyond expression. To see it is to endure it, to endure it is to survive it and to survive is an achievement in itself. if any of the cast; Extra writers Demons, even the guys who worked as runners on the set, help produce something as shattered as this one again, then it will be because the devil himself sent them here to destroy the middle of the movie or, it will be because it is very likely that have obtained a job on behalf of the Friedberg / Seltzer Mafia. <br /> <br /> The daughter of My Boss, (which I'm pretty sure should be titled as "My Boss' Daughter," speaking grammatically), revolves around her hapless male protagonist, named Tom Stansfield ( Kutcher), and one night in his boss's house while pursuing that seemingly elusive "target" that is his young blond daughter Lisa Taylor (Reid) - someone who works in the same apartment as him in a Chicago office building while is under the strict eye of Jack Taylor (Stamp). Tom spies on Lisa from the beginning, she's taking the subway to work with all the other shmos despite the fact that she owns a car and that her father is the boss of the damn company. After trying to talk to her, but her attempts to be frustrated by a vomiting baby and a dog for the blind more interested in Tom's crotch than anything else, she finally gets her chance in the office when talking about a night party somewhere else and it comes up. that she should go to her house to visit her, and yes, she still lives with her father. Think of the 1960 Hitchcock movie, Psycho, with the gender roles between Norman Bates and his mother invested and then he burst out laughing. <br /> <br /> The character's distinctive setting is painfully displayed in the opening scene in which Tom sits in the subway. Train and travel to work with your yuppies cohorts. They are a ruthless and elegant group, which becomes evident by slipping the briefcases of those unlucky enough to get stuck in the door in the next race of the morning, without having to return them. One day it happens with Tom there, and his desire is to give it back to him, beating so it's not like other guys (!) This, since he first sees Lisa in the carriage and is somewhat shy to approach her. as the other men treat the whole situation as if it were a breeze if they were in their position. This rather obvious and flat-footed attempt to get us to side with Tom is uncomfortable with what is supposedly needed to win a place among these co-workers in this company. <br /> <br /> It is, however, as close as My Boss's Daughter reaches any level of movie making. From a seemingly harmless premise of a child who knows a girl and wants to meet her, comes the comedy of hell. Tom who arrives at the house will not see him invited to the party, instead, he is accused of caring for Jack's owl and, in general, avoiding mischief while maintaining an impeccable home. It has been established that the character of Terrance Stamp is a business of the most strict manners, that dismisses people for the smallest things, such as preparing a bad cup of coffee. It's not that Jack is a shrewd businessman, he's a cleaning freak; Obsessed with control and a borderline sociopath in their bear trap locations in the garden to keep children next to their land. You can imagine that when we enter your big and exquisite house with orders that nothing goes wrong, obviously there will be problems. <br /> <br /> The film has fun with this danger premise for about ten minutes. The first time someone uses the countertop to open a beer and mark the top pristine, you can smile, but when the house is shattered and Michael Madsen appears urinating all over the carpet, you have your head in your hand. your hands. Every joke in the movie is configured in an extremely powerful way before it is reproduced in a way that is slower and more atrocious than the stain and the impeccable, the only thing missing while continuing to the next gag is the sound effect of someone It is incorrectly changing gears to a car while bending and squeaking in the next fall. Between the extravagance, the film takes time to travel a route of disgusting romance driven by the saccharine, as Lisa and Tom come together while talking about people inside and outside the workplace, and perhaps have more in common than the first. thought. By hour marked, the film has chosen to tease and hate more than anything when there is a complete scene that exists exclusively to attack the paraplegics and a silly sub-plot to do with a neighbor athlete with a head injury on a blind date in which some truly indecipherable sight gags are deployed. Throughout, Stamp's character enjoys putting people down and asking him if the simplest task is too difficult for them, to what the common response should be while channeling Jack Taylor: he was reading the first script too complicated: A concept for you, Stamp?
