This is by far the most insipid, idiotic, and incredibly stupid show that has ever been in the air, and it comes from someone who remembers "San Pedro Beach Bums." <br /> <br /> My wife loves watching reality shows. --and there was an episode of this nonsense where the aspirants had to develop a "walk". The final result was taken from the sketch of Monty Python's "Ministry of Silly Walks". I could not laugh enough. <br /> <br /> And then there is the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (as in laughing all the way to ...). She has to be the most annoying self-important woman on television since Rosie O'Donnell left The View. As if the modeling was doing great things for humanity. Please. I never found her attractive, and I do not consider her smart now that she has the temerity to open her mouth. <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell these human hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.
