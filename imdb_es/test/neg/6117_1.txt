UGH! ... this is the worst Wrestlemania unquestionably ... there are no good matches ... Hulk Hogan raises his bald head more tan once more in the main event, the scum of the light of the stain! One thing that's worthwhile on this tape, oh ... I'm retiring that ... this is Jim Ross' first WM ... but other than that ... it has nothing worth seeing ... a big failure ... <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 stars WOOF !!!
