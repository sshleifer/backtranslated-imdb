This is the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. Unless you are in masochism, never see it. It was an insupportable long film, meaningless, that hurts the eyes, depressing and that will always top my list of bad movies. Whoever wrote this movie is a sadist. I almost cried at the end, that's how bad it was. I'd like to give you zero stars, but since it's not an option, I give it one.
