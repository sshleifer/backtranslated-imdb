Identifying this movie as a vampire movie would be technically correct. Simply because it will take away your life. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is an insult to movie fans everywhere. The plot is almost nonexistent. The makeup is just horrible. And the performance is simply not there. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if Jackie Chan owed someone a great favor to convince me to appear in this movie. <br /> <br /> My wife picked up the Film at the rental store because she had a picture of Jackie Chan in the front (as if she were the protagonist) and thought it would be fun to watch a good JC movie. This movie was interesting to see in the same way that you can not avoid looking at the car accident when you pass by. You realize very quickly that the movie is not going to get better, but you keep looking, wondering how bad it will be.
