Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States, of which he is an unconditional member. King used to be a little fair and impartial and had a variety of guests. The Party also used to be centrist, but that was another era. Now, like, Larry, it's very far to the left. <br /> <br /> At least 90 percent of all the guests in the King show in the last year or two are liberals who sit there and beat President Bush and all the conservatives who may think ... night after night. Bill Mahar, one of the most viscous, is, and can look for, the most frequent guest in the history of the TV show King's TV. You can count on other open leftists to be in the King program every week, but do not hold on to a conservative wait. They are few and far between. <br /> <br /> King was also one of the innovators of the media. All that began with the O.J. Simpson Trial Night after night after night, that's all you saw in the mid-90s. Whatever the latest gossip about Anna Nicole Smith, or the murder case of Petersen, or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or some other journalist from the tabloids, you can bet that Larry will beat him to death. Unfortunately, all other networks do the same now. Larry was a leader in that regard. <br /> <br /> King also has the nerve to give advice at times, such as marriage. I'm not kidding; I've heard him say it. The joke is that he has been married and divorced half a dozen times! This man has few scruples, believe me. When it comes to morality, he has no idea. Maybe that's why you have Dr. Phil, to explain some life facts to him regularly. Larry will nod, but he does not understand more than when Billy Graham used to talk to him. <br /> <br /> King is also becoming famous for the "softball" interview, which means he does not ask difficult questions. That's a lot due to the fact that most of your guests are from your political persuasion. People know that being in the King's program likes to have a one-hour public relations concert. <br /> <br /> What all this has meant is a serious decline in the ratings in the last five years. People see him through him and his liberal television and tabloid mentality and switch from King and CNN to Fox News.
