It could end up being the biggest disappointment I'll see in 2009. It seems I'm the rare person who did not like Park's Oldboy, but I think his "Lady Vengeance" and "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" are among the best movies I've seen. I've seen it in the 2000s. So, I really wanted to see this, especially because it got such positive reviews. Instead, I found the clich√© of the movie and broke little, if anything, something new in the genre of vampires. And although I can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this, I felt that Park did it at very inopportune times. <br /> <br /> Others have compared / contrasted this with "Let the Right One In", and I have to say that "Let the Right One In" was far superior to this, and it was a new version of the vampire genre . Unfortunately, Park's take was tired.
