John Knowles' modern masterpiece, A Separate Peace, is one of the many subtle, and subtly the watchful word, themes of love, hate, jealousy, denial and repentance. The 1972 version attempts to address this style and what is the book: a love story with the war in the background. <br /> <br /> The 2004 version is not used subtly at all, but in the representation of the story. What is looking at your face when you read the novel is a love story, and yes, perhaps arguably, a gay love story. In the novel and in the film version of 1972 there are sexual nuances everywhere, in the writings and in the dialogue. In the 2004 film version of Showtime, these tensions were omitted and the actors were there at the end of the 1920s playing teenagers, which caused the mature actors to move away from any tenderness or doubt of innocence in the youth. <br /> <br /> I did not like this new version for more reasons. The hair that broke the back of the camels was that Phineas received a surname in the letters he received from the recruiting tables! Finny is a character that does not have or need a last name. John Knowles did that intentionally. <br /> <br /> Although I accept the 1972 version, the acting was sometimes a bit amateurish, so, I tried to be honest with the novel by filming at a place in the Phillips Exeter Academy that was based on Devon Acedemy; which was also attended by the writer John Knowles as a student. <br /> <br /> The directors and producers took all the teenage students from Exeter, with the exception of Parker Stevenson, who attended Brooks School, to participate in a Paramount movie. Act of class by preppies in comparison with this photo of Canadian College, played with adult actors, politically correct, Platonic version. No - I veto in this farce try again. The 1972 film version with John Heyl and Parker Stevenson was the real business of A Separate Peace on the screen. The 2004 Showtime movie made for the cable version was not.
