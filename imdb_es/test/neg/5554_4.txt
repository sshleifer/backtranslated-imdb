What a terrible movie, it took me 3 times to finish it. What I disliked most was the sense of childhood humor. Jokes made by a 10 year old boy. It's not fun quite annoying actually, for example, when the detective can not get a place at the bar, shouts "she is taking it all away" and then everyone runs "fast forward" slapstick a bit in a hurry. so stupid. and also a guy sitting at the bar breaking fruit to solve his post-traumatic stress disorder. At the bar! and the waiter is supplying him with more and more fresh fruit. Is that supposed to be funny? and I mean ... I love gore movies from Good Ol's exploitation, and I saw a lot of terrible movies, but yours is just bad. and also the "gore" is not so exciting. do not bother I would not recommend it.
