This is just one of those movies that can not justify much of what happens. These people go on a field trip: the young woman wants to photograph animals. There really are no piranhas, but I think the psychotic hunter is the real piranha. Anyway, there are many animals and a lot of driving. There is considerable talk against weapons, but we all know where that goes. Towards the end, there is a lot of action and a violation. Someone must pay, and he does. It would have been nice to have a couple of piranhas to complete the matter. There were many monkeys. If you move through the opaque parts, you have five adjusted minutes.
