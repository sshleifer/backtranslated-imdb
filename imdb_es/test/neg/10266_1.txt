Please, why on Earth did Bava have to add insults to the injuries to make this pathetic tracking piece a shit? <br /> <br /> To begin with us, "viewers" at home are treated with a narrative from some unknown ding. -but informing us of the events after the previous episode that indicate the triumph of humanity over demons, (yes, to the right). <br /> <br /> I can tell you "right now" that this does not work in any way. - Never have anything to do with Demons since this is a completely new story with a completely different background. Bava, as always, makes a casual appearance that does not seem to fit into the main context of the story. Acting in this beyond the atrocious and the whole concept about the demons that appear through a television, oh God, I will not continue. Go see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> As usual, you can enjoy funny dubbing, crap situations that do not make any sense and, above all, unanswered questions. How typical of a sequel that distributed the first batch of garbage. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are one of those Argentophile DVD collectors, then maybe you want to try it in another way, avoid it like the plague. It's not very close to the first one, so you'll want to avoid it like the plague.
