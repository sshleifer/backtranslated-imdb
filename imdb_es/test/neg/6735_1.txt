If I could have given this movie 0/10, I would, and this is the first movie I've wanted to rate so low. It is worse than horrible. If I were to see him at the cinema, I would like the cinema to pay me to see it (at least the minimum wage). Some of the camera shots were quite effective, but many were garbage, for example. The villains are reflected in a mirror that separates the head and shoulders from his body (see to believe). Several totally useless murders of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the actions of the victims / facial expressions when they were shot. I only saw it to the end (fast forward about 10 minutes of boring meaningless dialogue) in the hope of seeing Seagal in decent hand-to-hand combat, but almost none of that (he should have known that when he first threw someone as he lowered an elevator and showed up in slow motion with music (end of the "action" scene). In one scene, we see Seagal's hand cut someone's neck in slow motion, which makes it evident that his hand does not even made contact). The main villain keeps coming back to life. He is shot in the chest on 2 different occasions. The first time is with a shotgun that ejects him from the second / third floor to the street. In short, this movie is a total waste of time and a total joke. It looks very low budget (even for Seagal). The color is matt and gray. I could go on and on ... like this movie, but I will not. Watch this movie if you have insomnia. It is guaranteed to put you to sleep.
