I had a kind of high expectations for this movie. I've always thought that Tom Selleck's lesser-known films (ie, Runaway and Coma) are way above the ones he pushed the most. Maybe the producers should have had a little more knowledge about the former big league baseball players who became stars overseas. Most were players too good to triple a baseball, but not exactly in the major league. I admire the idea of ​​putting the character of Selle in Japan, against the cliché of playing in the minors. Sad to say, this movie, like the title of the publication, is stranded in the third position by a movie that seems to be running on autopilot. I would not mind seeing a sequel, and I hope the producers learn from the mistakes. The premise is too unique to leave her alone with this ragged movie
