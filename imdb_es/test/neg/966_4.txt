This 3-hour miniseries made for television came home with us from Blockbuster's this weekend. The production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets, costumes (Bridget Fonda, especially) and special effects (including a great Jim Henson who talks about polar bear and reindeer). They should have spent a little more money to get a coherent script. The story line was so loose that it never really came together. One can overlook the Germans with an Irish accent, but not the storytelling. With meaningless loose ends that included a special appearance by the devil, this is not meant to be a Christmas classic. A pity that they squandered the good performances of the two protagonists.
