I, as a Christian, am outraged after seeing only the first half of this image. The movie's website says they researched the movie before writing it, but I think they forgot to check out the latest source, THE BIBLE. I sat down with two different versions of the Bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this image. It was as if they invented what was not in the Bible and changed what was in the Bible for what they thought the viewers of modern movies would want to see instead of the truth. Personally I am too young to remember the Ten Commandments of 1950, but it can not be worse than this. I have written to the network and I can only hope that they will publicly apologize for this parody.
