OK, so I know it's better not to watch movies on SciFi. . . er, I'm sorry. . SyFy. Or shifafa. Or whatever it is now. Then demmite me. I spent all Saturday doing an advisory council ideas session for a nonprofit organization. I can be forgiven for letting me fall into my chair and wanting to see a movie I had never seen, instead of reading Proust in the original or learning to play the oud. <br /> <br /> I mean, I did not deserve Open Tombs. Of which I did not see any, by the way. Was there any? I fell asleep? Why is it called that? <br /> <br /> Some visual images. There are not many fears. As with too many movies in modern horror films, there are no reasons, apart from shared humanity, to worry about any of these people. Half a point, however, for the businessman without legs, which was a clich√© but had a good scene. <br /> <br /> These are played as Final Destination through a board game. The game has an intriguing aspect and involves one of my old favorite enigmas. I will give it a lot. The drawback is that the game had more personality than most of the characters. <br /> <br /> As for the end, if you did not see it coming, then I think YOU fell asleep. Somewhere back to the dawn of the genre.
