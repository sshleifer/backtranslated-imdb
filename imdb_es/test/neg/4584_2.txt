They have taken a story dear to the people of the heart of Edinburgh, a true story and have changed it as Hollywood has done before many stories. The final result is a film, however, well made for those who do not know the story but who are totally different and inaccurate. The original film of this story that Walt Disney himself supervised used the dog of the correct race that is crucial to this story and did not make John Gray special; It was a poor Shepard who died in poverty at the inn. If you like history, look at the original Disney for a better moving story. It's a shame the cast and the potential was there for an excellent remake of a classic tale. Read the book for a precise appearance of the story. And if you really like it, you can visit the real Kirkyard in Edinburgh.
