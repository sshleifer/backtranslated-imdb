Technically abominable (with audible pops between scenes) and amazingly amateurish, "Flesh" requires a lot of patience to sit down and probably deactivates most of the viewers; but the dialogue sounds startlingly real and Joe Dallesandro, who exposes his body in almost every scene, also offers an absolutely convincing performance. A curiosity, without a doubt, but the most polished "garbage", made two years later, is a definitive step. I suggest you look at that instead. (* 1/2)
