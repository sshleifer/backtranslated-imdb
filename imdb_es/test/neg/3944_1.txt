I could say that this would be bad in the trailer, but the appeal of the DVD box allowed me to rent it anyway. Chico was right ... <br /> <br /> Also, for some reason, the DVD version is VERY confusing and sometimes unclear (in terms of video quality). It seems as if they had filmed the entire movie with a 20-year-old camcorder, it looks so bad. I really did not like the plot, and after seeing the movie I was very disappointed. I will NOT tell any spoilers, but let's say the ending was so bad that I laughed, which has been done many times before. <br /> <br /> The whole story seems like something that came out of a high school English role. If I had to consider a movie as the worst horror movie I've ever seen, this could be the only one. I can not believe they really released this movie. It really is not worth the rent, not a penny of anyone's money unless you want to laugh at the expense of the movie.
