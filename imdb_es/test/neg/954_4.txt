This meandering story of Mafia revenge is just not very interesting, even with Ed McMahon in a mature role as a heavy boss. Jim Brown kicks ass effectively, Gloria Hendry proves once again that he can bring life to even the poorest roles, and Brock Peters is decent as The Cop Who Plays By the Book. It is still boring and poorly constructed, and even the print shown on the cable is now emasculated from its original James Brown score.
