This must be qualified with the worst movies I've ever seen. It just was not funny. My wife fell asleep. I suppose if you are the kind of person who goes crazy when you see a dog, then you can do something for yourself. If you expect a comedy movie to have some humor, then you will be disappointed unless you find a radio host in English saying the word very funny. The strippers in the club kept their underwear on, so there was not a bit of nudity to alleviate the boredom. What happened at the strip club did not make any sense. There were many murmurs from the main character with whom I had no sympathy. Mena Suvari was not in the movie, probably just to make people think it was a serious attempt to produce a movie. The bad guys were not convincing and carried as much threat as a dead sheep.
