The Girl in Lovers' Lane: 3 out of 10: The homoerotic subtext in movies is a well-known phenomenon. There have been many dissertations from film schools about hidden subtexts in films like Top Gun and Spartacus. The Girl in Lover 's Lane, without a doubt, adapts to the homoerotic trope. In fact, it is so flagrant and exaggerated that even MST3K, who rarely takes note of these things in his riffs, simply can not help it. <br /> <br /> The film is about two drifters. One of them is a rich boy (Lowell Brown) who runs away from home with a hundred dollars and no street intelligence, the other is a professional bum (Brett Halsey). The vagabond saves the child from a gang of thugs and ends up in a small town that consists of a restaurant, a billiard room and a brothel. Our erudite scholar gets a second look from the diner's waitress (Joyce Meadows as the titular Girl on Lovers Lane) who clearly has passed the age of being selective and whose only other prospect is the eerie Jack Elam making an impression of Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> On the surface, this looks like a strange movie for the MST3K treatment. While the cast is too old for the characters they are playing, the acting is pretty good, as both Brett Halsey and Jack Elam provide solid performances. The story is slight, but hardly the material of The Robot Vs. Aztec Mummy and the production values ​​are cheap, but relatively competent. <br /> <br /> It's the strange homosexual currents of Batman and his neighborhood that make this film horrible and hilarious Halsey's objections to children for attempts to sleep in the whorehouse are hilarious, their inability to Committing to the waitress (or at least passing first base) are revealing, and the dozens of looks between him and the child; a hand on the shoulder, arrangements to sleep, eliminating appointments with the girl so that he and the child can shave each other. You do not have to be Freud to discover this underground current.
