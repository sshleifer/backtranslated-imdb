A moderately interesting start, some beautiful scenes in sixteenth-century Japan and a promising idea. But the execution? The comparison that comes to mind after about fifteen minutes is "Cannibal women in the jungle of avocados of death". Really. A specialist in "oriental history" who does not speak Japanese, walks on a tatami without taking off her shoes and is generally as stupid as celery? Please. This looks like a student movie: the sets are laughable, the acting (except, perhaps, for the title character) near the wood, the plot is completely arbitrary. At least "Cannibal Women" was funny! This is best seen with someone who knows something about Japan, only to see how disbelief repeatedly creeps up his face.
