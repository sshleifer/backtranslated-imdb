I really expected the best with this, but it just did not happen. Funded in a very non-Dutch way and still looks great, with a style and a rhythm that looks a lot like Hollywood. What I do not understand is how, with all these great benefits, the director, writer and producer still managed to make this film a completely horrible image to watch. Full of bad jokes, cheap nudity and actors who simply can not speak [act] in the English language. Kudo is to achieve it, but what was this guy thinking?
