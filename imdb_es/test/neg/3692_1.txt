In Moscow, the priest Owen (Vincent Gallo) hires a team to guide him into the underworld to find his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzija) missing while investigating the legend about the existence of demons and an entrance to hell below the city. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based on the name of Val Kilmer and interesting photos on the cover. I am totally disappointed since this movie is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I do not understand how Val Kilmer agreed to participate in this production. There are two embarrassing reviews in IMDb that promote this movie and are typically fake, written by users with only one review on this site. There are two possible ways to see this boring and horrible movie: my wife and I sleep many times due to the monotony of this meaningless story, and we use the DVD rewind button to repeat each lost scene. However, the correct way should have been to use the fast forward or stop button, to end this crap faster. My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cidade Sombria" ("Dark City")
