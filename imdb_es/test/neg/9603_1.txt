Normally, for movie reviews, I try to be constructive and objective, but there is only one word for this, uh, "movie": SUCKS !!!!!!! The dialogue, the acting, the special effects, the plot, the setting and the characters seem to have been created by, well, my pots. Do not see this, for the sake of all that is good and right in this world! :)
