2/3 of this movie are recycled images from previous films, a fact that is sadly obvious even to someone like me who has not seen the original films. And somehow it feels like a scam even if I have not seen things before. It's like the episode of every TV show in which the characters sit around a photo album or something, and you only see recycled images from other episodes. I have seen some producers make extended assemblies of recycled material, but never more than 5 minutes. This film is mostly material that had already been seen by the public, so it could create a case in which it is one of the biggest deceptions that has been made public in the film. <br /> <br /> I have to see it in the theater, on a 16mm print, which is good enough, I suppose, considering how weird this kind of material is in the movie these days. I give the film some credit for the semi-convincing Gothic atmosphere and for the involuntary humor, but that's it. The monster of the Aztec mummy looks good, even has some mobility in his face, which is better than most of the movie monsters of the time. But the robot is unfortunate, although it is interesting that they made the human face fully visible. It's a "human robot" or something like that, as they explain in the movie. I think that's considered an android. So technically, in difficult science fiction terms, this movie should be called "Android vs. the Aztec Mummy," but I doubt that anyone is too concerned with technicalities here rather than with quality. In fact, the movie is so careless that it makes television look good. Even the dubbing of English to Mexican is lazy and weak; For example, at some point the hero says "I could start at the beginning ..." what kind of translation is that? Could not they at least ask him to say "start at the beginning" so that it does not sound repetitive? A publisher of a high school newspaper could have arranged the script for this movie. It is the epitome of making utilitarian movies, there is simply nothing in this movie that does not need to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the movie. They did not put more effort into doing it than they had to do, and considering the extensive recycled footage, I would doubt that they actually spent more than a week doing this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I will stop publishing about this the principle that I do not want to spend more energy in the process of commenting than what the creators of the film spent while doing it.
