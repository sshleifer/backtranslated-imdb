The United States built the atomic bomb to show its superior military power and to end World War II. The film Fat Man and Little Boy is a picture of the efforts of American physicists to invent the technology needed to create the bomb, and the tension that existed between scientists and the military about the potential uses of the bomb, and even the acceptability of his creation. Scientists thought that the bomb should be created as a deterrent, a mechanism that would stop the war by wasting as little life as possible. With their fists, they saw themselves in a race with German scientists, who were trying to build nuclear weapons themselves. When the Germans were defeated, many scientists expected to stop working on the project of the bomb, since they knew that the Japanese did not have the technology necessary to build a nuclear weapon and, therefore, they did not represent a threat of massive loss of lives . Those who favored the continuation of the Manhattan Project hoped that the bomb would be used as a demonstration, inviting the Japanese head of state to see his deployment on a small desert island. They felt that this enormous show of strength would be enough to win the war; no murder would be needed. The US military, under the direction of General Leslie Groves, expected from the beginning to use the bomb as a real weapon to be deployed against the enemy, first against the Germans and then against the Japanese. Due to the persistence of the Japanese soldiers in the small Japanese islands, the United States decided to launch the bomb in populous cities to end the war, first Hiroshima and then Nagasaki. The deployment of this great amount of force also served to make the rest of the world aware that the United States was the dominant military power, a message addressed especially to Russia, whose growing military power and economic weight in Eurasia threatened our pre-eminent world position. Fat Man and Little Boy was a film that had good intentions in mind, but it confused them rather badly with the choice of the actors, the script and the cinematography. One of the main points of the film was the struggle between the military vision of science for murder and the scientific vision of science for knowledge. The cornerstone of this conflict is the continuing disagreements between General Groves and Dr. Oppenheimer. Mr. Newman does his job on the part of the General, steep, massively angry, and radiating his dependence on the success of the project. Dwight Schultz, on the other hand, never puts up much resistance to the general's demands, always looks rather weak, deflated and phlegmatic in his audiences. John Cusack presents a surprisingly unpleasant character in a paper as flat as I've ever seen; It seems that he is only reading his lines. Laura Dern seems to be suffering the same evil. The script does not help any of the characters, who are ridiculously childish in the way they try to explain scientific concepts in unscientific ways, and offer the most unrealistic value relationship between Mr. Cusack and Ms. Dern that can be imagine, it does not even give us the opportunity. The excitement of seeing the army launch nuclear bombs in Japan, and relies heavily on a voice-over technique at any time, even when explaining the most intimate thoughts of a character, or for narrating something that is not It can show in the middle of the movie. , but it is used here to read some absolutely trite selections from Cusack's diary. The director of photography offers us several shots of the ominous shadow of the two bombs, which might be surprising if it did not look like cardboard cutouts instead of bombs, the false atomic fire really looks fake, and why use it? when the butt? the images at hand are really impressive and realistic, and the generalized brown tone does not seem to be thematically appropriate. On top of that, it's not a bad movie.
