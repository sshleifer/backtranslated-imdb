The Joe Cool Review - Hellraiser: Bloodline <br /> <br /> Starring: Bruce Ramsay as Phillip L'Merchant / John Merchant / Dr. Paul Merchant, Valentina Vargas as Angelique and Doug Bradley as Pinhead <br /> <br /> Plot: This follows a timeline of the lineage of Merchant's bloodline, which began with Phillip L'Merchant, who created the box that opens the door to hell. Starting from the 18th century to the present, when Pinhead meets Merchant and tries to cut the bloodline ... (he is the only one who can stop Pinhead, you will see) and, finally, in the future, in space, where Paul Merchant has finally discovered How to send Pinhead to hell forever. <br /> <br /> Openers: this is a film that the people who made it so hated, they declared that the fictional director Alan Smithee would be the accredited director. They only take Smithee out of the carpentry shop when they really believe they've made a terrible movie, like classics like The Birds II: Land's End or Bloodsucking Pharaohs in Pittsburgh. No, I did not invent that. How did I like it? You're reading this, so I'm sure that's what you want to know. <br /> <br /> The good: this movie is not as bad as you were led to believe. Oh, I'm not going to cover it with sugar. This movie was full of a lot of potential and ended up being a disaster, but it has some positive aspects. Freshest cenobites this time to start, like the twins and the demon Angelique. Pinhead still has a leading role, and he still has good lines ("Pain has a face, let me show you") and it's kind of entertaining in everything. Gorehounds will love the movie because of its infinite supply. There is also some continuity with the rest of the series, although you will have to look hard to see it. Chatterer's dog is amazing. <br /> <br /> The bad: but for a story about hell against the damn merchant bloodline that could close the gateway forever, it was really complicated and held together with duct tape. Nothing was really explored to its full potential and there were some really stupid things included. Pinhead kidnaps a child and holds him in rescue. Random deaths only to show more blood (not always a bad thing, but not for the sake of the story). Pinhead is at his worst here, ranting and ranting, even when he is about to die! For the demon as smart as it used to be, it has been reduced to nothing more than a Bond villain, at best. If Hellraiser fans ever needed a reason why they moved back to a role similar to that of a cameo, here it is. The bloodline ruined it for all of us. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: Gore is always mentioned here. This one has skin rips, drilling, impaling hooks, beheadings and more treats. The Chatterer Dog, although amazing, reeks of bad special effects during the chase scenes. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: This movie had the potential of something great, even Hellbound greatness levels. But all that was wasted. Who knows exactly what happened to produce this shit, but we can only blame Alan Smithee. <br /> <br /> Compared to the rest: this movie is the worst in the Hellraiser series. Only for completistas. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of *****
