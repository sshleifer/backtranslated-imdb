This movie is very similar to Cannibal Holocaust. If it were not for the unnecessary sacrifice of animals in the name of "shock" ("Ooh, look at us, we're a tough guy, we've added real death to our movies") these films make their way to my dusty classic platform - I'm a big fan of the cannibal and zombie movies. But as it is, it is another example of shock horror that clings to the last drops of the pile in a desperate effort to make a poor movie generate more exaggerations. In short, a crisp gore movie with limited appeal. A Gore fan of the 70s should try, but anyone with modern ethics and tastes should choose something better written for their popcorn festival.
