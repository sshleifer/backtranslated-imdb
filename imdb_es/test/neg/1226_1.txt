I really wanted to see a continuation of Lonesome Dove but this was total rubbish. The cinematography was terrible. Shot too tight. I was almost seeing the Grand Canyon through a stationary telescope. The edition was cut, cut, cut. Not even smooth. More like a bad student editor. I do not know if McMurtry did the screen, but the dialogue was terrible. I really like the Val Kilmer portrayal of Doc Holiday in Wyatt Earp, but what the hell was he doing with this character in Comanche Moon? I have no idea. It even seemed that it was filmed in a sound stage using the old Bonanza sets. How can the director of the original Solitary Dove have gone so badly with this? Where was your head .............. I can not say much for the performance either. It's a shame to have ruined a western so beautiful it could have been, but rather as if they rushed to this one just to put it in the can. I have read other comments and see that others felt the same. I'm not even curious about the next few nights because it would only be a waste of time like it was the first night. <br /> <br /> (2nd publication) .............. ... Okay, since nothing else was on TV, I must be honest and admit that I saw the Last 2 nights of Comanche Moon. And I'll be honest to tell you that I did not get to the end of any of the last 2 episodes because I fell asleep! I can only admit that I was watching the two main characters very closely and I could make out some gestures Steve Zahn made when playing the character with whom Duval did an excellent job. So I have to give Zahn credit for that. As for the representation of Karl Urban ... simple dead flesh. I can only say again that I was very disappointed because I cared so much about the original LD ​​and, like others ... I have defended my feelings for a true great west.
