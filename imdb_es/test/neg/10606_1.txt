Being a fan of the series, I thought, how bad can the movie be? Well, I have my answer. Some movies should never be made. Why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters? Pete's character in the series was not a plaintive baby as shown in the movie. The only good thing about this film besides the music and that Clare Danes is beautiful is that it was short. What's up with that dance scene? The only reason I did not leave this movie was because it was so bad that it got fun. Maybe that was the plan! It's really bad when a cheap TV show from the '60s is better than a 20-million-dollar movie from the' 90s. The Mariachi cost only $ 7,000 and it's a much better movie. Do not even waste your money when it comes out on tape, it's not even worth renting it.
