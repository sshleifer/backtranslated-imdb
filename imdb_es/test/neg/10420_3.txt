I'm pretty sure Poe would have considered this a farce. The first two stories are decent, nothing spectacular. And then there's Toby Dammit. What the hell was Fellini thinking? It is a boring, random, boring piece, with little to recommend it. One should be frustrated by the lack of background history or conclusion, but there is only relief that it is over.
