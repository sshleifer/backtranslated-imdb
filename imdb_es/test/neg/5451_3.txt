I wish it was "Last Dumb Thriller". But thrillers are like that. They are like children: numerous, illogical and, often, annoying. They desperately want to be taken seriously, but what should be taken seriously about a child's behavior or the plot of a thriller? Having seen this particular child, I mean ... thriller, I understand why the reviewers refer to him as "a Hitchcockian thriller"; They might well have called it "idiots" because that's what "hitchcockian" means in the movie's dictionary (look it up, if you do not believe me). Even the soundtrack is from the old school in Hollywood, which is a mistake: it does not fit into a movie of the late 70's and makes it look false. Also, how dare you steal De Palma's idea of ​​robbing Hitchcock? The story is absurd. Scheider's wife is murdered and her murderers are never a problem. Instead, first his former employers follow him, and then decide to kill him. Why do they decide to kill him? Without explanation. Maybe because the FBI is a dark and obscure organization ("X-Files") that is very happy to have defeated its former employees for pension fund reasons. Or maybe because it's fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this movie; Everyone seems to be after him. And while the poor unsuspecting spectator is trying to discover the mystery by logically assuming that there is a great conspiracy, in reality the murderer is ... Janet Margolin! Yes, the woman who occupies Scheider's home; the one who briefly hinted that she was "depraved." Why does he persecute Scheider precisely at the moment when his wife was murdered and he feels paranoid and followed by his own ex-employers, and not a few years before or a few years after the murder of the wife? A pure hitchcockian (look it up again in the dictionary, in case you've forgotten what it means) a coincidence. And how about that brilliant motive of her ...! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a newborn virgin on the 15-year-old ship in New York, and then she was syphilitized by a group of hot Jewish men, one of whom, tah-dah! - He's Scheider's grandfather. As a result, Margolin has been playing a prostitute in her spare time (among other things) to kill all the descendants of the men who so cruelly syphilitized her grandmother, who was once a virgin. How hitchcockian (look for it) is that? The ending, then, without embarrassment, starts the scene of Mount Rushmore of "North By Northwest", except that the love interest is a murderer and is not saved. <br /> <br /> The movie also offers some doubts. - Dialog box and some not so good performance. Take a look at the silly and obvious way in which Napier follows Scheider in the cemetery. Let's not forget the stupid Napier's apparatus that reaches for his jacket and holds it with suspicion, but it was not a weapon! What a brilliant Napier in the tower: now, there is another chain of illogical behavior patterns. J. Demme was, is and always will be a director without style, without style, and the man who directed "Philadelphia". Let's give him another Oscar!
