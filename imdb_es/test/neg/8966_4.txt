**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Young <br /> <br /> Mountain Hillbilly Katharine Hepburn (as Trigger Hicks) is a religious laundry woman in the background. "At 18", he begins to attract the attention of men and responds by throwing stones. The arrival of a construction team building dams triggers dreams of romance in Mrs. Hepburn. She quickly attracts the attention of mild engineer Robert Young (as John Stafford), who coquettishly hides his marital status. Supervising engineer Ralph Bellamy (as George Fleetwood) is also interested in Hepburn, but for different reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ, whom Hepburn loves. <br /> <br /> After Hepburn uses the power of prayer to heal a child, the people of the neighborhood suspect that she is a witch. <br /> <br /> If it was not so serious, "Spitfire" could be more fun; It is an atypical vehicle and extremely inappropriate for its star, which is not very convincing. Of the drivers, Mr. Bellamy performs better. However, the best characterization is rehearsed by Sarah Haden (as Etta Dawson), who appeared in the stage version of George Cukor, along with Louis Mason (as Bill Grayson). Will Geer (as West Fry), "Grandpa Walton" in the 1970s, has a small role. An unexpected end helps.
