I have seen this movie over and over since it started playing about 1 hour ago, and I must say that this is an hour of my life that I wasted and I will not return, the performance is crap and the scripts need a serious look, and who I wrote them should be slapped, maybe the TV will explode and take me out of my misery ... The only good thing about this movie is that it has something attractive for men and girls. , most of which I wish would disappear, in regard to the movie, special effects like sh * t, Dante? who thinks that a boy dressed in tight leather pants and a half leather jacket is scary, looks more feminine than most of the women in this movie, Dante's voice is pathetic, nobody finds it threatening or terrifying ... Please, TV, I beg you to explode !!!!!!!!!!
