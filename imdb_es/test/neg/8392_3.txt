Paranoid Park is about Alex, a 16-year-old skater who causes death even if accidentally from a security guard. As the movie progresses, Alex deals with small issues like his parents' divorce and the sexual heat of his girlfriend Jennifer (played by Taylor Momsen, whom you can see in Gossip Girl) while feeling guilty. So far I had seen only one Gus Van Sant movie, Elephant, and I can assure you that he kept all his gestures while doing this. Once again cross timelines. Once again, use strange filming techniques like the endless photos of people who walk ... maybe you like these filming techniques, I know not. The plot seems unsatisfactory ... it's almost too simple to explore for so long. The feeling I have (the same as with Elephant) is that Gus Van Sant tries too hard to make an "artistic" film that makes the film itself lose substance. Also Gabe Nevins was quite bad as Alex, there is a difference between being alienated or distant and looking like a robot. If you are a fan of Mr.Van Sant, look at this; otherwise, omit it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
