The movie is just horrible (2/10). Although the actors are doing their best (well, sometimes that's not much), the special effects are ... let me say it this way, it would be better if there were none. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Sapkowski's prose, so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie. Unfortunately it is the opposite. There is nothing left of the original environment. And everything is very chaotic. Maybe they only had too much material to show in 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you would like to see this movie, I would recommend looking for the television series (the same title, the same actors, even the plot). it stays the same) that was done at the same time as the movie did. It's much better (9/10) and the story there makes sense :)
