"CLOSE THE FRONT DOOR" That's what I said when I was told Blockbuster got a new movie called Snakes on a Train. Well, maybe that's not exactly what I said, but you understand the point. I did not need to know who was in the movie, or anything else. All I knew was that I was renting this movie. <br /> <br /> You should probably have asked what it was about. In retrospect, I do not know if I would have really wanted to see a movie about a Mayan curse that causes a woman to give birth to an internal birth of snakes and take them out of her mouth. Nor would I want to see a movie that shows a guy who looks strangely like a pedophile version of Leif Garrett. <br /> <br /> Anyway, although the curse might be interesting on some levels (well, maybe not), there was still the promise that these annoying characters would be devoured or, at least, killed by snakes. So I was willing to sit down for the first hour that very little happened, other than a Texas Ranger, forcing a girl to play with a nice little tit so she could keep her cocaine or the Hispanic shaman she had like to stab people occasionally. But then, all hell broke loose, and the girl began to spit more and more snakes. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * So everything's fine in the end, and I'm willing to overlook the fact that some of these snakes suddenly turned out to be 25 feet long. After all, people eat, so everything is fine. But suddenly, and I'm not going to tell you how because that would ruin the best part, one of the snakes is about 300 feet long. Then he proceeds to squeeze and devour the train, with all the Serpentaur graphic art from the old GI Joe cartoons. Unfortunately, I could not make a Nemesis Enforcer connection with this movie. Anyway, then one would think that such a big snake, which ate a train, would be pretty unstoppable. Well, not if you know your Mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from the sky. Yes, that's all I'll say about it. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is bad. Really bad to the point where he could be numb after seeing this, or his brain could hurt. I did not give this one, because no matter how stupid it was, it was still not as bad as Date Movie. So if you like camp or B horror movies badly built, this is for you. If you think this will really be great like your biggest and infamous siblings, just get away from the box if you see it. And I'll leave you with a quote from the movie that basically should summarize everything. <br /> <br /> "Snakes can not get on a train!" Because that is nonsense. Not like they make stops or anything ....
