Unless you are interested in seeing panoramic 2-hour mountain images with hysterical characters, many histrionic characters and cheap blood from the 70s (not much), I would advise you to avoid this movie. It is very windy, it is too long and it has a very annoying amateur feeling. Masterpiece? No, an average thriller, filmed in a normal way, in a beautiful Italian landscape. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of 1970s slow-paced movies, when there's an argument to delight and entertain you. In this case, it did not work for me. The plot is trite, intertwined with superficial and stereotyped characters, backed by hilarious angry mobs and your typical Italian widow dressed in black, sobbing. <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with the country of Italy, it may be worth watching the film, as the landscape itself is spectacular and impressive. This film is not, however, anything out of the ordinary, there are Italian horror films much better than this. Not much more than a yawning festival. 5/10
