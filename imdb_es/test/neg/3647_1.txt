Just do a little research on the making of this movie. Something as simple as a Google search. It was funded by the United States Army and promoted just in time for the elections. It is a great idea, but I would prefer to see a DOCUMENTARY, not something edited by the Bush Administration and its reality. The timing of the film's release, its tone and the fact that MS & L promoted it, raised doubts about the intention of the film. "According to MS & L Managing Director Joe Gleason, he and his colleagues also broadcast specific messages about the war in Iraq to specific groups," wrote Eartha Melzer. "Was the art people on the left one of those constituencies? Is the government hiring documentary filmmakers to advertise to the population of the United States?" Nobody involved in the film is willing to say who invested the money initially to the movie or how they were represented by the Army's public relations firm. "
