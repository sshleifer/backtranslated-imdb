I literally ran to see it, waiting for a movie that makes me cry or touch my heart. <br /> <br /> What I found was not heartbreaking, but an unconvincing exploitation of a strong human character. <Br /> <br /> Interwined between a couple of young lesbians and an obese man. <br /> <br /> In an environment that substantially lacks sound without mentioning the performance of the most common ones. <br /> <br /> It was not all BAD, as I saw the worst, and I left the cinema 10 dollars poorer but wiser, that a well-advertised FILM is not the same as a FILM WELL-MADE.
