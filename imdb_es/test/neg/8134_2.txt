This movie has some good performances, as others have pointed out, but it suffers (as others have pointed out, except for the people who apparently are friends of the filmmaker or the cast to explain in another way why they consider it a "10") of some schools of self-conscious and self-absorbing films and excess plots. This is the kind of argument that Sex In The City could handle in a half-hour episode, so there was no reason for it to be an 88-minute movie. A perfect example of lost footage is the quick-forward montage in the first third of the movie. He deserves some background story, but he spent too much time, for example, on the character of Daria with the boyfriend of anal sex and in the back story for Paulie, who was not a realistic character, although the actor made a decent work with him He was given lines. <br /> <br /> The worst aspect of the film was the level of amateur parts: from typographical errors in typed material, to incorrect jumps and editions, poor camera positions, angles, lighting problems and, what It is more evident, a poor image. Written script with a badly developed concept. If the writer (also the director and the director) had collaborated with someone, he may not have finished with a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, which further enhances anyone's ability to truly believe in the people they gave him or her. a 10 in the rating system here.
