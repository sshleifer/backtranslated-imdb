I agree with another viewer who wrote that this film recalls Melanie Griffith's unconventional comedy / Jeff Daniels, "Something Wild", in which a rather eccentric free spirit hooks up with a conservative and very orderly young man, and both They present as a couple and, basically, their personality has a gradual effect on him. He lets go and learns to enjoy his short appointment. That's exactly what happens here, except insert the convenient eccentric that steals in the store, Alex (Rosanna Arquette) in the role of Melanie Griffith and the super-cautious teenager, Lincoln (the name is not a coincidence, played by Devon Gummersall) in the role of Jeff Daniel. This film even shares the same twist and abrupt gender change in which the spooky and violent boyfriend suddenly appears at the end and things end up pretty bad. Only, here, instead of being Ray Liotta playing the imbeciles of the 1950 film, is Peter Greene. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage boy who is in his little world. He has some kind of fascination with death after his brother's suicide, and his parents have also disconnected, behaving very strangely (the mother is convinced that Christmas will arrive soon, despite being August). Then, in a night with the "boys" (one of which is played by Jason Hervey of Wonder Years) trying to buy them beer, he meets Alex, who decides to kidnap him and his friends' car (with his permission, Of course). ), and they launch into the mini-adventure through the deserts of the west coast, stealing convenient stores in the manner of Robin Hood and, of course, indulging in routine self-discovery, as everyone asks more about the life of the other. But, Alex has left behind a partner in his stealing job, and he is not going to leave easily. However, we are not always reminded of him or anything, as in the repetitive flashback or cut to his point of view. At least this was done intelligently. <br /> <br /> 'Do me a favor' (also known as commercial Favors), is a mostly underdeveloped story of criminal mischief and self-discovery that is delayed quite a bit during the first half of The Movie, but delivers the products a Little late, once Alex and Lincoln arrive at their house in the middle of nowhere. When the filmmakers stimulate you enough, unfortunately the film is almost finished. I would recommend that if this is the kind of story you're in the mood for, and even though Rosanna Arquette always gives a good performance (even in a badly written movie), I would still recommend capturing this in its best form, "Something Wild. "
