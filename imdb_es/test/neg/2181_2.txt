I bought this video on a disposable table in the video store, hoping for a good cast in what was touted as an award-winning British sex comedy. I guess I should have read the fine print. I rarely write a panoramic review, but here it goes. <br /> <br /> These actors in gay roles really play games with their memories of many more worthy films. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the audience that goes to the theater and all the good movies that have contributed to its reputation. <br /> <br /> I repeat: it is the joke about destroying the actors. Another highly respectable screen person with this rude movie? Can the reference to Austen's classics 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility' be anything more? How much political statement was producing this melodrama with these stars? Are we destined to simply take as a generalized error that all actors are gay and, therefore, let their role play on the screen affect our lifestyles is accepting their private gay relationships on our faces too? I'm sorry, but I do not think so. I say NO to this.
