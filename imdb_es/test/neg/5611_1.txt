This movie had a lot of potential to be hilarious but moving, but it did not reach either. He had a great story, he just did not perform as well as he could have been. The strange "hallucinations" during their sleep scenes made no sense and were definitely not necessary, had no impact, and did not improve or lend any understanding of what would come or would happen. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder's character was fine, but could have been expanded by more. He played the part of shit they gave him at his best. The character was fun, but once again, it did not come to what it could have been. <br /> <br /> Mila's character was perfect and her performance was successful. <br /> <br /> In the end, the writing was horrible and very often, it did not make sense and his hallucinations did not match the film at all. This film, with a better script and direction, could have been a candidate for National Lampoon's vacations in regards to fun and bad things that happen to a person on a trip through the United States. <br /> <br /> Instead, it was only worth a second "color". If I had seen this in the theater, I would have claimed my money and boycotted the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made this movie was losing an hour and a half of my life. He also managed to make everyone involved in the film look bad, simply because the movie was stinky. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone! Forever!
