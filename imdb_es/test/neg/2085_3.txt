I saw this movie more than 20 years ago and had good memories of it. When I picked up again at Cinemax this month, I realized how little discernment I had about movies at the time. This is a completely common spaghetti western, with absolutely nothing remarkable. Script, direction, acting, photography are all a great blah. Stay with Sergio Leone's westerns!
