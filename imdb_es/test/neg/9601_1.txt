Anyone who thinks that Kool Moe Dee, Carol Alt and Corey Feldman make up a list of good actors should be smoking something that I would love to try at some point. Where to start: lousy soundtrack, hammy acting, "action" in some places. This is the typical hacker trick written by fans that the washing has been and was never the love of starring. In fact, I felt embarrassed by the "stars" in this "movie". The only actor missing to overcome this turd was Gary Coleman, who if he had been in the film, would have done at least something howling, instead of just bad. <br /> <br /> There was a part in the movie where Carol Alt was shouting: "Do you think I'm an IDIOT?!?" Yes, Carol, I do, your agent does, and PLEASE, for the love of all that is decent and sacred ... GO AND stop degrading yourself in this way! This movie is something that Anna Nicole Smith would participate in. <br /> <br /> I would tell you what the plot was, but it would be a sentence fragment more for this article, besides my mind was diverted many times during the movie. Anyway, so I barely paid attention.
