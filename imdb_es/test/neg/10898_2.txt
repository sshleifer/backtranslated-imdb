I've never done one of these before, but this movie was literally so bad that I had to say something about it. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of making independent films as last year saw the worst (in my opinion) of the Hollywood screenings, the mainstream seems to have lost contact with what it means make good movies That said, movies like this really give a bad reputation to independent cinema. <br /> <br /> The characters are boring and too stupid to empathize. The direction is horrible, the plot is horrible, the plot itself is horrible, get away, away. Just a brief scene with a woman's naked breasts, and even that did not deserve a second look. <br /> <br /> The scariest thing about this movie is the idea of ​​having to see it again. I gave him a 2 and not a 1 simply because the actors were visible and the sound was audible: he earns a point for each of those traits.
