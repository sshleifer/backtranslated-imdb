This is one of the worst anime series I've seen. When I saw the manga review in a magazine, I thought maybe it was interesting, but when I got the chapters I realized that it was completely stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, the first 2 or 3 chapters are fine, and the series has a standard. But as the plot progresses, it becomes totally incoherent. The series tries to show something mystical based on the Christian mythologies, but it is a total stupidity. It has some demons and stigmata scenes ... Totally meaningless. It seems that the series tries to look deep, complex or mythologically revised, but an observer with a little brain and cultural references will soon realize that all those elements used do not have a real sense: THEY ARE FITTED ONLY TO PRINT THE IGNORANT WATCHERS! ! <br /> <br /> The final chapters are full of meaningless elements: battles with cat-eared demons, references to a supposed fight between demons and demons that control time (for no apparent reason). The final is totally meaningless; an ignorant observer will see in it a floating ending that gives them a place to meditate; but the truth is this: THE FINAL AND COMPLETE SERIES IS AN INCONSISTENT AND UNCONTAINABLE INCONGRUDING TOTAL.
