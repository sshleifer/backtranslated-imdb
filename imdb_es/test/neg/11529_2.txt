Well, I went out with some friends to watch this movie, we went an hour before the show started getting good seats. Then, as you can probably imagine, we were excited to see this movie :). But that emotion soon turned into horror, this movie is a complete failure, it just tries to be funny, it's sad, the script is badly written and it depends a lot on the actors to compensate ... <br /> <br /> The only good performance in the whole movie was that of Stefan C. Schaefer, which was great, the plot was weak and even the "funny" scenes felt forced and unnatural, considering that the main actors are some of Iceland's best comedians. It is very special ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone, because it is difficult and it is never fulfilled.
