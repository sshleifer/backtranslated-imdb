Well, first of all, forgive me for the pun in the title. I was looking for movies to rent the other day and I saw this. I heard something about this, so I picked it up and looked back and there was a little review of John Fallon, also known as Arrow in the Head! At that moment I thought: "Well, if he likes it, then I will like it." So I rented it and I was finally able to see it last night (the university keeps me so busy). Oh, and maybe I want to add that I read a bit of the criticism of Arrow and it turns out that 4 stars gave it 1 and a half. So my expectations of this movie went from being very high to doubtful. Well, after seeing this, once again I agree with Arrow (and it turns out that the review appointment was the only positive thing he said about it). Wow, did this movie suck or what? Where do I start with why he did it? Well, the movie was so boring in my opinion. Not even the great fragments of blood moved me and when a beheading does not excite you in a movie, that's bad! The characters that I hated so much and from the beginning could tell who would die and who would not. Actually, the film showed that I was wrong in some points, but the worst thing is that a particular character that I wanted to die did not do it! What the hell? And the chemistry between the main girl and the boy she met? I did not feel it. Obviously, he was only there to be an eye candy and give him a love interest, otherwise, I thought it was a waste! And as a fan of horror, I must know that doing the "silly horror movie" sometimes has to happen or else there will not be a lot of film, but those that are here have marked me! Hello? Why are you kissing in the murderous nun's room when you should watch her? And it was done by the supposedly smarter characters or less. The turn ... ah, it would have been fine, if it had not been done a billion times and I would not have had to go through this whole movie to get to that point! My main point: stupid movie that absorbed me with some words from my favorite movie critic (actually, my only favorite). Jerks!
