I have seen some bad things in my time. A half-dead cow trying to get out of the high-waist mud; a head in collision between two cars; a thousand dishes crushing the floor of a kitchen; human beings who live like animals. <br /> <br /> But never in my life have I seen anything as bad as The Cat in the Hat. <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than 911, worse than Hitler, worse than Vllad the Impaler, worse than the people who put kittens in the microwave. <br /> <br /> It's the most disturbing movie of all time, easy. <br /> <br /> I used to think it was a joke, an elaborate joke, and that Mike Myers was maybe a gambling addict who smelled a lot of cocaine and lost a bet or something.
