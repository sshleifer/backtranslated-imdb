This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I did not enter with high expectations, but as soon as I started, I thought it could be o-k. It was not Jim Carrey seemed to try, but he spoke all his lines as if he were a character of diabolical cartoons. The other actors seem to do everything possible, but they are made of wood. The plot has a good base, but the melodramatic lines make it boring and a bit stupid. I laughed throughout the second half of the movie, and after five minutes I got tired of that. Most of the 'twists' of the plot could be seen from several miles away. It just is not worth seeing. I really wish I had not wasted my time with that.
