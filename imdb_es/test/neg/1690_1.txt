This is a terrible adaptation of the story of Charles Kingsley. Animation is, to put it bluntly, horrible. And the songs are an embarrassment to the films, especially the song "high cockororim", which they keep repeating. I'm sorry for Jon Pertwee and David Jason, two of Britain's best talents, who provide the voice for the depressing animation sequence. Bernerd Cirbbins does his best in this horrible production, but fails. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs, even if it is the last movie on this planet!
