Gamera vs. Viras became lazy and much of it suffers as a result. <br /> <br /> Space Aliens tries to take over the Earth and is stopped by Gamera. So they send another ship that manages to kidnap two small children. The aliens then take control of Gamera and make it attack humanity. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say that I really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between Gamera and Viras. Viras looks like a large squid with a beak. He has no weopons of energy and does not shoot rays, but he can close the appendages on the top of his head to make a sharp pointed point. So, in general, this is not a bad monster for Gamera to fight and it's decent. Viras really hurts Gamera by stabbing her underside with her pointed head and I'm surprised that Gamera could have survived this. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Gamera vs. Viras decided to use images from previous Gamera movies to fill the time. for this movie They are showing the battles between Gamera and Barugon and Gamera and Gaos when the aliens look at the past gameras battles. However, when they show the battles of Gamera with Gaos, they first show the battle between Gamera and Gaos in the city, then they show the final battle between the two. After they show the images of the final battle between Gamera and Gaos, they show the FIRST battle between Gamera and Gaos. Talk about showing the battles in non-chronological order. They did not even have to show the first battle they should have stopped after showing the final battle between the two. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that they decide to return to show images of Gamera attacking cities when the aliens command him to attack Tokyo. So they show the scene of "Gamera vs Barugon" where it destroys the prey. After the scenes of the "Gamera The Invincible" show, that is a big problem for me. Mainly due to the fact that "Gamera The Invincible" was in WHITE AND BLACK !!!! Using footage from a black and white movie in a COLOR movie is really lazy and that's not good. <br /> <br /> Also the dubbing is bad once more. The two small children are not so annoying, but it would be nice to see a Gamera movie that does not involve young children. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the excessive use of images from other Gamera films is a deterrent for this film. The final fight is amazing, so I basically recommend jumping to the last ten minutes and watch this movie. The rest is something that has been seen before.
