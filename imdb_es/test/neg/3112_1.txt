The general story, though quite graphic, is actually decent and reasonably interesting to readers. However, the movie was absolutely terrible. The story was good, but the performance was terrible. I was crying all the time because I knew that I could never recover my past time. I do not see this movie. If you do, bring a gun with a bullet and a few bullets if you go with friends. I'm sorry for everyone who had something to do with this movie. I also feel sorry for everyone who had to watch the movie. Avoid this movie at all costs, and if your mother forces you to look at her, kill her. Hahahahaha See! I'm a psycho now! IKWTCBS made me a psychopath!
