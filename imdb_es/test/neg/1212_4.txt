I loved this movie 10 years ago when I was about 16 years old. My biggest mistake was to see him again, 10 years later. It's not the worst "I-wanna-be-a-pilot" movie in history, but it has so many flaws that you can hardly miss it. <br /> <br /> Queen's "One Vision" (along with the rest of the soundtrack) makes this film better than the average patriotic nonsense that is normally seen;) <br /> <br /> [* *** ------]
