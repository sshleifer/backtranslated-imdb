It's been 3 months and you know what that means ... A new Seagal movie. Seagal has really been making a horrible movie after a horrible movie. Each time each movie gets worse and worse, it's really amazing! I really do not know what to say about TYD, first it's a piece of shit, the story does not make any sense, secondly, it uses doubles in all of its fighting scenes, and last but not least, it takes a big quantity of images from other movies! Surprising how this guy is still finding work, arrives late on the set and leaves early and, because of that, his films are full of plot holes and acrobatics. Why are we still buying your movies? Why do we still have the hope that maybe he will make a great movie?
