I got this for my birthday in a box with the name Broke Skull. Well, after seeing one on the DVD and being pleasantly surprised, I introduced this suction cup. It was worse than I expected and I did not expect much. This movie is basically an intricate story about a man who dies and comes back to life with the mafia and other nonsense. There were some interesting ideas in this that were never followed. Now everyone has been saying that there was a lot of blood, can anyone tell me yes? I saw a negative effect of a crushed head, brain tissue (or something like that) and blood coming from the area of ​​the penis twice. I have to say that the part in which the boy bit his man's hood made me writhe, that was the only good thing about this movie. And that gay sex scene was thrown in there for no reason. The acting in this was atrocious, in fact, it exploded. That Asian girl was upset, then the annoying Mexican boyfriend who comes to be killed. I say that if you get this in a box, that's fine, but do not spend any money on that.
