This movie is anything but the real story of Phoolan Devi. The claims of director Shekhar Kapoor are countered by the fact that he made the whole movie without even having met Phoolan Devi, in whose life this film is supposed to be based! The excuse is that the encounter with the woman would have interfered with the director's conception of the story! The film wastes the opportunity to sensitize society about the plight of lower caste women in Indian society and ends up as a stereotype that portrays Phoolan Devi as an angry woman whose only motivation is revenge. No wonder, this film by Shekhar Kapoor was successful in the west, as it adapted to her non-bollywood tastes!
