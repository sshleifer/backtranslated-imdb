The scientist Charles and his wife (or assistant) Marissa receive some objects and a skull from an old Indian cemetery, and while cleaning a vase, they are attacked and killed by a mysterious being, the Skeleton Man. Then, a military squadron commanded by Captain Leary (Michael Rooker) seeks two groups of four soldiers who disappeared into the jungle. They face the Skeleton Man, shooting him while he kills each soldier. Then, the Skeleton Man goes to an energy plant, and Captain Leary exploits the facilities and destroys the supernatural being. <br /> <br /> I bought the "Skeleton Man" on a DVD expecting to see some funny garbage, but I found a boring, annoying and pointless garbage, with outbreaks and explosions. The story of the imbeciles is totally disconnected and does not make any sense, and the military team is made up of imbeciles, who insist on shooting the Supernatural Skeleton Man until they are totally sacrificed. Their leader is also the most stupid, with the explosion of a complete installation at the end to destroy the supernatural theft of the extraterrestrial warrior Predator. On DVD, it is possible to use the fast forward button throughout the movie and reduce the suffering of the viewer. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Skeleton Man"
