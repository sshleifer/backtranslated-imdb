The atmosphere in this show is great. There is a lot of excellent accumulation, but that's where this show fails. There is a lot to build for nothing. You will constantly see a creepy configuration that will make you feel like something really strange is coming out of the corner and then ... nothing. Again and again nothing. You hear many stories of people who talk about strange events but you do not see any. They appear at the doors of these people, talk about their deep and emotional pasts, make up a scarce team and find nothing! There is nothing in this program that leads me to believe in something paranormal. I laugh every time they need to exercise a "horrible spirit" of which we have not seen anything as public. They get rid of the spirit that never was and everything is put in a small and orderly package. A show that looked so weird and with great potential leads to one thing ... Nothing!
