University professor Justin Thorne (Jimmy Smits) has done it. An attractive and sophisticated teacher, with a loving wife and two adorable children. He plays the saxophone, he owns an expensive car and his students love him and respect him. But when temptation calls, in the form of one of his bright, handsome, sexy and willful students, Jennifer Carter (Naomi Watts), surrenders foolishly. The next day, he is being accused of his rape, and his perfect life could be ruined forever. <br /> <br /> When we see an American actor in an Australian film, we know that we are not in a masterpiece. But even seen with low expectations, "Misconduct" is a great failure. Based on a play with an unimaginative title and then adapted into a reasonably pleasant book, it fails to involve, convince or even remotely interest its audience on a more fundamental level. The script is clumsy and unconvincing; The acting is, for the most part, not much better. Watts gives an acceptable performance, showing for one of the first times on the screen her emotional rawness, but she is the only good thing about the movie, which seems almost like she can not wait for it to end. <br /> <br /> Management is not horrible or distracting in any way, but it is painfully mediocre. Apart from the aforementioned Naomi Watts, who could be forgiven, since this was at the beginning of her career, the performance is wooden and constantly worsens throughout the film. The generally reliable Jimmy Smits does not seem to have been trying in this, and who could really blame him? However, all these small failures only add to the last fatal flaw of the movie, which is that the focus is completely in the wrong place. Any empathy for the characters or interest in the result is lost in a sea of ​​what is basically a soft core entertainment of an adult type. In the end, audiences will probably be bored, tired and wishing they had done something else with their ninety minutes. Unless you just want to see Naomi get naked 4 or 5 times, you could definitely afford to let this movie go by.
