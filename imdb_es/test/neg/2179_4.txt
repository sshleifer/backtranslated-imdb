Maybe this was * An important film * and that's why people rate it so high, but honestly it's not very good. In retrospect, it's easy to see that Chaplin (probably all Hollywood) was incredibly naive about the magnitude of what was really going on in the ghettos, so he can not blame him too much for the disconnection that affects a modern viewer, but the disconnection it remains. <br /> <br /> More disappointingly, the movie is simply awkward; It's as if Chaplin had no idea that the films had progressed in sophistication since the silent era. The fixed pieces, those that involve both the Jewish hairdresser and the dictator, do not flow with each other; they simply sit there as discrete bulges of history that progress in adjustments and beginnings, moving SOMEWHERE but never reaching resolution. Some are fun, others not so much. <br /> <br /> The charm of the movie is strictly in the person of Chaplin. His parodies of Hitler's speeches were the best part of the whole affair, and it can not be denied that he had a physical grace that was very pleasing to see. But virtually everything he surrounded himself with was ANNOUNCING. Hannah was too American. The Storm Troopers were TOO American BLACK. <br /> <br /> Oooh! Oooh! One more thing! I do not know what purpose was fulfilled in making trash the source of the evil behind the throne. It almost seems that the movie is saying that, if it were not for evil influences like Garbage, Hynckle would not have been as bad as a boy.
