He was still a photographer working in Europe the summer Jim Salter filmed the movie Three. <br /> <br /> I made some fantastic photos for him, one of which I was told became the poster for the film. I did not see the movie until years later. I thought it was bad. A pity, because the elements that entered it were convincing. Robie Porter's girlfriend was almost as beautiful as Rampling. Salter asked me if I would stay and would be an additional cameraman so they did not have to shoot everything twice. I said yes, but I had to return to New York promising to return. Unfortunately, I never came back. One of the forgotten melodies of life. <br /> <br /> I would like to be able to post the photos I made somewhere. <br /> <br /> Rowland Scherman
