I have been collecting Iron Man comics since the early 70s and have always enjoyed the character that is far from the average hero and his numerous and varied enemies. There have been no less than three attempts in an animated series for Iron Man and only the original and part of the second have done justice to the character. So I had a little hope that this new version was good. Boy was wrong! The art of the DVD is VERY deceptive and presents an image that is not the movie. Get away from the good, the little that there is ... Art and animation are well drawn and writing and dialogue are generally good, although with notable exceptions. The voices of the characters are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well acted. Now, for the bad ... Unfortunately, the writers chose to ruin completely with the origin of the Iron Man and especially with the Mandarines. In addition to that, they decided to make Iron Man and his opponents in CGI. Bad CGI. This makes them stand out almost as badly as the actors live in a caricature. CG work is often repetitive and obvious shortcuts are sometimes taken. CG battles are also clumsy, which further enhances the fact that CG and line animation do not blend well. The movie would certainly have been better if they had chosen to DRAW all the characters. Another problem is that Iron Man is in his traditional red and gold suit for a whole battle! And it's not even the big fight at the end. All this drags the film down and never recovers. <br /> <br /> ************ SPOILERS (or warnings) CAN FOLLOW *********** * <br /> <br /> The movie It begins with an interesting unusual sequence of stop motion credits for machinery, welding and gears. Then we are presented with what appears to be a Chinese temple in the process of restoration, and a prominent statue of what the fanatics will recognize as Mandarin. Things go strangely, impeding progress in the restoration of the temple. Supervising it is James Rhodes, Tony Stark's old friend. It seems that they plan to actually raise the temple from the earth, despite the opposition of a group that insists that when the temple is erected a terrible disaster will take place. Rhodes is caught in a raid. Stark, who appears in a Jacuzzi with a charming lady, is informed of the problems and intends to personally supervise the project and rescue his friend, while in the background, his father deals with the Board Executives who are pushing for withdraw Tony. Tony arrives only to have his armored escort ambushed and smashed to pieces. Tony wakes up later mortally wounded in the heart and prisoner of the rebels. He is saved only by the rapid action of Rhodes and a scientist. Eventually, Stark must build the prototype gray iron armor and make a good escape, but only after some loss of life. While with the rebels he meets a girl with problems called Li Mei, and the two fall in love. The Temple rises and four elemental beings (all made in CG) appear and proceed to begin to collect hidden rings of power. Stark and Rhody encounter problems at home, but manage to face the elementals without success to really stop them. First use the water armor, then the most classic red and gold armor and finally everything goes back to the temple and Stark is back in the bulky gray armor. for a final confrontation and an encounter with what could be Fin Fang Foom (also in CG). Here history takes an important turn, since it turns out that Mandarin needs a host body to manifest. This leads to a somewhat tragic final battle tainted by the fact that Mandarin is little more than a ghost and is not seen until the last 5 minutes of the film. ugh ... <br /> <br /> If you're an Iron Man fan, you probably do not enjoy this exit. And even non-fans may find that the movie is somewhat deficient or not.
