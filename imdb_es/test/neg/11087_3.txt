Let me start by saying that I love Japanese cinema, literature and culture in general. I have seen many Japanese movies and I have enjoyed them, but "Portrait of Hell" (also known as Jigokuhen) becomes ridiculous. The two characters that dominate the action: the "evil lord" in his privileged bubble and the "stubborn and crazy artist" are pure types without any subtlety or nuances, and all his actions emanate caricaturesque extremes. The film wants to show horrible scenes of violence and raw emotions, but many of these scenes are so exaggerated that they really become laughable and the general feeling is that of a movie made for television that went off the rails. If this rarely-projected film falls into your hands or arrives in your city, save yourself and give it a pass.
