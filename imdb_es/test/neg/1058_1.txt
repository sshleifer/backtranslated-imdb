Well, you know ... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick are very good actors. But WTF with this movie? The story was lame and the script was terrible. The poor actors did not have material to work with! <br /> <br /> The cover of the DVD invited you to a flight action movie. You would expect something like Top Gun ... Great disappointment! The flight action in this movie is so cheap that it makes you throw up. The aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other sources of images, not made for this film. And they did not even care about brands or wrestler models, taking it for granted that the audience will not notice. <br /> <br /> As I said, the story was scarce. With a little effort the writer and director could have been very interesting. In short, it looks like a B-movie made in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I'm so sorry for these actors who put their names here. Surely they must be ashamed.
