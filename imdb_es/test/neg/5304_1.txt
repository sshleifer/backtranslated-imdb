OK, it was bought a few Christmases ago by my brother-in-law, who took me to see "Get Shorty" at the movies, and both of them were impressed with "uber". And we watch the two short and be cool one after the other. I read reviews of people who had not seen in a short time and I thought that this movie was pretty good ... I think it's another way in which the film companies cheat the paying customer. All I have to say about this movie is WTF? After almost 10 years and Chili Palmer had become a kitten ... The script was basically the same, they joined Travolta and Thurman after their hit Plup Fiction, they released a couple of big stars (plus a shed of nobodies) ) and I thought it was going to be good ... the character of Vince Vaughn was just annoying, even though I was a fan of both him and Rock, both actors were little used and unrealistic. Basically, I'm glad that this was bought for me as a gift, because if I had paid money for it, I would have felt super annoying.
