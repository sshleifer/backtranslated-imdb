If you thought that Herbie, who was trying to commit suicide by driving from a bridge on 'The Love Bug', was stupid, wait 'til you see him acting horny in this second sequel, amazingly silly. Dean Jones has returned as the driver competing in the rally from Paris to Monte Carlo; this time his sensational VW falls in love with another car in the race, a Lancia driven by Julie Sommars. At this point in the series, energy and charm are missing even more than in 'Herbie Rides Again'; The film is too long and incomprehensible, although it can be seen thanks to the return of the sympathetic interpretation of Jones, some funny fragments and the frantic holdup of the cast.
