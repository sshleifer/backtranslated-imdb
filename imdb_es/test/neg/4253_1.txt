I do not see why everyone likes this movie so much. It is true that it has good intentions and meaning, but it can not compensate for such a poor script. Woody Allen is a brilliant filmmaker, but I'm afraid this is just a piece of trash. It is extremely predictable and the subject is too visible. It turns out that I'm a big fan of Woody Allan and I love most of his work, but I can not recommend it.
