The 1998 version of "Psycho" needed to be delayed in the 60s, instead of the present. The headliners would have done a good job with the stage. There were two scenes that stuck out like a sore thumb. The first was at the beginning of the film when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) was sitting at her desk. His boss took his client to his office because "it was air conditioning." I imagine that most Arizona companies have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) and Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Lila wearing the Walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie. The movie scared several spectators in the theater.
