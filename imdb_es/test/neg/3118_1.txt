The film contains a very short scene of Deneuve in a bathtub. She looks absolutely stunning for a 56 year old woman, but this is the only salvation of the movie. Otherwise, it has a carefree and unmotivated script and the main actress does not have the appeal of Deneuve. Apparently, the director saw too many Peter Greenaway movies and Pola X appears as an imitation of a Greenaway-style student, without any of his inspirations.
