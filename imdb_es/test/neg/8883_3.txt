Maybe I missed something, but I found that Goya's ghosts were a tedious costume melodrama. As for the story I was trying to tell, I found a confused jumble that shot up in all directions. And maybe it should have been done by a Spanish director with the appropriate subtitled languages ​​instead of an English with an unconvincing accent. I can not judge the historical veracity of the story, but it seemed to move along with the plot of a "tragic destiny of the artist's model" similar to GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. Was the film a comment on the religious injustices of the Inquisition, false piety, torture then and now, or what? I never seemed able to solve that. The various characters of Natalie Portman also seemed ridiculously stereotyped. And in the end, the film was crowned with the final melodrama of a disheveled head and body of Bardem hanging on the edge of the car that was heading towards the sunset, with Ines and Goya following behind, can not Milos Forman do it best? What's that?
