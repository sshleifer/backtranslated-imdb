This is one of those strange, self-indulgent, self-indulgent films that try too hard to be profound. It is not. Instead, it throws clich√©s that try to go through Profundity. Typical is the scene in which Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to the protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how the man begins to breastfeed, then continues sucking the breast of his girlfriend and, finally, his wife, concluding that the life sucks. . So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters that offer their perspective on life, the universe, etc. during Adam's travels through the Mojave Desert on foot. (Abruptly leaving L.A. on his wedding day and his family, friends and fiance assume that he died when his car was found in a military test field crushed by a rocket.) Some characters are more entertaining than others. The best by far is a fugitive from a psychiatric hospital who only speaks through the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, makes great impressions, such as Nicholson, Popeye and several original Star Trek characters. But once the interesting characters come out of the screen, we stay with Adam again and his search for depth. It is a long journey, which drags in many places. In fact, it's the longest hour and a half movie I've seen. And the end almost does not seem worth it, at all. <br /> <br /> I discovered this movie on HBO one day when I woke up very early and clicked on the television. That will learn me. Next time I'll try harder to sleep.
