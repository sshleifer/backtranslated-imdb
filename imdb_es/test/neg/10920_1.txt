Why, oh, why, this garbage is considered a classic? I have seen a greater number of bodies in the episodes of The Simpsons. Practically nothing happens in this film and much of its execution time is full of almost unbearable melodrama directly from a low-cost soap opera. <br /> <br /> The Trenton family is going through difficult times and when dad is not at home. And the little boy is going to fix the car. But when they arrive at the ranch, they discover that the watchdog has gone crazy. The rest of the film is only those who are sitting in the car, while San Bernardo surrounds them again and again. <br /> <br /> As for the child, I have never seen a more upset child in a movie in my life. And, obviously, it's completely Aryan, since children with blond hair and blue eyes, like the one featured in Kinder chocolate packages, are apparently more friendly than people with brown eyes and dark hair, like me. All he does is cry and whine. The same goes for mom. He gets out of the car, gets into the car, gets out of the car, gets into the car. <br /> <br /> I know this was done in 1983, but I just died from the horror movies where the characters make stupid and illogical decisions. If Mom just used common sense, she would be able to get away from the nasty dog. <br /> <br /> It is very badly written and there is no tension. If you want to see a good "bad dog" movie, check out John Lafia's The Best Friend of Man. It's fun, inventive, has a better dog, a greater body count and a more immersive story. Let this trash be.
