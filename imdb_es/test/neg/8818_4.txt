I have to give this movie a 4 for a couple of things. <br /> <br /> 1. What I will call the "stupid victim syndrome". If you have the murderer on the ground and you have his gun, shoot him, please. If you're a cop and you have your gun pointed at the assassin's back, please shoot him. <br /> <br /> 2. When you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun, your first instinct is to squeeze. This is one of the first things they teach you in pistol training and the reason why you do not press the trigger until you are ready to shoot, ask any hunter or infantryman. If you are electrocuted, your muscles should also contract, causing you to squeeze your finger. <br /> <br /> 3. It is really difficult to lie on the floor completely motionless for 8 hours without another 2 people, one of them a doctor, without realizing that you are not dead. Even more so if you are supposedly dying of a brain tumor and you were in the hospital a few months earlier. <br /> <br /> 4. Technically, the killer killed one of his victims: the guy who injected him with a poison that had to get the antidote. If you poison someone, that's murder. <br /> <br /> 5. What was Adam's lesson that he was supposed to learn? Yes, the doctor needed to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something. <br /> <br /> Aside from those things, I would have given this movie a higher grade. The plot was quite good, and the ways in which the killer chose to kill his victims were very clever. I can even forgive the terrible performance of the doctor: the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. The cinematography and the soundtrack were very good, but the end seemed to be devised and it just did not work for me. Thank God I did not have to pay to see this or I would have demanded a refund.
