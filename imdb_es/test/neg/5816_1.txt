If you are looking for a movie with beautiful shots of Mount Everest, then you can enjoy this movie. Simply go to the views of the mountain. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Alert) However, if you, like me, believe that lives are precious and that you do not have to waste them, this movie will leave a bad taste in your mouth. 6 people died, 5 sherpas and one member of the Japanese party only for a man to try to ski on Mount Everest. <br /> <br /> The question arises in the film about whether the continuation of the expedition will meet. His personal goal was worth it in lives, and he responds with an emphatic "Yes." <br /> <br /> The part about skiing is in the last 15 minutes. Ski for a short time, then fall for the rest of the way until it stops in the snow.
