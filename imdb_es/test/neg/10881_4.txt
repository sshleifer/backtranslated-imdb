Continuing in the chain of films "stalker / slasher" in the vein of "Wolf Creek", "Hostel", "Joy Ride", etc., "Rest Stop" appears. The most unoriginal and useless of all. <br /> <br /> We start, reasonably promising, with the violent death of a pretty girl in a dirty bathroom. <br /> <br /> This is where our interest is lost. Then, we moved to the clich√© road trip couple, on their way to Los Angeles with an eye toward stardom. . . that, making movies like this, they will never achieve. <br /> <br /> From the sexual romp in the park, the couple leads, arguing all the way, to a deserted and unpleasant rest area for the girl. the bathroom. Harmless enough until she goes out and finds her missing boyfriend and realizes she's being harassed by a boring Rusty Nail version of "Joy Ride." . . just drive in Mater from "Cars". <br /> <br /> Honestly, if this had been directed / written / produced / acted by someone else, it could have been pretty good. But no. <br /> <br /> Because then comes the ghost story. Yep. . . you guessed it A lot of "oh, I'll help you, but wait, you're dead" to "wait, is this stalker a person, a monster or a ghost?" <br /> <br /> But wait? Who comes to the rescue to save the girl's life and possibly the movie? That brother of Lawerence. Excellent. We are saved (sarcasm) Oh, wait, no, we are not. <br /> <br /> You know. . . If you want to laugh pretty badly, or if you get free rentals like me, try it. <br /> <br /> In any case, you will learn how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
