In the mid-1800s, Irishman Dennis Hopper (as Daniel Morgan) emigrated to Australia, looking for a share of the continent's gold. Instead, Mr. Hopper is marked and thrown into a tortuous prison; there, he is a raped gang. Upon being freed, Hopper hooks up with Aboriginal David Gulpilil (like Billy), with whom he seeks revenge on the sadistic Bill Hunter (like Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Detective Mainwaring) and others. Eventually, revenge becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and assisted by ordinary people, and persecuted by corrupt and powerful authorities. Hopper's "barely human" performance certainly suits the disjointed feel of the film. Mr. Gulpilil heads a strong cast. The staff involved in "Mad Dog Morgan" makes it worth not only a look, but also a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> *** Mad Dog Morgan (1976) Philippe Mora ~ Dennis Hopper, David Gulpilil, Bill Hunter
