In general it is not my practice to review movies that I do not like very much. However, once or twice a year, I temporarily put aside my rule to only comment on the things I like to give a warning. I think it's more pleasant to comment on something I like and promote it than filming bad movies. But some "movies" clamor for the razor. <br /> <br /> Bilitis is one of them. Cinematography is not the only blurry and unfocused aspect here. An almost indiscernible plot (certainly incoherent, if there is one) bad performance, cheesy script and a horrible rhythm. These are your main problems. <br /> <br /> I understand, I firmly believe that not all films are created in the same way and that films should be judged according to their category. It is not reasonable to judge, for example, the Beach Blanket Bingo against Gone With the Wind. I judge Bilitis against other films in its weight category. Measured compared to movies like Emmanuelle or Secrets of a Chambermaid, it really goes very wrong. Even sweet eyes should be entertaining and bilitis definitely is not.
