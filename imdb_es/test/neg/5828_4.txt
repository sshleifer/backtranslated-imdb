All in all, this is a movie for children. We saw it tonight and my son loved it. At one point, my son's emotion was so great that sitting was impossible. However, I am a big fan of A.A. Milne's books, which are very subtle and hide an ironic intelligence behind the childlike quality of its main characters. This movie was not subtle. It seems a pity that Disney can not see the benefit of making movies from more of the stories contained in those pages, although you may not have permission to use them. I found myself wishing that the theater was playing "Winnie-the-Pooh and Tigger too", instead. The voices of the characters were very good. It just bothered me a lot, Kanga. However, the music was twice as loud as the dialogue, and incongruous with the film. <br /> <br /> As for the story, I was a little preacher and militant in tone. In general, I was disappointed, but I would return to see the same emotion in my son's face. <br /> <br /> I liked Lumpy's laughter ...
