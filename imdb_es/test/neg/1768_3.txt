A sf / horror adventure at a slow pace that is taken too seriously, memorable only by (a) beautiful Mathilda May wandering nude through chaos and (b) terrible miscasting. It has some slightly creepy effects and surprising moments, and some involuntarily funny scenes, but it's mostly a waste of time.
