I saw this movie so you do not have to! I have great respect for Kris Kristofferson, but what was he thinking? Did he do it by scale? <br /> <br /> At least the title of the film practices the truth in advertising, since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film, which increases the confusion. Kristofferson mentions this in his comment that even he was not sure if the character of Genevieve Bujold really existed. This is not a good omen for the viewer to follow the story! <br /> <br /> The "making of" feature was much more interesting than the movie itself. Explore the difficulty of raising funds for an indie, even while filming the movie. <br /> <br /> To your credit, this movie is visually pleasing and in no way resembles a movie made with just over 1M. Too bad the money has not been spent on a better project.
