This was without a doubt the worst movie I've ever sat on. And that's saying a lot, because I've seen my share of horrible movies. <br /> <br /> But I have never seen a movie in which each character represented was an unintelligent loser. Seriously, there was not a single respectable character in the whole script. How appropriate that the plot was equally boring, without any intelligence. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Keanu Reeves and Cameron DÃ­az did not even agree to participate in that stupidity. And although I have not seen all his other movies, I have always enjoyed his performances so far. Not that the performance was bad, only the whole story was stupid.
