Truly frightful waste of space. My friend and I tried to watch this movie until its conclusion, but we had to turn it off about 30 minutes from the end. And I can tell, on the one hand, the movies that I've turned off before the end. <br /> <br /> The script and the direction are major and uninspiring. I would not be surprised if they found the script in a pile of discarded scripts of 1983. For example, the irritating irritation that threatens the type of real estate from your home phone. Is seriously. The police would be knocking on your door in a matter of minutes. The scenes and events are simply washed by you like the turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the real thrust of the movie. Narrative movies between characters in a seemingly random way break the pathetic attempts to build the characters. Oh and what "characters" are. The protagonist played by Rourke is terrible. He could have sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. After 60 or more minutes of the movie, he had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. It is neither friendly nor hateful. Only a disfigured mannequin from a shop window that gets fully into each scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from his delivery, usually murmured and without emotion. Is happy? He's sad? Angry? No idea. Only those same dead eyes that look at you from a piece of disfigured flesh. And the theme of the Native Americans is simply horrible and useless. <br /> <br /> At best, the good ones are unpleasant. A stupid white-collar stereotype and a neurotic stereotype of ex-wife that glows brightly. Cue the archetypal wife with the shotgun faces the bad boy, "you're not going to shoot me", which is both unoriginal and annoying. <br /> <br /> The richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends to a unilateral irritating psycho character. What seems to be at odds with the apparent intention of making bad guys somehow sympathetic or at least realistic. <br /> <br /> The character of Roasario Dawsons begins with some promise, but soon descends to a morbid and childish parody of the mobster Chick scenes of Jackie Brown. Do you really want me to believe that your character is SO attracted to Rourke's? Or worse, is it just a sluggard who sleeps with something that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! <br /> <br /> In summary the complete disorder of a movie. Characterizations and desperate actions. A lead and threshing script along with an uninspired address. And ultimately, extremely boring. Comedy is not even bad. Laughing at the emaciated face of Rourkes becomes quite old after spending the first 15 turgid minutes of the movie.
