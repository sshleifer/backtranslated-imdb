Ugh This movie has so many incredible contrivances of the plot that turned what could have been a good movie into a horrible disaster. The story is pretty decent, but the holes in the plot make the execution literally ridiculous. Actually, we are supposed to believe that the Secret Service would go against all common sense and allow the President of the United States to be at incredible risk. If this is an indication of the kind of thinking that goes through good judgment among the President's protectors, then we are all in trouble. Roy Scheider performs well as President, but unfortunately is countered by the truly disgusting performance of Patrick Muldoon (who somehow continues to get jobs in Hollywood based solely on his good looks and his strange ability to smile at every opportunity, regardless of if the script asks for a smile). Maybe someone will see this and be inspired to make a good movie from the premise, or maybe someone will see it and say: "Hey, if you can get a movie so badly made, maybe I can too!"
