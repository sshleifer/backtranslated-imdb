This movie has been compared to the hilarious British comedy "A Fish Called Wanda", although I do not see why. The only connection I can find is that of Monty Python (Eric Idle in "Nuns", John Cleese and Michael Palin in "Wanda"). Otherwise, the two are incomparable. <br /> <br /> Inactive and Robbie Coltrane are two mobsters who want to get out of business before they end up dead, so they decide to cheat their boss and leave for Rio. When the getaway goes wrong, the two are forced to take refuge in a convent, as nuns. <br /> <br /> What at first promises to be a riot soon becomes a predictable average movie with the usual sexual jokes and no taste. Bland humor Once again, high places occasionally appear, but neither the cast nor the crew manage to inspire the procedures. The attempt at a "Wanda" manic finish also fails, along with the effort for "men in drag" humor, which is not surprising. When you think about it, men who try to be women are funny, men who try to be nuns are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Friday, April 22, 1994 - Video
