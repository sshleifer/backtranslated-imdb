Brass images (movies are not a suitable word for them) are actually a bit brazen. Its attractive visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high-class television commercials. But unfortunately the Brass images are feature films on the pretext of wanting to entertain the audience for more than two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable qualities, but rather soft and flabby to the erotic and rough do not resist. <br /> <br /> Senso '45 is a remake of a Luchino Visconti movie with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of love and senseless lust in and around Venice during the wars of Italian independence. Brass took the action of the nineteenth century to the twentieth century of 1945 to be exact, so there are murals by Mussolini, men in black shirts, German uniforms or the shredded garb of the partisans. But it's just a showcase, the historical context is completely insignificant. <br /> <br /> Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls in love with the amoral SS guy who always puts on too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well-trained Italian actress and clearly above the material. His wide range of facial expressions (sign of boredom, aversion, delight, fear, hatred ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to look at this image and it is worth two stars. She supports these basically garbage things with an amazing dignity. I want some really good parts to come for her. She really deserves it.
