Here's why this movie did not reach its potential (I do not read much, so I do not care how the novel was). 1. I think Brendan Frasier copied his man Encino from Lambert's Tarzan. He was rigid, and although his call to Tarzan was a little more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. They fucked up with the story. Maybe that's how the book works, but for as long as I can remember, Tarzan's first statements were "I Tarzan, you Jane." Jane is the first tarzan human encounter. I liked the natives a little more than the dwarf pygmy pygmies in Weismuller's version, but those bows and arrows were a little cheesy. 3. Tarzan is first and foremost a love story. I'm sorry, but the love interest goes more than an hour in the image. That qualifies her for a secondary role at best. Support roles and potential customers do not fall with each other, there is not enough screen time, I'm sorry. Not only was Andie McDowell violated on pathetic (probably because of her strong southern accent could not be masked) the chemical scale between Tarzan and Jane was a whopping 0. I never thought they loved each other, which made the Belgian uncles close the voice. frankly, silly. When Tarzan sees Jane for the first time in the jungle, he feels a need, if you will, for a feeling he has never felt before. Jane brings out humanity in him, and he brings out the indomitable side of her. It is this chemistry that compiles the history of Tarzan. Not that Lord Greystoke's last wish is to keep his entire land and that the boy John will do it for him. Even a good facelift could not avoid this movie. It needs a massive internal reconstruction. Oh, and we could shoot more in the jungle, or at least use camera angles that do not show the sound stage as qualities of the place. Final judgment, 4 out of 10. Sorry, tin man, and by the way, if you want to see the real performance, leave Lambert and check out Leonardo Dicaprio.
