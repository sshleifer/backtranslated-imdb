This is easily the worst adaptation of Greek mythology I have seen. It completely fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing twisted wefts and reducing the 12 labors to ... 3 or 4, I think. They invent totally unnecessary things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways that question the writers have read the myths, how to change from bird to harpy, from lions to sphinxes, the Oracle from Delphi to Tiresias and bulls to a pedantic version of Proteus , including integrating aspects, never seen outside the entertaining series of Sam Raimi, about his first marriage, with a woman with the chosen name of one of the Furies, so it sounds appropriate for the period. <br /> <br /> I could accept a lot of that, but it also completely fails in the standards of pure films; The most painful is the dialogue, the lead, the portentous pseudo-Shakespearean misbehavior. It is a bad reinterpretation of the myths, making a sad attempt at the kind of postmodern revisionism that Crichton's "13er Guerrero" tried with respect to the Beowulf legend, while including the strictly mythological elements, such as clear interference of The Gods and the super magic force. A sad and sad failure of an entertainment experience, I am sure that many of the quality actors involved deeply regret.
