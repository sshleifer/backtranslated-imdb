I lost 35 minutes of my life in this turkey before I gave up. The main character is completely clueless and surprisingly unfriendly, but there is no humor in his mistake. As soon as he arrives in Germany, the writer retires the old one: "there is only one room in the hotel, you will have to share a room with a pretty girl". Come on, at least you could let them develop their relationship a little first. Watch "It Happened One Night" to see how to do it right, or any of the thousands of movies since then. <br /> <br /> The performance is always of third category, and the improvised dialogue should have been left on The floor of the cutting room. It winds its way without any plan, even though the film telegraphs the fate of the relationship from the moment it is presented to Greta. <br /> <br /> The first song, in the boardroom, is slightly funny but badly sung. The rest of the songs (well, to be fair, I only heard those in the first half hour) are simply useless and horrible. Most singers are painfully out of tune, but not in an intentionally humorous way.
