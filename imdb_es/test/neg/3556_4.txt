The comedies of Ealing constitute their own specific subgenre in the history of cinema. They were ironic, funny reflections on British life in the late forties and early fifties. They are always fun, but I think it's deceptive to characterize them as comedies. They are windy and in a good mood, instead of laughing out loud. However, the best of them are tied with a discreet satire and are shot with an occasional dark streak (especially the Hearts and Hearts Hearts and the Ladykillers). <br /> <br /> I have an affection for all of them, but The Lavender Hill Mob is probably the one that costs me the most. Compared with the others, it seems superficial. For me, it's a sketch of a movie, but I needed to spend a lot more time in development before I was ready to go before the cameras. <br /> <br /> Everything is a little undercooked. For example, no one is given any real context or background. Henry is simply a druid duty, whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions are not recognized, while Albert is a frustrated artist who is forced to prostitute his talent by making the gift shop garbage for a living. This establishes a motive for his crime, but nothing that happens later is a consequence of his characters or his plan. <br /> <br /> Other characters are presented but they do not have a real role in the story. The elderly resident in Henry's guest house could (with his love for detective stories) have been turned into an involuntary thorn in his side, but only used as a "color" in the background. In a similar way, the various policemen who enter and exit the action are simply there to keep the plot moving forward. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film is totally directed by its artificial raster devices, which I find both frustrating and slightly irritating. The not very ingenious theft is achieved with minimal problems, although Albert was prevented from carrying out his part in the plan (by Sidney Tafler's Clayton). The gold is then smuggled into France without mishaps. Everything would have gone well had it not been for a minor problem, based on the French pronunciation of the letter 'R', which causes six of the Eiffel Eiffel to be sold accidentally to some English schoolgirls. <br /> <br /> This leads to a series of frantic chases while Henry and Albert seek to recover them. These scenes are well executed, but at each point the conspirators are frustrated in their search for the students for a series of totally fictitious accidents. It is as if God were deliberately intervening to make them have a hard time. This type of conspiracy always makes me grind my teeth. <br /> <br /> When they finally crawl the last Eiffel Tower to an exhibition of the Police Academy and snatch it from the nose of John Gregson's Inspector of Police (why is he there?) Anyway? fragments of raster logic are abandoned. The final chases of the car simply fill the screen time until we return to the framing device with which the image began. <br /> <br /> The film does not even bother to tell us the fate of Albert (Stanley Holloway), Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass). <br /> <br /> This small and brilliant career has the professionalism of the Ealing team, so it is far from being a bad movie. I suspect that most viewers will find it much more pleasurable than me (and why should not they?), But I can not help thinking that a much better movie was expected, if only more time and effort had been invested in it. the creation of meat. both the characters and the story. <br /> <br /> According to the standards set by Ealing, Lavender Hill Mob is a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> PS: A curious note is that Audrey Hepburn receives a credit for her unique line from the beginning, but Archie Duncan remains anonymous despite her much more substantial contribution. I guess she just had a better agent.
