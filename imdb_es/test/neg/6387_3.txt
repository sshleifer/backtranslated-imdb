South of Hell Mountain is one of the first films produced by the schlockmeisters at Cannon Film, a completely dazzling western that features flash-forward sequences in an asylum. Co-directed by William Sachs, who would then hand out fan favorites such as The Incredible Melting Man and Galaxina, the film tells the boring story of a trio of gold thieves who run into a hut occupied by two women who hide some secrets that do not it's worth discovering them. The cast (most of whom never made another movie) tries it boldly, but is paralyzed by the script, which generally makes no sense. Asylum scenes are edited with little effect and are marked by ridiculous sound effects and ribbon loops. Ultimately, it's a lot to talk about and little else.
