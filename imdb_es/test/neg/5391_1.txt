I, like so many others here, bought this movie at my local WM office in the container "Two for $ 11.00" cheap-or bin. I love horror movies and sci-fi B corny, and this definitely fits into that category. Quite a lot more than what everyone else here said is dead. Yes, it was bad, but that was to be expected. The "main" problem I had with this movie is that it was basically BORING. I mean it would be yawning-or-branch. The performance was bad, the costumes (the K Mart Skeletor suit in 1982) was worse, and the edition was horrible. There is no continuity. Mr. Skeletor finally dies in a kind of explosion ... uh, although he found a multiple explosion throughout this movement. I suppose the last one just passed bill in it. Apparently, the first encounters with this "military" group (cough) made a dent in his horse ... it would change from red to black throughout this crap party. Even for a B movie, do yourself a favor and skip it. The only good thing that serves me now is to add it to my DVD collection. Hopefully nobody will recognize it when they look at my movie collection. Thumb down, great time.
