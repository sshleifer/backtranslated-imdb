Even if Ryan was not such an annoying person, this would still be bad, I said even if, where do we start? "record of the directors" You will have the need to snatch your recorder and hit it with a hammer or beat it in a lake, an enchanted lake, of course. Oh, how I wish the "dead time" was more literal than what they refer to as, but, unfortunately, there's no death, maybe a pillow out of place or a "buzz", oh, wait, that's the cat. Actually I expected to see some kind of evidence or at least something to verify your adventures, do not worry, you will not see anything that you would not see on a normal day. <br /> <br /> A full season and whatever. Do you have to prove it? Nothing. No, in fact, they have less than nothing, they have a waste of time. They took my challenge, they did something for the paranormal challenge. Now, in this you really do something paranormal, you can say, go to the camera and say "I love the paranormal so much that I'll draw ghost figures" or "I love the paranormal so much that I'm going to shoot hot movies". The eds that pretend to be ghost hunters "you would be wasting film, but losing because of the paranormal." Or you can say "I'll go with a demon", but do not say it's a name you can hurt, and you know God does not like that That would be all for God but he would not like that, so do not do that, so I asked them to waste their time for the paranormal and followed his example, they entered an old building in search of "mothman", it was a Wasted time, it did not make any difference, it had no effect, we did not learn anything new, it was a waste of time and film. <br /> <br /> There, the amazing work of detective is so strange, "well, we found your problem ", a cat died here, so we communicate psychically with that cat and we tell it to keep going, like throwing some catnip, and it will be fine ...... the record of the directors ..." Start date of the Captain's record 541.2 ... oh, I mean "the record of the directors, I just brought in a few new researchers, a pair of 8 and 9, but this chic is a 10 ... um, yes ... we have a new case ... strange things are happening ... ... focusing on one of the children ... they were going to investigate ... "Now we will bring a psychic, we have not told you anything of this, it is TV. Trust us
