I am a little scared by some of these critics praising A.K.A. Not only do they sound like they are written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of privileged information that can surely only be found by reading the press book from beginning to end. Please, do not tell me that the director is writing his own reviews, since that would be too sad to contemplate. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that I am another of those who hated the movie and were surprised that he does not apologize. inexperience. Great idea, shame for the execution. And it was very disconcerting to see so many good actors (as well as some very bad ones, including the main character) who apparently thought they appeared in a series of very different movies. <br /> <br /> I wish AKA had been bold, innovative or just interesting. Unfortunately, it was like watching a home video without hysterical intent with artistic aspirations. A missed opportunity
