I've always been a fan of Bottom, capturing as many videos as I could find of the series here in the United States. The chemistry between Rik and Ade is always great, and the combination of intelligent writing and absolutely stupid humor seems to work flawlessly. So I sat down to watch this movie with great enthusiasm ... and I was completely disappointed in the ending. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the film can be described as boring and misdirected (sorry, Ade!), but with some absolutely brilliant moments. Unfortunately, these moments of laughter out loud make you realize how shining the rest of the movie is. The slapstick starts fun, but eventually it gets a little boring, with only perverted sexual jokes to keep things in the mood. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie (the "green" scenes, for those of you who have seen it) was ... maybe the worst ending I've seen in the last decade. Honestly. It was a joke that was repeated about thirty times, followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense (which did not bother me) and it was not funny (it did). <br /> <br /> In summary, I was very disappointed by this movie. I will cling to the few bright moments in it, to keep the most fervent memories I can ... but I must warn you that, if you are about to overpay for your NTSC conversion tape from the local importer, do not do it. There are much better things to spend your money on.
