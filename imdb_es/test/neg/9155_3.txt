Great book, bad movie. The cheesy presentations and artificial situations make this film a festival of sentimental boredom. The flat and uninspired work of most of the actors leaves this film in the special category After school. There is no doubt that there is a lot of talent in this cast and crew, but something went terribly wrong. The very talented Gretchen Mol tries to get this movie out of the mud, but even she does not seem to be able to overcome the stupid dialogue. It feels as if everyone has called him on the phone. Even makeup (Mulrooney, 20 years old, during the course of the film) seems amateur and raw. Do not waste your time with this pileup ... go read the book.
