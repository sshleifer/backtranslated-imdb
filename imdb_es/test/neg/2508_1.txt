This movie is so incredibly horrible! everything was rubbish. You can not say anything good about this movie, the acting, the script, the direction and the effects are as bad as the other. Even Ed Wood could have done a better job than this. I strongly recommended staying away from this movie, unless you want to lose about 100 minutes of your life or the time the movie lasted. I forget. This is the first time I wrote a comment about a movie in IMDb, but this movie was only on TV and I had to let the world know about movie lovers that this movie sucked balls !!!!!!!!! ! So if you have any decency left. Go and rent a much better bad movie like critters 3
