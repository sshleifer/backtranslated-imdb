I saw this movie last night. I do not usually comment well or badly, since I believe that movies are like books, because there is something for each person and each person is different, tastes vary, yadda yadda. This movie was bad. In the end I thought, oh my, this is testing my patience. How many women really look and live like this when they touch the "bottom" and if I could borrow some money from my mother and carry out my dreams of fashion design, my God, life would be great! I had a good movie to go out with my girl (my dear husband likes to watch movies together and I knew that this would not be his thing), something light and easy for the senses, but this was a bad movie. We are spectators of intelligent and interesting films and this movie was not that. Annette Benning is a great actress, she fought back. Bad. Bad.
