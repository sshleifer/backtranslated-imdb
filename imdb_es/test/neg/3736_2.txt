Feeling Minnesota, directed by Steven Baigelmann, and starring Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio: the tense relationship between two brothers, Sam (D'Onofrio) and Jjaks (Reeves), is pushed to a breaking point when Jjaks comes to Sam Freddie (Diaz), a former stripper, marries Sam to marry Sam and pay a gambling debt to the owner of a nightclub, Red (Lindo). The principle of writing and direction of Baigelman is a frustrating disorder, full of obnoxious characters and without coherence. Putting Keanu and Diaz in the same movie should provide at least some visual appeal, but Baigelman even controls the score in that respect, reprimanding his actors with little positive effect. Very poor.
