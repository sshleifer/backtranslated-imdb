I've been waiting for a comedy about the EVN, but this is a parody. It shows the East German national army in a light that is not appropriate, and it is definitely not true. <br /> <br /> One can make a comedy about everything, as long as the underlying facts are not changed. Even a comedy about the German KZ is possible, as Roberto Benigni has shown with "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL". <br /> <br /> The movie NVA would be a comedy "OK", because the jokes in it are good in general. Nothing special, it's not funny, but it's enough to live with. <br /> <br /> The point is that the movie is a farce and a parody on the NVA. A death machine that was ready to attack WEST EUROPE together with his friend the RED ARMY. An institution that used everything to get the most out of its soldiers. An army that entered the CSPR in 1968, and was ready to march also in POLAND to destroy SOLIDARNOSC. Can not you make a movie without showing the slightest evil, or would you make a parody about a KZ, Guantanamo or 9/11? Showing Osama bin Laden as a fun screwed guy? 90 minutes about a funny Osama in an Afghan Taliban camp, where he jokes and trains his soldiers, would be comparable to what this movie is doing about the NVA!
