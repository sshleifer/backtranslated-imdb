Hellraiser: Bloodline is where the mediocrity of the sequel to the Hellraiser series really sets. The imagination and the invention of the first two films are over. The spirit of Pinhead and his henchmen has gone. Gone are the sick desires of humans. In fact, everything that once made Hellraiser so original has been destroyed by this mess of an image. <br /> <br /> All that remains is the basic premise of Christian mythology that there is a Hell with evil demons. What happened to the evil that men do? This diluted excuse for a Hellraiser film is completed by the endless Psycho Babble, for Pinhead to become a meaningless philosopher and not in the omen of doom as he is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> The film uses the most basic formulas of movies with characters that separate and kill each other individually. Pinhead is not Alien. The link between the box and the 'demons' or 'Hell' is never established, only comes to a sacrifice and sits on a dresser. <br /> <br /> The main female character is called 'Rimmer' and the producers obviously think it's really funny because everyone keeps saying her name. Actually the film should have been renamed to give it the name of that character. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Kevin Yagher and Alan Smithee.
