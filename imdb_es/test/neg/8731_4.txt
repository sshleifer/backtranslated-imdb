I suppose I should take something like this with a grain of salt. These lab films (and, yes, they spend a lot of time in the lab), always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that single people who are doing nonsense have discovered secrets that go beyond anyone's understanding until this moment . Of course, they pay a price because their experimentation has the same deficiencies that Dr. Frankenstein had. There is always something that they did not anticipate. There are many things, from pure science to fashion, to young ladies and outrageous cover-ups that do not work here. The young woman is certainly looking and the doctor can not help himself, but he could have been a little discreet or even made an effort to protect what he was doing. Things go wrong and because of this intellect, she gains tremendous power, including an understanding of how she came to be. Rock Hudson looks pretty good here. However, he never does it in this role. It wanders everywhere with many clich√©s and nonsense that diminish the basic problem. Once she has her revenge, one more appropriate thing would be to get away and let her search for it and destroy it in some great way.
