I remember when "The Love Machine" was first released to theaters. I was barely 13 years old, I was too young to see the premiere of the film, but not too old to take my mother's paper copy of Jacqueline Susann's novel to school and analyze the "naughty snatches" with my classmates. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not sure what my problem was at such an early age, I was very interested in the book. I bought and used an "ankh" ring as on the cover of the paperback, and I remember the ads for the "Xanadu" perfume that was cross-promoted and presented awkwardly in the film. Despite such interest, I did not see the film until several years later. I should have left things the way they were. <br /> <br /> "The Love Machine" is, without a doubt, the worst of the many bad films adapted from Susann's novels ... which, of course, makes it the most fun to watch. Its flaws are many: from its script that jumps jerkily from one incident to another without a connection thread; its date, horny (metal instruments, I mean) music by Ersatz Bacharach; the floor, first performances; Boring sexuality: I've never seen bathrobes so prominent in a movie before. It's like a fetish! When you ask for sex, nudity or something sordid, someone with a blue tunic appears! Very strange, that; and without a doubt, the circus train of the modest fashions of the 70 that are exhibited without end. Poor Dyan Cannon's performance (which is not a good shake anyway, but is aimed at the rest of the cast) is constantly undermined by the amazing outfits she must wear. However, the main responsibility of the film is the stoic, John Philip Law, with stone aspect, as (appropriately) Robin Stone, the object of the affection of all the girls (and one on the most striking male photographers). <br /> <br /> Law is simply horrible and behaves as if he had been taken off the street, hastily handed the pages of the script and told to give a cold reading on the spot. Only lifeless! Not only that, but it seems he desperately needs a blood transfusion or something like that. He looks pale and sickly all over his body and is much smaller than most of his female costars. Robin Stone should be a piece, not a handkerchief. <br /> <br /> For anyone who finds the film difficult (it is quite slow by today's standards) I beg you to stay for the "fight scene". Here, Mrs. Cannon (balancing 23 pounds of dull hair) finally abandons her hitherto starched-up performance style and lets go of that infectious laugh from her, setting in motion a truly memorable game for everything that should have become a highlight of the game. movie theater. Trying to rival the infamous wig scene in the toilet of "Valley of the Dolls", "The Love Machine" finally does something right. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Susann's unique garbage brand is very strange. Maybe someone out there owns the rights to "The Lovomaniacs" by Rona Barrett and will revive the genre.
