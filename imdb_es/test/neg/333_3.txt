I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only criticism that gave this movie a suspiciously high rating of 9/10. I say suspicion because it looks less like a review, but more like a publicity statement. Maybe the filmmaker himself, or one of his colleagues, has written that "criticism". Naughty, naughty. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV hoping it was really horrible. The special effects used were honest, very good for a low budget movie, and some of the performances were not that bad either, but most of the performances were really horrible, but well done to try, as I think most were friends of the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmaker has done very well in trying to hit above his weight. I found something funny about the movie because I was trying to be super cool when it just was not. <br /> <br /> If you do not take this movie too seriously and you see it drunk with some partners, it might well have a good time, but probably not in the intended way. This movie is not in any way a 9/10, but it is worth seeing it to laugh taking into account that it was made with a very low budget and with a fair credit to those who participate in its production.
