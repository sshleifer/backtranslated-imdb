I just do not receive these comments! I can not help thinking that they are written by the kind of LOG fanatic who would love anything they did without questioning if it really is good. <br /> <br /> I'm a massive fan of the show, but I thought This movie was a nonsense project. I could forgive the ridiculous plot if I had left the cinema after laughing more than twice. At one point, I thought it might be just for me before I realized that almost no laugh came from the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much from a plot (very few television comedies resist being stretched for more than 90 minutes) but thought the strange thing about LOG's classic dialogue or visual joke (like at the beginning of each program) would take a movie. After 5 minutes of the plot of the seventeenth century, I begged it to end (little did I know it would continue for the rest of the movie). It just was not funny. <br /> <br /> I was greatly disappointed and I can not see the story being too kind, even if a few enthusiastic fans write enthusiastic comments.
