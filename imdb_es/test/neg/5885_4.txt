This is an extremely technically competent film. The work and the direction of the camera are excellent and the acting is also good, especially the good performance of Daniel Auteuil as Marqu√©s. I really thought there were no problems at all with these aspects of the movie. On the other hand, I was a little disturbed by the way in which the Marquis was portrayed, since he did not seem so honest and seems to be a very revisionist vision of history. In fact, in recent years, the Marquis has undergone a small transformation to become a defender of freedom with great insight, not the fat sado-masochist rapist he really was. In a way, this is very reminiscent of the bleaching that occurs in THE PEOPLE VERSUS LARRY FLINT, where these men are elevated to the category of hero. Even if you do not think the Marquis's perversions were not so bad (including rapes and extreme violence), his representation in this film as a "social worker" in this prison seems pretty silly. Instead of the violent and selfish Sade, he spends a lot of time carefully grooming a young virgin and slowly helping her explore her own sensuality. What a nice and kind man. In fact, now that I think about it, this performance reminds me of the man Maurice Chavalier played in GIGI (but without singing), an older man who loves ladies. I doubt very much that the real-life Marquis de Sade would have recognized this character at all! <br /> <br /> The film, surprisingly, does not have much nudity, although what it shows is extremely explicit. Only a maniac would let his children see this as this is a very adult drama. It is very well done and it is quite entertaining, but not so sincere. The director admits that the film is largely fictional in the interview between the special features of the DVD that I saw. So go ahead, watch the movie if you wish; understanding it simply is not very good historically. During the eighteenth century, sexual libertines were quite accepted in France, since they had a fairly broad mentality, so despite what the film implies, it was not the sex issue, the violence and the rape that was (and is still) the problem.
