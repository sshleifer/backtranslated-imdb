I usually love Jackie Chan's movies, but this one was terrible. There are only 2 or 3 fight scenes, all of which meet the normal standard more or less. The downside of this movie is that it focuses a lot on chasing cars / races. The pursuit of cars is not so bad (although it is not as exciting as fighting) but the car races at the end are exceptionally boring. Basically it takes all the things that make a Jackie Chan movie a Jackie Chan movie and leaves out everything except Jackie Chan. Even the traditional shots at the end lack their usual humor. <br /> <br /> I suppose that to a certain extent it was made worse by the fact that I saw one of those horrible doubled versions. I usually try to see the subtitled version ... I wish I could understand Chinese. <br /> <br /> I've only seen a movie of Jackie worse than this and that was one of his first forays into Hollywood movies that did not turn out so well. <br /> <br /> Avoid it unless you are really curious or a lover of motorized sports.
