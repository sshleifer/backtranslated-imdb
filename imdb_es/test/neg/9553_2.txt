The Boston Blackie movies have some strengths, mainly because the pace is fast and the hero is not disturbed in the worst circumstances. But the conspiracy is often atrocious, and the relentless comic bits often kill the beat (if the plot turns out to be uncharacteristically good) or simply are not funny and inappropriate. Asylum (Steve Cochran in a really poor performance) who has become obsessed with the beautiful Nina Foch (who has a good job of quite subtle acting). Inspector Farraday, of course, believes that Blackie has become a homicidal maniac (at least he has some evidence of this), and is trying to imprison him incompetent while Blackie goes after the real killer. The plot has possibilities, but any time any real tension arises, we can obtain a comedy routine that is not fun. It seems that no one in Columbia understood that, in a movie about finding a really dangerous maniac, small and funny comedy scenes about hiding an inconvenient body of the inspector interrupt any voluntary suspension of disbelief. (One just concluded that our clever hero is an idiot, deadly for a movie like this one). <br /> <br /> This one is not worth it. For a well-plotted episode of this series, see Alias ​​Boston Blackie.
