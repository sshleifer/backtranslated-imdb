Apparently, the film has a harsh anti-Bush message ... If it has (I did not understand), that's it. It's boring and useless, period. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's too serious to be a comedy, too slow to be a thriller, it's not funny, it's not exciting, it's not exciting, it's not a movie. It is too much to be the opposite, and vice versa. I was surprised how bad a movie could stink. Do not even think about seeing it. <br /> <br /> I've seen literally hundreds of movies, and I've never been so forced to write a warning on IMDb. Avoid at all costs. They have warned you. <br /> <br /> Even "The Making of ..." is painfully boring. It's just people who talk bad humor with a lot of internal jokes in front of a camera, something like a home movie. There is even a part in which a boy takes you on a tour of the food that was consumed on set by the film crew. Still, it surpasses the movie that I suppose ...
