I'm thinking about some things for this movie: First, it's really a very bad movie. This is really "Superbad". The film looked very promising in the trailers, but it was not flat ... Maybe the original idea was good, but between a bad script and a bad performance, the film became boring and empty. My advice is to not lose 2 hours of your precious time. You have been warned. This is the first movie I rated with 1 star on IMDb.com ... Secondly, none of the characters is nice. You really do not care what happened to them ... Third, the villain is very easy to identify. The grandson kills his father, sodomizes the friend's son, leaves the maiden pregnant, suffocates his grandfather ... As JT says: "If you like evil without retribution, this is your movie". Nothing more to say...
