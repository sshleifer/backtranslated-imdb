It is difficult to know exactly what to say about this little film so dull and boring. The story is predictable when it is not completely ridiculous. Everything is a matter of "obedient gestures" that, as presented here, have no conviction. Yes, MGM's "production values" are magnificent, and yes, Ms. Lamarr was exquisitely beautiful, but she and the great Spencer Tracy do not have any "chemistry" together, and that's the only thing that this parade would have done. clich√©s in all cash ... I understand that this film received bad reviews when it was originally released; The passage of time has not improved it.
