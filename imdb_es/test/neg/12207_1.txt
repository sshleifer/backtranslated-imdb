This version of David Copperfield is terrible from start to finish. I knew we were in a wasted night when a little foolish to the point of shame Attenborough and Olivier camp like two bad guys. Everything went downhill after this. Aunt Betsy was adequate, but she did not have the eccentric style for which she excelled. The worst of the worst was the producer's choice for Uriah. This was the version of the music room of this character, previously and admirably played by Roland Young. And what was all this self-absorbed anguish of David. Dickens must have turned in his grave to see his favorite son turned into a wimp who cried in his beer. <br /> <br /> This was a time when Hollywood knew more than old England.
