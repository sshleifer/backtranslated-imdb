I found this movie at the flea market for little money. I was so excited because I thought it was a skate movie. I got home, the rules of the previews and the opening scene with the old man rolling down the street on a skateboard was amazing. At that time I realized that it was a post-apocalyptic film, but I still had high hopes. This movie was horrible. A friend of mine went crazy when we saw him and even he thought it was horrible and a loss of being elevated. I fell asleep during the movie because it was very boring and the music was absolutely horrible. I do not know if during the apocalypse all the good music is destroyed, and all the music that is just a kind of shit is destroyed and all the memories of how to play it are erased, but I think I would rather die than have to endure that shit. Besides, what the hell was going on with the television studio? I can only assume that this film was adapted from an old Greek work, with the names and the title, but some works are not intended to be adapted in a futuristic science fiction environment. Or at least not for the people who participated in this movie. If you are forced to watch this movie, I can only suggest that you take a gun and finish before it ends. It would also be a good movie to kill you, everyone will understand why.
