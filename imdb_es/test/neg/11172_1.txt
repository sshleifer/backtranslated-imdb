Do not be fooled by the offline plot as described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story about this seems quite interesting, with speculative clues. Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the saddest movie experience I've had in my life ... It's simple and accurate and should not be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the plot seems intriguing, think about this: phones can move, run and kill people like any other electrical device. He can throw things at you, chase you and run after you. PLEASE, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, it's a shame for the horror genre ...
