Because everyone just watches there MST3K with their artificial friends who do (mostly) not so funny and obvious comments about movies. And that's the only way these people see them and then they comment on them and reject them in the IMDb based on that alone, they do not even try to watch the movie themselves. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in itself, I did not read the reviews first, I did not have some people to say what to laugh about, I just bought the DVD (bought from the other side, Morons From Outer Space, an old one favorite) and I saw it <br /> <br /> Because I knew something of what I was expecting when it was a Golan Globus film, Albert Pyun, but it can usually be quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> The film is not too stressful for the brain Alice for the story of Rabbit-hole made so many times, and similar in its basic structure (but completely different in content) to Warlords of Atlantis, another entertaining movie B. <br /> <br /> The voice was annoying, but that's the idea, that they even poke around with a few lines in the movie. <br /> <br /> The hero character had one of the worst voices and top accents. in english language fi I am history, but you get to accept it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but it's not really a bad movie, it's just a bit of the average B-Movie DTV movie type, nothing too new, nothing too outstanding, and I would probably enjoy it more a young man (for example, from 7 to 14 years old) than me. It's a bit of cheerful fantasy. <br /> <br /> Will I see it? again, probably not about 10 years ago, I would have. <br /> <br /> Do not be so hard with a movie because a couple of puppets have also told you, this movie is not being taken seriously and certainly there is no Troll 2 or Space Mutiny.
