A professional production with quality actors who simply never touched the heart or the funny bone, no matter how hard they tried. The cast of quality, the marked stage and the excellent cinemography made you wait for Fargo or High Plains Drifter, but I'm sorry, the soup had no seasoning ... no meat. A 3 (out of 10) per effort.
