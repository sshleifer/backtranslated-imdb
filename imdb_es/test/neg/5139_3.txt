I just finished seeing Disappearances at AFI FEST 2006 with another 30 people in a 1000 seat auditorium, mostly vacancies. The programmer of the festival, after seeing the lack of audience, began his initial comments with "Well, at least some of the festival goers have good taste in the cinema". Well, Mr. Programmer, after watching this movie, I must respond: "No, we do not, and neither do you!" This "behind the times" piece follows Wild Bill (not so much) while he and his mystical family dangerously run illegal Canadian whiskey across the border during the US ban. The former outlaws (Kris Kristofferson and company) not only need the money to save their ramshackle farm in Vermont, but also want to introduce the little Wild Bill to the virtues of virility. <br /> <br /> Although they are very well photographed, this story of adventures. It lacks what makes movies of this kind good, "tension" and credibility. Kristofferson's lackluster performance and dry monologue remind me of a dream I once had where Al Gore played the role of Willy Wonka. I just did not care and when the mystical grandmother of the Wild Bills appears out of nowhere to give you advice, it just did not fit. Yes, I almost fell asleep more than once. <br /> <br /> Gary Farmer does a good job as Cameron Frye in the character of Ferris Bueller; Big Bill's brother-in-law, while teenager Chris McDermott uses those piercing blue eyes for his acting benefit. <br /> <br /> But overall, expect to see the Jay Cravens Disappearances playing in a $ 2 Blocker Pool near you.
