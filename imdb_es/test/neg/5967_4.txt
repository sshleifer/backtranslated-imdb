I saw the movie in original Italian. It must be said that the performance and the interpretation are more strongly contaminated by the tendency generated by the television to speak with a severely muffled voice, without moving the lips, the tense tones, as it emerged in the productions "That is real life" and " Let's increase "-an audience-with-some-tears-screen-playwriting. The late Massimo Girotti relies on the other characters for their intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. The film has some good advice, but (as in another commentary previous to mine) it lacks a focal point and dribbles in many plots of less or less relevance, another tendency dragged by the television productions, well known by the Italians. Some drops of style can be saved to the public, like the drag of the confectionery (charm and aesthetics of the most sensual kitchen loads of sweets, see Chocolat, the lunch of Babette, Vatel, etc.) Hammam and the fairies are definitely more truthful , it seems that Ozpetek learned the melody of Italy at the beginning of the 2000s and keeps humming ... although I will give him one last chance ...
