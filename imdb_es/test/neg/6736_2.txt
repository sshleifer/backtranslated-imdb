I saw that "The Foreigner" was classified in the "Bottom 100" movie lists here in IMDb, so I did not expect much when I connected to the US channel. UU A week ago, but I had hopes. "Belly Of The Beast" (which aired a month ago) was a disaster, but it had great landscapes and pictures and some very funny moments scattered all over the world, so I thought that this movie could have something of the same. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie does not meet the standards of basic surveillance capability in almost every respect. The script appears as the bastard son of a novel by John LeCarre and a film by Richard Ludlum, but made by people without the talent of writers and characters worthy of those worthy writers. Instead, what we got is a nest of cryptic mares, moody, mosques, malicious, entangled alliances and shots in the back. And shootings in the chest. And the bombings. And eviscerations. This is translated into the directional style, which is based on three-dimensional 'granular shot / slow motion' shots every 10 seconds, along with the work with hyperactive jump cables and cuts. These film devices were obsolete 10 years ago when the MTV directors used them for the Whitesnake videos, and the director works them as a punch, hoping to inject some coldness of techno thriller into the art. <br /> <br /> The same Segal is just horrible in this. The whole movie is spent speaking in a hoarse and guttural half whisper, alternating between two expressions: he seems to be sucking a lemon while someone shakes a small turbo under his nose, or seems constipated. And it's so thick (and in vain) that you never really take off your knee duster with the camera. I understand that it is difficult to keep the girth under control as a male actor ages (although Denzel Washington and Paul Newman never seemed to have that problem). But you solve it by being honest about it, and growing as an actor, not hiding it with carefully chosen camera angles and tunics. <br /> <br /> So I can not really tell what's going on, and the movie does not give me a reason to worry about what's going on, and the protagonist is completely one-dimensional and visually unattractive. It is not a recipe for a good cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, most sets and scenarios are atmospheric and striking; In fact, if I froze the film in almost any scene that was not a close-up of Seagal, I would be impressed by the care and professionalism of the lighting, the colors and the composition, and by how beautiful Eastern Europe is. The settings are. But dressing a rotten egg like a Faberg√© egg can not make it edible. And the procedures are rotten in the heart. <br /> <br /> There are "great" movies (like "Versus"), and there are visually stunning but emotionally cold films (like "Underworld") and there are paranoid conspiracy thrillers (like "The Bourne Identity" and their new version with Matt Damon). And then there is this thing, which can not decide what it wants to be, pretends to be all these things and fails because it has no guts or soul. <br /> <br /> This is a movie made by professionals with a real budget, so it really can not be put in the same class as "Hands", "Killer Shrews" or "Hobgoblins". But I prefer to watch those three movies in a row several times than see "The Foreigner" one more time.
