For the record, I hate fake movies. Except for Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE! because those are classics and they make fun of clich√©s, not the movies themselves. I think the fake films are the bottom of the barrel for both the comedy and the movie. Especially I hate the things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the "geniuses" behind DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE, and MEET THE SPARTANS. <br /> <br /> I decided to take a look at THE COMEBACKS. As Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with production, I was as objective as possible. It was like one of his movies. Basically, all sports movies were combined with kindergarten jokes, and the disturbing images of bodily injuries supposedly make me laugh and fail. <br /> <br /> Only someone who would make fun of them would laugh at these jokes. Toilet? Who wrote this? a boy of 11 years? I was surprised to see that this was the creation of the producers of WEDDING WEDDINGS, which was actually quite decent. But the attempt to make the parody genre as fun as a burning orphanage. The only reason I gave these two stars (when I clearly deserved one) was because Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with this.
