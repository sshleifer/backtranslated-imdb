Lame thymus of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): the first half is deadly bland, even lugubrious, but the last stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the unbridled 'monster'. At the accompaniment party (a pretty dry affair in just 9 minutes, compared to those created for the other titles of the "Monsters & Madmen" set by Criterion), director Day, who admits to not being a fan of the science fiction genre : try to justify the shortcomings of the movie by saying that I had a zero budget to work with (where all the scenes from outer space were composed of footage) ... and I would have been inclined to be more lenient with the movie I had not seen recently CALTIKI, THE IMMORTAL MONSTER (1959) - a similar (and similarly threadbare) but much more elegant adventure from Italy. <br /> <br /> Bill Edwards, as the arrogant but unfortunate astronaut, obsessed with achieving the titular feat, is positively boring at first, but finally manages to capture the sympathy of the audience when his physical characteristics are deformed and the character develops a taste for blood Marshall Thompson as his commanding officer and his older brother is OK like a slimmer guy from Glenn Ford; previously he had starred in FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1958), another (and more successful) science fiction produced by Richard Gordon that, incidentally, is also available on DVD through Criterion. The Italian star Marla Landi, struggling with the English language, becomes an inadequate female leader; Even its entry into the featurette is of little lasting value! <br /> <br /> The Audio Commentary is another pleasant song by Tom Weaver / Richard Gordon in which, among many things, the fact that FIRST MAN INTO SPACE was designed as a double function with CORRIDORS OF BLOOD (1958 ) up - but finally it was published as a stand-alone version, to exploit the value of current news of the current space race; It is also mentioned that the dialogue of the monster was actually nicknamed by Bonar Colleano (who, tragically, died in a traffic accident before the premiere of the movie!). Weaver even remembers a couple of anecdotes from the time he took part in the production of the DVD with a film made by, of all people, the former filmmaker Norman J. Warren: Landi, who by then had become a lady of title, I was still ready to help carry the necessary equipment to film the interview in several flights of stairs! Edwards was supposed to have contributed to the exercise, but, once in London, he was reluctant to cooperate with Weaver; finally, the latter knew that the actor had recently been diagnosed with cancer and, in fact, he died in 2002!
