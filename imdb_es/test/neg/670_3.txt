Compared to other "sand and sandal" rates, Egyptian leaves a lot to be desired. The film is based very loosely on the well-researched novel by Mika Waltari, which focuses on the adventures of the Egyptian doctor Sinhue at the court of Akhnaton, as well as on his travels through Canaan, Minoan Crete and Africa. Unfortunately, due to the moral restrictions of the time, much of Sinhue's story (which is full of romantic and sexual exploits) remains on the floor of the cutting room and, on the other hand, the public is used to the reels and the drums of Victor Mature's wooden performance. Even Gene Tierney? A "basic" main lady of the time? she can not manage to look or act in the best way in this film and offers a rather sleepwalking performance that can only be justified by the fact that the actress was having some serious psychiatric problems at that time. There is a great deal of rhetoric and theological machinations about the idea of ​​monotheism versus polytheism, but Michael Wilding is as strenuous as the revolutionary Akhnaton, who is surely encouraging someone to throw him out and restore the old religion before the second reel. My advice: buy the E-Bay book, rent something more entertaining like Solomon and Sheba and then call it a night!
