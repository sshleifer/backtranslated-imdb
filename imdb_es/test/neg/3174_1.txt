This movie is terribly bad. It can be said that all actors are ashamed to associate with a really terrible movie. There are obvious budget restrictions, but with a little thought and attention to detail, the movie could have been much better. For example: look at the scene where Mickey first goes to the morgue and talks to his friend's pathologist while the murdered taxi driver lies on the slab. You can actually see the breathing of the corpse! What, could not they afford to hire a decent half extra that could hold their breath for a 2 minute scene?
