The funniest thing about Fortunes is that one of the main characters, Lewis (Urbaniak) has a writer's block and apparently also the screenwriter of the movie. This is also sad, as I suppose it's generally supposed to be a comedy or a drama, but that's the most fun I can remember seeing this. <br /> <br /> Three friends go out and drink one night. On the way home, two decide that a "gypsy" tell them his fortune, as they call it. Those two lives are undone while the third friend stays by his side. Then, nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I hope I did not spoil the movie there, but in reality, this very low budget and poor quality movie had some kind of idea when it started, but it quickly vanished into the depths of hell. Yes, I'm being hard. Honestly, it was not so bad, it was just blah. <br /> <br /> The writer mentioned above was annoying to see, although he delivered maybe one or two of the only two funny phrases. The clich√© "ladies", the only one who was not told his fortune was simply annoying. The only bright spot was the remaining friend, the married father who was told to fortune that something big was going to happen to his son and that he needed to be prepared. He was funny, genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie. Unfortunately, that does not say much. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's too cruel. Hell, they had the ambition to make a movie, they went and got funds and they achieved something. Unfortunately, however, I can not recommend the film, since there are hundreds of thousands of other independent films that have hundreds of thousands of best ideas and executions. This was, literally, 10 minutes of an idea stretched another 81 boring minutes.
