This was a surprisingly bad movie and I literally gasped the first time I saw the puppets on the blue screen. Imagine the worst special effects of the blue screen you've seen, make them somehow much worse, and then combine this with badly made rubber and Play-doh puppets that look like something from a pre-retarded pre-school art class. Then, add some guitar solos that are too noisy and that last too long, like Yngwie Malmstein-esquire, melodic metal guitar solos. The film in general is absolutely horrible and makes "Feeders" look like "Rashomon". It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, with every quantifiable metric in a downward spiral, much like a mob flooded in the slow, perpetual whirlpool of a Rest Stop toilet. However, however, a movie like "Actium Maximus" should not be missed because of the bad movie you play, even if you only look for clips on YouTube or elsewhere. This movie is a bit revealing, if you can handle the trip. However, I think that this director may be mentally ill, which is a little degrading. When you see him discuss the project, you have the feeling that he really believes he has created something wonderful. I guess it's the "Star Wars child" of the gonzo filmmakers. What a mess. :-)
