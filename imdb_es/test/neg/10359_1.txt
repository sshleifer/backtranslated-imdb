I have read the positive comments about this movie. I assume that the people who were in this movie must have come to this site to give it a good press because this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I always watch the whole movie despite the quality or lack of it, which explains why I've seen this whole movie, but I do not think I've laughed even once for the duration of this movie. Most of the jokes were very bad, but when the jokes promised something, the delivery was wrong. If you liked it, maybe you should put aside the outbreaks because you need to preserve the 5 or 6 brain cells that you have left. This film had a bad script, bad acting, bad direction, weak plot ... nothing of virtue and it was not entertaining. If you have not seen this movie, do not do it.
