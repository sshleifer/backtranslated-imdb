This movie was total garbage. I was sitting watching this absolutely furious that this was funded. They definitely spent all their budget on the special FX instead of the scriptwriter and the director and some of the actors. <br /> <br /> First, the performance was bland and bland. The story was not sufficiently relatable with the audience. Instead of being from the perspective of the storm of the people, the narrative was more told by figures of the government and the army, which is not really a way to connect with them, since most of us hate politicians from anyway. The writer tried to add a human element to the unrealistic characters by adding the small secondary plot about the father and the son, which completely failed. <br /> <br /> As for the direction ... oh, God, your techniques to treat and create tension and discomfort are repetitive and exaggerated. The accelerated movement of the camera and then the sudden flash of flash in a character's face when something horrible happened was pathetic. <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw it until the end was to see the special effects. What is bad, since special effects should not make the film, should only expand the story and experience. There was no story. <br /> <br /> I would not really bother to see this, the total garbage and a shame for the British film industry.
