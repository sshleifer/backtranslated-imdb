I just gave a 10 for Thieves Highway. I mention this for two reasons, one to show that I am not a git that only gives bad reviews, but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread: the infatuation of a woman. of the night. <br /> <br /> We all know that Pretty Woman is a movie for girls, but you can not avoid them all, they will eventually catch you. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two horrible things, horrible, in the first place, it represents prostitution as a career more similar to that of a dancer, and you know that with absolutely great friends, many legs that laugh, that are borrowed each other In the reality of Pretty Woman, the prostitute, it is a street passer. Prostitute of which we speak here, has a great life, is healthy, happy with only an occasional moan to explain his situation. My feeling is that this protagonist of the type 'happy Hooker' is much more appetizing than a character even almost realistic, which for me is the question if you make a film about a type of person but you are too scared to decorate that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but I do not want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat, why make a film about a chef in the first place? By rescuing and converting the whore into a respectable type of dancer, the story loses its meaning completely and, therefore, never gives up any of the moral or social issues that might have, what a scandal, really is stupid. <br /> <br /> Secondly, 'Pretty Woman' insults the romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no idea how to seduce or fall in love with this 'lady' without her plastic friend, yes, Do not leave home without It's like that, especially if you're an imbecile in a suit that has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of your romantic moments involve splashing money one way or another, even when you first meet her, it's the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here, limousines there, money money money, where is the charm? Where is the charism? Do not mention that attempt to play the piano, please. <br /> <br /> Girls who like this movie will also be girls who like to shop more than most. The guys who like this movie will not even have noticed that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, since they probably do not have it either, so they will not have registered. More importantly, everyone who likes this film will hate 'Thieves Highway', a wonderful story in which part is based on the same theme. <br /> <br /> I'll finish with a song: <br /> <br /> Pretty woman hanging down the street Pretty woman, the kind that I like to treat Pretty woman, I do not believe you You're not the truth Nobody could spend so much Like you Mercy <br /> <br /> Pretty woman, Do not forgive me Pretty woman, I could not help but see Pretty woman, and you look beautiful as it can be, you lack imagination like me <br /> <br /> Pretty woman , buy a while Pretty woman, speak a pretty woman, sell me your smile pretty woman, yes, yes, pretty woman, look my way Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me ... and I'll pay you ... I'll treat you well
