Undoubtedly, one of the movies with racial prejudices that I have never seen, with the prejudice directed against Hayden Panettiere, since he has to move to a tough school in the city. She is constantly called "white girl" and other slanders based on her color. First, would this be allowed the other way around if a black girl was the target of all abuses? and secondly, the stereotype of ethnic children from the inner city school is also a disgrace. The apparent desire of the writers to show that they were "modern" also extended to the point of losing the point that the downtown school won cheerleaders, not through talent, but by intimidating their opponents. whites. These nuances of the film took him away from the expected direction of a happy and innocuous comedy suitable for a family audience in a vehicle that does not give credit to any of the participants. Hayden Panettiere has a star quality, but I would be surprised if the rest of the class went further. In short, a movie without charm that was a waste of time.
