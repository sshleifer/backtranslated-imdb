"Ashes of Time" was a bold project, but ended up being a pretentious movie. This movie is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex way. The plot of "Ashes of Time" is quite simple and is reduced to two words: "amorous triangle". Due to these "love triangles" that cross stories, jealousy, hatred and love are the main dynamics that the characters show. The narrative part is seen through the eyes of Ou-yang Feng (Leslie Cheung). Ou-yang Feng lives in the desert, where he acts as an intermediary for several swordsmen and becomes the tool of Destiny through which revenge is achieved. Unfortunately, "Ashes of Time" fails to tell these simple stories of love and hate. Wong Kar-wai was lost because of the desire to make each picture of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience. In fact, in addition to the casting of beautiful actors (men and women), everything else is a failure in this film. The dialogues are minimalist and are nothing original. The quality of the image is very uneven, the editing is one of the worst ever (at least by me) in the genre of "sword games" and, finally, the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and attractive Even the attempt to construct artistic scenes is not always achieved: the so-called erotic scene of "women on a horse" is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. Wong Kar-wai wanted to offer 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a movie comes first about how a story is told. By forgetting that he delivers an uncomfortable movie that does not even meet his artistic goal.
