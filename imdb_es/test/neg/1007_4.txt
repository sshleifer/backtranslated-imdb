I was disappointed in the third film of the series "Death Wish" and I would not recommend it unless I'm really interested in Bronson. He is his usual self in this case, perhaps a little more cheerful than in the others; The rest of the cast is good if you're watching a movie of the week on TV: the whole movie has the production value of a bad episode of Team A and I like the escapism fun of a show like Team A, but not on the big screen, even if it's an action movie that does not claim to be anything fancy. The film takes a while to get going and then, when it finally does, it goes out of control to the point of being ridiculous. The plot is something taken from an episode of "Highway to Heaven" and Bronson looks like a fish out of water with the majority cast of old people and the game of weapons is so out of control that you do not even get any satisfaction for Bronson's revenge against the bad guys. Skip this and continue with the 4th installment that I highly recommend
