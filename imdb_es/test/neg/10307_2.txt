I love this program. I watched all the episodes last year. I bought the DVDs. And I tune in to see tonight and I see, for some reason, that you have renewed this great show. And you have taken what made it work and you ruined it. You took one of the best aspects of the show, which were the 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I also love the other characters, but they are good at small dozens like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It's as if the program is losing something of its family and everyone else is trying to complete it. It is an overdose. While things are fun in small doses when you are exposed to them, all the time goes from fun to annoying. I was so anxious for the return of this show. So please bring the charm back. Even if you can not include Piper in the program, at least go back to Lizzy. But I loved those girls. They brought the fun. The show was about Sam trying to live his business life and manage his personal life and his friends as well. That was the charm. And that great dog too. <br /> <br /> I hope that the network (FOX) has forced the writers to do this and that the writers have not done this voluntarily to the show. I'll give the show a couple of more episodes before I give up, but the episodes tonight were bad. I made a great deal with the show that was coming back tonight and there were people coming up to me and I felt like a fool, because nobody laughed, except two or three times. I apologized to them and told them that I do not know what happened. And 10 minutes into the episode, I realized that they were not going to show Piper or Lizzy and this was no longer a must-see for television comedy.
