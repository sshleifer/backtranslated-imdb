The plot: A group of young people with ridiculous names (Hutch, Swink, Phineaus and October) are united by the death of their friend Loomis, equally ridiculously named. After the funeral, they decide to divide the belongings of their deceased friend. Among them is a video game called Stay Alive. The group decides that there is no better way to show their pain than all those involved in a small virtual bloodshed. But the more they play, the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor Olom Loomis. <br /> <br /> Production: this movie is just another entry to the latest low-budget Hollywood fashion. The PG-13 horror meant to capitalize on the high school crowd. The direction is careless to say the least with quick cuts of music video style that make the action difficult to follow. The dialogue is so bad that it actually kills brain cells. The plot is so full of holes that we do not even learn where the game came from or why those who play it die. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this film, although not entirely original, had some promise. But poor execution on both sides of the camera makes this a big failure. <br /> <br /> If you ever have a desire to "kill someone in a video game, you die in real life" horror movie Follow my advice and omit Stay Alive for the top Brainscan.
