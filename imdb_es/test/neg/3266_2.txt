Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself, but compared to the original one it can not be stacked. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while fun can not compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is fun, being the only character in the original. Most of the other characters in the film lack the blow of the original (Henry Wilcoxon, for example), except the hysterical lawyer Peter Blunt, played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the original humor, especially the scene in his office (I do not go into legal demands or motions, I find out where you live and I come to your house and hit the door with a whore) * ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale, maybe grab that golden retriever (arff arff arff) and then eat it. And then I'm going to go up to the upstairs room, and I'm grabbing him by the brooks brothers pjs and cramming his new BMW up his tight one **! Do we have an understanding?). However, compensating for his small role, is Dan Acroyd, who obviously does not replace Bill Murray. His voice is more than irritating and everything he does is not even funny, it's just stupid. In general, Caddyshack II is a good movie, but compared to the original incredible, it simply can not be cut.
