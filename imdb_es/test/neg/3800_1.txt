Unhappy. Talk about fudge. BEYOND POSEIDON ADVENTURE is bad in every respect. The rescuers Michael Caine and Karl Malden decided to tow the shipwreck of the transatlantic of the same name with a very squeaky tugboat. They are challenged by the ruthless Telly Savalas and his band of machine-gun thugs. This part sequel, part remake has Caine, Malden and ANOTHER group of Poseidon survivors making a similarly dangerous trip out of the sinking ship. Among this group are Shirley Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, Shirley Knight and Slim Pickens. Jack Warden plays a blind man. Surely, you will want to be blind after seeing this disaster. Sally Field is particularly annoying as a stowaway aboard Caine's tugboat. <br /> <br /> Disaster master Irwin Allen not only produced this, he also decided to direct it.
