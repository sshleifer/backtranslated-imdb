I do not even know where to start. I do not like. He did not behave like a story and he injected himself so much into the movie (the pot brownies, the son was gay (?) The murder was justified, what reason could there be in the script for Linda aka Pen√©lope to exist) that was never explained Everything was fluid spilled on a table and dropped dripping from the counter until it made a big mess on the floor. <br /> <br /> Why did Vanessa Redgrave make a five-second cameo? Why did Diane Wiest use her Balas character on Broadway without the fun of the camp? Why was Jane Birkin in the story to begin with? The list is endless. The movie ended and we all looked at each other, like, did you understand any of this? <br /> <br /> I tell you one thing, if I see my lost dad makes him die murdered, he certainly would not. I'll be hugging the killer. Tell him something else, if "Bob" broke up with "Bob", what was the purpose of hiding the son in the closet? Was Bob going to have sex with Bob in front of the son? How was the killer contacted with the son so easily? <br /> <br /> If this revision sounds confusing, it is because it was a loss of film, talent and time. What the hell had the deceased died to do with anything! <br /> <br /> Jezz, this is one of the worst movies I've seen because it should have been / could have been better, stronger and should have done it. He made some kind of sense Any sense. Instead, they give us a "Diva" (the movie of the 70s complete with a murder) and tired performances that read boring words from a script that is completely insane. <br /> <br /> By the way, friends. Or maybe I and the rest of the people who reviewed this movie are too stupid to understand everything. I mean, after all it's a French movie.
