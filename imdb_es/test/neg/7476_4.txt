Again, we are getting a mix of well-covered themes from so many previous films. The good and bad story of the son, courtesy of East of Eden. The story of the American sea hero, who does not consider himself one because of what he knows. And the afflicted wife can potentially fall in love with another man's story. <br /> <br /> The mere fact that these stories are so ubiquitous is not a big problem. Because, in theory, they could still be presented and treated better each time. However, there is no luck this time, since the three threads eventually become flat. <br /> <br /> As the bad son never gets to talk to his father, so the conflict is never solved correctly. Apart from the father, he began to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter who had renovated the kitchen of the afflicted wife. Now, how satisfying that is. <br /> <br /> Next, the marine surprisingly back home who suspects that his wife of infidelity conflicts never resolves. Because he never really talks to the man under suspicion, that is, to his own brother. So, once again, we have a loose end here. <br /> <br /> And finally, the subject of the hypocrisy of American military heroism, where the Marine is publicly considered a hero when, due to the dirt of the war he went through, Actually, he should not be called one As for its own standards, that third issue is not the same. Because the movie ends just when, for the first time, he can only talk to his wife about what happened. Where the real story would really begin at that very point, namely, its recovery process, how it would look and how it would finally confront the family to which it would have to admit great guilt. All that, all the really interesting fragments are ignored and ignored. <br /> <br /> So, despite the story, this movie is very serious, and I mean seriously, disappointed, I'll still give you points for the awesome cast. Although no movie should use Maguire for a voice-over, because that belongs to Spiderman. Especially an adult Gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor. So much so that, in fact, I would love to see him be entrusted with a truly profound and demanding leadership role with an adequate profile. <br /> <br /> So, while the cast really does what it can, I consider this movie totally. forgettable otherwise. A superficial and, ultimately, pretentious, absolutely unsatisfying squeezer of tears. Message du jour to the writers: we already know the wounds, let's see the host of the Vietnam films. You want to earn some credit, show us a credible cure.
