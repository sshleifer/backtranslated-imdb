Now this is a movie that really disgusts me. It is one of the most boring horror films of the 90s, mainly because it starts slow and focuses on a boring environment. The adjustments are not even attractive to the eye and do not serve the purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> Puppets look very cheesy, not in a good way like in the 80s films of Puppet Master. What did you do with our favorite toys ?! <br /> <br /> The story is sparse, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets. There are no death scenes as in previous films and the f / x are terrible. <br /> <br /> I felt asleep the first time I saw it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.
