Do the following: Get a copy of this movie and a friend. Bet the friend $ 10 who can not sit in this whole movie. They can not look away or be distracted by anything. Now look at your friend. Win or lose, get $ 10 of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I get angry until the end when people watch a movie and rush to give it 1 out of 10, or summarize their thoughts with "stunk". (And when they are asked "Why?", They respond: "Just because." Arrgh.) That's why this movie exists. Its sole purpose is to say: "There! THIS IS a horrible movie! IT IS 1 out of 10!". <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely atrocious. <br /> <br /> Although the recent trend of movie parodies has forced them to become more and more formulas, this film falls short in all respects. It's not funny. It is not entertaining. And for some of the parodies, it's completely inaccurate! Horrible performance Dialog without grace An ingenious story Terrible "special effects." One INANE clamp after another. And to make matters even worse, there is not even free nudity to make it worthwhile in any way. <br /> <br /> This movie jumps idiots, stumbles over stupid ones, and lands are first confronted with stupidity. Even I, who loves a good "check your brain at the door" movie, I found myself physically agitated to see this. This movie is not even "Hard Ticket To Hawaii", it's terrible, it's good, it's bad ... IT'S VERY BAD. <br /> <br /> NOTE: In fact, I challenged a friend to see this as described above. Not only could he not get to the end, but he had a headache and needed a couple of minutes later because he felt a little sick. True story. <br /> <br /> I could not emphasize this qualification more ... a resounding 1 out of 10!
