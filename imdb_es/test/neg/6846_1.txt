The most hardcore bad film aficionado will be surprised by the general ineptitude of this z-grade "movie." Mary Woronov, an intelligent actress best known for her roles as Mary Bland in Eating Raoul and Miss Togar in Rock 'N' Roll High School, is by far the best in this gut. This movie is almost so bad even for MST3K, honestly!
