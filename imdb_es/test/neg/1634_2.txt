Another on the long list of aspiring Conan who got tired of taking advantage of the success of that movie, this Italian monstrosity is as bad as they came. You know it's a bad sign when your heroes fight against invisible enemies because the movie became so cheap that there was no money for proper special effects or to hire real people. I will not even bother to enter the plot as I challenge someone to follow it and make sense of the story. Maybe it's the television cut that I saw, but I can not imagine any better version. Everything seems so random. Wicked sorcerers, cavemen, giant snakes, medieval castles, grenades and hang gliding? none of that fits. It's as if director Joe D'Amato had an epileptic seizure by doing Cave Dwellers (or any of the other half-dozen names the movie goes through) and throwing everything he could think of on the screen, regardless of how unrelated that it was or how it fits into the already disconcerting plot of the film. The acting is bad enough. Miles O'Keeffe could never get out of a wet paper bag and proves it once again in this movie. The rest of the cast is equally atrocious. Then there is the. . . Well, you get the idea. It's late, I'm tired and I've already lost more than enough time writing about this piece of garbage. Take my word for it ?? Avoid the inhabitants of the caves (or whatever you want to call it) at all costs.
