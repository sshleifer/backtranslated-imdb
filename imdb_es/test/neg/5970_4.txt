My mother and I went to see this movie because my brother is serving in the Peace Corps of the United States in the same region in which it is set. Halfway through the movie, I decided that, since I can not measure what I'm trying to achieve, the title is pretentious. The subject with which it deals could have been an excellent documentary, but due to its bad execution, it left me much less educated on the subject than I expected. I agree with Laura-Jane from Canada ("Powerful message, but I lack focus"). I also agree with the user who commented that the free narrative style of this filmmaker is the opposite of Michael Moore's, but I do not agree that he presents diverse points of view and invites the viewer to decide for himself. I agree with a user's comment that "a lesson is best learned when we draw the conclusions ourselves"; However, our conclusions can only be well founded if we are presented with little relevant information to extract them. <br /> <br /> The main points of the documentary seem to be that 1) the African people who live near Lake Victoria are very poor and suffer a lot. 2) The introduction of the perch to Lake Victoria, inflicted by Europeans, ruined its ecosystem. 3) The communities surrounding Lake Victoria depend financially on the perch economy. <br /> <br /> The best I can say about the film is that it tried to relate the perspectives of the average people in sub-Saharan Africa, which, unfortunately, is an anomaly between the films, and who tried to describe poverty as result of a dysfunctional economic system instead of a universal and inevitable phenomenon. I liked the irony that he captured in the enormous amount of fish that left the country in the face of a famine. I appreciated the description of what was out of touch that the U.N. assigned to the region was with the people. Like almost all documentaries that do not have the word "women" in the title, this film does not do a good job representing the voices of women; most of the conversations made in the interviews are those of men. <br /> You may need to watch the movie a second time to capture some key points you might have overlooked, but I could not detect Sauper's theory about the relationship between the introduction of the perch on Lake Victoria and the unjust living conditions for living Africans. near the lake. Also, I could be wrong, but I was surprised that Sauper could do well to improve his interviewing skills. Not only did the questions he asked and the answers he included appear to be arbitrary, but he seemed to have a real ability to make the interviewees uncomfortable and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The most convincing development of the movie is the suggestion. that the export of perch now works to mask the import of weapons and that the real economy that ruins the Tanzanians is that of war, not fishing. Regrettably, Sauper refrains from making an exhaustive exposition of the idea (or at least extending the interview with the journalist who seemed to know what he was talking about in relation to the import of weapons) and manages with a "decide for itself" . <br /> <br /> If Darwin's nightmare was destined to dispel the myth that exploitation of the first world of the third world gives them "an opportunity for a better life", he did not do a good job. If it was meant to represent how the US arms manufacturing industry. UU And Europe is responsible for many armed conflicts around the world, it did not do a good job. If it was meant to show what leads people to prostitution, it did not do a good job. If it was meant to shed light on the inability of the United States to carry out its mission, it did not do a good job. If it was meant to say that the low income that Tanzanians get from the perch are not worth the human cost of playing with Mother Nature to create a profitable product, it did not do a good job. If this was supposed to imply that Tanzania would be much better off if the Europeans never came, it did not do a good job.
