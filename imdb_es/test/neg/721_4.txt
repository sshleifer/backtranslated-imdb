The director of a film that I'm working with lent me this DVD in which I play an actor who plays Prospero. Knowing his own style, he did not expect anything like a "classical" interpretation of the text. <br /> <br /> What I have found is sometimes surprising, sometimes evocative, but often meandering and tedious. Like most experimental music, I find that in films like this, the basic components of powerful filmmaking are hand-made, even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format. <br /> <br /> So we have a Caliban who is more of a clown than a threat, and from whom even Miranda does not seem to be very afraid (which is strange, since we know he tried to rape her at least once). A Stefano and Trinculo that are more annoying than fun. A strangely young Prospero who looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and very stylized posture. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I have no problem with the way Ferdanand or Miranda is portrayed. His astonished ecstasy and his strange innocence are actually quite appropriate. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this is a bad movie, but an experimental one. One that assumes great risks, but is intended more for students of art and cinema and not really for anyone who is interested in the Tempest for their own good.
