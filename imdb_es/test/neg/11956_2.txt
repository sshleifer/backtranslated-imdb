This is an excellent example of a very bad b-movie. There are worse movies than this one (for example, Titanic), but this definitely shares the pile of smoking shit movies. <br /> <br /> OK, apparently it was filmed in Kansas City, which explains why everyone is so lame. The main guy looks like Steve Guttenberg, and he's even more lame than him! I did not even think that was possible! In fact, he and the main girl in the film are responsible for the WORST DRAMA OF EVERYONE! It's not just that the performance was too dramatic, well, actually it was, of course, the script was terrible, that combines to give a mortal blow from one to two in a terrible drama, absolutely impossible to see. <br /> <br /> The scarecrow, let's talk about it. The whistle you hear every time you're around is stupid, and obviously doubled. Now, his disguise, I can not get over that: he's a guy wearing burlap sacks and a stupid mask! I'm just stupefied, maybe if your 3-year-old with brain damage scares you from him. <br /> <br /> One of the characters, the black token man, used the line: "This could be the chance to win my red wings" when you refer to trying to score with one of the girls in your period. Wow, um yes, that's the kind of dialogue you can expect. <br /> <br /> Oh, at the beginning, when the girl with little clothes is running through the corn, why is she disconnected? I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be obvious, just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this "movie." Another is the wrong dubbing for the musical number (yes, that's right), all on the beach and the only dorkaziod. He gathers the courage to sing a song and play the guitar for everyone, and obviously it's said to be funny. Fortunately, the scarecrow responds to all our prayers and throws a spear through the boy's chest when he finishes singing. In general, the gore like that is pretty good, this is one of those movies in which you try to get the murderer to kill these people. <br /> <br /> Okay, there's a scene where two guys bury one of their friends. In the sand, get up, take out your penis and urinate on the man who is in the sand. Who does this? Really, imagine it. "Hey, let's bury Joe in the sand, then let's get up and grow our genitals like it's not a big problem and piss on him." In fact, this highlights the homoeroticism in this movie, what the hell? A good part of the beginning of this film are the athletes who are standing in their underwear in the dressing room and in the corn field while they are doing the hazing. What the hell's going on with that? Traditionally, in movies and in real life, athletes make girls and nerds do not. That really does not make sense since all the nerds think about girls and sex, and apparently all athletes think about sports and being together in their underwear, I do not understand it. <br /> <br /> Let's get to sex As someone who saw this movie with me said: "I've never been so disgusted with heterosexual sex in my life" and it's true. If you like the action of a hot cup, or old and ugly tits, this movie is for you. I swear, they found a girl with smaller breasts and this is the people they can make the nude scene. Then the ugly old nurse shows her fans a couple of times, and man, she just did not want to see that. <br /> <br /> Now, I have to talk about the continuity of the timeline of this movie. that is what is really strange. It starts in the day, then everyone goes to the corn field, and in about 2 minutes it's instantly dark in the middle of the night, when they leave there saying they're going to the beach - it's instantly back again the day, and apparently it's they stay on the beach until the night again, and until the next day. Basically, these events in the film cover 4 days, without any of the characters needing sleep or anything, it's really strange. <br /> <br /> After the main murders have taken place, the flashes advance until "3 weeks later". And apparently none of these people really care that they've seen their friends brutally murdered! People who survive literally blow up a champaign! And that's when I realized that the budget did not go to the script, neither to the direction nor to the performance, but to the damn bottle of champaign. <br /> <br /> The end. Stop reading now if you do not want to be ruined in the end, it's really nice. <br /> <br /> Well, the ending takes place in a church, and the scarecrow puts his soul inside the body of the diabetic child. , then he fights with the guy similar to steve guttenberg, and he fights him with a movie version B of the power that the emperor had in the war of the galaxies! I'm not kidding, it's so stupid! So somehow, in the middle of the fight, the soul of the scarecrow jumps bodies to the guttenberg jr. Boy, and then with the last amount of will he has, he impales himself on a cross in the church. Is awesome! A little blood, but what is even better is that the cross is obviously cardboard! You can see the bottom movement of the floor! Wow, yes have fun watching.
