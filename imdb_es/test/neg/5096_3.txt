With an interesting premise (in conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear), it should have been a good movie. But the story is sabotaged by the dominant passion of the director with his own intelligence and a very poor script. <br /> <br /> Yes, the natural environment is beautiful and, yes, the film is authentic to its 19th century historical setting. . But the filmmaker continues to brown the lily again and again, adding layer upon layer of exaggerated musical accompaniment, not to mention a completely unnecessary voice-over, to the soundtrack, which finally overwhelms the viewer and, by drawing attention to themselves, away from history. <br /> <br /> For me, it was clear that the director, with his microscopic close-ups and the endless repetition of the musical motif of "Danny Boy" (of all things!) was trying to make a version of New Zeeland of an epic film by Sergio Leone, something of the order of Once Upon A Time In The West. But given the seriousness of the story (most of Leone's westerns were ironic), not to mention that it's not 1968, he manages to make a parody of one. <br /> <br /> Very badly.
