If you are a fan of the original ten commandments, this movie will make you cry inside. granted, I've only been around for half an hour now, but it's very painful, I felt it was my duty to warn the true fanatics of the commandments before they were subjected to this bastardization. I did not think it was possible to make special effects worse than they were in the 1950s when the original was shot, but this 2006 remake proves that I'm wrong. I can forgive some boring special effects, but the dialogue, the melodramatic confusion of a lifetime in the style of the film, and the forced performance of the wax figures that come true make me hope that they rewrite the plot and drown Moses Red Sea.
