This movie has no plot, it is not good acting, to be honest, it has nothing, the same songs are played again and again, and if you can really sit there and see everything and enjoy it, something is wrong with you. I wish I could give this 0 out of 10, but I can not, so it has to be a 1 that is generous. ice-t is not even a good rapper and worse in acting, every part of the movie is garbage, I got this movie on DVD without knowing what it cost Â£ 1.99 and I thought I had bought a bargain Then I looked at the IMDb index and did not I took it into consideration, but after seeing it I discovered that the DVD I had bought was a complete waste of time, money and electricity. If you have this movie, there are two things you can do to sell it to someone who does not know or burn it.
