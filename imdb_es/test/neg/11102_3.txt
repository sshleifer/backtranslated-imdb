My fuzzy memories of childhood have kept the echo of Belphegor's cult series in the French 60s ... so I was eager to see the adaptation to the big screen. I should have saved my money and gone for a walk in the Louvre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the scenario is still very successful and interesting (the fantastic one from Le Louvre), but the adaptation is ridiculous. The dialogues vacillate permanently between the French irony and the serious "American companies" without achieving any, but not without sounding stupid. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the action leaves to be desired and special effects are scarce compared to what one might expect (low budget)?). <br /> <br /> What's left of all that. Not far from some good photos of Paris ... which is rarely a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Belphégor was worth more than that. <br /> <br />
