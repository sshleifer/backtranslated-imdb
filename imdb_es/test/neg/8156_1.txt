Rarely does one find a film so bad that it achieves the paradigm so frequently sought to have so little value of redemption that only makes it worth seeing. "Cyclone", I am pleased to report that it is such a movie. <br /> <br /> I knew I expected something good as soon as I found the videotape. I am, at least, his fourth owner: he has a sticker of "Used film sale! $ 9.95" on the front and a garage sale sticker for a dollar. I picked it up at a thrift store for fifty cents. <br /> <br /> The sale of used movies! The sticker covers much of the cover, which means that what I see is a really strange mix of the front of the Cyclone super bike, a car that is on fire, and Heather Thomas, who wears Flouncy Eighties hair with Open mouth in an expression that says: "I have a pain". I saw that and thought: "All right". Honestly, the case was enough ("without having anywhere to turn or anyone to confide in, Teri is mired in a maze of dangers and deceptions"), but I was surprised to see it. I always make time for really bad movies. That "Fight Club" movie can wait. <br /> <br /> Meet Teri. Teri is an astonishingly well-crafted character, as we can see in her introduction, in which she and her friend do exercises that highlight her breasts and, later, her leg warmers. Then Teri is going to join her boyfriend at night that goes terribly wrong. Before she knows it, Teri is led "directly to a network of deadly double crosses in CYCLONE." The VHS box says it's the way it is. <br /> <br /> If left out of the box's summary, perhaps by some slight hope that real copies of this movie are sold, it's how horrible the acting is. It could have been just me, but I kept thinking I could read the thoughts of the characters through their eyes. "This is silly," thinks Heather Thomas. "I know," Bad Guy thinks with his mouth too wide. <br /> <br /> A driving force (no pun intended) for the second half of this epic image are car chases. Actually, they were pretty good, although I am convinced that gasoline does not need training on how to exploit. What really impressed me is that, in all the persecutions, the streets were practically empty. It's like there are only twenty people in this great city. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking. You're thinking: "Wow, I have to see this movie!" The sad thing, however, is that you can not find it. Oh no. "Cyclone" is a movie that finds you. Just wait Someday, maybe during lunch, maybe late at night, maybe "when military scientist Jeffery Combs ('Re-animator') is killed by hit men" - he will hear the whisper of the boilermakers and you'll know it's time.
