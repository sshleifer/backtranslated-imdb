This movie was terrible. It was so terrible. <br /> <br /> The most annoying was the way the trial was conducted. The defense attorney is allowed to ramble again and again when questioning a witness without the prosecution making any objection. Attack the children brought in to bear witness with cruel ferocity and repeatedly yell at them that they are lying. These are simply not things that are subjected to children who have been victims of sexual abuse. The trial is foolish and ruins the whole movie ... (Law & Order has spoiled me for the accuracy of the courtroom).
