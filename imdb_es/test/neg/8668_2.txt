I have read a lot of Jane Austen in my time and I approve several film / TV adaptations, but we do not need this one. <br /> <br /> The rating is a 2 since I would not say it is horrible. So boring you'll feel like you've wasted 90 minutes of your life. Bored script matched by an even more boring performance. I heard that Billie Piper is fine in Dr Who (he's not a fan so I can not confirm) but in this she just sucks. There is absolutely no chemistry among the drivers. This is Austen, it's supposed to be a romance! <br /> <br /> Please, do not let this discourage you from Austen or historical dramas. There are many better programs to watch.
