I chose either of these two movies. This movie has been on my "must see" list for a while because people talked about it being "disturbing" and also the VHS box contains many quotes from people who say how "amazing" it is, or how "so close" How can you get to the Texas chainsaw massacre "and lines like that. But, sorry people, I was disappointed in a big way. The idea is interesting, but the script is so underdeveloped that each character becomes an erroneous creation of evolution and people do it in the dumbest movies of the movie. The plot may have had otherwise. He could not believe how unnecessarily the sequences of "where he is, let's find him" were. A few bloody moments to please the gore fan, but they are so few that by the time we get to them it does not make sense. If Luther is a geek, then the filmmakers must really be in the food chain.
