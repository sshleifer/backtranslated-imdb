Okay, it's a historical movie that caused an uproar, shocked people and was banned. I'll give him that, so I gave him a 3 instead of a 1. He may have been ahead of the times, but he's certainly far behind the times now. I'm a big fan of Salvador Dali and I loved Un Chien Andalou. That short was captivating with one creative scene after another. L'age d'Or was too long and boring, just a self-indulgent piece to make a pompous movie created simply as a feeble attempt to surpass Un Chien Andalou by creating a long-running film (and by shamelessly taking the name and fame daliis to Although it had little to do with that). Total waste, except for (very) some shots of "shocking scenes" separated by long stretches of boring no action. A waste of time and money. My two thumbs are down, very down. He will go to my shelf to never be seen again.
