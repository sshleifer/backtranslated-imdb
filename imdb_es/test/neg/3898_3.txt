I consider myself a fan of Jess Franco and his junk movies, but almost every time I see one of them, I see lost opportunities and plots that do not work well. This movie is not, unfortunately, different. The film certainly had a lot of potential, since Franco has fused the intriguing theme of the classic movie "The most dangerous game" with his usual brand of poor quality, but the plot here is lost very often, and Franco needs an eternity. To get to the main point of the movie. This being a later Franco film, you can be forgiven for thinking that the director had improved, but in fact I have discovered that the opposite is true; Like this and the terrible 'Killer Barbys' are two of his worst movies. The plot focuses on a stripper and her boyfriend of poor quality. The couple is invited to a private island by a rich woman and her lover. However, they soon discover that they have not been invited there for social reasons since they are 'liberated' on the island so that the wealthy woman and her friends can hunt them for sport. <br /> <br /> What attracted me to this film was the cover and the fact that it was directed by the king of the shoddy movies. You would think, then, that I would be pleased if the film presented a lot of scenes of sex and general sordidness; but not me. The reason for this is mainly that sex and disappointment in the film are really boring and most of the time it only serves to give me the condition known as "finger that moves fast and itches". However, my inclination to see everything until the end assured me that I had to group it. There was a time when I did not believe that a girl with another girl could be boring, but since then I have shown that I was wrong. The only positive thing I can get out of the movie is that the soundtrack is pretty sticky and, despite being a silly foreign pop music; Actually it combines pretty well with sex scenes. I enjoyed the last ten minutes; since that's when the plot finally started, but it was a case of too little too late and, unfortunately, this is a very tarnished movie. In general, I only recommend this film to those who feel that they should see more than 180 Franco films ... everyone else should see Vampyros Lesbos, Faceless or She Killed in Ecstasy.
