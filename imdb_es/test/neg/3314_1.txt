It is good that these three young directors have produced films with good production values ​​and decent performance. Here is a good job. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they suffer for what affects a lot of modern gay cinema; recycled diagrams, too familiar devices (I have seen the configuration of "pool" too many times in movies of gay men) and dashed scripts. The most atrocious of all is "Dorothy", whose absurd premise is that a handsome young boy will have trouble getting him shot in New York City due to the shortage of identifiable gay types available in his neighborhood. <br /> <br /> In terms of cinema, these shorts play like little gay specials after school. Not much imagination in its writing or execution; they basically follow a point-and-shoot convention, shot / reaction shot / master shot that becomes painfully boring after about five minutes. There are hopes for the queer cinema in the works of Todd Haynes, Sadie Benning and the late great Marlon Riggs ... but not here. These films are incredibly mediocre, particularly white bread and their values ​​basically please a bourgeois gay sensibility. That's probably why they play so well at gay film festivals.
