The polar Express. The director Robert Zemeckis, I love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (THERE IS NO BRAND QUESTION AFTER THIS FILM TITLE) And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. The critics of this film were almost unanimous saying that it is a classic of instant parties. Ebert and Roeper give him two ENTHUSIASTIC thumbs! Even Ebert's written review gave him four full stars! Wow ... OK ... this I have to see it! But wait ... the motion capture used looks very weird. Hmm ... maybe I'm not so interested in seeing this anymore. <br /> <br /> "Well, are you coming?" The train driver tells the child at The Polar Express. The child is reluctant at first, and the train starts its course without him. The boy soon changes his mind and jumps on board just in time. <br /> <br /> Now, most of you have probably decided not to get on this train and wait for the TV train or Rental Express (hee hee, I'm very clever and smart). I, on the other hand, was like the kid who was skeptical at first, but jumped to see what this was all about. <br /> <br /> I just lost $ 10 and two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to explain the pain in my stomach. The Polar Express was so painful to sit on that it's not even funny. There is no history There is no reward. You sit there through this series of events and you ask yourself "is there any point in all this?" One thing would be if the scenes were entertaining ... but they are not. <br /> <br /> This movie is devoid of any emotion, any soul, any ounce of plausibility, and above all: any fun. This movie is not fun. <br /> <br /> And let's talk about the way these characters look for a second. To say that it's the same technology (movement, I'm sorry, the capture of "PERFORMANCE") used to make Gollum a real shame because Gollum was believable. Photographic realism does not translate well in this medium. You are using animation, why do not you design the characters to be more expressive? Or why not shoot everything with real actors? They certainly could have. As people we know very well how we walk, we talk, we interact with things. Seeing it on the screen in an unconvincing way is not impressive. Cartoons made convincingly are even more credible, as The Incredibles has shown. The result of The Polar Express now is as if they took corpses of dead children and turned them into puppets. They are moving and talking, but where is the heart? Where is the soul That is what we are seeing on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so horrible! <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, there is a scene in which the child takes a train ticket from a girl from his seat because he got up and left him. He wants to give it to her, but you sit down "why?" Just leave it .. she's coming back! He, of course, loses the ticket and the "adventure" occurs. And then there's a guy who's stuck in the back of the train all the time, and they bring him hot chocolate, but can not he come up and join the rest of the kids? And then there is the annoying child "I know everything" with the voice of a 35-year-old boy. Everything is very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there are songs! A girl enters the back of the train where the lonely child is. He is singing a song for himself. And then she interrupts and joins! They finish the song while holding hands, looking into each other's eyes as if they were lovers. Very uncomfortable. I will not even go into details about the song about serving hot chocolate while the waiters dance around the train. "Keep it warm keep it hot!" The only scene in which Tom Hanks slips on his knees with his arms stretched out in the air has to be one of the BAD scenes most memorably in the history of the bad scenes. <br /> <br /> I have to stop now or I just kill myself. I need to see some shit to clean the palette. Yes ... crappy is better than the Polar Express. <br /> <br /> "The only thing about trains, no matter where you go, what matters is deciding." <br /> <br /> Do not get on this one. For the love of God, I have decided for you! This is just another film taken from a children's book that stretches incredibly thin in film form. It happened with the Grinch and The Cat in the Hat and those were also horrible. But who can blame them? I bet if I took the book, The Berenstein Bears' Too Much Junk Food, and turned that into a movie, it would probably be pretty boring, too. But at least ... there would be a story and a point, of what The Polar Express lacks.
