Space is a vacuum, right? Therefore, space stinks. Vampires also suck. A really bad vampire movie in space would have twice as much suction power, right? <br /> <br /> It started with what could have been a fun premise. Retell the story of Bram Stoker's Dracula in the future. There is a rescue team that is sent to investigate a cargo ship that is lost in the space called the Demeter. Fans of the original novel will assume, without knowing it, that this will be a simple recount of Dracula set in the future ... unfortunately, without sharing the names of characters, this takes the servants' route and enters the galaxy of the movie B twenty minutes later. When Coolio becomes a vampire. Trust me when I tell him he's the best actor in the movie, and that does not mean much. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien should sell his products on daytime television. Erika Eleniak should have resigned after leaving Baywatch and poor Udo Kier has trouble reading the reference cards. The guy who plays Dracula in this is more ridiculous than Frank Langella in the 1970 version. If you manage to sit through the whole movie, you will be rewarded with the worst end imaginable. The end makes one wonder if the actors and the team realized the trash they were doing and left the stage. <br /> <br /> Look, vampire fanatics. This sucks twice as hard.
