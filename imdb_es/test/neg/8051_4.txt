The Kindred opens to the shots of a Porsche that runs along a road, meets an old pick-up truck and stops. As the vehicle passes, the driver (Benjamin J. Perry as Ben Perry) screams obscenities and honks. Distracted, he does not notice an obstruction ahead and crashes his Porsche. He is quickly freed from the remains and taken to the hospital. Along the way, the Paramedic (Randy Harrington) trying to save him suggests that he probably will not make it. Then, the ambulance is attacked and forced to leave the road by a van. The driver of the truck, Jackson (Jim Boeke as James F. Boeke) hits the Paramedic and steals the patient. The driver of the ambulance, Harry (Charles Grueber) makes no attempt to stop him. Once the injured man has been placed in the van Jackson turns his attention to Harry, who seems to know each other. Harry asks Jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw 'the last time'. Jackson hits Harry on the ground and throws him a lot of money. Then, the film makes it clear that we are in San Fransisco showing a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sharon Raymond woke up with a phone call from her boyfriend, Dr. John Hollins (David Allen Brooks), to inform her that her mother, Amanda (Kim Hunter), who recently had a heart attack, has regained consciousness. Hollins works for a company called 'Geneticell Corporation' and is delighted with the news and goes to see it. Once there, she asks him to return to his old childhood home in a small town called Shelter Cove and destroy all his notes and experiments, especially the "Anthony diaries" of which Hollins has never heard, also claims that he has a brother. called Anthony. Back in Geneticell, Hollins talks to a Dr. Phillip Lloyd (Rod Steiger) about his mother, since they both worked together before they quarreled with each other, and asks about his investigation and if he knows of someone named Anthony. He says he does not know anything. When Amanda dies after a visit from the sinister Dr. Lloyd, Hollins decides to carry out her Mothers request and try to find out who Anthony is. While presenting his final respects at the funeral, a woman named Melissa Leftridge (Amanda Pays) introduces herself to Hollins and says that she was a great admirer of her work and research of Mothers after helping her. As Melissa seems to know a lot about her work as Mothers, she invites her to the house, as she can possibly help find some answers to the various questions he has. Hollins, Sharon, Melissa and three lab assistants, Brad Baxter (Peter Frechette), Hart Phillips (Timothy Gibbs) and Cindy Russell (Julia Montgomery) plus a girl with a watermelon (!) Call Nell Valentine (Bunki Z, big name) . your parents thinking? They get to work immediately, but they find little interest. For some reason, nobody at this point thinks to look in the basement, which is as good as there is something down there, something big, viscous and with many tentacles. First kill Duke, the dog. Then it moves towards larger prey. When Hart is attacked by something in a barn, Hollins decides that he must destroy all traces of his work as Mothers and whatever Anthony is. Jointly co-written and directed by Stepehn Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow, Carpenter also acted as cinematographer and Obrow as a producer. This is a pretty poor movie in my opinion. The script is accredited to five (!) Writers, Carpenter, Obrow, Earl Ghaffari, John Penny and Joseph Stefano and with five people working on it I would like to think that you could find something a little better and more consistent than this. Nothing is so well explained, why did Amanda create these monstrous marine creatures / human hybrids? What is Dr. Lloyd's interest and his motives? Why do you steal bodies from the back of the ambulance? Why do you have a basement full of mutants? Why do not any of these so-called genetic scientists plan to check the basement? Could Melissa act with more suspicion even if she tried? Why do not any of the characters have a background? Why do people keep mentioning a substance found in marine creatures called Hemocynine when 99.9% of the audience will not have an idea of ​​what it is? There is also a serious lack of blood and blood, only one person dies on the screen, only one! And all the scientists survive in a vomit, undoubtedly timid, "happy ending". This is a horror movie, all we want to see is that the muddy monsters kill and eat people in various bloody ways. The one who is on the screen of death is really great, someone has slimy tentacles inserted under the skin, in the ear and in the nose, in the film just a sequence of decent horror. To test and raise the gore index, there is a scene in which Dr. Lloyd is experimenting with an animal with skin, but it only lasts a few seconds, and in the context of the rest of the movie it does not mean anything. Melissa also becomes a fish, do not ask. There is no nudity either, which is not a surprise. The film seems professional enough with decent production values, but it is so boring and stomps at a snail pace, we can not even see the giant monster in the basement until 15 minutes before the end, which is too small. late, when it appears, the effects are good and that makes it more shameful that it has not been used anymore. In general, I was very disappointed and expected much better. A horror movie with only one death on screen and only three in total, what comes from the world too?
