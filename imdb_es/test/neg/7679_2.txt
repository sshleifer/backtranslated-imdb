The original Airport (1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two tracks of the movie B (Airport 1975; Airport '77) were, at best, fun and fun; but this gross and inept final entry lacks entertainment value and shows a shocking disdain for his audience. It is unbearable and it is not even good for laughter. <br /> <br /> The three sequels of "Airport" were theatrical premieres made by Universal's television wing, but this one is below the most modest standards of a television movie of its time, with cheapjack production , grotesque casting, visual ugliness. and without flavor, without grace "comedy". The project was clearly condemned by the "creative" efforts of the Universal executive, Jennings Lang, who produced personally and is granted a "history" credit. <br /> <br /> Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) could have done it. It provided an element of self-burlesque, as did the previous films (especially the famous 1975 Airport), but there's nothing worthwhile in Roth's turgid, incoherent script and even in the Airplane comedy. Leave this mess untouched. <br /> <br /> What makes The Concorde: Airport '79 particularly insulting is its insulting misuse of professionals. The worst victim is the highly talented Cicily Tyson (Sounder, The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman), mercilessly reduced to a secondary plot of vomiting that accompanies her to accompany a heart transplant frozen in the unfortunate flight. <br /> <br /> A special kick in the groin is reserved for the wonderful George Kennedy, who is the true leader despite being buried in the list of actors. The official mascot of the series "Airport" and the only actor that appeared in the four films, Kennedy won the leading role and his turn in the Captain's seat would have been the only possible reason for this entry, besides the squeeze of one last dollar. Kennedy provides the only warmth and real humor in this mechanical disorder, briefly leaving aside the machismo brave and revealing a genuinely sweet and tender side for him, and his loving and heroic character of "Joe Patroni". Unfortunately, we are never allowed to forget how fat and old and on the hill is Kennedy, and the handsome boy Alain Delon, relentlessly, relentlessly calls him "Porky Pig" as part of a bond of friends that falls flat. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only human part of this plane crash, turns out to be simply a trap for a hateful joke by Patroni, Kennedy and the viewer.
