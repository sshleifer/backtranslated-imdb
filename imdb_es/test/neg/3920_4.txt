Manufactured cheaply, badly acted and handled in an unimaginative way, Flight to Mars is still entertaining despite what it opposes. A flight to Mars is planned with five people (three older gentlemen, Cameron Mitchell as a journalist, and a scientific / obvious love interest) "manning" the ship.The spacecraft arrives and finds that very human-looking Martians live there. Technological advances that would make the Earth blush But not everything is rosy in the underground cities of the Martians (here they are shown as some caves and some rooms) The Martians are a dying planet and a faction wants the Earthlings only repair the ship to remove it at the last moment and then mobilize for an attack on Earth and another faction wants to talk about peace and see if they can not persuade the Earth to give them vital space.The special effects here are quite scarce even for Sci-fi standards of the 50s complete with slow-moving rockets, pastel / neon alien outfit where women wear panta short lones that would make a lot of blush (except men, of course) and a little less offered. Cameron Mitchell is the journalist and is affable, if nothing else. Marguer ite Chapman is beautiful in very short shorts but adds little acting range. The rest of the cast is filled with some older science fiction veterans like Arthur Franz and Morris Ankrum who do useful work. This is not a science fiction movie premiere of the Golden Age by any standard, but it is very visible and slips quickly.
