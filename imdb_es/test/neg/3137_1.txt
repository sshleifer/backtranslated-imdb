Critics are a strange kind of people. Some of them are ordinary people like you and me. Some of them are not. When a critic says that Subconscius Cruelty is beautiful, I wonder where they grew up. What is beautiful is filming a field, some clouds or a tree with an old camera if you can not do it with style and capture the atmosphere of the environments. Karim Hussain sure can not. I've seen children make better images than Karim manages to do in Subconscius Cruelty. But that is not the worst. The worst thing is that the complete recording, I refuse to call this a movie, is just a bad excuse to imagine nakedness and extreme torture, rapes of both sexes, masturbation, sperm, urine, cannibalism, murder of children and much more. I love gore / splatter and I love horror. This is not any of those. This is total shit and if my comments make a single person omit Subconscius Cruelty, it's been worth it. Always remember that your life will not last forever, do not waste two hours of precious time on Subconscius Cruelty. You have been warned
