I seem to be in the minority in this case, but I found that One True Thing is immoral, artificial and generally unpleasant. Not that the performance was so bad, but the characters seemed little more than archetypes (the bad father, oh, but wait, maybe it is not tirelessly bad, maybe there is a resolution at the end ...). It's true that the woman I was with loved the movie, so maybe you like it. But I did not.
