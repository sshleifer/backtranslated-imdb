Well, how to start? I saw The Italian Job for the first time some years ago and when visiting a rental store I could not remember why I had a bad feeling. Yes now. <br /> <br /> After voting for the ratings of this movie, I saw the statistics. Apparently, this film attracts more to children under 18 years. It is not surprising. They did not pay enough to Charlize to make a flash and I suppose some girls magazine has described Mark Wahlbergs abs as "AWESOME". <br /> <br /> Besides that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly B stars forever. and even the good ones are being used horribly, the film is replete with an obvious location of the product and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without making a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and everything is downhill from there and once they realized this, they decided to use the best time again at the end, repeating the detail of their gold theft. All in all, a lot of noise about nothing. <br /> <br /> I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more like he has been before. Apart from the aspect of Donald Sutherland that appears here as well, at first I would say that this movie should have a "pass if you have more than 18" everywhere.
