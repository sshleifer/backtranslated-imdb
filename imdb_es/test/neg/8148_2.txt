This movie is a laugh and a half. From the first scene, in which Mel Torme appears as a great and evil Jaguar directing the gang of muffins stud (and that's a festival of giggles in itself), to the final image of Mamie Van Doren, now an angelic teenager rehabilitated. When you leave the prison, you can not stop shaking your head. The cast of this movie is a cheesy list of Mel and Mamie to the unfortunate Paul Anka (all he wanted through most of this movie was for him to stop singing!) And the King of the forty-year-olds, Dick Contino. Gloria Talbot, who plays a teenager without humor with more than a few chops (judo, without acting), the last time I saw in the horrible Leog Woman of Misogynist, with a hairstyle so bad that it looked like a dead ladybug crushed by a Mac Truck. <br /> <br /> Mamie is a bad girl, bad; smoke, swear, run wild, hit teachers and run with gang leaders. She leaves her idiot Jaguar driving her boyfriend Chip (whom we see in the first scene trying to rape a blonde girl, before he falls for a nice guy), and proceeds to deal with Dick Contino instead. If this is a step forward for her, nobody knows. Mel appears at a party where she is with her new boyfriend and accuses her of pushing the nasty Chip over the cliff. Although I'm sure he would have liked it, she was not there. A stupid fight scene between Contino and his gang and Mel and his jazz fans takes place, with hilariously bad moves on both sides. <br /> <br /> Mamie ends up being sent to the girls' town, a reform school ... please. ..love home for the erring girls..run of sister Iron Pants and her correction partners. She annoys the nuns (and us) by sneaking off, throwing themselves into the wrinkles of a sullen line and, in general, only shows how bad it is. She quickly meets Gloria Talbot, who plays one of the girls who misbehave, who gives her a trick so she knows where she belongs. Meet a loose noodle of a girl who is obsessed with the character of Paul Anka (why?). This little drip becomes his 'henchman'. <br /> <br /> There's a big part of the movie where nothing happens, except that St. Paul of Anka keeps showing up and showing how holy he is. He sings too much in this interval, until you want to slap him in his huge words to keep him quiet! And Mamie's little sister, played by the best reputation of the Princess of Father Know, calls her to tell her that she is in trouble. It turns out that it was the sister who left with the Chipster, and now Mel is blackmailing her because she found out. All the girls come out to save her, with a scene of hysterical struggle between the girls and Mel and her children. This is after a race between Mel and Dick that is so stupid that it stuns the mind. The older teenagers of this cheesy movie have a great time fabulously through what is basically a silly, badly written and morally predicative film that does not achieve any of its objectives, unless its goal is to make you laugh out loud.
