The cover of VHS for The Evil Below makes it look like a horror movie underwater. Unfortunately, it is closer to a boring movie and has no real horror elements. It starts with some divers who are attacked and we see a bit of blood, but that is the only blood in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The Evil Below is not the worst, but for a horror movie It's tediously boring. The acting is decent and, to be honest, the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two drivers. There are some sequences of nightmares in which it seems that the director did not know what to do. I managed to sit through everything (almost) but I would not recommend this movie to ANYONE. Fans of terror may want a copy for the great VHS cover, but it's better to leave that.
