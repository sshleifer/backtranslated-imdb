It's been a long time since I was in a movie as boring and boring as this one. It's one thing to have a slow rhythm when the characters are developing progressively, or some aspect of the movie is clearly enhanced by that rhythm (such as "Lost in translation"). However, there is a difference between slow progression and total stagnation, as happened in this one. I suppose by the expression of Helen Mirren, she must have been distressed by the disappearance of her husband. Surprise, surprise! What a wonderful moment the meeting of the mistress and the wife was! . (sarcasm) And what a great way that the whole story collapsed in the end. Truly a masterpiece.
