Flashdance is one of those horrible and stupid movies that you really enjoy, simply because they are so bad. I just saw him on TV and my friend and I were surprised at how silly he was. It's true that Don Simpson and the other producers came up with the idea of ​​a fairly cheap and low-key movie with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell a pop soundtrack (admirably catchy), so Flashdance is a strange guy of pioneer: the first MTV movie. Adrian Lyne began in advertising and is shown because Flashdance is almost a commercial for himself. You have already decided to see it, but the movie has this strange and panicky undercurrent, as if you were afraid you could change your mind at any time. It keeps selling to you over and over again, until the very end, using a commercial style edition and bright close-ups of moving breasts. The story is very thin (honestly I can not think of another movie I've seen with less plot) and it never makes much sense, but it's a very elaborate and calculating movie, so it feels consistent. People say it's dated, but Flashdance was always garbage. Viewers in the early '80s knew it was just a cheesy T & A, but it works in a very silly way. There is a good romance for the crowd of girls and lots of oily and twisted female bodies for their dates, all set for a disco beat. How could it fail? It helps that the dialogue does not make sense, so you can take popcorn without losing something important and, if this kind of thing is not your cup of tea, you can always laugh at the "interpretive dance" that is shown. The scene in which an understudy by Jennifer Beals convulses / "dances" on stage in front of a TV with a fan and a face full of white clown makeup made us ready. A real guilty pleasure.
