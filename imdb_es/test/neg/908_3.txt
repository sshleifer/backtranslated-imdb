The film uses motifs that could be plagiarized by "Wait Until Dark" (1967), a much better film by Terence Young, starring Audrey Hepburn. "Dead Silent" is a pale paraphrase. There is nothing new here: the hidden object on the wrist, the bad men who want it, the bad guy pretending to be a good guy. The disability, however, has changed: Audrey Hepburn could not see, the child in DS can not talk. But both stories depend on the disadvantage. Where "Wait Until Dark" created an unbearable suspense, "Dead Silent" allows you to guess the result, since the story is a stereotype.
