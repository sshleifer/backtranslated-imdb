I hope that the people who made these films read these comments. The choreography was horrible, the plot was null, and the actors where the low budget rangers appeared 5 stars in this garbage. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes in which the actors could be seen so slowly waiting for each other to perform the next movement. Camera cuts and bad lighting could not cover the cheap effects. The lightning was just stupid. The weapons looked like they were taken out of a final fantasy game, and the dual bow and arrow were as boring as anything I've seen. <br /> <br /> The next movie you decide to do is try to invest in some wireless microphones, better make a script and try to spend some time on your tricks. <br /> <br /> Honestly, there are shows on television that game every night and they are released together in a few hours that look better than this one. <br /> <br /> Stick to martial arts (unless it's as poor as your performance) and then embrace the quilting.
