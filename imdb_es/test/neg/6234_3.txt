I'm sorry, but I do not understand how the study is saved with this. The movie is not worth it. Maybe like a play, but certainly not like a movie! And why do they call it a thriller? Out of the fountain, the acting is good, but I expected nothing less from these perfect actors. Robert Redford plays very well and Willem Dafoe is convincing enough as the "bad guy". Helen Mirren can play almost any role and always (still) seems beautiful to me;). I'm also a fan of his British detectives. They still can not keep this movie so boring, I'm sorry. I hope we do not get to many films of this director "Pieter Jan Brugge" because he obviously does not understand the meaning of the words "suspense and suspense".
