An art student in Rome is possessed ... or something like that. She dreams of being nailed to a cross and Satan himself is raping her. He owns her (I think) and makes her a sex addict. That's all I could take and I turned it off. <br /> <br /> An "Exorcist" without meaning, a scam. I caught this on the wire in the 80s and I was horrified ... and not in a good way! This movie is supposed to be a horror movie, but it becomes nothing more than a sex movie disguised as a horror movie. There are tons of nonsense female nonsense and the actress who takes the role of the head has to degrade more than once. We see her being raped by Satan (a sexy looking guy), masturbating, reaching her own father ... I have to give her points for her bravery. Add to that the faulty dubbing, the editing (the scene of the rape seems to have been cut a bit), the misinterpretation and a story that makes almost no sense. The only disturbing sequence (his nailed in the cross) ALMOST works, but the terrible "special" effects ruin it. This is one of the few horror movies that was so bad that I stopped watching. Skip it.
