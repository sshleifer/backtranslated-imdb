The curse of the mummy is the last in the series of the films of the mummy of Kharis, and it seems that creativity had run out a little at the time they did this. Kharis and his partner Ananka end up in the Louisiana bayous, and in his resurrection, he looks for his beloved princess. The way they end up in Louisiana is not entirely clear, but with several people trying to find them, the viewer can be sure of some mummy murders. <br /> <br /> The curse of the mummy was visible, but in reality There is nothing special. During the film I had the feeling of having seen this before. Frankly, apart from the original The Mummy with Boris Karloff, Mummy's films are not my favorite among the old universal horrors. They are not bad, but they become a bit repetitive. <br /> <br /> There are some great scenes in the movie (the scene with Ananka coming to life in the swamp, for example) but in general this was not the case. do a lot for me <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing if you want to be more complete and see all the mummy movies, but otherwise you will want to pass this one.
