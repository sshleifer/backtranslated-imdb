The director and FX man John Carl Buechler does not have to do much to terrify me; the sight of his name alone in the credits is enough to instill fear in my heart. <br /> <br /> Your unfortunate direct video output in the 80s sat on the lower shelf of the terror section in my local rental store; Twenty years later, and their DVDs occupy the same space. It seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same. You can rely on the old JCB to serve dreck, whatever the format and regardless of the advances in film-making technology. <br /> <br /> In this despicable offer, a group of friends travel to a remote city where they discover the secret treasure of Jeremiah Stone, also known as the evil cannibal miner, of those who skip the claims, and who caused Havoc in the mid-nineteenth century. Before his death, Jeremiah cursed anyone who found his gold, and it is not long before the wielding ax begins to return, striking the unfortunate treasure hunters. <br /> <br /> With his terrible script, an impressive brand. Until the effects and the villain of the Scooby-Doo style, 'The Curse of the Forty-Niner' is at the height of Buechler's course. Only the unconditional ones of the sort Keren Black, Richard Lynch and John Phillip Law grant credibility to this film, with the rest of the cast giving performances that go from bad to horrible (although I will forgive Alexandra Ford, who is a complete hottie). <Br /> <br /> Even fans of Schlock's horror will be disappointed, as most women dress and many of the deaths happen off the screen (which is probably not so bad since the deaths in screen). they are pathetic). <br /> <br /> 'The Curse of the Forty-Niner' is another in a long list of failures for John Carl.
