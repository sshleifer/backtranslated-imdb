As the main "character", Lillith Silver likes to point out: "You know f ** k all about vampires." It is clear that this statement was directed to the cast and crew, who create an extremely bad image of the undead favorite of all. According to the wrong director, the vampires are soaked in a white base and huddled in latex similar to a piece of meat in a shrink wrap. With fangs that resemble those of Bannana and a bad case of asthma, our protagonist Lillith creates a slapstick caricature of the "modern" vampire. <br /> <br /> The plot consists of a playstation collection for 9-year-old children written on a piece of paper, then mixed to make this horrible story. Lillith, our pale protagonist, is a vampire bounty hunter who earns a living away from the members of everyone's favorite cult, the Illuminati! However, instead of incorporating the classic murderous methodology of stealth and precision, Lillith enters through an open window and then proceeds to hit her white necks before firing them with a gun (apparently does not leave bullet holes thanks to the unstable continuity). ). Then PC Plod is assigned to solve the murders, arrives at the grizzly conclusion, although surprisingly obvious, that Lillith is actually a vampire and proceeds to hunt her armed with the usual tools of vampire dispatch, such as a cross, garlic and a piece of sharp wood. . Meanwhile, Lillith, who has become accustomed to beating her boss, feels distressed when an old nemesis hits him and demands a ransom to hand him over personally. As you can imagine, this does not go according to plan. However, I will not go through the pain of the following scenes, so I'll skip to the end. Lillith and her "nemesis" have a confrontation, and after Lillith gets the victory, it is revealed, with all the extravagance of someone who is said to have cancer, that the two are lovers of a century and the whole plot was a kind of twisted game. Yes, that kick in the balls was the real ending of the movie. In my opinion, this joke of a conclusion is the icing on the cake coated with latex, and sealed this film in the vault "Never look at this." <br /> <br /> Regarding the cinematographic techniques, the film is limited to Do not bother to create any style. The director tries to rescue his disaster from the edge, throwing some close-ups and some multi-angle shots, however, this is not the salvation the film needed. <br /> <br /> It may be screaming "but this is a B movie, it's meant to be bullshit." However, I do not feel sorry for myself. I've seen some B crack movies, like evil dead 2 and Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, and therefore this misfortune can not hide behind the excuses. The budget was low, this is obvious due to the lack of location and good actors. Maybe, though, if the director were more creative and spent less money paying for makeup and fake blood, he could have done something decent with this disgusting attempt. Sordid sex scenes are not beneficial in any way and only served to giggle at the obscene acting skills at all times. Half of the budget must have been paid to the female cast just for taking off the top for the lesbians. If I wanted to see a vampire porn, I would have bought Muffy The Vampire Layer. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad, the story is worse and the effects are terribly false. This movie had some potential, however, its sordid tone and the shameful portrayal of a classic horror character simply served to be his downfall. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh with some friends, I recommend you see this mockery. If you're looking for a more serious vampire action movie, try Blade or Underworld to relieve your thirst for blood.
