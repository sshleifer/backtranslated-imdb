Bela Lugosi is a true enigma. In the early 1930s, he was on top of the world after appearing in Dracula. However, over and over again, he made bad decisions regarding his career. Maybe he had a bad agent, maybe his alcohol and drug use had a part in him or maybe he was just crazy. In any case, it ruined his reputation by appearing in almost any film, from excellent horror movies (such as THE RAVEN) to big budget movies (such as NINOTCHKA) to Z-grade movies for cheaper and shoddy studios. Interestingly, although he agreed to make this terrible film, he actually rejected the role that was later for Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN. As for this movie, it's a very stupid and horribly produced World War II propaganda film that presented a stupid argument and a miserable edition. Lugosi spends much of the film murdering saboteurs, it's nothing bad. But in the end, we discovered that he himself is a Nazi plastic surgeon and that all the American-looking men he killed were actually Japanese! The funniest part of this is during a flashback. You'll see Lugosi talking to a group of Japanese men before changing them to American-style men. When the camera scans them, men are clearly Asian. But, in all the other shots that are not close, they are all VERY Western, many of them with a bald head! They seemed absolutely NOTHING like Japanese men. I suspect that the plot must have been rewritten and this could explain the obvious error. Or, it could simply be poor quality production and editing values. In fact, at the beginning of the film, they show a street scene in the city and all the cars (around 1942) are old Ford Model T, obviously of archival material! The conclusion is that the movie is bad but also very boring. Unlike PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, it is hard to laugh at ineptitude; simply, lie down with her.
