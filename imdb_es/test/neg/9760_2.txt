The writer and director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless theme, friendship, and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite the A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. Everything is in the plot, and the plot is ridiculous. "Teach me to be nice", art dealer François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and that sums it up. We learn almost nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil can be a good actor, but not a minute we think it could be the fierce egoist of whom the script depends on him. Just when we expect the farce to be over, Leconte pulls one of his usual third cathartic acts, rapidly moving from one damage to another. Like the precious Greek vase by François, everyone and everything in this film is false. The only advantage of Leconte is Julie Gayet in the part of Coste's business partner, Catherine, with an attractive and sexy appearance despite a major hair accident.
