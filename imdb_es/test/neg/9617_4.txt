I will not waste your time describing the plot for this, the other critic already did quite well. However I will give you my opinion of this movie. This movie is basically against Japanese propaganda. The Japanese are portrayed as incredibly evil bards who have no respect for anything, in addition to having very poor martial arts skills (groups of Japanese men arrive there after the kicks of single women on more than one occasion). the fighters lose almost all (if not all) the fights in the film somehow remove the suspense. However, the plot is quite solid and perfect for a kung fu movie. The problem lies in the fact that there is not much struggle. When there are fights, some of the fights are pretty good, but other scenes are badly choreographed. An angela mao scene acquires six Japanese in a church and kicks all her asses. The problem is that they show that they fight with them one by one when they are supposed to be attacking at the same time. I suppose this movie was incredibly cheap considering how cheap some of the sets are. They use the same set of people for when they are in Korea and when they are in China without changing it at all. However, some scenes are recorded in real places and look good. In general, the only real problem with the movie is that it is a slow and uninteresting argument. Since there are few fight scenes, we have to trust the plot for the entertainment and, well, I did not entertain myself. <br /> <br /> one and a half stars in four
