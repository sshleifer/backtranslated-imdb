I remember seeing this movie when I was about 10 years old, one of my friends had it. At that time it was just a movie, since I was about 10 years old and I thought it was another action movie. <br /> <br /> When I look back now as a complete movie buff, this is a surprisingly bad movie. Whoever produced this movie, I'm sure he had a short career in Hollywood. Although the main actor seems to have made some movies according to IMDb, although I have not seen any and I do not remember much. <br /> <br /> Anyway, just to say that this movie is really Mal, in every way it could be. Although I would love to see it again: oD
