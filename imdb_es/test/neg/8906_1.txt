I got this movie on DVD with the title Evil Never Sleeps, which gives the cover to Carrie Ann Moss, but she plays a character so small that I did not notice her in the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I think this is one of the worst purchases I've made. The dialogue was forced and the delivery of wood, I found that the performance was disconnected from the plot. Graham's performance for me was that of someone who wonders if he left the gas at home. <br /> <br /> In general, both my wife and I thought it was a painful movie, and it is not a valuable addition to my Recolecta, look at your own risk, but spend 90 minutes to get your nails It would probably be a better way to spend your time.
