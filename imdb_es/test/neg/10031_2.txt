All the criticisms of this movie are quite valid! It's pretty boring, and it's full of all kinds of ridiculous and pointless things. A couple exchanging nod their head for their "good food." A medium shot of a desk as a telephone rings until someone finally arrives, sits down and responds at a fairly leisurely pace. Quadruple takes or more when people look at things. Solitaire banjo-tuning and game, taking a break for a beer. Telling a fawn a joke, about a large mouth frog trying to learn what to feed its babies, complete with many large mouth expressions (which are necessary for the weak boxing line). The fact of sharing the sandwiches of cucumber and cream cheese in oatmeal, which for the delicate becomes unbearable when talking about people burned in a fire. A lot of close-up shots of animals, birds, insects and spiders in the forest. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a forest fire, then at least a couple of decades later, some people in those places. The same woods are killed by an ax. Evidently, the killer was not too pleased with the ax he stole and killed other people with other weapons of opportunity or with his own hands. <br /> <br /> If true, the film in the version available abroad. the video tape of the copy is cut, perhaps if a large number of images were cut, it deserves another look at the DVD. Otherwise, it's just not very interesting, and would probably test the patience of even the most die-hard outdoor fans.
