How LIVING THE DREAM managed to get into Laemmle 5 in West Hollywood surpasses me, since it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I should have known when the first scene opened, Eugene, Oregon, that this movie with characters that you would like to thank and feel sorry for your days of high school exclusion, but can not, since you are such losers, are so cunning and atrocious with a dialogue that is beyond the bad. <br /> <br /> So, cliche, the three losers from high school end up in Los Angeles, and this is where the movie could have been realistic if Les had shown it trying to find a career in acting. But no, you work as a used car salesman, the other is a real loser in a garage call center that sells magazines. Even the bastard who runs the place has more appeal to the audience than that horrible actor with the horrible foreign accent. And, they fraudulently obtain money from an insurance scam to establish an inexperienced Executive Recruiting company, simply showing "the supposed good life" in Los Angeles nightspots with a cast of such cunning and evil actors, that it's better than do not have SAG Cards ... <br /> <br /> I could go on and on about this bad movie, but I ended up leaving the theater, which had at first six people, and when I left, four were the only ones. those of the audience. I wanted to like this movie, but I could not find a merit in the story, the characters, the writing, the dialogue or the actors. Whoever has cast this film must withdraw. Amen ... enough ...
