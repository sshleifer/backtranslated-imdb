Unfortunately, this movie had potential with such a willing cast, but everything was so badly thought and badly executed. I do not think I've seen any movie in which each scene falls off with a thud, as it happened here. Also, I think I have never seen a sexual comedy "stoner" that did not provide at least a laugh, but this vortex of pain did not provide more than moans and misery. The last time I was so surprised at how funny a comedy can be, it was with the horrible "Casa de la gran mam√°". Scene after scene, these movies will turn your brain into jelly. The fool and the stupid can sometimes be fun, but here, the fool and the stupid are used as a torture device against the spectator. An absolute, false rock bottom.
