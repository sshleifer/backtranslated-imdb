'Helen of Troy' follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan War. This is more of a love story between Helen and Paris, who falls shipwrecked and falls in love with Helen without knowing that she is the queen. The film portrays the couple as being in love and wants nothing more than to be together. (Other films and books have different representations of the characters, but in this, they are simply hopelessly in love). The movie is pretty slow in some places, but the battles and the details of the scenery are pretty good. There are also some good performances. I thought the slave did a particularly good job, and she was one of the most popular characters. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good adaptation if you can see past the history of slow movement Places and looks beyond some of the romantic corny and dialogues. In my opinion, a perfect movie version of the Iliad has not yet been created, but it is entertaining and has some nice details.
