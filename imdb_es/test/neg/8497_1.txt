This movie has made her crazy. I think the original of this movie, 'The Mask', was an incredible movie, worth buying and seeing a lot. I firmly believed that they should do a sequel, but when I saw this, I thought again. <br /> <br /> This movie has ruined the whole idea of ​​'The mask'. Mask mode? A baby flying in a room? My little brother of seven years did not even laugh, and he is interested in these children's films, but this was worse. A load of garbage! I'm telling you now, please do not watch this movie, it's a waste of money and a waste of time. Instead, he could actually be having fun! Look at 'The mask', but no, I repeat NO, look at this piece of garbage. Thank you.
