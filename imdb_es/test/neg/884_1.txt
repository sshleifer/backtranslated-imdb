Let me clarify this: <br /> <br /> "The Hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a cyst from his face and ends up falling in love with a recently separated bed and breakfast hostess, approximately 24 hours after knowing her because of her solid advice on how to go to bed. " <br /> <br /> Wow. Move on "The Notebook", there is a new child in the city. <br /> <br /> Where to start. Well, what about the depth of this "relationship"? I think we can safely summarize the basis of this eternal love in the following steps: <br /> <br /> 1. Exchange polite courtesies for a mouthful of salad. 2. Drink large quantities of Jack Daniels; play basketball with old food 3. Give yourself simple and unsolicited advice about your fucking lives. 4. Making love during a hurricane. 5. Devote your lives by airmail. <br /> <br /> I noticed that George C Wolfe has "The Hairball" and "United Kanye West Project" in his file. Would it be "hard to your gender" too hard? Enough talk. I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry, laugh or even wait. But the reason they can do it is that, somewhere in the story, we really start to worry about the characters we're seeing on the screen. For us to worry, you must devote time to develop these characters ... their lives, their history, why we are seeing them now. Wolfe did not seem to want to "waste time" with such trivialities, and instead gave us approximately 8 minutes of background information on each character before launching into an intense one-on-one interaction between two ACTORS. We have all come to adore, but to two CHARACTERS that do not matter to us. <br /> <br /> For a brief moment of tenderness when Richard Gere exclaims that he does not expect her to listen to his problems, and she invites him. At dinner, the viewer sees a flash, a beginning, of something special between these two characters. But instead of being allowed to enjoy the anticipation and joy of "what happens next" in the wonderful and unpredictable joy that is courtship, instead, we are pushed into a loving relationship between two people who we barely know <br /> <br /> Let's face it. We've all heard cheesy one liners in romantic movies. But the reason why we left Bogart in "Casablanca" or Nicholson in "Something's Gotta Give" is because our hearts and minds have risen to the heavens and have been dragged through the mud and back with these characters, and by the time deliver the line, we are so deeply involved with your situation that we do not even notice the cheese factor. As Wolfe does not allow us to love or even as our protagonists, we all left with a chewing gum sandwich and a few giggles in the audience. <br /> <br /> Wolfe takes the phrase from the old Hollywood director "Cut to The Persecution" too literally here. As each of the forced is handed out by our cast, the viewer wonders if director Wolfe is subliminally saying to the audience: "Come on, it's Richard Richard's romance. <br /> <br /> It is as a result of this surprising lack of character development, or relationship, that the climax of the film fails miserably to pull our hearts. When the character of Gere dies, I felt I was watching the news of someone who did not know he was dying. Or watch a rowing race of eights during the Beijing Olympics. Single. I did not Care. <br /> <br /> Epic. Fail.
