As in the previous poster, I'm from northern Vermont and I liked this movie. However, not from the "Red Zone of Cuba" I have seen such a confusing plot. The things that pirate people do not make sense. Two of the gang members who cross the border send a second party in a car. Uhm, why? Then they meet another two, and drive at night to the hideout of the bad boy in a luxurious Packard. - Would not only two people make more sense in a platform truck? Then, parked outside the garage that has the booty pointed, the four fall asleep! When they wake up in the morning and start to take out the whiskey, of course, they are seen and shot, losing part of their precious burden in the process. Then, two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and took it to the border. Again, why? Someone whose great uncle really smuggled in the area, all that was needed was to drive a vehicle that could surpass the Border Patrol of Canada, which at that time had a fraction of the resources it has now. <br /> <br /> And do not make me start with the last half hour, which does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about the film is that Kris Kristopherson has actually grown a bit of charisma over the years.
