Although touted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast, Ice-cream, I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity. <br /> <br /> The plot opens with Ali's dream, a traveling ice. cream vendor in a city in Western Anatolia, where he sees himself as successful using the same marketing methods as the big ice cream companies. She dreams of playing in the television commercial of her product with beautiful bikini models, dancing around her. As his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gigantic wife, who refuses to have sex with him for 6 years without any apparent reason. Is it because he is not successful in his work? Apparently, because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from the global ice cream companies. But this is what he says; we do not see him suffer so much: he still sells well, travels through the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays in the store, selling ice cream to the people of the city. Ali blames big companies for the use of sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real "sahlep" (roots of mountain orchid dust). Ali buys a motorcycle with a bank loan to be a street vendor and gives advertisements to a local television channel that prefers to broadcast even the local dialect newsletter. His wife does not like his ways of doing business, they always fight, and Ali threatens to do very bad things in a moment of frenzy. <br /> <br /> On a very successful day, your bad bicycle is stolen by poorly behaved children in the city. In search of his stolen bicycle, Ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for the theft, but, of course, nobody takes it seriously. Annoyed by his wife's annoyance, Ali goes to a tavern and gets drunk. One of his friends at the table, an aspiring socialist from the city, gives a didactic discourse and criticizes globalism, and without any real connection, he throws himself into the subject of the global freeze. Ali returns home and decides to commit suicide with poison. His wife wakes up and prevents him. An old neighbor takes him on an evening stroll and advises him on life. According to him, Ali can even sell hot sahlep drinks if the world is facing a global freeze. When he returns home, we suddenly see that his wife understood his courage, treating him like a hero and praising his manhood. Meanwhile, the thieves got sick eating too much ice cream. They confess to the doctor that they stole Ali's bicycle. Ali forgives them and the happy ending arrives. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may seem promising in some way, it is the narrative that makes this film insincere and corny. First, the director does not show much effort to tell the story visually; Everything is based on dialogues. And the dialogues never stop to show us that cinema is really a visual art. Even Ali's problems are not convincing because we do not see him, we only understand him by his words. The director markets his film as Ali's fair fight against the big ice cream companies, but there's nothing in the movie about big companies. We do not see his pressure enough. The film actually ridicules Ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft. And when her motorcycle is found, she solves all the problems: Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. It is not a real criticism of globalism. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the movie is corny due to raw humor. Maybe people in that part of Turkey are cursing and doing so many vulgar jokes in their daily lives, but vulgar language and raw humor are not enough to make a funny movie. I may have accepted it if they were vulgar and "smart", but they are not smart jokes, they are simply corny. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe Americans like the oriental version of American Pie style humor. But American Pie never had any right to be nominated for the Oscars, nor to have a political message! If you think you can laugh at just seeing the big erection of a man in his shorts (and we had to endure this joke twice!) Or an old village girl saying "f ** k", then you can find this funny movie.
