The comments for Commune make it look like a very interesting movie, one that would interest me deeply. Unfortunately, producers did not find it appropriate to include subtitles for people with hearing and deaf disabilities. That leaves me and many others like me, completely dependent on subtitles to follow a movie. <br /> <br /> This is inexcusable for any film produced in 2005. In a world where all types of disabilities and disabilities are accommodated, it is exasperating and ironic that the entertainment industry, which is always so sanctified, does not demand that all productions and theaters be closed with subtitles.
