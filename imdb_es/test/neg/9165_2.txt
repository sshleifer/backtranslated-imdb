I entered this film with almost high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood, and this almost destroyed that love for me. Jason Lee, David Sevilla in the movie, is horrible. I understand that it can not be easy to act with CGI characters that are not really there, but I did find their atrocious performance, along with all the other non-animated characters. Chipmunks were adorable, but sometimes they were clearly obvious when moving the plot of the story and, therefore, they did not tempt me to stay in the movies for more than half an hour after the movie. If you feel you should see this movie, rent it, at the most. It is NOT worth eight dollars to see it in theaters, unless you want to laugh at the horrible performance.
