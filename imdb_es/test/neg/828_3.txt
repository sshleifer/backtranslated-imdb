I CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS For the past four years, I've been a huge fan of Ali G. Sacha Baron Cohen is, without doubt, a very funny and intelligent guy and, in my opinion, his best creation is Borat, which is as fun as the Hell and pretty cheeky in what he does and he tells people. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie. I did not bother paying money to see this at the cinema; I guess because I did not expect much, but when I hired the DVD recently, I found it quite sad. The best part of Ali pulling out the mickey from the others was largely gone and the script and plot were damn horrible; hook up all the batteries in the car to burn a safe - REALLY !! <br /> <br /> This movie shows that I think some things can last too long and definitely do not translate to the big screen. The film also had that sweet final that I have come to expect from British films. Where have all the good ideals of British film creation gone? That said, there were very funny moments like the dog in Ali's bed and Ali's audience with HM the Q with the comment "Shaven haven - RESPECT". <br /> <br /> So, in short, I am an Ali G and the Borat fan and I have enjoyed many of his interviews (especially that of Anita Roddick from Body Shop), but this movie was not very good to me. If there's going to be another movie, I hope it's much better than this bunch of old men. <br /> <br /> Weasel100 <br /> <br /> Canberra, Australia
