Another Indian legend you've never heard of is unleashed. As the name implies, this is a vengeful specter that likes to absorb the skeletons of people while they are still using them. As usual, the old cemeteries (can you say, "Poltergeist?") Have been disturbed by the greedy greedy land developers who build things. <br /> <br /> The CGI, if it had been better, could have made the effect more look treacherous, but they skimped on the budget, and it shows - to comedic effect. The unleashed creature probably should have stayed off the stage during his first murders, which could have added some mystery or imminent atmosphere of fatality, but the inept director decided to show us in the first five minutes how it looks, and it did not. Awesome. The deaths are wrong, again with CGI of poor quality. I guess the ancient spirits always kill using cheap special effects. As for the "victims", it seems that they will laugh at any moment while making ridiculous shouts. It is always obvious who will get it: a character appears with only a few lines, strange noises are heard, CGI points fly, the character is exited. Repeat (several times). <br /> <br /> Still, there are some chase scenes in which the monster appears that really made this thing visible. Unfortunately, the director seems to be using these as a device to resort to (so it is used too often) when he can not think of anything else for his characters to do. In general, it is quite silly, but I have seen worse things. This movie is cheap, but strangely fun to watch.
