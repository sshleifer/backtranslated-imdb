This movie sucks so bad. It's funny to see the poor story that this has, where two American twins who know nothing outside their school can come to another continent and do unimaginable things there. It's so stupid and so strange. How can they find two Frenchmen, beat them and, in the end, kiss them, without knowing anything about them? More realistic would have been for the boys to take them away and rape them, which could easily have happened in such a situation. As for the part where they make the French president drink 'bad water', that was nonsense. I do not think I would have been so happy in real life. Everything was too easy for the girls, and they could have been in real trouble many times in the movie, if they represented real life. <br /> <br /> My rating: 0/10
