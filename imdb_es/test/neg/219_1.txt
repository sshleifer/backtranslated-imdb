This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen! The cast was fantastic, but the movie itself was horrible. It was so horrible that I had to check in just to say how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and I wanted to break it every minute I saw. It could have been great. I had a great premise. If you are going to steal an armored vehicle and there is a homeless person who sees you, you have to do, what you have to do. For the main character to decide to kill a policeman, and kill his friends and coworkers after the destitute was already dead, it's ridiculous. And yes, I'm sure there will be answers to this about how his conscience came to him, but come on. <br /> <br /> The main character crawled through the bottom of the armored truck, nobody saw it. He blew up the stash of money, grabbed and dragged the cop right behind the other guards and nobody saw him. He was able to return to the armored car, and nobody saw him ... This movie had potential, but it spoiled it. <br /> <br /> I could not afford to watch this movie anymore! NEVER see it! Aggravating...
