I rarely turn off a movie after the first 10 minutes, but that's what I did with it. What discouraged me was that it was so obvious that the only purpose of this movie was to expose as many B actresses as possible, and nothing else really matters. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong; I like pretty actresses and sex scenes, and sexploitation movies have their own scale of merit, but this director does not do anything right. <br /> <br /> For example, take the scene where the two cops (of course, one boy and one) gal and OF COURSE, there is all this supposedly ingenious joke between them) are talking while standing on the first body dead. The camera moves between them for each line, (there is more than one screen width between them!) And you end up wondering if you are dizzy from that or from the clueless dialogue. <br /> <br /> Well, I COULD have improved after the first 10 minutes, but I would not know. I rejected the piglet bet and found something better to do.
