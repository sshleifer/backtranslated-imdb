Savage Steve Holland wrote and directed his second film, One Crazy Summer, with John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong again in a supporting role. Cusack and Bobcat Goldthwait are recent graduates who head to Cape Cod to stay at Grandma's home during the summer. On the way, they run into Demi Moore, pursued by John Matuszak and a gang of motorcyclists. Soon, the three come together to try to prevent a house from becoming another lobster restaurant and become a lobster restaurant that considers "work" as a dirty word. The film contains several funny vignettes, such as the jokes of the millionaire radio contest and the work of Godzilla. <br /> <br /> Like Holland's first film, Better Off Dead, John Cusack adds greatly to the film. Otherwise, this is a failure of a movie full of artificial situations and idiotic characters (instead of peculiar). Moore even sings some bars in a nightclub with some horrible synths. Goldthwait's gags run out after a while, and Armstrong was never an actor of any caliber to appear in anything except the Z-grade stuff. The twins of the towing cranes are extremely annoying and unpleasant rather than the losers more endearments that obviously should be. This is more like a kitchen sink comedy that could have used a better script and direction. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
