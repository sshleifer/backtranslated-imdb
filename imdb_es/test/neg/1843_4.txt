The concept for this movie was pretty good. But somehow the execution failed in many parts. There are not many horror movies that I can think of that use dolls that look so realistic. Especially when these dolls begin to blink or move their hands. A lot could have been done with this premise. There were many scenes where there was room for tension and suspense. And I really expected spooky things to happen. But the movie never managed to be scary. One of the main reasons is that the story is too minimal and predictable. In fact, I thought they did it on purpose to surprise us with a wonderful twist. Unfortunately this does not happen. Well, at least not in the way I expected. The cast also failed to make everything credible. It would have been nice if more information about the characters was given. At the beginning when we introduce ourselves to the main character. It seems that she and other characters are invited by some kind of artist. But it is also evident that they themselves do not have an idea for what they are invited. Of course this is part of the mystery. But it seems unlikely. If I received an invitation without having an idea of ​​what the deal is, I simply would not go. Also, most of the characters are not really nice with the end result that you never take care of them. Another flaw is that the director deviates from the basic premise, which is terrifying enough and brings new elements that are never explained and that are not even relevant to the "mystery of Doll Master." In general, this movie has been a big disappointment to me. If you want to see a good horror movie with dolls, go see "Dead Silence"!
