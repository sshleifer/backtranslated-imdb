At first I thought that this little fantasy excursion would be a little entertaining. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> A good cast (Roy Scheider as president) did not help at all. The story had every possible worst possible scenario that could occur in a nuclear terrorist disaster. And none of this could POSSIBLY happen! <br /> <br /> Right - the kidnapping of the President could only be achieved with the internal help of a traitor in the Secret Service (wing Air Force One), but everything they described about FOOTBALL and the impotence of our If the country falls into the hands of the enemy, it is ridiculous until the ninth grade. Seriously, not even the president can completely cancel our missile control. The case is only used to transmit orders. In this situation, our system would have completely eliminated the codes and everything would go nowhere. The destruction of Beijing could not happen, there would not have been a missile launch because the crews of the silos would have been ordered not to do so (communications include a wired system). There are too many security guards to prevent something like this from happening. <br /> <br /> True, movies like FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE gave some credibility to the concept that we lose control of THE SYSTEM. But this movie goes too far and I can not suspend my concept of the incredible. And that makes the experience a waste of time for the viewer. This movie is a failure.
