I am a huge fan of Assault On Precinct 13 original. The ice cream scene chases me until today. Now I am 33 years old and I still remember that I was horrified when I was a child. When I heard that they were remaking it, I thought it might be good, but when I saw the movie, it's not the same movie at 100%. It is not a remake. It's a bad idea stolen. I was completely ruined. The cast, Maria Bello, Laurence Fishburne, Ethan Hawke, Gabriel Burne, John Leguizamo and Drea De Matteo are great actors, but not even they could save this movie. It was wrong. Even the scenario was completely opposite. And how the hell nobody in that city realized that there was a war in the next door? Why did not it help to appear before? Stupid. Without sense.
