I found this movie to be a complete waste of 96 minutes. Jones was a strange child and he is very bad! According to my memory, what could be wrong, was not he only 16 or 17 years old? ** Spoiler ** why did he leave the university and rent an apartment with two crazy girls who fight over the children for a while? and the cowboy who lives under Jones also scared me, how he knew what happened in the apartments did not happen by my side for a minute. I do not understand his thinking about the girl who took pictures for fun and stayed in his room when Mandy Moore was always over and it was pretty obvious that she wanted to be more than a friend with him. I really do not find this movie funny or artistic or dramatic or something like that, it seemed stupid and a complete waste of time (D-F +)
