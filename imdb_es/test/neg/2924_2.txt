The highlight of "Talk Radio" is how bad it is. The voices of the callers all have a fake timbre of reading a script. One afternoon with an annoying puff on a Dallas radio station is related to the portentousness of a Sartrean vision in hell. Stone tries an existential revelation and, instead, gets involuntary comedy. When a caller makes a "deep" (empty) point on something, Stone pushes the camera towards one of the characters of his character, since they are affected by a traumatic realization that is never revealed to the public. Bogosian exaggerates in one of the most irritating performances that has ever been applied to celluloid. Classic underestimated? Give me a break.
