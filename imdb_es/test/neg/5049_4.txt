A ridiculous thriller in which a group of students kidnapped their evil and neurotic teacher (Mirren) only to avoid their action against them. An interesting premise could be a good movie, but this one is simply unconvincing. Bored with an embarrassing ending, to say the least. Mrs. Mirren tries to give some dignity to this misfire, but even she, a good actress, without a doubt, could save this garbage. I give this one 4 (four).
