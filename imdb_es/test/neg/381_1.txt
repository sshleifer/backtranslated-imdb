Mr. Bean is just a lot of slapstick humor without grace. It is the most superficial television humor series ever made in history. The scenes are often unpleasant and the horrible canned laugh sends chills down the spine. Mr. Bean is a selfish and rude character and one can only empathize with how pathetic he is. It is incredible that a series of low quality television can be maintained for 5 years. It is a complete waste of time to see even 1 episode and one can not help but express his disgust and pity why Rowen had presented himself as a two-dimensional character, without grace and ridicule. Or pity why he even bothered to watch an episode. Seeing this is an aggravating experience.
