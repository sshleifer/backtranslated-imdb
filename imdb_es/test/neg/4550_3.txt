If you like soap series, you may like this movie. I recommend this movie to fans of series of Dutch soap operas such as GTST, Westenwind or even American things like The Bold & The Beautiful. If you do not like those things, stay away from this movie. It has the same type of visual style, the same acting quality, direction and writing. The film was a great success in its territory, but it was not sold anywhere else outside Holland and Belgium. Pretty strange for a commercial movie like this. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'll say something ...
