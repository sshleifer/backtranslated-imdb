It is difficult to say if this adventure of B-movie is a parody, a homage or simply a confusion, but it does not work as you see it. Based on the novel novel by Michael Crichton, it is a mix of lost cities, giant hippos, monster monsters, naff visual effects and cheesy dialogue. The first thing that surprises is the gorilla that can communicate in sign language, and it goes without saying that the film does not improve from that moment. Tim Curry makes all this old rope worthwhile, turns into a piece of fevered ham and has a strange accent that defies identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems to know that all this is a pile of old trash.
