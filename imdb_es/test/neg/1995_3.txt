After almost being killed by a big dog, a street cat thinks to herself: "Why can not I be a skunk? Then everyone would leave me alone." He looks around the junkyard and comes up with an idea: white paint, black paint and some Limburger cheese and some garlic ... mmm. The next thing you know is that we have the precursor of "Pepe Le Pew", although in this caricature, she is still a cat, she is a she, and only a skunk in disguise. <br /> <br /> The cat is also enjoying and taking full advantage of its new state as a smelly skunk. Now he is a happy and happy boy ... until a real skunk appears (with the imitation voice of Charles Boyer)! <br /> <br /> I really appreciated the cat that put on a Bugs Bunny suit. However, in general, I was never interested in these French takeoff characters, finding the dialogue stereotyped exaggerated and not very funny, so I only call it "fair". I make this a point, however, for the moral at the end of the story.
