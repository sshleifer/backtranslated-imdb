This is, by far, the stupidest thing I've seen on celluloid. I mean, we started to see him assuming it was a "T & A skinemax movie," but other than a pair of tits, that was it. I mean, I have the point of making stupid movies to show some sex scenes, since they are the only reason to make a movie of that kind. This movie, however, does not have sex scenes, and it really does not make any sense. There is no linear time, the scenes move like a fart in the wind, people appear without reason, then leave, and it is never explained, the plot never progresses, and nothing happens. I've never been so amazed at how bad a movie was until I saw this. Has the director gone to a film school? Have you ever seen a movie? I do not know, but from the looks of it, it seems to have made some imbeciles feel proud about this piece of shit, since it's still working. I literally walked away from this silly movie, but I still recommend seeing it, since it should be shown in all the film schools in the country as an example of what not to do when making a movie. Move over PLan 9 from Outer Space, you have a new contender for the worst movie ever made.
