When I saw this movie for the first time, I said to myself: "Hey, what the hell sounds like a good movie, why not rent it?". So yes, I rented it and went home to see it. When I inserted it into my DVD player, I was surprised. <br /> <br /> Well, FIRST, nobody told me it was a Mexican movie and it was spoken in Spanish, well, it had subtitles. <br /> <br /> SECOND, I was naked, naked, naked! Since I do not have a background in Mexican films, you could see my surprise when I saw her. *GASP! Covering virgin eyes, NOO * <br /> <br /> THIRD, predictable to say the least, but being predictable was not an excuse for me to like movies, because I do not care if it's predictable, unless it's very above the top. <br /> <br /> FOURTH, how they met Heidi and Kike, so corny. <br /> <br /> FIFTH, how the movie ended. It was a BAD, BAD end. How Mr. Van der Linde's sudden approval for the mayor's election was because his daughter knew how to organize the party ... BLAH, Blah. I hoped it was not so easy to accept, the director could have rushed to do it. <br /> <br /> After all this attack of bad things, good things are to come. The movie was actually pretty hilarious at some point with Maribel being awkward in the kitchen and all, Heidi's attitude, Valentina being poetic with words. What I also really like is the song that Valentina did with her girlfriend. That's all, and for the other things that I did not mention, they were more or less like that.
