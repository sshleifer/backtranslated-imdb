The movie was horrible. The production company should be required to pay a fine for wasting the electricity that transmits this nonsense. <br /> <br /> There were too many holes in the plot. Why would the DOJ send an assassin to assassinate a world leader? If it were not the Justice Department, why would they send someone they thought would not do the job? To quote Butch Cassidy, "Who are those guys?" Apparently, the director does not know either because he never told us anything. <br /> <br /> The characters were incredible. They did not behave in any way that seemed to fit with who they supposedly were. With the exception of the doctor, none of the characters was particularly attractive or sympathetic. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend money on the electricity needed to watch this movie, feel free. Otherwise, run the opposite direction.
