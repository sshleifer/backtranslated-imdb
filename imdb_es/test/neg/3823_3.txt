Some of the critics of this film were extremely "generous" with praise. Personally I was disappointed, because due to these criticisms, I was optimistic when starting to roll the opening credits. <br /> <br /> The line of the familiar story is like this: the deformed child and his father live in Louisiana Swamp. The local boys ridicule and torment him. The local boys start with Gruesome, oh, I'm sorry, I mean Victor Crowley's cabin ablaze with him in it. Dad tries to rescue his son, formerly known as Eddie Munster, meets the Elephant Man, but accidentally passes an ax over the boy's head. Victor becomes a murderous ghost that pursues the unfortunate who enter his domain. Oooo ... scary. <br /> <br /> One thing I appreciated about Hatchet was that he never took it seriously and that some of the gags made me laugh. The point is that I got tired of Hollywood's polished B-horror sticks. I like to laugh and I enjoy a good scare, but this movie did not offer a solid dose of either. As for Crowley being the next Michael, Jason or Freddy ... Pumpkinhead has a better chance.
