After the wife of a plastic surgeon dies, she receives her hunchbacked assistant to help her revive her with various parts of other young, nubile girls. This movie wants to be a romp in the style of Hersel Gordon Lewis, but fails miserably. The acting is beyond the bad, the bloody effects are atrocious (no, not in the right way), the plot almost non-existent and not fun. Skip it. Do you want to know how incompetent it is? At any given time, you can see a blackboard of the movie quite obviously. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Candy Furr gets topless and again in a flashback <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <Br /> DVD Extras: Comment with Jeffrey Hogue and Cynthia Soroka, a second feature "How to make a doll"; Alternative title sequence with introduction by Hershel Gordon Lewis; 2 shorts ("Quest of the Perfect Woman" and "Maniac Hospital"); Cover the art gallery with music by Dead Elvi; Trailers for "Dr. Black Mr. Hyde", "Boots and the Preacher"; "The Doctor and the Playgirls", "The Gruesome Twosome"; "Magician of Gore"; "Horrible Dr. Orlof"; "Mad world of Dr. Morgus"; "Proffessor Lust", "Monstrosity"; "Fanny Hill meets Dr. Erotico"; and "I, Marquis DeSade" <br /> <br /> Easter Eggs: Theatrical Trailer; a scene from "Just for the Hell of It"; and a trailer for "Ax"
