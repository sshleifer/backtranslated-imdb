My Age: 13 <br /> <br /> James Cole, played by Steven Seagal, is sent to help Detective Jim Campbell, played by Keenen Ivory Wayans, to solve a series of murders in which victims are crucified. Since Cole arrived at the scene, he realizes that the murders have changed a bit and he thinks there is a different killer. It becomes personal when his ex-wife is murdered, and Campbell finds his prints on the body. Campbell investigates the mysterious Cole and discovers a very dark past. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal. I like action movies, but he's the worst actor I've seen. This movie is not very fun to watch, incredibly silly, and, obviously, Steven Seagal's performance is absolutely horrible. However, Keenen Ivory Wayans is not too bad. The only thing that redeems in this movie is the good occasional action scene, although the majority is presented for incredibly stupid reasons. The plot in this movie is absolute gibberish. I did not care at all. All the past of the "shining man" of the character of Seagal was stupid, all the fights of the Mafia and the fights in the restaurant were there for almost no reason. Give this movie a chance. <br /> <br /> Australian classification: MA 15+: High level violence <br /> <br /> Rating: 35 out of 100 (quite generous)
