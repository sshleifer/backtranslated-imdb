For people who have compared this TRASH with the brightness of David Lynch, etc. ... listen to your caregiver when they tell you ... DO NOT USE OTHER PEOPLE'S PC WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION! <br /> <br /> This is complete and UTTER POO! There is no art here. This is a person trying to make a name with a group of rough ideas that was not smart enough to apply them in ONE main idea, so he opted for the easy option. <br /> <br /> Anyone with a half brain could sit at home and evoke some controversial images to surprise viewers, but it takes a person with real imagination to turn it into a movie that people WANT to see. <br /> <br /> I am a LOVER of shock cinema. I have seen O OWN almost everything you can get ... And I can strongly recommend to anyone who LOVES the world of cinema so that it clears well of this garbage. <br /> <br /> This is ONLY for people who would like to analyze more thoroughly what they are seeing, or for first-time 17-year-old drinkers who do not know any better. <br /> <br /> 0/10! <br /> <br />
