I saw this on the shelves of the rental place and I rented everything else, so I said why not. Why is not it because it's one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. It seems that it was filmed with a homemade camcorder. I guess that's all the budget would allow. There were less tits in what I thought there would be. Some people managed to be soft porn with some murders. The funniest part of the whole movie for me is in the extra things. There is a place with deleted scenes. Well, there's only one, but he's the dumbest and I think he may have reduced the rest of the movie. The girls get into a jacuzzi and find some chocolate syrup in the bathroom. Yes, it ends up on them. Good thing !!! This movie is very bad. Do not bother yourself
