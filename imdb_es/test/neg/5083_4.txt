This is the prize that made me lose all respect for the Hugos. <br /> <br /> If a panel so "distinguished" can not see or worry about the obvious problems of the Battlestar Galactica to tell stories, then it's worth it. Your prize? The answer: not much. <br /> <br /> The award-winning programs must be examples of creativity and excellence, none of which is evident in BG, in this episode or in any other that I have seen. <Br /> <br /> Recording in a monotonous video is not "artistic", it's simply cheap. Shaking the camera is not "creative", it is vomit and lazy. <br /> <br /> All BG has shown is how corrupt the "academies" are that give more prizes and how easy it is to buy prizes. With a lot of PR money.
