I do not know how people can see this. The only people who enjoy watching this are those who have no feelings or emotions and enjoy watching people die, burn houses, crash cars, die babies and kill cast members every week. . It's the most absurd thing on television and I still do not know how it gets ratings. It is so depressing. I imagine the writers sitting and saying: "then, who will we kill next week" or "who are we going to burn in a month?" <br /> <br /> It's the most depressing, absurd and most stupid thing on TV right now, and I can no longer understand the motives of people to see this pile of depressing garbage
