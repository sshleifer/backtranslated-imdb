This movie is so unreal. French films like these are just a waste of time. Why watch this movie? Even, I did not know ... why. What? The well-known half-brothers sex scene? Although the sexual scene is so real and explicit, but the story on which it is based is so unreal. What's the use then? Can you easily find in life, half brother doing those things? <br /> <br /> Did I learn anything from this movie? Yes: some people like to waste time making those movies, stories, meaningless. But for those who like nihilism, nothingness in life, or simply a life without hope, then there they are ... they have to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> However, there is only one that is worth loving: CATHERINE DENEUVE. She is a surprisingly beautiful woman.
