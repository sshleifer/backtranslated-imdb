I'm great at acting, writing and directing, but still not famous. My friends and I often rent bad movies, just for fun and laughter, but when we went to the local Family Video and found a movie called Biker Zombies From Detroit, we knew it was going to be the worst movie of all time. I was! Biker Zombies From Detroit does not have a script! They can say they have one, but they are liars! There was a 4 minute scene in which only two boys talked about women and sexuality, and it was obvious that they were improvised. And if they are going to improve, it should be at least decent, but it was not, and one could say that the two actors ruined the lines and said things that did not even make sense. <br /> <br /> To give you an idea of ​​how terrible and retarded this movie is, here's the beginning: a girl skinns a boy, hits her in the face and hits her, then rapes her. Then we see zombies attacking and both become zombies. <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the movie! Not to mention the main zombie voice that transports through the whole movie, trying to be sinister and thought provoking, but which sounds like Marylin Manson has a connotation. In a few words, people. But look at it if you like movies without a script, without an argument, bad acting, bad editing, bad music and more than 100 F words used in the movie. <br /> <br /> If this can affect the video stores, my future The movies will win the Oscars.
