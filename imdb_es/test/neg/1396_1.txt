I have not seen this program in months, but for a while I was forced to see it every day because I had a roommate who liked it. So maybe you have experienced a great improvement in all that time, although the commercials and the 4.2 rating in IMDb are not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Clearly, it was just a quick replacement for the Chappelle Show. Even Mencia says it. And although he was not even a big fan of Chappelle's Show, his jokes were at least original and intelligent (and much more aggressive than Mencia has been). Mencia's jokes are completely unoriginal and outdated. If you can not see that, I guess there's simply no hope for you. But to be fair, here are some examples: <br /> <br /> --Mencia shamelessly starts the sketch of Lil Jon de Chapelle. It just takes it. <br /> <br /> - "South Park" makes an episode about Scientology. A week later, Mencia has a joke about his program about how offensive it is for Scientologists. Keep in mind that the joke is not about Scientologists, but about how much you have offended them in your program. When up to this point, he's never done a single scientology joke, ever. <br /> <br /> - After Hurricane Katrina, two AP photos go online showing a black man "looting" groceries and a white woman "finding" them. WEEKS later, after millions of people have already seen it, Mencia presents it in her program as if she had discovered it and showed it to her for the first time (the Daily Show would have been in something like that in a day). Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Even more annoying than stealing jokes is the way Carlos has promoted himself and his show, claiming he's breaking a PC barrier (whatever) and that if you're not laughing , you must be a weak asshole who can not handle any joke about the race. Yes, Carlos, it's not because you're not funny, it's because we're too offended to laugh (if that was really true, why was the Chappelle Show so popular?). He constantly berates his audience for "not understanding" him if he does not laugh enough, and often repeats and EXPLAINS his jokes, a technique that most comedians stop using at age 14. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that Mencia does not seem to be very intelligent. It's a little tragic that there are dozens of funnier and more perceptive comedians trying to succeed while this guy is accumulating money. Its program is, supposedly, the third best ranked in Comedy Central, which is disconcerting (again, it has a rating of 4.2 on this site). Where the hell are you getting these numbers? Comedy Central tries to bill itself as an "avant-garde" station, but as long as it tries to attract the dumbest audience possible, that will never be the case.
