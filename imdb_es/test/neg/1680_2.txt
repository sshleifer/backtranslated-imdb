An elite American military team that, of course, includes two beautiful women and a guy who can not understand teamwork, many bats, some terrorists and a Spetznaz team that acts like the gang that can not shoot directly. All thrown together in a confused plot with a mediocre performance. This does not have much in his favor. The characters are not convincing. Even the environment, which has great potential, seems somewhat outside of rural Pennsylvania, not an exotic boreal forest in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> Bats are certainly fierce looking. They can even pick up a man and fly with him for a few feet (harpies?) Or cut off an arm. You see the force of Delta surrounded by hundreds of bats with one guy firing assault rifles and pistols at them and throwing them to the ground. It would be like trying to shoot with a rifle from a distance of 3 feet. Completely clueless. The dialogue is rancidly unreal, with boy / girl jokes and flirts amid the tense parts of the mission. One of the team members is blown up by a mine and the first in the scene just looks sadly at his body, dazed, without even bothering to cover or secure the area. In fact, AFTER the rest of the group appears, he talks about how the area is arranged as a minefield, thanks for the great stir. <br /> <br /> If you want a contrast in how a horror movie involves a small military group you can do well on a low budget. The harvest is not the movie you want to see. In fact, I think I'm going to give him a two instead of a three if I can get through the second half. It seems unlikely at this point.
