This film affirms through its protagonist that the world is essentially sadness and pain, and those who ignore it have blinders. One can argue whether this is true or not. But even if he accepts this as true, the end of the film A: A) discusses it saying that there may be something good in tragic situations or B) forgets this and uses a clich√© montage to leave the audience feeling animated. <br /> <br /> That the film metaphorically surpasses its protagonist by presenting it as a sympathetic character even though the evidence shows that the sympathy shows contempt for the secondary characters that were the most convincing in the film. <br /> <br /> So, what to have in this movie a script that is not consistent in its subject and direction that does not synchronize the ending with the rest of the movie. There are excellent performances given by each cast member, especially Spacey, Olin, Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson. It's a shame they have not been supported by a better writer / director.
