In his efforts to make a somewhat comical but serious film about the art of growing marijuana, Stephen Gyllenhaal (director) stayed a few beeps on the edge of a good movie. While the cast is amazing, this film is extremely difficult to interpret. The performance of Billy Bob Thornton, Ryan Phillipe, Jon Bon Jovi, Hank Azaria and Kelly Lynch could not even save this film from failure. It would be wiser to throw three dollar bills down the toilet and watch this movie at the local video store. <br /> <br />
