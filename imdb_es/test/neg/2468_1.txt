This movie is horrible If you're considering watching this movie ... two words NO. It's tasteless, the story is really boring and the jokes are even worse. The acting is really pathetic. I can not believe that this movie was made. Rather, look at American Pie, Going Greek or Road Trip if you're in the mood for a teen comedy. It's about two girls heading to Malibu on their spring break. As usual, they did not do much planning and called (I think she calls Michelle's uncle) to crash at her Malibu mansion. Uncle Bennie strictly forbids them to hold any kind of party and, as you might suppose, they will go ahead. Please, I urge you, do not watch this movie.
