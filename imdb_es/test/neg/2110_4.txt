So I was energized during my weekend Snakes on a Plane, after the movie we crave more. Why not snakes in a train? How bad it could be, its snakes probably kill people on trains. The snakes were supposed to be rattles. First, my friends and I thought the snakes were harmless garden snakes and pet snakes with the same squeaky sound. In fact, we sit completely ready to turn it off (we are too lazy to walk and drive). The next thing we knew is that we do not know what the hell was going on, but in the end something amazingly funny happens. It's one of those endings that you'll rewind a couple of times just to squeeze the laughter, because you suffered for so long. <br /> <br /> Last 10 minutes to "8", rest of the movie to 2.
