I just saw this "movie" and it really made me want to write my first comment on IMDb.com, even though I have been a user for more than 9 years. The reason I saw this is because I like splash movies and sometimes I like to test my limits and see what really surprises me. First of all, the gore in this movie did not surprise me, not even the idea that someone would come up with this and turn it into a movie; What really surprised me is that there seems to be a market for this type of garbage. . Do not get me wrong, I'm totally against censorship, but this movie seems to me that it was made for a kind of public fetish that seems to have this kind of shit. I did not give you that. the same kind of disgust and guilt that he felt after seeing movies like "underground august". That movie is terrible to watch, but at least you have the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how repugnant violence is. in the case of "niku daruma", it seems that it was done strictly to awaken people. I prefer the movies that surprise, because they are well made and well thought out, like the movies of Gaspar Noe, Takashi Miike, Funny Games or Man Bites Dog, those movies will stay with you for a while. I will have forgotten this movie for tomorrow, and the only thing that will stay with me is the idea that somewhere out there, there are people who get excited to see this. If you read this, check yourself at the next hospital or shoot yourself. Of course, this does not apply to hounds, who love splashing. You're great! peace
