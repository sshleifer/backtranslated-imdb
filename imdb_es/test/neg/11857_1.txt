Roger Corman has enjoyed his cinematic infamy in his illustrious low-budget career spanning more than 300 films. While few (if any) would call it great, the dark connections of his films with the clandestine culture (through references, tributes or influences) have assured him a deformed legacy. Throughout his career, he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films ("Piranha," "Humanoids from the Deep," "The Black Scorpion," etc.), without improving them in the slightest. "Raptor", "written" and "directed" by "Jay Andrews" (Jim Wynorski, the man behind one of my favorite guilty movie pleasures, "Chopping Mall") takes that practice to a new low point with respect to the mid of the 90 of Corman The trilogy of "Carnosaur". <br /> <br /> Wynorski's credits are in quotes because "Raptor" is not a tribute to "Carnosaur" movies, and not even a remake. "Raptor" IS the "Carnosaurus" movies, or at least the dinosaur-induced death scenes from the movie, paired at random with trace elements from the original plot and some newly filmed scenes (many of which consist of images of " Dino's Eye View "in a lame attempt to make inserted scenes seem less obvious). The "new" material was written around the archival material, rather than vice versa, and there is nothing special about it, with huge gaps in logic (for example, the military sends two separate teams, so material from parts 2 and 3, where the soldiers had different uniforms, could be included), which is amazing if you consider how little logic plays in any of the "Carnosaur" movies. The lack of feeling of the actors in their characters (although to be fair, any dimension of the character only appears in the script once, maybe twice) recalls the terribly wooden performance in the films of the 1950s, and He certainly does not do anything. Among the snatched attack scenes that are worth seeing. Even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical construction between the new actor and the actor in the original scene. When the only scene that evokes a response in a movie is the oldest trick in the horror book, the "animal loaded with springs," something is very wrong. <br /> <br /> As it stands, this is a despicable practice two b-grade figures (who should not worry about ruining their reputation, because they do not have one) who are stealing their own material, for the most dirty tricks cheap and faster, simply because they can (why else would someone feel possessed by them?) tear off a series meant to be a scam of the series "Jurassic Park"?). I can not say much more than this film that contains my highest recommendations AGAINST visualization; The only good thing about this (besides looking at the navel of Melissa Braselle) is that now I do not have to see any of the films of "Carnosaurios".
