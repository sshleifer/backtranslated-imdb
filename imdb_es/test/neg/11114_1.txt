I saw this movie knowing it would be horrible, but damn if it did not open revolutionary new paths in the field of making fecal matter acceptable as entertainment. The plot is Deep Rising with raw effects and HORRID performance. The lines in this ... well ... there's no way to leave this movie because I think the words have not yet been created in the English language. The sad thing is that the filmmakers thought they were really doing something good. He will not believe in his eyes when he sees how many films were ripped off without even trying to hide it. There are scenes / plot devices directly taken from Deep Rising, Alien, Jurassic Park, Predator, Jeepers Creepers, and the list could go on forever. However, unlike any of these movies, it only falls short in celluloid feces. The most incredulous aspect of this film, aside from the way it tries to be competent but fails, is that Gimli he-freakin'-self is in it. How the hell can they afford John Rhys-Davies but not decent effects, writing, actors or sets? Really horrible ... and not the kind of evil that is good.
