The documentaries about the fans are always setbacks, and they are never worth seeing, but I found this fact by some of the fans themselves, more than what is usually not very illustrative. As a veteran of Tolkien's original fashion, forty years ago, he expected something more than the obvious, which is not always true. If there is someone who lives and who does not know the nature of a fandom, any fandom, for having been or known as a fanatic, will not discover it here. Between irrelevancies, commonplaces (to which the actors in the films are particularly prone), and acting (by fans who make the most, if not the best, their only chance at fame), I was able to extract a little of the special appeal of LOTR, the special emotional responses it evokes, and the range of special creative ways these answers can take. In addition, the film is quite lazy: it shows some facts that could have been transmitted with little effort, for example. what was the exact legal vacuum (the wording of a copyright notice) that allowed the unauthorized publication of books in the US UU They were not the work of Jack Gaughan, a very skilled illustrator of the time, and some fans, including me, found them more apt and more attractive than the covers of the rival set.
