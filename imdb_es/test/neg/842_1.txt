When reading the novel for the first time, I do not care, for the purpose of filming, how different it is written, as long as it adheres to the plot, or at least includes it. For reasons known only to Hollywood, important parts of the story are completely ignored and a different story line is added. The reason why this novel passed the test of time is undoubtedly due to the intertwining of the characters and the plot, as a whole. Interfering with this structure is to destroy the intricate balance of the story line and, therefore, the intention of the narrator. Although it is a matter of opinion, the casting of this film leaves much to be desired. The characters, who are described as very fat, must, at least, be portrayed in a corpulent manner, to allow the character to have credibility. The days of slavery can not have ended, or surely, the actors of this caliber would have rebelled against such a parody of history. Marian Halcolme's face is described as masculine in appearance, ... The very feminine appearance of Tara Fitzgerald does not seem true. Again, Laura Fairly is described as "fair", if not "ethereal", so, with dark hair, does not conform to the impression that emerges from the novel. .... badly done, Hollywood! <br /> <br /> J. Hunter
