Without John Rhys-Davies, I must admit that this would never register on my movie meter. But in spite of that unique fact, this is not a great thriller, considering the low budget, the low quality effects, the rigid acting and the aspects of the science fiction channel. The effects on the blood are very convincing, and the Chupacabra really seems realistic ... regardless of what you create, a Chupacabra looks like this. This is an attractive Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> Aside from the positive aspects, this is something like as Kolchak: The Night Stalker (Darren McGavin, remember?) meets the Love Boat, but despite the last cheese of this work, It still has something like a plot, and actually tries to earn you respect while it makes you laugh and roll your eyes. <br /> <br /> Despite how conflictive this job is, I could still find some fun here. Maybe you will too. <br /> <br /> Rate a 5.2 / 10 on the TV Scale Made 4. <br /> <br /> Rate a 4.1 / 10 on the Movie Scale of ... <br /> <br /> the demon:.
