And one of them are bad movies. The title, as it turns out, refers to a killer of the human male variety, not the fish. This is not the "Piranha" led by Dante from 78 (who had the fish) and is also known as "Piranha, Piranha". A trio of photographers, 2 men and one woman, join a local trapper / hunter named Caribe somewhere in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they are not familiar with the film's summary of William Smith, who plays Caribe; Otherwise, they would have known immediately that he is the villain of the piece. Smith may also have refused to film the ending or the cut before filming ends (see the end of this comment). <br /> <br /> As mentioned elsewhere, this photo has a lot of filler: extensive shots of the local wildlife (birds) - and the centerpiece, a motorcycle race, that lasts too long. The reason this second star gives it to me is, of course, William Smith, who really can not save this mud, but once again proves why he was the 'go to' guy 30-35 years ago if you needed a very bad villain; At his best, Smith could be really scary. He is the type who enjoys killing, possibly in a sadistic way, and the evil smile that he usually gives when a state of mind hits him gives you that sense. Physically, it is very imposing, and you know that the other 3 characters are condemned in the first half hour. This is what Smith contributed to most of his papers; It seems desperate for the other characters against this monster resembling a man. Unfortunately, the film continues to muddy things to the end, as if a minute of images had been lost, a confused and incomplete climax.
