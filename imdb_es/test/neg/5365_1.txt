I was very excited when Paranormal State first arrived at A & E. I thought I could bring some more interesting ghostly evidence. The production value looked good and I really love the logo. Then, after a few episodes, I began to feel that this program might not look for evidence, but I had a strong religious agenda. <br /> <br /> It seems that every case they investigate has some evil and powerful demon that can not even make a movement of the teacup in the chamber, however, they are all terrified. Then comes a power ritual of Christ that saves everyone. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is very little focus on other team members. The whole show focuses on Ryan and he feels like one of those people who gives him brochures about his church on the street. <br /> <br /> Has the paranormal phenomenon and demons become the new missionaries of Christianity, scaring people to convert? Actually, this should be in a Christian network. I was very disappointed.
