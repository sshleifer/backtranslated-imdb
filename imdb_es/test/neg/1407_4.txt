The slightly belligerent brother of a suicide discovers that he and his mother grieve in the same way (acting), but that dad is grumpy and blames himself. Screenwriter and director Dan Harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn apart, characters with question marks hanging over them, and then presents all the story points in the most obvious terms: Suicide! Mysteries! Gay shame! Family disease! Ultimately, in order to wrap things up with an orderly bow, Harris wants to make sure we do not miss a trick; At the beginning, it offers us reflective material to reflect on, but then it explains everything in an elementary and sentimental way. The bewildered performance of Sigourney Weaver as matriarch of the family disregards and is a joy, that is, until Harris gives him a makeover (complete with a new sensitive hairstyle). It is the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head. ** since ****
