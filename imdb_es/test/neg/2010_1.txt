My original comment on this particular title was deleted by an IMDb user or by the staff, just because I disliked this movie to the point that I had to sincerely write what I felt after seeing this poor excuse for a movie. Where is my freedom of speech? <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie was made by students, because they felt so lazy and amateur. Of course they even have to start from somewhere? The script was an incoherent mess and so was the acting. With low budget and class B actors, what can you expect? There is some CGI in places, so poor, it seems that it is done with an old PC. Some may say, this is a kind of clone "Alien", only this time it is Dracula (with a vintage suit) who is sucking the other dry, one by one. The sets are unconvincing, cheap and small (boiler rooms), although the story takes place in a large spaceship. <br /> <br /> It would be fun to know what the stars thought (Erika Eleniak, Casper Van Dien, Coolio and Udo Kier) about the film after its release ... Coolio must be the worst rapper who has become an actor . ! <br /> <br /> It was a total waste of my time and money, I do not know why I even bothered to rent this movie. Honestly, I hate this movie. With Uwe Boll's House of The Dead, Dracula 3000 shares the questionable honor of being the worst movie in history. (Well, I've seen even worse than these two) <br /> <br /> Avoid it! Any other movie will make it better.
