This movie is perfect for any aspiring screenwriter, actor or director. When you watch this movie, you will see all the things that are wrong in the film industry as it is today. There are so many clichés that it hurt to sit in this movie. None of that is original and every spoken line has been ripped from those cliché movies that we all saw in the 90s. Although it has some cheap laughs, it is generally badly wrong. It was so immensely boring and the movie was so predictable and pathetic that I really noticed the amount of makeup stuck on Tara Reid's face to hide those huge bags and wrinkles from her endless party. Seriously, I was using so much base that I could literally scrape and refill an entire bottle. <br /> <br /> What surprised me was that many of the talented and popular actors would sign this piece. And I do not know how I sat through that horrible shout that Ashton Kutcher does, do you know when he's angry or something and shouts his words in this annoying way? The horrible "conversation" of Ashton, the face of Tara with ten shades darker than his neck, a drugged owl, a script that looked like the work of a three-year-old girl ... <br /> <br /> Really In my whole life there has not been a movie I've seen and that I have not enjoyed in any way, no matter how bad it was. This deserves a prize for being the first. BAD WRONG BAD ... I do not think there's a single word in the English dictionary that can describe this shoddy movie. Today I tried to see him again, but I had to turn it off like ten minutes because I was about to cry because of the many clichés. <br /> <br /> I do not even bother to rent this in your blockbuster, it's not worth a dime, in fact, I'm willing to pay anyone who is considering watching this movie so they can do something decent with their lives .
