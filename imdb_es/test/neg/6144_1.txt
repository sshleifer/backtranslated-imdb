What exactly is the point of pretending to "cheat" people with things like ski passes and pizza? I can not see a point. It was not intelligent or original and I think it is extremely useless. <br /> <br /> Skyler Stone does not seem to be very realistic or even a good guy. He has very little charisma and almost anyone could do what he does in this show. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this shit is the fact that many of the phone calls are re-rendered, so not only are they apparently cheating the poor at the other end of the phone, but also We're also fooling the audience who does not have enough time to read the "discarded" that flashes on the screen for about half a second at the beginning of the program! <br /> <br /> Not only that, but also He also affirms that this is how he lives all his life. What a lie Nobody could live their lives in this way and the fact that he says that this is not just another scam to watch his show, but also one of the most fabricated and blatant pieces of bull smash I've heard. This guy is an @ $$! <br /> <br /> What makes them think that they take the trouble to, for example, write and record a song, make someone suffer a HUGE image of you and two classmates, get dance lessons and, in fact, , traveling to a ski resort is it worthwhile just to get free ski passes and some free food? What is the point of this? It's a lot of trouble to go just for a few ski passes and a little snow. <br /> <br /> As far as "comedy" is concerned, this is the substance of the matter.
