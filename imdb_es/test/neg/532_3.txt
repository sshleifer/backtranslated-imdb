This movie is a cyborg in itself: half meaningless / half Original movie of all life. <br /> <br /> Like a cyborg, this movie has only one goal: to make you want you to have passed the duration of the movie. In a dark room, giving you a punch in the testicles. <br /> <br /> Unlike many people, I did not rent this movie because of Angelina Jolie (I will explain why I rented it shortly). I'm not a big fan of Ms. Jolie, though I'll say her performance was stellar! Her blank look and her robotic performance really made me believe she was an Android prostitute. If someone has a video of her in "Inside the Actor's Studio" that explains how she prepared for this role, send it to me in my own way. I'll make sure to use it when I try James Lipton for Crimes Against Integrity. <br /> <br /> So, what led me to rent this movie? One might think it was the hope of seeing Angelina Jolie's nipples, but it was not like that. No, the reason behind this rental was based solely on one of the images on the cover of the DVD; The one with Jack Palance's face! THE HALF OF HIS FACE WAS ROBOTIC! When I saw him, I imagined legions of "Palances" marching slowly through a fertile wasteland, destroying humans who were foolish enough to resist. In my opinion, all the members of this secular army of fathers had a bright red eye; a bright red eye that looked at humans and only saw "flesh." They must be the Architects of oblivion ... a cold and robust Apocalypse ... a Nightmare from which Humanity would never awaken. It is a beautiful image that I will appreciate until the end of my years. <br /> <br /> Like most things in my life, the real movie did not live up to my expectations. No, there was only 'one' Jack Palance, and the only visible cyber improvements he had were located on his legs. Unfortunately, those improvements really did not "improve" anything. That is, unless you count WALKING LIKE A POLICE VICTIM as a superpower. At least, there was a scene in which Jack, smiling like an Alzheimer's patient with a happy trigger, had to shoot some people to hell. I was waiting for him to scream: "I'm really tired of paying too much for prescription drugs!" Unfortunately, the outbursts of geriatric rage were few. <br /> <br /> What the film had in abundance was a poorly developed love story about a man (Elias Koteas, also known as De Niro of the poor man) and a cyborg (Angelina Jolie, alias Demon John's spawn Voigt). Oh, man, can love between a Romeo of flesh and a Juliet of silicon ever last? You can if you follow the simple advice of Jack Palance: "You have to KNOW THE TIME of the other". <br /> <br /> Yes, I'm not sure what that means. However, I'm sure I do not want Jack Palance to explain it to me. Of course I do not want to show it to me! As an experiment, I suggest you ask your partner if he / she "believes that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to KNOW THE TIME of others."
