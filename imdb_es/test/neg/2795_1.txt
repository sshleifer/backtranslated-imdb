MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. This movie was the worst movie of all. I could not even see everything, it was so bad. This movie is really worse than the scarecrow killer, which says a lot. This was worse than the toons of terror, that at least the toons of terror were sometimes funny. Even the gore in the movie was not good. The shootings were false and the performance was worse. Please, do yourself a favor and skip this one. If you see it in the rental store, run to the other side. There is nothing good in this movie at all. If you want to see a good scarecrow movie, look at the Night of the scarecrow or the pumpkin head. If you want to see a new corny movie OK, look Scarecrow. I rate this movie with 0.2 out of 10. That's how horrible this movie really is. The worst movie of all.
