The character of Michael Caine has problems. He is a simple, myopic, insecure man of about 40 years. He is married, but his wife no longer seems to love him. He has a bad relationship with his only daughter. But his most immediate problem is that an incredibly beautiful young woman, played by Michelle Johnson, pursues him with too much desire, kisses him, gropes for him and tries to initiate sex at every opportunity. What does the poor have to do? <br /> <br /> This movie should be taken out of the Comedy section and placed under Science Fiction. Only an intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of Michelle Johnson's character. Let's see, 3 billion men in the world, she can have practically her choice, she goes with a clumsy and aged loser. This goes beyond a middle-aged male fantasy and becomes something so illusory. Just expect everyone involved to voluntarily submit to therapy. <br /> <br /> There's nothing fun here. There are some quick attempts at ingenuity on the part of Caine, who often seems to play Hawkeye Pierce more than a new character. Joseph Bologna is like nails on a blackboard. Michelle Johnson is not an actress, she has a crying scene that would not pass by in a high school play, but she is beautiful and she takes off her clothes. So buy the DVD, skip to scenes 4 and 9, and forget about the rest.
