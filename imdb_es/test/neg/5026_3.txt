Let me tell you this from the beginning. I DO NOT hate this show. In fact, I quite like some aspects of it. In fact, when I started seeing it, I was hooked quickly. I was starting to get away from the whole stereotype of "the anime is for kids", and the mature elements of the program intrigued me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after watching the whole series and some of the films, I can say that my general disposition has changed, and it falls into almost all the pitfalls that plague the "bad" anime. Seven or eight friends and I started watching this series on television. In the end, only one friend and I kept looking and neither of us liked it. <br /> <br /> Let me explain the plot. You can skip this paragraph if you do not want to know. Kagome is an average high school student who one day falls into a magical well near her family sanctuary. When Kagome comes back out of the well, she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of Japan. He meets many other characters and forms a group of five or more comrades who embark on a revenge / justice / groping trip in the case of a character =). In general, they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel fragment that increases the power of the demons that use it. <br /> <br /> While there are many, MANY stories and story arcs, there are not enough. Material to occupy 167 episodes. The only arc in history that is interesting enough to see is still a bit boring (the band of seven). After half the mark in the series or maybe even before, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put dozens and dozens of filler episodes. <br /> <br /> These episodes have little or no impact on the story, and rarely even on the characters. In some cases, some characters who played an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at once. Many episodes follow the same cookie cut patterns as the previous stories. Inuyasha fires a wind scar at the enemy. Wind cars deflects. The characters gasp in horror. The enemy turns out to have a barrier. The characters spent three episodes trying to kill the enemy before Kagome finally shot a sacred arrow at him and he turned to dust. <br /> <br /> Also ** MAIN SPOILER: THE CONCLUSION WILL BE REVEALED ** the lack of any conclusion makes it look like you have lost 83 hours. <br /> <br /> ** GREATER SPOILER OVER ** <br /> <br /> The animation itself is above average, and in some cases it is excellent. Even so, the reused animation cells plague most of the action scenes, and it is very difficult to ignore them when it is clear that the same rock has flown past a character five or six times in a row. <br /> <br /> On the brighter side, however, all the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating. In addition, the designs of the characters (appearances) were brilliant and, at times, among the best I've seen, particularly with the band of seven. There is definitely no shortage of cosplay opportunities here. Even so, I found myself waiting for a character to die just so there would be some kind of movement in the plot. And some of the humor in the show between characters is used again and again. There is a particular joke (sit boy) within the first five episodes, and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes. <br /> <br /> Although there are some positive aspects of the program. and it is easy to see why he has many followers, the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fanatics who drool over Sesshomiru and InuYasha. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's definitely worth checking out, but it's not worth seeing. The whole series. The first 30 episodes are very intelligent, original and enjoyable for everyone. But after that, it just becomes boring and tedious. Watching a television show should never feel like a chore, but somehow this series accomplishes that. Do not expect much from "Inuyasha", because you will only be disappointed.
