From an artistic point of view, the film does not entertain or provide any moral resolution. The plot is difficult to follow, if there is one. The acting is difficult to digest. The dialogue is clich√© and clearly written by someone who does not know English. Only the cinematography was worth seeing in this movie, although you can still see flaws in the image. <br /> <br /> As an Asian-American woman, the movie angered me because it showed how narrow people can be. Politically speaking, putting Asian women in such shameful roles should be outlawed. Perpetuating the stereotypes of Asian prostitutes is not only bad for the self-esteem of Asian women, but also for the country in general. I'm sorry for the main actress who played Maya and the exploitation she had to face in playing that role. <br /> <br /> As Americans, avoid this movie. Art should be used to develop our tolerance and mutual respect, not to stop it.
