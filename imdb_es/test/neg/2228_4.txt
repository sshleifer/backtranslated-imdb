All those who criticize The Sopranos for their stereotyped portraits of Italians have not seen anything until they've seen this cornball gangster movie that focuses on such an irritating family, you almost want to be erased. <Br /> <br /> The parents in this clan are not so bad, but their two small children, one of them brats, one in an unbearable way, they are unbearable, while their eldest son, who is worthless, and Pollyanna's daughter Skillfully compete for the contempt of the audience. But their grandfather is, well, grandfather. As interpreted by Chic Sale (in full mode "Dag-nabbit!") He serves as the moral compass of the movies, throwing a lot of diatribes about "dang, dirty foreigners" just in case. If these are the good ones, it is not surprising that the actors of that era who played the bad guys became the big stars. <br /> <br /> It's not that stellar performances are found among the criminal actors, but at least they were acquitted better than the Leeds family. Incompetent police officers are not even given enough screen time to lower things further. Only Walter Huston, as district attorney, raises the plague-ridden material in his futile attempts to instill some sense in these dollars. <br /> <br /> The film deserves credit for being an early entry into what it would prove to be a very popular formula for silencing witnesses, and it does not flout with its description of the underworld lifestyle, but there is better examples, and less xenophobic, in the genre.
