A horribly bad movie supposedly about a croupier who wants to be a writer and the incidents that make up the life of the casino. It moves at a snail's pace. Bored, bored, bored! Virtually everything about this film is amateurish and unconvincing, with one notable exception: the performance of Clive Owen, which is like a Rolls Royce that purrs through a poor neighborhood. The tips for the casino sequences were supposedly provided by a professional, but judging by the way they are handled, they were completely ignored by the director. While the casino staff may be a different breed from the rest of the world, they are not nearly as resourceful as the characters featured in this script. The odds and ends are included in the script in an attempt to provide a convincing background, but it seems that they have been written down in a list on a napkin. For anyone who makes a living in the casino business (as this writer has done for the last forty-five years), this is a representation of his world ravaged by poverty that even in the farthest and darkest reaches of England has NEVER been like this! A frightful and insulting mess of a movie that treads and treads and treads an idiotic and unconvincing ending. American critics loved it.
