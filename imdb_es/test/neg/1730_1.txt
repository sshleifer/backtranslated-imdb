Horrific! I'm a teenager and I do not care about teen movies, but this is horrible! Aaron Carter plays this pop star named JD McQueen and to improve his grades or something, he works together with the 'nerd', Jane whatever it is called. But "bad girls" are too predictable and the clothes that most girls wear in the movie are unrealistic. How would one of those girls manage without using a bra, tube tops and shirts that expose the belly? IN HIGH SCHOOL? At my school, they would send us home for something like that. <br /> <br /> And in a part of the movie where JD sends a message to Jane, he says: 'Do you sleep well? He must think I'm an idiot! I did not know that texting was so stressful! How is it stressful to send text messages? And how obsessed Jane is with JD and how he "falls in love" with her is very stupid. The dialogue is cheesy and stupid, the acting is terrible. the music is something pleasant and the plot is little or nothing. <br /> <br /> For the tweeny-boppers who still love Aaron Carter, you'll enjoy it. If you are a casual observer like me, this is NOT the movie for you
