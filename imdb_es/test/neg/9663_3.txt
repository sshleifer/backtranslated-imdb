"one of the best independent exploitation films of the year (1999)", shocking ", and" essential ". <br /> <br /> Well, I wasted my money, but not everything was bad in this movie. with the gore, as well as with some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time.Even there is a story (a bit) and that's it. <br /> <br /> But for one In the exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content, but not exploitation, we have gay sex, sorta, we have 3 interracial babies, maybe, we have a psychotic Vietnamese prostitute: good sex, oral sex (well, that made me shudder) and some feminine version of Gene Simmons (I do not understand that part.) We have Capone, honest and kind, ranked among the best actors in this movie, that's not a compliment, and finally, we have a government conspiracy launched in - I do not know - try to connect the killing for revenge / random / thematic of the c Did Jimmy make the Vietnamese psychopath look healthy? If nothing else, this movie proves that the Italians and the Americans do not have a lock on this type of movie. Latinos can make garbage as well as the rest of them. Kudos addresses any person involved in this achievement who surpassed him and made a career for himself.
