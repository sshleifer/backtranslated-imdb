I have never seen the television series or the previous movies. Probably that's the reason why I did not enjoy it very much. Bored and just not funny, it sums it up nicely. <br /> <br /> Considering the budget that the film seemed to have, it is shameful that they could not do an acceptable job. <br /> <br /> We went to the cinema without exception and hope to see a funny movie that is not too demanding for the mind. My friend fell asleep in the middle of the movie and spent the next 2 hours hoping he would finally recover. A hope, that died with the final credits.
