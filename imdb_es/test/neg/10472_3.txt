In Sweet Water, the ambitious businessman Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is building a resort in the middle of the desert under the protest of the Katonah. When three workers find some Indian relics and bones in a ditch on the site, they accidentally release the giant skeleton like a creature known as a Bone Devourer and their bones are devoured by the monster. The mestizo sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) a.k.a. Running Wolf is in charge of the investigation of the disappearance of the workers, being pressured by Krantz to arrest the demonstrators. But the Bone Eater attacks and kills other locals, while Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) searches for an ancient Tomahawk capable of destroying the evil creature. <br /> <br /> "Bone Eater" is a stupid and silly movie, with only one of the most ridiculous script I've ever seen. The characters and the situation are not well developed and things happen without further consequences. The conclusion is probably the worst part of this movie, with the typical white American Bruce Boxleitner dressed like an Indian (in history, his grandfather was an Indian), cutting his wrist (why? And where is the blood later? ?) and awkwardly throwing the ax into the chest of the Bone Devourer, destroying the monster and my last hope for any improvement in the story. My last question: if the bones eater eats bones, what happens to the flesh and clothes of their victims? My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Devorador de Ossos" ("The Bone Eater")
