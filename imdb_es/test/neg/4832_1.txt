This is a cellular scam. <br /> <br /> Bad cast ... <br /> <br /> Bad direction ... <br /> <br /> Bad music ... <br /> <br /> And the list continue ... <br /> <br /> Well, there was no direction since the story, the scenes and the stage were removed from the movie. <br /> <br /> Even the fight sequence is copied. One with the mace was from Kill Bill and another with fire hose, either from a movie by Jet Li or Jackie Chan (I can not remember the name of this film) ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real ... <br /> <br /> You can not expect anything original from any of the Bhatts anymore!
