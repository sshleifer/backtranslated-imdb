Do not get me wrong: I like art movies, low budget movies, character studios and foreign films. Unfortunately, I could not enjoy this: glacial rhythm, complete lack of plot and characters that you can not hate enough to hate, but you can not tolerate enough to like. <br /> <br /> To me, Distant was like watching the images of the reality show cutting room: all the scenes that were considered too uninteresting and that would not normally be the final cut, were the only scenes included A camera in my apartment with two of my friends wandering around for hours does not make an interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the viewer makes the observer feel that way: long periods without dialogue (almost 10 minutes before the first word that is said of the credits can be made to work (it comes to me) the mind in 2001), but for me, it is necessary that something else happens that attracts me. <br /> <br /> If you are the type of Observer that can sit through a movie and be satisfied with the analysis of the film It might work for you, however, if you are someone who chooses to watch movies to relax, expand your mind or entertain you, you should probably look elsewhere.
