Ladies and gentlemen, let us introduce you. The Toltecs! This ancient Latin American tribe, even before the Aztecs, supposedly had the wizards more malevolent and bloodthirsty, yet their asses are revived by a pair of university floozies and a one hundred and seven year old lawyer with a whip! But before you see this, however, you have to fight for more than 40 minutes of sheer boredom, childish pranks and shoddy sequences that do not contain any real sleaze. In case I have not made it completely clear yet: "The Dark Power" is an indescribably cheesy and inept piece of horror shit from the 80s that can still be funny due to its stupidity factor, something charming and charming. The intentions of writer / director Phil Smoot were obviously admirable, but he? As well as the rest of the cast and crew? He lacked the talent and financial means to deliver something even half decent. Smoot carefully observed "The Evil Dead" and other similar demon-themed movies, and somehow he must have thought that he could do it too. The film begins with an old Indian who dies in his isolated house in the countryside; barely speaking his last word above a whisper? Toltecs His grandson quickly rents the house to a group of college girls, including a typical aerobics of the 80s, a cute black girl and a racist of a redneck. You will soon discover why exactly the ancient Indian lived like a hermit, since he was actually the guardian of an ancient Toltec cemetery. The Toltec sorcerers were buried alive, only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living. And, honestly, is there a meat that tastes better than bimbos? As suggested earlier, the first half of "The Dark Power" is terribly lame and induces sleep. The clich√©d jokes, the delayed dialogues and the ridiculously long images of Lash LaRue spinning around her whip seem to last forever. Then, the film loses its last bit of credibility when the Toltec sorcerers emerge from the earth. Instead of menacing, they look like hard rock stars stoned with imbecile masks and drunken gestures. It is worth mentioning exactly ONE bloody moment, when a boy's lips spread over his entire skull, but in general, even the butchery aspect of this film is disappointing. The only remotely worthwhile moments are completely meaningless, like when a 9-year-old boy (named Cletus!) Goes hand in hand with his uncle's truck or when the naked chick drinks a beer in the bathtub after exercise. Seriously, unless you get excited to see a Western veteran of the 1940s spinning around his whip to nothing, I would advise you to skip this movie.
