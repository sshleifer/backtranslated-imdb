First of all, let me say that I am not denying in any way the importance of the subject, quite the contrary. I am Polish and have been aware of the Katyn massacre for quite some time (in fact, two of my family members died there), so I looked forward to this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem lies in the script, which covers too many subplots and characters, none of which is correctly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; Their stories are intertwined, but they lack a general meaning. In my opinion, the cast does not really have the opportunity to show their skill. The exception is Andrzej Chyra, who plays Jerzy, the only interesting character. I wish the story was more focused on him. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film lacks emotion. Before seeing it, I thought that it would move me, even if only for sentimental reasons, but in fact I observed it with a strange sense of detachment, except in the scene of the final execution. It is well done and its location is interesting and provides a climatic end, although the idea that the Lord's prayer is recited in unison by the executed officers seems a bit implausible. <br /> <br /> To conclude, I suppose The film may have some educational value for those who are not familiar with the historical events portrayed, but in my opinion, it fails as a film work.
