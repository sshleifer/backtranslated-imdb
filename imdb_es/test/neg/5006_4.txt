It is very sad to see someone of the caliber of George C Scott in a low budget thriller, which would have been better if the original novel was written by Graham Greene and directed by someone with more experience in the genre. DO NOT MENTION A BETTER CINEMATÃ“GRAFO. There are so many missed opportunities with the landscape and the carnival simply overlooked, instead of capturing it to place the film in a solid way in the exotic environment of the novel. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere in the comments of the viewer on this site, a very astute observer complained about the variety of diabolically bad accents in this movie. Ever since I saw George C Scott as Rochester in Jane Eyre, I have prayed that I will NEVER accept a role that required me to assume a British accent. Only once in a while, he could pass for a British or a South African Swede that sounds obviously played by an American actor. I can handle the extraordinarily laborious accents of Meryl Streep (both British and Australian); at least, he understands it well, although with all the words, he demands that we marvel at his ability. Well, I'm sorry that Mr. Scott is not Meryl Streep, and he just destroys the illusion, how to make Michele Yeoh speak the unbearable Mandarin with a strong Singaporean accent in Crouching Tiger, etc. <br /> <br /> Peterson does not act differently from what we see in CSI. Except that he is still very handsome and more or less thin in this movie. He is the Harrison Ford of television. The same old expressions for each emotion, each situation. No, on second thought, Ford has two: perplexed / aching and happy. I've never seen a smile on Mr. CSI!
