Although I sat down and watched the whole thing, I must say it was not good. It was everywhere, lacking a lot of information about how things developed and even in some parts also inaccurate. If you do not know anything about Michael, you must not understand anything. You have to trust your current knowledge of man so that some parts make sense. Acting was a bit dramatic, Flex Alexander did not look anything like Michael, which was a disappointment for me and towards the end. Literally, it looked gray. He said that portraying Michael as naive, but very positive, kind and loving, was fine, although they still cheated him from time to time.
