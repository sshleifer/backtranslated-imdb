The film career of Jean Claude Van Damme seems to have gone to hell in a wheelbarrow, so it's ironic to see him play a character who faces the same fate literally at the beginning of the film! It is also interesting to see how very, very similar are the plots of his films, regardless of who is the producer, the director or the screenwriter. Usually, Van Damme plays a character who lives in France, then, due to a series of circumstances, is in another part of the world where he has a brother who dies and depends on Van Damme get revenge for a character that ends to know. Watch AWOL or LEGOINAIRRE or many other movies featuring the headline "Starring Jean Claude Van Damme" and all feature almost the same kind of story structure. Of course, this does not mean that they are identical, just very similar and if you have seen a Van Damme movie, you have basically seen them all. It is the same with MAXIMUM RISK.
