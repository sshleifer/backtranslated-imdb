It hurts me to say this about an Australian movie, but Mr. Accident is among the worst of the worst movies I've ever seen. What is even more tragic is that it does not fit into the category "it's so bad that it's good". What bothers me the most about this movie is the rather large amount of money that has been wasted on a meaningless, ungraceful, underdeveloped, inept script. Silly performances (what are Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore, also known as Elle McFeast?) Doing, in this garbage, inadequate management, no plot and a general sense of pettiness away from the interesting production design and leave you with a really horrible taste in mouth . Comedy! Say ah! Do yourself a favor and stay away!
