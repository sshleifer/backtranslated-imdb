A paranoid scientist creates a werewolf by transferring wolf blood to a gentle, quiet, but very large gardener, to test a hypothesis. So the gardener begins nocturnal riots and the scientist tries to use it to claim his credentials, but is rejected by his previous colleagues for altering nature. Island of Dr Moreau, Frankenstein and several wolfman films mixed in a morally terrible and ridiculous play. <br /> <br /> Although the theme is pedantic and unoriginal at best, this film is not badly made, and interesting to see as a representative of the horror movie of his time. Like most crazy scientist films, this is a weak warning against nonsense with mother nature. He does not have the power or the intellectual challenges of Frankenstein, but he does not extend his scope either way. The acting is passable, like the cinematography, and the film advances in an entertaining clip. Part of the dialogue is completely ridiculous, but hey ... it's just a movie, and a B minus one in that. There are also some pretty pictures of a wolf, and a bit of mixed humor to avoid that the film seems to take itself too seriously, it is always an advantage for this genre.
