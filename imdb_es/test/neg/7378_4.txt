First, I'm in the USA UU <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, I thought it was an obvious, and abhorrent scam, from "The Office" (UK). Therefore, I would have awarded him zero stars, but here it came out long before the Ricky Gervais series. <br /> <br /> Even so, it is difficult to see this or any other program with a similar dynamic (including the "American Office") without comparison. It's just not even close to being the same. <br /> <br /> I will give you some credit for being original and ahead of your time. I will also say that, and the "Office" and "Larry Sanders" of the United States, are real satires. The "Office" of the United Kingdom is something bigger and more transcendent, as if it were populated with real people in events that seemed to really happened. However, unlike this or the "mockumentaries" shrieks of Christopher Guest, it's not really a satire, while "The Newsroom" definitely is. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, "The Newsroom" is not yet very funny. He is distant and self-aware, but with a cast and crew that is not smart or talented enough to support the goods. It is a heavy comedy carried on weak shoulders. Praiseworthy, but ultimately, it is not recommended. <br /> <br /> --- And what about the lack of an anamorphic DVD ?! I know it was filmed on anamorphic widescreen, because I watched the pilot episode on one of our HD channels. CBC, get going with the program. ; )
