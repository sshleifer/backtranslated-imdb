Tycus is one of the worst films directed to video movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that this product does not appear in the cinema. Visual effects (the beginning is terrible) Bad actors (I do not understand why the great Dennis Hopper appears in this movie) and the bad screen No sense. My alternative: Armaggedon or Twister. JUDGMENT FOR TYCUS: Do not watch this movie.
