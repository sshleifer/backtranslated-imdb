What about American movies these days? Hollyweird continues to make films in which men act as women and women act as men. The idiot director and male writer of this movie needs to have their heads examined. The main problems with this film are its extreme and extreme feminist representations of the sexes. <br /> <br /> In the bar scenes, Eva Méndez and her friend are drinking from the beer bottles as you can find sailors in an oil. Tanker doing that in a bar in Iceland. Méndez continually kisses all the girls he sees after that. She also dresses provocatively in each scene, but curses like a boy. He gets very excited when he fights with Will Smith for a while, as he tries to "defend" all the women from the bad guys everywhere. <br /> <br /> Men are not better in this movie. What we see is a group of idiots who try to do everything possible to win an appointment. The men in this movie are worried about getting sexual favors or can not speak clearly when they are face to face with a woman. Men in real life do not behave this way. <br /> <br /> What we see in this film is a product of the culture that went wrong. Everything is flip-flopped. Boys act like girls, girls act like boys. All this is done by maintaining the extreme predilections of the sexes in much of history. Most of the time men are shown as soft and stupid, but they are only interested in sex, while women are shown as macho and dominant, but only as an appearance because of their emotional insecurities. <br /> <br /> This movie would be good if it was not presented with hate to the audience. The content is not the culprit. It's the way the content is presented.
