Despite having an absolutely horrible script (more on that later), this film is still vaguely visible only because it is starring two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Apart from one or two REAL smells, I would probably see almost anything with them in the movie, since I'm a huge fan of Hollywood's golden age of the 30s and 40s. However, no matter how much I like your movies, I just can not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at a ski resort. The two have not yet been found, but the movie starts loud and unpleasantly with a scene in which Fonda screams horribly while skiing. It was done in such an unpleasant way and it made my teeth grind but I excelled it, especially when Fonda fell on a snowbank and this stopped the yodeling. In hindsight, maybe I should have turned it off then! Fonda is eliminated in the fall and Barbara seeks help. Back at the ski lodge, she seems fine, but fortunately she is also a doctor and takes an X-ray and takes care of him until he regains his health. He, in turn, falls in love with her and proposes something to her. Although they barely know each other, they get married and until now the movie seems like a sweet but very light romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Once at home, however, not everything is rosy when he returns to work as a family doctor and begins to show signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man because of his jealousy . The film shows everything to laugh, but frankly, Fonda's behaviors were really creepy: they spied on her and her male patients, attacked or threatened ANY man she treats, cheating on a patient who already has an injury to her. back and trampling a surprise party and insisting that everyone who is there (men and women) want to steal from his wife. It is presented as a combination of a sociopath and a paranoid schizophrenic, but everything is supposed to be laughed at. Given that it seems dangerous madness, you would think Stanwyck would request an annulment along with a restraining order! But, curiously, she gets angry, but she just can not stay mad at Fonda because he is so ... I can not think of the right word: "creepy" is all that comes to mind! Later, suddenly, the multimillionaire Fonda gets a job at the counter of a department store. Then, through magical thinking, he and Babs seem to assume that their hostility and violent jealousy are a thing of the past, so a job apparently heals anger and suspicion. When this work fails, the film ends when Fonda buys his own hospital, gives Barbara a job there and they live happily ever after. They do not go further with the story, but I suppose that, according to Fonda's character, he spent most of his time as a hospital administrator hitting all the male patients. <br /> <br /> The first part in skiing. the lodge and the following did not fit well, nor the final section inspired by "Horatio Alger" where the rich kid did well in the business world. They were like three separate plots, but despite this, the film's biggest problem was that it seemed to excuse domestic violence and delirious jealousy. What a spooky little movie! Thank God, neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this yechy movie, but for all their other lovely movies.
