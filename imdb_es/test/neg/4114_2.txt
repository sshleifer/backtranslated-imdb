Ray Bradbury, run and hide! This sticky movie version of his 1950s tale about time travel and the effect it could have on the evolution of evolution is not well known for the theatrical series (did he have one?) And exists now as a DVD on shelves published during a slow week. <br /> <br /> What seems to be an elegant sci-fi thriller from the first scenes, deceives us quickly as computer-generated graphics are rerun unmodified in a movie that is supposed to be different 'trips back in the time where an important company sells macho men in 2055 the opportunity to hunt dinosaurs paying exorbitant rates to travel back in time to the prehistoric jungles. A glide of the foot / butterfly in one of these companies and the course of the evolution is altered with the resulting waves of time that roll over the planet and change everything to plants and beasts that devour men. Of course, there is a beautiful maid who knows how to reverse the process and a shrewd man who risks his life to fulfill his orders and everything is eventually fine. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's the story ... and the most surprising fact about this mess of a badly written and abysmally acted movie is that it attracted a great talent to portray flat characters in comics. Edward Burns (all buff and hunky) is our hero du jour, Ben Kingsley is the evil corporate man who wears a ridiculous white wig, Catherine McCormack is the creator of women who knows everything, and Wilfried Hochholdinger as a villain. Great actors and should have known better than to align with this flop. And the saddest thing is that for those who like this genre of science fiction thrillers and monsters, the creative department was sold with one of the most incredible animations that were heard on the screen in a long time. A must see Harp grady
