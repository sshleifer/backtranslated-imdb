AALCC informs us that children of 14 years can be quite unpleasant and vicious. For those who do not know, the film performs a public service. Otherwise, it's a lot of flashy videography with little or no reason to be. I will allow the camera work to be sometimes shocking, but also that it can be madly self-indulgent at other times. The actors occupy screen space and screen time, but do not compute as convincing human beings. I guess the email that appears on the screen means you have to find out which character has that name, but I just could not tell enough differences to do it, and anyway I did not care.
