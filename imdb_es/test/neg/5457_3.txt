The television director uses astral projection to kill people who take the blue man's form. <br /> <br /> A dull, uncovered horror movie that sits before your eyes and makes you wonder why you're watching it. I sat through the movie until the end and I really can not give you more than a brief summary of what the movie was because I kept finding my attention diverted by other things. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this. I think my feelings are best summarized by the fact that I paid a dollar for the DVD as a double feature and feel cheated.
