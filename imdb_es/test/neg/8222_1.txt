Wave after wave of aimless nausea: this film wants and, at first, promises to be extravagant and original, but in fact it is obvious, solipsistic and immersed in a dialogue driven by clich√©s that accumulates for an increase of scares and cheeses for the final. Throughout the film, we find characters supposedly out of the wall, who are actually very boring, and who just do not work and who cling to the hideous script like men in armor suits, driving jeeps through the mansions and spitting obvious existential evidence accompanied by the Coldplay Moans. The film has occasional funny episodes, often no more funny than a dog playing with its genitals, which happened twice (a slapstick index, rudimentary humor of the movie in general) but in the end, the film falls into a " infinite abyss ". of complete detritus and the egocentric ramblings of the director that made me want to take my eyes off. Watch this movie at your own risk.
