Dean Cain, the superman once, plays Max Hooper, the super-thief. He can enter any company and steal anything for the right price. Unfortunately, his latest theft ends in a place where someone else has lit a fire to hide his own attempts to steal the product. Now the thief is forced to be the hero who rescues everyone in the building. Unfortunately, the other thief is still in the building and the F.B.I. & INC. They are outside waiting for Max. <br /> <br /> The movie is barely passable. Dean Cain is a funny actor and he has done much better with more improved material, but here he has a weak script and a rather poor direction.
