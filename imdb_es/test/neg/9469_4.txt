Telly Savalas presented a passable interpretation (but no better than that) as Pancho Villa, the famous Mexican bandit / revolutionary in this account of Villa's raid in the city of Columbus, New Mexico in 1916. Villa is not really a historical figure to whom I am too familiar with, so I will not say much about the historical details of the film. As a movie, this is not great, although it has a handful of action and humor. The performance of Chuck Connors as Colonel Wilcox, commander of the US Army base. UU Near Columbus I thought it was a bit of an exaggeration, and Clint Walker as the companion of Villa del Gringo Scotty did not do much for me. The film is obviously a low budget effort with limited technical quality. For a movie with a run time of just over an hour and a half, I must say that this movie was dragged to places, especially in the last 20 minutes or so. Villa's incursion to the United States was an interesting historical sidebar (yes, in the general scheme of things, not especially important), and probably deserved better treatment than this. 4/10
