I was at Wrestlemania VI in Toronto when I was 10 years old, and the event I saw at that time was quite different from the one I saw on the Wrestlemania Collection DVD that I just saw. I do not understand how wwE does not have the rights of part of the old music, since most of those songs were created by WWF, they should not have to worry about licensing and royalty fees that prevent programs like SNL from releasing sets from the season. It's pretty stupid to complain, but for me to hear Demolition listen to their song in a Wrestlemania in person was a memory I never forgot, and it did not exist on this DVD. What good is it that you have the rights to this huge library of videos if you have to edit it so drastically to use it?
