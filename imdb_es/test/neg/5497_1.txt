Such a stupid movie should never see the light of day. The acting is lame, the violence is everywhere, the end secretly is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> This is a lawyer who saw a murder committed by R.I.C.C.O. team. Nobody has ever seen him, not even the assassins. So he and a beautiful lady are running away trying to find the leader of this R.I.C.C.O. squadron, before they find them. <br /> <br /> Then the film continues with a romance, gun shots and voodoo. Now, how the hell did voodoo get into this? Never see this movie if your life depends on it. Trust me!!!!!!!!
