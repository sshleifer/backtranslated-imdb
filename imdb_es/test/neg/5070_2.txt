Another example of the gender of women in prison. This is not exactly a genre known for quality films, but it is a category below most. A group of women are taken from brothels where they work to a prison on a rocky island. Once there, they are subjected to a lot of misdirected sex and an atrocious "dialogue". For a movie with an amazing amount of sex and nudes, there really is nothing erotic about any of that. The sex scenes are acted with awkwardness, and some scenes, like the shower scene, seem to go on and on. That said, there are at least some minimum values ​​of production. On the W-i-P scale I would put it above Frauen fur Zellenblock Neun, but below Heated Chained.
