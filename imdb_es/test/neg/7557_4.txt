Ken Harrison, a young sculptor in his early thirties, is seriously injured in a traffic accident. End of story. <br /> <br /> "End of history", that is, in the sense of "end of any physical action". Not in the sense of "end of the movie". Ken's life is saved, but he is paralyzed from the neck down. When he discovers that he is unlikely to recover from the use of his limbs, he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to stop the medical treatment that keeps him alive. The rest of the film is essentially a long debate about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia and the right to die. <br /> <br /> Ken's main antagonist in this debate is his doctor, Michael Emerson. Although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms, it is presented here in purely secular ones. If Dr. Emerson has deep religious convictions, they are never expressed in the film. However, passionately believe that death is an enemy against which it is your duty as a physician to fight; Allowing a patient to effectively take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and negligence in the fulfillment of that duty. Ken, therefore, is in a "Catch-22" situation. You must be able to show that you are healthy and rational enough to make the decision to end your life. Emerson, however, considers that the desire to die is in itself evidence of insanity and irrationality. Ken's dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes when Dr. Emerson expounded their respective views with skill and sincerity, but this can not hide fact that "Whose life is it anyway? " It just does not work like a movie. There was a time when the film versions of the plays were made in a similar way to the theatrical productions, but in the seventies and eighties this was often considered unsatisfactory due to the differences between the two media. Therefore, when theatrical works were filmed, the general tendency was to "open" them by filming in the place and in the studio settings, taking liberties with the dramatist's text, often making significant changes in the plot and even introducing additional characters . br /> <br /> I have never seen the work of Brian Clarke, but I suspect that this is a story that would work better in the theater than in the cinema. There is very little physical action; most of the action consists of long discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character is paralyzed. Said frame does not lend itself to the device of "opening" at all, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by conversation at the expense of action. Although it is well written and has a good performance, I am surprised that a film of such a non-cinematic theme has ever been made. 4/10
