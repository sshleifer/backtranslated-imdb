I wish I had something more positive to say about Devil Fish, but honestly I can not think of much. I can not even think of many of those moments "so bad, so good". Devil Fish is just old and bad. The plot is completely derived (Jaws, someone?), The performance is wooden, the characters are not interesting, the special effects are more than bad and the score is annoying. Add to that the apparently inept direction of Lamberto Bava and you will have a stench from a movie. However, I believe that the film's biggest sin is its lack of budget. Bava does not seem to have much to work with. In 1984, the Italian film industry was in decline. Especially in terms of genre films. The funding available for Bava was very probably very scarce. The movie like Devil Fish, which is based on special effects, never had the chance to be good. It is not the only Italian film that suffers this fate. There is a series of Italian films made in the mid-80s whose ideas and concepts far exceeded what anyone could have realistically expected, given their budget constraints. <br /> <br /> However, having said all that and noticing the film's many weaknesses, I can not say that Devil Fish is less than 3/10. I have even considered a higher rating, but I can not because I realize how bad a movie is. Why do not I rate it lower? Well, that's hard to explain. Despite the many problems found in the movie, there is something about Devil Fish that I inexplicably enjoy. It could be as simple as my love for low budget and cheesy Italian films. Maybe my taste for movies is horribly distorted, but I enjoy what I enjoy. <br /> <br /> Devil Fish's Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment is really very nice. I qualify Devil Fish with a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale. The guys do a good job mocking the film's many flaws. A very astute observation comes very early in the commentary when Tom Servo says: "Just because you can edit does not mean you should"? highlighting another of the many weaknesses found in Devil Fish.
