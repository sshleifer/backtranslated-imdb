I wish I could have given him a zero. Of course I must admit that I was also wrong to think that it was Spielberg's version. An ingenious marketing strategy that frees you right now and shows prominently in the video store. However, I was willing to try anyway, I wish I had not. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? I have read some of the other comments here and I have to say that I disagree with anyone who thinks that any of the performances was good; I'm sorry, even C. Thomas Howell stank. None of the performances was good. Not one. <br /> <br /> Even if the performance was decent, the dialogue is terrible! "Ginormus" and "dick skinners" just do not cut it. <br /> <br /> Now, as for the story, it is terribly adapted and must have been edited by a 5-year-old child. The main character is constantly running in situations that are very convenient, or at least appear that way due to the way the film was edited together. For example, he is trying to reach a place called New Hope to find his brother. During a brief pause, someone randomly gives instructions to get to New Hope. What the hell is that? When he arrives in Nueva Esperanza, he meets his dying brother. Then there is the part where he has been traveling away from his destination for days and, by chance, he finds the car in which his wife and son were traveling. I was going in a different direction and then they were how the car arrived at its destination. I was? He has a black backpack that appears at random and disappears throughout the film. There are parts of the movie where the characters wake up in the morning and then, two seconds later, it is night or, what is worse, at nightfall the next day. Nor can I forget that the main character and the preacher falling on the floor of a house without any reason, we do not discover until later that a foreigner has landed in the house. Which reminds me of the moment they walk and suddenly they are standing under an alien they did not notice. What the hell, the aliens are about two stories high with huge bodies and multiple legs, how could they miss it? There is a point at which an alien kills a citizen at random, supposedly spitting on him a kind of garbage, but you never see things fly, they only appear on the faces of the boys. The special effects in general are terrible. The whole movie is like a bad "train crash". When we finally reach the end, after this guy tries to get to DC to find his family, they just show up. Do not look, do not ask questions, nothing. Just oh, there you are, I'm very happy, the end. <br /> <br /> Sorry if my review rambles a bit, but this movie was so bad that it cost me to organize my contempt. Please, save yourself time and do not look at this heap of kinematic stench that is shown in secret. It is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I would rather have been getting a root canal: it would have been less painful.
