Now I saw this when it first appeared on VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a pretty good movie, but, again, we were teenagers. But, honestly, it's not such a good movie in hindsight. A kind of metallic hair, Dokken version of Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie does not exactly mean you can not see it; however, this seems to lack the charm that many of the normal Mst3k forages usually contain. But if he was on the wire, and he was bored and drinking beer, of course, he would see him again. But, again, I've seen Howling VII about five times, so maybe you really should not listen to me. <br /> <br /> Any other person thinks it's a bit sad that the director was supposed to comment on his own movie? And why did you feel the need to capitalize so much?
