This was an irreverent comedy of the 70s, mocking the psychiatric profession and Beverly Hills. I did not care about that, but I objected more to irreverence regarding marriage and religion: two issues that secular filmmakers (that is, everyone in Hollywood and elsewhere) simply can not stop tearing up. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays a character "Donald Becker", who walks with the neck of a cleric, which offends me but when has Hollywood worried about offending Christians? <br /> <br /> Anyway, despite that nonsense, the movie has its entertaining moments and even some charm. Dan Aykroyd is good at paying a case of insanity and Donna Dixon ("Laura Rollins") is a knockout. I'm sorry that she did not have a more important role.
