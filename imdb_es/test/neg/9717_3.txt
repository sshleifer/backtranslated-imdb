A group of four young people, who attend a prestigious private school, belong to an old pact formed by their ancestors during the witch hunt of the late seventeenth century. Each one possesses a power that ages them each time they use it and they suspect that a new child in the academy might belong to a family that was believed to have perished long ago. This new boy wants everyone's power for himself. <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie, as it tries to present itself as. Yes, there is magic and all those supernatural things, but this is just an action movie. A very mediocre action movie. Focusing almost exclusively on being fresh and skillful and paying only a minimum of attention to the plot, which has a lot of space sadly unused for interesting turns. But he did not put any, and even before the movie has finished half, he will know what is being played and by whom. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes here and there, especially an exploding car that is magically Rebuilt after colliding with a large platform, but that's all. What's worse is that the director Renny Harlin, who has some very entertaining, if not intelligent, films to his credit, relies heavily on metal music and too sexy tracks to take that film and that makes it possibly the most stupid "horror" movie since the disastrous "Alone in the Dark." It's not as bad as "Alone in the Dark," since the few slippery scenes are really clever and not ridiculously incompetent, but in the end, the best this film can hope for is a nice, cozy house on the nightly cable. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Classified PG-13: violent action
