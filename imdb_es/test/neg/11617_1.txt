Woohoo! I really regret seeing this picture ... It's funny, I agreed to see it only for my wife, who endured the torture of seeing her for about half an hour before I left, while I was standing in front of the TV, but only to feed the masochist in me and me because I wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its entirety or if there were some tradable aspects that could alleviate the feeling I had of being stupid by seeing this **** called Two Girls and a boy ... <br /> <br /> Everything in this image is wrong, totally wrong ... from the initial premise, absurd, of two women stupid enough to stay with their common boyfriend, until the horrible, but merciful, In the end, without forgetting the horrible performance of the three actors ... Do not believe the rumors, the performance of the junkie is bad and I do not see how Graham has become a well-known name within the film industry ... <br /> <br /> I wonder why, after that the producers saved some dollars with only three actors and a single location, they did not hire a person to write the script instead of putting a monkey to do it with their shit ... <br /> <br /> At least, I I felt a little bit good when I destroyed the DVD and threw it away ... Anyway, I liked somehow (and only a little) the brunette actress, Natasha something, but that was not enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of Face-off (changing face), so Two Girls and a Guy to the bottom to go go ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this ****!
