K, one day my father picked up a movie with a "neat" cover. I arrived home with my mother and we were as if, let's see this new movie that we never saw before. Ok, so it started ... interesting start, cool robots and gore disgusting (eek) on a strange planet (actually Pluto, right?) ... Blablabla could tell the whole story but I prefer not to point, WTF I NEVER NEVER choose a movie with a lame ass name, and seriously, I NEVER mean NEVER judge a book by its cover (err tape ..) It seemed an interesting movie HOWEVER, it was a slap in the face Science movies fiction, it's disgusting. I mean it was so bad that I just started laughing (I swear I tried to be serious) I WANTED TO DESCRIBE THE STUPIDITY! He killed more than a million brain cells of mine, I can not even write a criticism of descent. IT IS THAT BAD! Argh and I prepare you for something "strange" * TOSORIOSO * Mechanics p3n1 $ * TOS TOS TOSOS * Sorry, I just have to say it, it's very funny, think of it as a comedy or a parody of science fiction movies. His classic batman laughs but in a new container. What the hell was this director thinking?
