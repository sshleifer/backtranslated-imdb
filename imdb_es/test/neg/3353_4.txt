Threadbare horror outing has an innocent teenager (Meg Tilly, attractive as always) who tries to get along with the popular clique at school (despite the fact that she seems to hate it openly) and lets herself be subjected to her initiation as sisterhood of women: spend the night in a spooky mausoleum. Despite the total absence of originality, this low budget thriller film achieves some decent special effects and has several good performances (in particular by Robin Evans, who oozes campy Viciousness as the leader of the girls). The script is not very clear, but has enough peculiarities to make the procedures more bearable. ** since ****
