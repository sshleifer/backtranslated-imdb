As a caricature, the movie Spytroops was pretty bad. It only lasts 44 minutes, however, there are several battles that culminate with the destruction of the COBRA headquarters. A disappointment was the beginning of the movie. An animated battle that was better than the rest of the movie turned out to have been some kind of battle simulation. That moment there was a great detour and made the rest of the film lack credibility. Then there was the issue of Shipwreck tied together with his parrot and thrown into a room where no one had checked for several days. What happened to the surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> The COBRA base only had a handful of characters, and the rest were BAT robots. Apart from many runners, the COBRA base did not seem to have weapons, tanks, trucks or any other equipment. Then there was the silly idea that 100 complex androids could be created overnight. The plot was silly, even if it was intended for small children. SpongeBob, Powerpuff Girls and even Barney The Dinosaur pay more attention to their plots. <br /> <br /> The characters were not bad, except that I could never understand anything Destro said, and Commander Cobra was foolish and not much of a villain. In fact, with the exception of Storm Shadow and Xartan, the rest of the COBRA characters were comical and hardly impressive. The characters of GI Joe were pretty good. Scarlett, Agent Faces, Road Block and Snake Eyes were my favorites here. Shipwreck and beach head were the worst. Shipwreck is written like nonsense and Beach Head sounded like a surfer of the nineties. I guess the writer, Larry Hama, was trying to make a character that would appeal to teenagers, but he was a decade away from the brand. Just listening to the Beach Head Spicoli conversation (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) I was wondering if the new GI Joes were going to smoke a tube before the big mission. <br /> <br /> The CGI was pretty good, except that Cobra Commander had a spasmodic jolt, and the vehicles did not seem very realistic. The flying tank and the explosions were not very impressive. The old-style animation would have been much better than this. Since, reportedly, Hasbro likes to do cheap things, they got what they paid for. I had trouble seeing everything, it was just boring and lacked the soul or spirit of GI Joe. Even the old GI Joe ads would have been better. In fact, the DVD included extras like four or five current commercials for GI Joe Spy Troops, and those commercials were much more entertaining than the movie. The commercials had more fun and spirit oriented to children. The ads were animated, while the movie was boring.
