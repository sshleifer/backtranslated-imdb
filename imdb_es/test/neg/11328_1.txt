It's hard to believe that such a bad movie could be released. The dialogue was unnatural. Especially poor was the portrait of the relationship between the child and his future stepfather. I suppose you could say that they succeeded in producing an uncomfortable dialogue, but what was said seemed false and artificial. The suspense was simply not there. The music was as bad as it gets. The only reason I saw this movie was because I live in the Death Valley area and I was curious to know what locations would appear on the screen. Fortunately, the movie was on TV and, therefore, I did not waste money by renting this sorry excuse for a movie! Honestly, I think that most fans could put together a more captivating plot than what is presented here. It's a shame that the entire film crew's time has been wasted on so much garbage! I guess the only positive thing I can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good.
