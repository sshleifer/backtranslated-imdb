The first official release of the World Wrestling Entertainment movie division is a fairly basic horror / slasher movie called "See No Evil," starring Kane, one of his big-man fighters known for having an intimidating presence, blunt movements and one of the most important. Complicated backstories in wrestling. And let's not make any blow here; While this movie is touted as the best horror film of all time (mainly by WWE), it goes without saying that after watching this movie, I can confirm it as one of the best comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> "See No Evil" sees a group of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up. Of course, a monstrous killer (played by Kane) also lives in this hotel and we all know where that goes. Without revealing too much of the plot of the film, this film has all the appearance and structure of a film of the early 1980s with most of the clich√©s intact, but without any of the fears that accompany those films. And that's the main kind of problem with "See No Evil." Try so many of the tricks implied by your predecessors in the predictable genre; veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the tricks in advance and even those who have only seen a few movies must tell what will happen next. It's too generic to be scary. <br /> <br /> The movie is bloody, no doubt, but it's only there for effect. The dark atmosphere instilled in the film initially emits that sense of terror, but as the end approaches, it somehow feels out of place and quickly becomes boring. The scenes of death are not as bloody and horrible as are the laughter, although some of them are quite ingenious. <br /> <br /> And the acting in this movie is also pretty bad, like the main characters. They are not developed enough for us to worry about when they finally fall apart. Some can not even represent fear adequately; they just scream and cry in a vain effort for emote. So when they die, it only adds to the comedy because you do not care enough for them to simply consider them the equivalent of Starfleet red t-shirts to the monster Kane. <br /> <br /> As for Kane, he simply portrayed his movie character in the same way that he plays his fighting character, only using axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone. I have no doubt that Kane can be a great accessory in the horror genre. He has the look and the presence for it; he just needs a better material (specifically a script that is not written by someone writing fight programs) to work. <br /> <br /> Now, despite what may seem like a harsh criticism, I really enjoyed the movie. It's one of those ridiculously bad movies that you can not stop sitting and enjoying. My main complaint with the film, once again, is that it is simply an exercise to film bloody massacres and has no moment of fear or surprise. I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed it because it was easy for me to laugh at some of those that were supposed to be moments of fear in the movie. If that happens because it was supposed to be that way, the movie would have been rated higher. But it was not like that. He laughed because it's a B movie and it does not help that the director's previous experiences were porn movies and music videos; Not exactly exaggerating things to lead anyway. However, I enjoyed it tremendously. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind a funny B movie or a funny horror movie, I highly recommend "See No Evil". If you are a true enthusiast of the genre, I would wait until the DVD comes out before watching it. Probably everyone else should go see something else.
