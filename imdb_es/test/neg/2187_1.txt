It is the best film that occupies the first place in the sickest and a useful film that has been made in this poor country. Actually, people do not even know what the word cinema means and vote for movies, I'm very curious to know how many films of P.P.P. or L.Bunuel has seen you. The score of this "fade experiment" reflects a great way of understanding things and recognizing a good quality movie when you see it. We, the Romanians, have only ONE movie and to this day the state has not changed and that movie is "Padurea Spanzuratilor". But I do not waste time thinking about how many of you have seen it. That is a film that respects all the qualities required of a MOVIE. From the script to the frames and even the quality / clarity of the image, even 41 years have passed over it. I recommend that voters look for better films and then vote. KuDos will see you later.
