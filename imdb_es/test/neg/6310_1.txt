I have not seen this movie in years, but the horrible "taste" of Quaid's performance still lingers in my language. Some have commented on how Quaid has Jerry Lee Lewis "to perfection", but the fact is that he only seems to have in mind the most extreme stage of Jerry. Nobody behaves that way all the time, and acting becomes irremediably silly, which reduces Lewis to a caricature buffoon. The nuances of a man's life are lost in the rubble of pure overacting. <br /> <br /> The author of the book on which it is based (Nick Tosches) is a good writer, who has written several excellent musical biographies. (I particularly liked "Dino" in Dean Martin); In the books, Tosches gives us a complete human being, both separated and involved in the "business". Quaid's performance seems to imply that Jerry never acted like a human being. If people were like that, nobody would bother to stay close to them. As the cartoons go, it's a little funny, but otherwise it's one of the most notorious and destructive performances of movies that I've had the "honor" of seeing. Terrible...
