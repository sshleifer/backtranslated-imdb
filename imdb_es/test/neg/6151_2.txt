I saw this movie when it first came out at the cinema. We were all looking forward to see Mark Hamill relaunch his career, but we left wishing we had not been bothered. Many people left after half an hour, I wish I had. The basic premise seems to be fine, but the plot was ridiculously complicated and tortuous, and it ends in the middle. It is completely memorable, and it is not a movie in which you want to have paid money to watch. If you're really bored and on TV, then it will help you kill a couple of hours (or it will help you fall asleep!). 2/10
