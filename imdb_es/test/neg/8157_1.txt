Even though I'm a Heather Thomas fan and I have some of her old bikini posters here and in earnest, I can honestly say that if the only movie I ever saw her in was "Cyclone," I could never guess why. she had gone as far as she had in the world of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Directed by Fred Olen Ray (almost as good an omen as seeing the hawks circling in the desert), this tale of a woman (Thomas) who must protect a high-tech motorcycle of the types Unscrupulous is a "B" movie, since (or, in the case of Fred Olen, "B minus"). <br /> <br /> The cast itself should tell you something. Not all films combine Thomas with actors of the caliber of Beswick, Hall, Combs, Donahue, Tamblyn and Landau (!!). If you're lucky, very few movies do. And even though they seem to be having fun, should not some of that fun be passed on to the audience? Vote yes, it seems that they voted no. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you ever wanted to see Heather deliver an uppercut to another woman, use the word "F" and connect to the battery cables. I've probably been looking for this one. Myself, I'll settle for the old "Fall Guy" reruns. <br /> <br /> A star, hoping that when another "Cyclone" arrives in the city, Heather runs to take refuge. I know I will.
