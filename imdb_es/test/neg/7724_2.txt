When Uwe Boll, cinema with man extraordinaire, released the first adaptation of House Of The Dead to a deserved mockery, in general, the fans of the video game of origin agreed that one would have to be incredibly stupid to contemplate a sequel. The proportion of idiots per capita of Hollywood must be high, since not only do we have a sequel, but it was also distributed in the antipodes by Sony, a company that is not usually known for its taste in expensive cancellations. Launched directly to television in the United States, the sequel improves the original in most aspects, but in doing so, it becomes insipid instead of interesting. The scale of the stage expands, and the action takes place in a deserted city that simply surrounds a university where experiments are being conducted with a virus that can reanimate the dead. In particular, the action extends throughout the university, where the first infected inhabitants can be found. In short, the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs inside a house where dead people can be found. <br /> <br /> The cast, on the other hand, is a true step backwards. Emmanuelle Vaugier was created specifically to look like a low-income Angelina Jolie, while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a poor neighborhood, JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. In fact, the only name that will stand out in this cast is Sticky Fingaz, who probably did not want to be recognized so easily by the people he faces at home. In short, these people could not order pizza convincingly on the big screen, even in the best direction. Say what you want about Boll, but at least he inspired actors like Ona Grauer to fight against his ineptitude. That said, the people involved here at least seem to be aware that their movie sucks and that they could also have a little fun with it. Much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was making some kind of misunderstood masterpiece, and took himself seriously. Unfortunately, because the actors do not take their characters or the situation seriously, the little dramatic tension that might have existed is undermined. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot refers to the search for a zero-generation victim of Any plague is causing the dead to rise up. Or to translate it into more practical terms, they're trying to find someone who got infected right after the virus mutated in a way that threatened humans. The way in which this would help when an unmutated strain is required to create a vaccine is a guess, but the way in which this search develops suffers its own problems. The we-have-to-back-back plotting device is used to compensate for the execution time, but the real time of the additional search is also problematic. At one point, we are told that the Cruise missiles will destroy the city in ten minutes, but the heroes return to the university, locate the sample they are looking for and fight against enough zombies to eat the Chinese army, all in this space of weather. The filmmakers take note: it is only worthwhile to be specific with time when it can serve rather than hinder dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The special effects used in House of The Dead 2 leave the originals in the dust. Where Uwe Boll simulated the death of the characters using idiots rotating camera tricks, Michael Hurst uses all the graphic details that his budget can allow. They bite their necks, cut their arms, shoot their heads. All this makes the performance much more convincing, but also prevents the mockery of obvious fakes. Photography has also improved a lot. As expressed by DVD Crypt, the fact that it is focused at all times makes it an improvement over the original, but this also deprives us of something that we laugh at the expense of. Writing is also an improvement and a setback. Throughout the script, references to other horror and survival games are offered, the most obvious being Run Like Hell. The first couple of times, they work because they offer intelligent ways of working the titles in a daily and ordinary dialogue. However, after the eighth time, they get nervous because they remind players of the things they would prefer to do with their time. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that House of The Dead 2 cost only six million. to television screens throughout the United States. Since Tom Savini would only cost more than this to work on a movie today, I must say that I am somewhat impressed with the visual results. In contrast to the original so vilified, the zombies here look like real zombies instead of extras in bad makeup fired badly. In additional contrast to the original, the actors seem to have a clue of what they are doing. Sealing the deal is the fact that, apart from some scattered real zingers, the characters speak like real people. However, history is nothing that we have not seen a thousand times. When Aliens, the real Dawn Of The Dead, or The Evil Dead were released to be acclaimed, the fact was due to the fact that these films did something we had not seen before, or did so well that it really did not matter to us. House Of The Dead 2 is competent enough not to make fun of it, but it does not bring anything new or particularly bright to the table, so it does not matter to us either. <br /> <br /> For that reason, and many others. , Di House of The Dead 2 to two out of ten. It's too good to be bad, but too bad to be good. Unless you like dirty movies as much as I do, you'd better get away from them.
