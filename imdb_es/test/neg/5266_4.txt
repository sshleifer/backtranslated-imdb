This movie is really quite strange. Clearly certain * events * depicted identify the main character as the Dublin criminal known as "The General", but almost everything else is wrong. We are not talking about a distortion of ancient history ... but about a complete distortion of irrefutable and documented facts. The question is why? The garda are shown as Keystone Cops of the last days, their band as non-threatening and the man as ... well, Kevin Spacey. Almost pure fiction anyway, why bother trying to give an appearance of realism? Having said all this, it's a bad exercise * any * way you want to see it. It's not worth a second of anyone's time.
