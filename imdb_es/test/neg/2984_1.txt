I just watched this movie last night and I almost cried. No, it was not because it completely petrified me, no. It was absolutely horrible! Sometimes, you watch movies that make you wonder what will happen to the human race in the near future, this movie is one of those. It's as if the writer, the actors, the director and others come together, copy and paste scenes from their favorite horror films, compress everything together and say "hey, here is the whip of Satan". After watching this movie, I could not help but be tormented by the sight of people who call themselves "actors"; walking around like they were some kind of talented performers ... Do not be fooled, they stink! Do not bother losing your time or money!
