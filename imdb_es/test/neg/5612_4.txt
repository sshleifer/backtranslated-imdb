Rutger Hauer helps throughout a film that can basically be summarized in the category of young people who find themselves and, obviously, yes, so they need a lot of help. <br /> <br /> The beginning is much more promising, from A film that could become Michael Clayton or Stranger Than Fiction. It's very bad because I really got hooked at the beginning. Then, just like the opening soundtrack, it went from being cool and intriguing to practically nowhere. <br /> <br /> It's quite fun, with lots of curiosities and interesting characters that worked well. I'm sure it will be enough for many people. The problem is that everything feels artificial and empty, which, ironically, is supposed to be the main discovery for the self-realization of the character. Not the film itself (it's not a self-conscious film), but the character is supposed to recognize that his own life is artificial and empty.
