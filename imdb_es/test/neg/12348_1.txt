I was looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality as Frontline or "Fog of War" (by Errol Morris). On the other hand, I was horrified by this superficial and naive tale of a very complex and disturbing man and his regime: Alberto Fujimori. This movie should be called "The return of Fujimori." The director presumes that she made a "perfect" movie because it alienates pro and anti-Fujimori factions when in reality it is a very partial and unprofessional work. <br /> <br /> The film has some crucial facts wrong: <br /> <br /> 1) She uses the so-called "overwhelming" election of 1995 in which Fujimori was re-elected with 65% of the vote. , as an example of Fujimori's massive popular support. But now we all know that we are the fruit of a very organized electoral fraud. <br /> <br /> 2) The film says that Shining Path (60th Shining Path) killed 60,000 people. In fact, the final report of the Truth Commission affirms that there were 69,280 deaths due to political violence in Peru. 33% of these were caused by SL. That leaves the other 67% in the hands of the police, the military and other groups. The fact that she uses the same misleading information that Fujimori has been using for 10 years is another example of how terrible this film is. <br /> <br /> For anyone with any education in Peruvian politics and history, Fujimori is clearly an accomplished manipulator, a delirious character and an implacable egomaniac. His regime was far from democratic. It remains a threat to Peruvians. Despite these facts, the director lets Fujimori tell the story. Not only about how he wants the camera to be placed, but the narrative and direction of the film seem to be part of his political agenda. It always seems to have the last word. There are no journalistic "balls", only soft questions and unanswered comments. Where is Oriana Fallaci when we need her? When the director was asked after the screening, she did not hide the fact that she was deeply impressed by Fujimori, her charm and intelligence. Yes, she has definitely been delighted with him, and you can watch him watching this movie. It is obvious that she has a hard time digesting the multitude of events that point to her responsibility for the corruption, murder and deception that took place. He assured the panting audience that Fujimori was truly a "patriot" when, a few moments before, one of the leading Peruvian journalists was adamant in telling us that Fujimori was, above all, a "traitor." He went on to say that despite all the accusations, no "one dollar" was found in any bank account in his name, etc., etc. It was like listening again to the same band of ruthless thugs who ruled the country for 10 years defending domination. It was a sad moment for journalism. <br /> <br /> This movie does injustice to history. It is an insult to hundreds of people killed, disappeared or unjustly incarcerated by the Fujimori regime. No wonder he later confessed that all the Peruvian intellectuals with whom he became friends when making the film felt betrayed. Impartial? The words "opportunist", "naive" and "denial" come to mind.
