I was a teenager when he first appeared in theaters, and I saw him in Japan. The plot of the movie was not my cup of tea as a high school student, but I went to see it for the 3-D process. He had been missed in the press, so even service personnel abroad had heard of him, though he never showed at the Post Theater. <br /> <br /> The movie started the trend of throwing objects at the audience, which was taken to absurd levels with later 3-D movies. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this qualifies as a spoiler, but you have been warned if it is. In many films of the time, the actors often worked in front of a "rear-projection screen", where they could project funds to make it appear that they were in a different environment, like a jungle background when the actors were really in a scene. Stage of sound. This works well in normal movies, but when viewed in 3-D, they look like a flat scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the film where the rear-projection was used, and it did not work well in the theaters. If seen in 3-D, it will be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The only importance of the film is historical, since it was the first of its kind.
