Well, there's not much to say about this movie. it's just trash very bad acting, bad script and bad story ... well, the actress, (I do not even know her name) who played mainrole (not the blonde but the latina) was acting well, but the blonde who played the friend of the main character ", his acting level is like the high school game, as well as most of the other actors in the movie, in addition, zombies, very bad acting too, and, the story itself does not make any sense. If you're really bored and you do not have anything to do, but you want to kill time somehow, maybe you want to watch this movie, but in any case, there are still millions of better B movies than this shit, your total waste of money and weather.
