Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was a little embarrassing to see Lane and Gere in this movie, because it's BAD. The performance was bad, the dialogues were extremely superficial and little sincere. It was well filmed, but, again, it's a big budget movie. It was too predictable, even for a movie for girls. I even knew from the beginning that I was going to die in the end, the only thing I did not know was how. Too politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing that is really worth seeing is the landscape and the house, because it is beautiful. But, if you want that, look at the geographic national. I love Lane, but I've never seen her in such a bad movie. As far as Gere is concerned, he's a good actor, but he had movies like this, so I'm not surprised. An hour and a half I wish I could go back.
