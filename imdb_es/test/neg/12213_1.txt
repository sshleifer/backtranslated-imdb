I am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of Christian fundamentalism. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie is reprehensible, vile and transparent. It only works at the currently fashionable (and tired) hate motive of white American Christian fundamentalism. If this film had been made about a fundamentalist Jewish or Muslim family, or even about a black Christian family, the outrage would have been palpable, and the film would have been resounding in ALL circles. However, as it stands, it is "OK" and "witty" because white Christian fundamentalists remain one of the last "acceptable" targets for garbage like this. <br /> <br /> And the trash really is. If you want to watch a quality movie with a similar inclination, look and see or review "Badlands." There was nothing good in "The King" that was not done better decades ago in that masterful film. <br /> <br /> As other critics point out, the characters are almost completely underdeveloped in "The King", the lines are a siesta, the cinematography is lackluster. We have seen how the sociopath's story is best done 100 times. This movie does not cut it for thoughtful viewers.
