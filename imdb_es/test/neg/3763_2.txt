Minor spoilers <br /> <br /> First I must say how weird and charming it is to find a movie with such basic messages: nuclear war will inevitably destroy all civilization, and women are to make babies. It is absolutely incredible how well formulated is the plot of hitting these two points, as with a golden hammer. Essentially, everything related to this movie bothered me. Casual sexism, the character whose only trait came from Texas, the mysterious choice of dying the orange of Mars and, of course, the faulty science of all this. Then the Martian woman screaming as if she had just realized that she was blind? What was that? However, I will give you credit. The fifties spit some silly things. But not much...
