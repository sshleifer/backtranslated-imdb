No, it's just a cheap series from 1940 with the good name of Cap. If you are a comic book fan, you will be very disappointed. They have radically changed the character. No shield, no Bucky, no fighting against the Nazis, no wings on the side of his mask and most importantly: Captain America is now a District Attorney and is no longer an IG. <br /> <br /> Dick Purcell as Captain America? Do not look too closely when you put on your costume. It is quite obvious that he was not in the best physical shape when he did this series (can you say that he is flaccid?). It is also VERY obvious that a specialist is doing most of the action here. Almost all the chapters have a mandatory fist fight that is triggered and performed in exactly the same way. The villain is quite insipid and, although he uses an alias (The Scarab), he does not wear any kind of disguise. The story is repetitive and very simple. The effects are laughable and the action is average. On the positive side, we have the sexy Lorna Gray as assistant to the grade teacher and the good captain gets on a cool-looking motorcycle in a previous chapter. In general it is fine, but nothing special.
