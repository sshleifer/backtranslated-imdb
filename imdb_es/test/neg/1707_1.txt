There was a time when Michael Jackson was revered as the King of Pop. Then came a time when he attracted negative publicity as much as lemonade attracts wasps. Finally, now is the time when we feel truly sorry for this man. <br /> <br /> This "movie" is another reason to do it. I promised a rabid Michael Jackson fan to watch her with her. You know the kind of fanatic, someone who tells himself that he likes everything the object of affection did. While watching this movie, which she had already seen twice, I realized how far this fan goes. Probably far enough to rate this movie above a 1/10, as some people did miraculously. <br /> <br /> The film tries to be a parody of many other films and series, especially Cast Away, Lost and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, it fails miserably at any level. The performance does not keep the story absolutely horrible, the footage has the quality of a video tape that plays very often, the special effects were executed better in Be Kind Rewind (for those who do not now in this movie: with paper aluminum). All this would be fun if the movie could be, well, fun. Unfortunately, it is not. It hurts me to see this. <br /> <br /> And then there's Michael Jackson's appearance in this garbage. He appears on a projection screen to broadcast an important message, and he manages to be as mobile as Jabba the Hutt and as serious as a 4-year-old child. Just when I thought "Who is the terrible person who attracted this poor man to participate in this film and, once again, to make a fool of himself?", I finally reached the final credits and discovered that the film was partially shot by Jackson. Ranch never ever In other words: the. Pleasures. It's. <br /> <br /> This movie, and Jackson's participation in it, is really disturbing. Do not even see it because of the effect "haha, a movie on IMDb Bottom 100". Or be warned.
