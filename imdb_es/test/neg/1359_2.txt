For those of you who have never heard of the film so far (of which, I suppose there are many lucky people who have not done so), I will summarize it for you. Ryan Gosling plays the titular character of Leland, who also serves as the narrator of the film (Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, but without the intelligent observations about life). Leland goes to jail for stabbing a retarded child and the movie tries to find out why he did it. He seems to be a good boy (if he is not mentally absent), and Gosling portrays him with a total lack of violence, anger or agenda (and if you're waiting for him to reveal his sinister side later in the film, don't waste your time. ... it's not that kind of movie ... Once in juvenile prison, Leland attends classes taught by Pearl Madison, with a good performance of Don Cheadle (who is incapable of anything but quality, even when it comes to bad movies) Pearl tries to discover the mystery of Leland in an attempt to discover how such a child could do something like this, and so could write a book on the subject later on (besides being a teacher of a juvenile prison, Pearl is also an aspiring author). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Leland and Pearl is the driving narrative behind the film, as their conversations reveal Leland's past to the audience, however, calling it the central focus would imply that this film The serpentine one had one. It is not like this. The United States of Leland have an impressive cast, which seems to be to the detriment of the film. It seems that writer / director Matthew Ryan Hodge (do not worry about not having heard about him, he has never done anything) had to give each character a personal story arc and a personality defect for the actors to interpret. . Most of these traits and stories are cliches, and most are underdeveloped and unresolved. <br /> <br /> I will try to break them here: Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson are the parents of the murdered retarded child (I love how the movie kept calling the child "retarded", never "mentally disabled".) That part made me laugh for Inside, they seem to have a cold relationship, because all suburban marriages in contemporary cinema should be cold.Their other two children are Michelle Williams, who is apparently an aspiring actress about to attend college, and Jena Malone, who plays the same adolescent archetype with problems that he always plays, this time with a heroin addiction.Malone was also Leland's girlfriend, which gives him his link to his victim.The boyfriend of Williams, who was orphaned and came to live with the family, and is a baseball player looking to go to the same university as his girlfriend, is played by Chris Klein, he ends up doing more with his character than any of the other bit players, managing to steal the movie at times. Lena Olin is Leland's mother, who seems to be perpetually sad for some reason. Kevin Spacey (also executive producer) is the cold and absent father of Leland, who is a famous novelist. Eventually, Sherilyn Fenn will appear to ruin Leland's story, if at that moment you care. Oh yeah, and there's an ex-boyfriend drug dealer, a couple of fellow juvees and a co-worker from Pearl with whom he has an affair with his long-distance girlfriend (played by Kerry Washington). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if all that synopsis and character breakdown took so long. If it seemed pointless and boring, then you have experienced a bit of what I did during the 108 minutes I spent watching the movie. But the ungovernable cast of too-forged clich√©s is the least of the crimes in this film. The biggest one is that the whole exercise is totally useless. We are not given a fascinating look to a mind with problems, we are not given an effective explanation, we are not given much of anything. Since it stunk so much, I'm going to go ahead and ruin the end so you never have to see it: Leland stabbed at the delay because everything Leland could see in the world was sad, and he wanted to avoid Corky (or whatever the name of the victim was) the sadness in his eyes. It's like the worst emo band in the world that made an album, and he called it "The world is sad, so I killed a delay." Oh, and Leland dies at the end, in such a confident sequence of incredible coincidences that would have ruined the movie, if the movie no longer stinks. Of course, in the end he dies, because that made the film so profound. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 2 stars, because all the actors did a good job with the trash they were given. The scenes with Cheadle and Gosling together were even interesting on some levels. But, paraphrasing the film itself, you have to believe that movies are more than the sum of their parts, child.
