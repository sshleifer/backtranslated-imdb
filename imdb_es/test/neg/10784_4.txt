The paths of Western-style feminism in the various subcultures of India have remained largely non-existent until now, the two entities belonging to strange and threatening realms (in the name of tradition) never coincide. Art imitates life (or so it says) and Hindi popular cinema is no exception, reflecting an underlying misogyny that, unfortunately, forms the basis of much of the collective Indian culture. But why? What about the female gender that has made it so obnoxious to the culture that women are routinely subjected to the most unimaginable horrors, such as rape, murder, infanticide, imposed illiteracy, infidelity and subjugation of the low spirit? the name of 'dowry'? The last offer of Rajkumar Santoshi, "Lajja", raises the same pitiful question, linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate episodes / chapters that comprise the journey of shame endured by its protagonist, Vaidehi (Manisha Koirala). <br /> <br /> Santoshi's direction is not on par with the level demanded by history. He fails to achieve the sensitivity necessary to describe the saga of sadness and faces the problem of misogyny from the side, instead of facing it. Santoshi has said recently that he did not make the film for an international film festival, but for the masses of his country. Regrettably, adherence proves, and the film goes too often into the bloody blood genre in which Santoshi specializes. The film suffers from its irregular and episodic rhythm and its end is too artificial. <br /> <br /> The female cast receives characterizations much nicer and more rounded than their male counterparts. The protagonist is played with sensitivity by the beautiful luminous Manisha Koirala, who shows in Lajja that she is one of the most competent ladies of our time, and that she has a suitable role and configuration, emerges with a truly commendable performance. One wonders how brilliantly he could have shone if the film had been made by a director with the appropriate creative intention and appreciation of the subject in question. Mahima Choudhary presents a laudable performance and continues to demonstrate that she is an untapped talent. With the role of Janki, Madhuri Dixit is presented with a fervor and happiness never before seen for what really deserves the name of "acting." The role of an intelligent street interpreter who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of a child to be born represents the greatest risk in her canon of singing and dancing roles that have maintained her brand position in the last decade. What leaves the last and most disturbing performance in this possible feminist saga, that of the incessant talented Rekha. Lajja is the film of Manisha Koirala, there is no doubt about it, but it is Rekha who dominates the proceedings in a performance that digs into your bones and sends echoes of terror through the halls of your heart. Rekha dazzles as Ramdulari, renouncing vanity and complacency by offering a performance so full of authenticity and wit that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this part of the film. The comparisons are really odious, especially when they are represented in front of one of the most important ladies of the world, but before the graceful presence of this legend of the prevailing screen, the others vanish in their shadow. <br /> <br /> "Lajja" is nothing fancy. of protofeminist dramas like "Zubeidaa", "Pinjar", or even the celebration of the Queen of Hell "Laadla": fulfills her feminist goals in two early moments: the tirade in which Mahima berates her in-laws for her abuse of her father, that he has committed no other crime than to have given birth to a girl. She erupts, leaving the wedding procession in ruins. Seeing her father devastated, she begins to cry, blaming herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her. She laments: "Why did I say something? I've ruined everything! It's all my fault!" Her grandmother, silently witnessing the abuse she suffered, comforts her by saying: "Why are you crying? There is no reason for you to cry, it's not your fault, it's my fault, it's all women's fault." who came before you, because if we had the courage to say in our day what you said today, it would not have been necessary for you to say anything today. "In this scene, the importance of the Feminist Legacy is clearly seen through the words . <br /> <br /> The other, more subtle moment arrives early in the film when Vaidehi (Manisha) has fled her abusive husband to the Refuge of his parents' house in India. Western societies, it may seem perfectly reasonable (in fact, natural) for any battered woman to seek protection from her parents, but this is a social taboo in many Eastern cultures, including India. married, the identity that assumes is that of her husband and his personal assets (family, company, children, etc.). For her to turn her back on these responsibilities is a serious social sin, one that does not really have Equivalent for the occide woman Subsequently, it is considered as contaminated and as 'damaged goods', one whose value has been completely annulled by its own actions and its refusal to submit to the function assigned to it. It is not so much an individual as an emblem of family honor. Her father reprimands her for her actions, worried that her family honor will be irreparably tarnished by the daughter she had already transferred to another man. His main concern is the imminent marriage of Vaidehi's younger sister, a much less likely possibility with an older daughter divorced in the same house. He tells her without hesitation that she must return to the man she legally belongs to, no matter how violent and sadistic he may be. It imposes on her the old adage that "the honor of every home is in the hands of her daughter." Silently and thoughtfully, she responds: "Yes, the honor of each home is in the hands of her daughter, but there is no honor for the daughter herself."
