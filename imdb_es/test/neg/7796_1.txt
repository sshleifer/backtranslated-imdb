Think about the most unworthy movie theme you can and this is 10 times worse. A woman needs to complete as many crossword puzzles as she can in one day. We do not even get to see the questions and think of the words on our own, we only see their struggle. The woman seems so anxious and hurried to do the crosswords, but for some reason she spends her time absentmindedly walking around the city when she could be concentrating on her house. The acting is horrible, the actress snorts and tries to think of the words, and we are completely in the dark. The landscape of New York is pleasant, but the film depends too much on it and ages quickly. The film is presented as a rejected student film from the University of New York. This film has no redeeming qualities and I do not recommend it to anyone, ever.
