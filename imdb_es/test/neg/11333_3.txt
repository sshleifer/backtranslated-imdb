I do not understand why someone would allow a subparatic director to put nonsense like this on celluloid. This film has already been made at least two other times that were better than this ("Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - 1941, and "Heaven Can Wait" - 1978). The only saving factor for figure skating fans could have been a good ice skating done by a professional cast of skaters, but this just does not happen. The closest thing the public sees to a good skating is when the character of Tara Lipinski turns the ice for a moment. Others like Nancy Kerrigan and Elvis Stojko are hidden in the background and do not do figure skating at all. It does not show much real emotion, and there's really no reason to tune into this obviously made-for-television movie. My advice: rent the original.
