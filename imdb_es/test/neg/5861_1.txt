* Spoilers ahead, but that should not matter since I hope you do not see this one anyway. <br /> <br /> If you planned to see this one, I strongly advise you not to do it. Because it was one of the most wasted 1Â½ hours I've experienced. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a complete scam of the great movie "Battle Royale". It's as stupid as watching any American television show like "Cops" or "Candid Camera." <br /> <br /> The plot is totally predictable. A challenger is pregnant and another is a nurse, anyone who thinks logically understands at first what should happen between them. <br /> <br /> The concept has been ripped apart as mentioned above and the film lacks the violence necessary to make this film enjoyable. I mean, the preggo shoots a guy in the back and there's no blood, not even a trace of the blow to the back. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever without finding anything good, so take your money. and get a copy of Battle Royale instead of seeing this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, too bad I could not rate it lower. It almost makes Scream 3 a masterpiece.
