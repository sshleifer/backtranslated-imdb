My friends and I watched this movie last night. It was pretty amazing. Anyway, this was probably the worst movie I've seen. At first, it was tolerable. It reeked of BAD IMPROV but it was quite funny, even though the scenes were too long and long and the quality terrible (I read the $ 400 budget above ... sounds good) of the film itself. <br /> <br /> the biggest problem came from the lack of a script; With a background in improvisation, I know how difficult it can be to keep the scenes short and efficient. What happened in this movie was that the actors stayed to improvise the scenes and did not know when to stop, they just continued for years on stupid subjects. At the beginning I thought that this was because the film was short and they needed long and useless scenes to realize it. As the movie progressed, I realized that it was a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> There were many parts where I could see that the filmmaker had a very good idea for a shot, but not the resources (or talent ??) to carry it out effectively. A lot of the scenes were taken from a single shot (because, you know, improvisation) during what seemed like a really long time. very boring! If you can endure an hour and a half of terrible improvisation, look at it. It's very funny in some places, but it's also really stupid and annoying. The acting varies from good to absolutely terrible. It seemed that the only good parts were the parts that really had nothing to do with the main plot; the hairy guy who swore a lot, the barbershop, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> but yes. painfully bad. Like, I was literally hurt. After about an hour, my friends and I got bored and left.
