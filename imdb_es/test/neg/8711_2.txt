The only reason I give a second star is for the first half of the movie. This was a good version of the story. I enjoy seeing some fictional characters added to add color to a well-known story. But the second half was horrible! Yes, there were violent aspects of this story. But the writers of this film chose to include only violence and forget about the good things that God did for the Israelites. By the end of the movie, Scott seemed to be receiving messages from the giant big head instead of talking and listening to God. This interpretation had some HUGE problems with the deviation of the Scriptures. And great surprise, there are no favorable deviations! His depiction of Moses as this mad lunatic who did all this against his will is totally false. He showed a Moses who had to shout for God to speak to him. INCORRECT Scripture says that God spoke to Moses all the time and not just after a tantrum. They complained about complaining about the people, but they could not prove that God spoke to Moses on Sinai with an audible voice that the followers could hear and believe (Chapter 19). They also forgot the pillar of fire and the clouds that guided them in the day and night. <br /> <br /> What was it all Joshua? The righteous and peace-loving Jew who would not fight until Moses threatens him? INCORRECT (he was known as a great warrior) What about the great speech that Moses gave the army and told them that God had helped them enough and now they were alone? INCORRECT (They only won with the help of God as shown in their own scenes with Moses raising his staff) And what was that ark of the Covenant looking pitiful? Instead of superimposing it with gold, this film had a tight budget and put little gold chips in it! Oh, yes, it was a "molten calf", not a straw one with small chips stuck together. Someone forgot that they left Egypt with a large amount of gold tribute from the Egyptians. By the way, the part of them that kill the Israelites after the incident of the golden calf says "men" and does not mention to women and children that the film Enchanted to show the spectators. Oh yes, the manna was not the only thing sent from heaven, do not forget the birds for the meat. In addition, the Bible mentions that Jethro brought Moses to his wife and children and then says that Jethro returned to his own land. It does not say that Moses abandoned his family. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, if you do not know anything about the real story, read Exodus for yourself. If you know the real story, you will hate this version.
