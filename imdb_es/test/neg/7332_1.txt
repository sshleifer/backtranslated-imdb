This boy is a real job. An angry and immature child in the body of an adult man, loaded with all the charisma of a rock, goes to places that most people would only want to visit and does everything possible to be as miserable as possible. Give this job to someone who really appreciates it. <br /> <br /> I could read an endless list of all the stupid things this guy does in his "episodes", although I will only highlight the worst: Crete. While the locals are putting picnics by the sea in their "honor", this clown has the nerve to act like a petulant, spoiled child. He complains about everything, including the fashion sense of the people who live there. What an imbecile. <br /> <br /> When he went to Sweden, he spent at least five minutes pretending disbelief with a group of chefs (who probably had better things to do than talking to some American fool, like work) because they did not think that Abba it was horrible. Everywhere he went, he raised Abba. This is the kind of conversation I would hear from 13 year olds who watch too much MTV. <br /> <br /> When I was in New Orleans, I was disgusted that a certain restaurant had chips that taste better than Su, so he "accidentally" spilled some wine on them to ruin them. What a strange and emotionally unstable person. <br /> <br /> Worst of all are his clumsy voice-overs, where he tries in vain to add some kind of perspective on a situation that was too thick and ignorant to appreciate. . Try to use all these "big" words to make him look like an author, but in reality it's just a pretentious trick whose lack of conscience has convinced him he has something to say. That, by the way, is probably the only good thing about this prankster's television show. This shows that no matter how inept you are, as long as you take it seriously enough, the world will too. <br /> <br /> Then there's the way you talk to local guides whose English is obviously only. rudimentary. He will use the vocabulary that any writer, as he thinks he is, would instinctively know that these people probably will not understand. Does he care? No. Self-importance imbeciles like this Bourdain clown does not use language to communicate; they use it to look important. <br /> <br /> The review of Mcg13jthm on this same page is a perfect example of the kind of mind that Bourdain attracts: that of a low-IQ social misfit. Observe how the critic attempts to justify Bourdain's sociopathic nature with childish and naive excuses that make little sense. "Bourdain can complain, but he goes through 'a lot' and, not only that, he was 'forced' to make this show, but he's trying to redeem himself." A dolt attracts dolts, and reading the review of Mcg13jthm should let you know perfectly if you are the kind of person who would enjoy this useless and useless show. <br /> <br /> Finally, to add a bit of "fairness" to my tirade, I admit that Bourdain would have been momentarily amusing if I had met him in a bar. But as a television presenter of a travel program whose purpose is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures, Bourdain is a miserable failure, abject, desperate, gloomy and depressing. <br /> <br /> A failure.
