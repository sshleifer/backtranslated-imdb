I hate being too critical, but this really was bad. I like the Baldwin brothers, I just wish there were more talent distributed evenly among them. I liked the general plot, but there was too much "intent" and not enough "to do" in terms of acting quality. <br /> <br /> My favorite character of all was the bald cop. It reminded me of Dmitri Valtane (Jeremy Roberts, I think) of Start Trek 6: Undiscovered country. Alone, without the hair. <br /> <br /> If you have the Hollywood Video MVP program and you are really trying to get your money's worth, then through one of the three MVP movies you choose. It's worth it for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> The most impressive special effect in the entire show is the sound of Stephen Baldwin's rifle shot. I guess that leaves you in a moment the quality and emotion of the rest of the show.
