If possible, try to see the five films of the Universal "Mummy" in order, not so much because of the continuity between the films, but because of the obvious lack of them. Of course, it goes without saying that Boris Karloff's original classic, "The Mummy", should not even be mentioned in the same breath as the so-called "sequels", all of which is presented as an accent or cult. <br /> <br /> This time, it was revealed that the mummified remains of Princess Ananka have been directed to the United States. And once again, while your eyes deceive you, Kharis, the mummy, did not really die for the second time in "The Tomb of the Mummy", but is alive and in search of his lost love, Princess Ananka, with the help of the rhetorical nine sheets of Tana. Made during the full moon cycle. To complete the mythology, Kharis needs a caretaker, skillfully occupied by an emaciated John Carradine like Yousef Bey, in charge of the task by Andoheb of George Zucco, high priest of Arkan. <br /> <br /> Kharis and Ananka must be returned to their final resting place in the Arkan Hills in Egypt. But as we have seen before, trusting in the duty of a high priest is a sure bet to end in failure, with the character of Carradine in love with the reincarnation of Ananka, Amina Monsouri (Ramsay Ames). It's shocking to see Yousef Bey and the bandaged band PO come to beat the beautiful Amina. <br /> <br /> Guess this: in both "Tomb" and "Curse", Lon Chaney portrays the Mummy with an inert right arm bent without being able to do anything on his chest. When he meets the fainted Amina, he lifts her in both arms without any problem; As soon as he lowers it, his right arm returns to its crippled position once again. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is very remarkable: the monster stays with the girl! But it is a short-lived victory, since the mummy and her kidnapped girlfriend succumb to a swampy grave, an ancient Egyptian curse is fulfilled: "The fate of those who defy the will of the ancient gods will be a cruel and violent death."
