I was very disappointed in this movie. The director has shown some talent in his other efforts, but this simply seems to be a filling. There may have been a deep meaning behind this, but it seems to me that it is nothing more than a director who has access to some toys. <br /> <br /> I would recommend your other jobs to people, but it certainly is not this. one. While I watched him, I kept thinking that he would recover after a slow initial period, but never did. At the end of the film I did not entertain or move or think about things in a new way. I could only say to myself: "What was that?" <br /> <br /> There were some really amazing parts of the movie, but not enough to justify being seated again.
