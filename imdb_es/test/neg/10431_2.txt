Busy, maybe that should have been the title. Bad dialogue delivered at the snail's pace. All characters are a single dimension with the exception of one. Unfortunately, that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this two-hour drag with clich√©s. Having grown up in the seventies, this film seriously lacks details, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by Kelsey Grammar, someone who should recognize a sharp dialogue and a coherent narrative in a script. Cameron Richardson is the only element that illuminates this film. The music of Robin Trower is also a welcome addition.
