Lowe returns to the nest after another failed relationship, to find that he has been assigned to the jury service. It is in the plans to, somehow, get out of that, when he realizes that the accused is the girl he has been in love with since the first grade. <br /> <br /> Through life in the past, telling other people about their feelings for this girl (played by Camp), Lowe remembers those feelings and does everything in his power to clear the Camp of attempted murder, while away from the real bad guys at the same time, and manages to create a hit movie at the same time. <br /> <br /> I have heard that San Agustin is the oldest city in the USA. UU., And I also know that it has some ties with Ponce de Le√≥n, so the fund is a good place to start. Unfortunately, it's the only good thing about this movie. The local police are inept, the judge is an idiot, and the defense attorney does everything in his power to look like Joanie Cunningham! I do not know whether to blame the director for the bad direction, or simply for letting the cast make such an unfortunate effort. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was so boring, I could not even sleep. that! 1 out of 10 stars!
