This series and Elon Gold were being HYPED as "the next big thing" in NBC sitcoms. Well, they were not. Dennis Farina was terribly misinformed like the father-in-law. It just seemed so uncomfortable and out of place here. The term, 'private time' convo '! " It was supposed to become the "Dyno-mite!" slogan of the 21st century. Well, it was not like that. People asked then, as it is still today (when his name appears), "Who the hell is Elon Gold?" I saw it in an episode of "The Mentalist" tonight. I mentioned his name and my girlfriend asked: "Who?" It's not fun Total waste of airtime. NBC had high hopes for this show, but it just fell apart.
