1st viewed 7/19/2003 - 1 of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): ridiculously lax 3D movie that follows practically the plots of many 80s teen movies. Stupid kids go to a known killer camp site, they are hunted by an unknown masked man, and then we try to find out who, if anyone, will live. We really do not care who is behind the mask, but even that is not hard to figure out if you've seen any of these types of movies. What a waste of a 3D viewer despite the somewhat decent 3D effects.
