I had also waited a long time to see this movie. As far as I know, it has never been released in Australia, so in the end I found a copy on the network and ordered it through it. Weeks after the confirmation of my order, it finally arrived and I was extremely excited to be sitting in front of my TV, ready to watch a movie that seemed very interesting and controversial and filmed in an area of ​​the world where there are so many good movies. What a disappointment. In the first few minutes, I realized that I had ordered a B grader, but it was still full of expectations. I convinced my son (18) to watch it with me when I love sharing when I find a movie of value with good underlying statements and / or story lines. Halfway up he got up and said he could not keep seeing him, he was very predictable and amateur. I agreed but I looked until the end. The acting was atrocious even by B Grade standards. The stereotype is also predictable and I feel for the good people of Lake Arthur, Louisianna, who must have shrunk after seeing the movie that describes them that way. No doubt, there are still some racial prejudices in many parts of the world, not only in the United States, but in reality, today, I doubt they will get away with all the ridiculous alibis. I had to verify the date on which the film was made, since his attempts to film the most frightening scenes was something he would expect from a high school student's first attempt to make a film like "indy". I would like to see this film put into the hands of experienced screenwriters and filmmakers, it is an old story but it could still strike a blow if it were dealt with professionally. So disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations. The soundtrack was probably the only thing I enjoyed.
