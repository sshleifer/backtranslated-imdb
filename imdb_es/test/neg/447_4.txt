Honestly, I can not believe this is a continuation or continuation of John Landis' classic comedy horror film of 1981. I guess you can not really describe it as an original werewolf movie, since the bones of the story steal elements of the London game: an American tourist visits a famous European capital, survives for a bit of a werewolf attack that kills a colleague, embarks (Forgive the pun) in a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession, turns into a werewolf, is visited by the apparitions of his dead victims, etc. And reading the previous line, I just discovered how much history has in common with the original that seems very similar. The difference lies in how nice and entertaining the Landis film is. <br /> <br /> With this Paris-based film, there are no scenes that really stand out. There is not a naked man who wakes up in a zoo wondering how he will return home without money or clothes, there is a strange dream sequence of Nazi wolves and there is no spectacular climax. AAWIP tries to be fun, but is there anything more shameful than failed humor? I'm thinking about the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone that he has chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two films is that there is no commotion involved with this dubious follow-up. You really feel sorry for the fate and dilemma of the protagonist in the London film, here you simply feel that Andy is nothing more than an encryption that reviews the literary movements of a script. There are also a lot of visible screen holes. Is this the first time that the Lunar Club carries out a massacre? If not, has not a large number of corpses been reported with their hearts ripped out in the world press? Why the police do not have clues? <br /> <br /> Everyone else has mentioned it and so have I. The images are bad. Look at the bungee jumping scene in The Eifell Tower, it is painfully obvious that it is achieved through a blue screen projection while the transformation of the werewolf is done through a very cartoonish CGI. I will not put Anthony Waller in the same support as Stephen Sommers as director who totally ruins a movie due to an overconfidence in CGI. Classic movie of 1981) but would have preferred the Rick Baker-type special effects used for the transformation. To be fair, it is reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget has not gone that far. But at the end of the day, this is a pretty bad horror movie that was not necessary to do and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment
