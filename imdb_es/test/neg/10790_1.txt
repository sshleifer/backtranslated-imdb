This film, although well filmed and superbly acted, was horrible. I felt like I was watching a car accident, I'm sure I kept watching but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely disjointed, and the end was abysmal. Although, if it matched the tone of the film, I expected something to improve this movie. I still do not understand what are the references to rage and the child that the fox bit at the beginning of the movie. Fifteen minutes of plot that really did not do much. It's really sad to see a movie with good actors and a beautiful set wasted in such a horrible story. There is not much more to say about this movie. Save your time and watch c-span. It will be more edifying.
