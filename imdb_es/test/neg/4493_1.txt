The action scenes were pretty good. But in the plot of the film, I would have to give it a score of 1 out of 10. Does it seem that the producers and the director of this film did not think carefully? <br /> <br /> It's not like that. It gives much value and values ​​to its viewers, except for its violence. The whole story was about revenge. A child witnessing a rape and murder. I would even recommend it to be prohibited. Those who saw it, you just lost some money. If you are thinking about seeing it, look at something else. I would ask for a refund if I was at a movie theater. So for you and girls who are reading this article. Please do not waste your time.
