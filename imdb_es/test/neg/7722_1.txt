This is one of the most horrible movies I've had the misfortune to choose. Do not get me wrong, I love a good zombie movie, but this was not one of them. <br /> <br /> ... It could also (at least from the initial scenes) be called 'Titty Zombies from outer space'. I had absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or the video game (from what I could see). <br /> <br /> The best aspect of the film is how the two main characters can cover themselves with so much blood. and remain so baffled. No doubt, I would suggest giving it up and failing and staying with a safer zombie complainer like '28 Days Later 'or' Dawn of the Living Dead '(the remake, of course, unless I'm involved in a serious action).
