I must admit that I was cheated by the title and the summary on the back of the box. So I put it in the vcr and I kept waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting for something good to happen. But of course, it never does. The creators of this movie must be tied to a chair and watch "Saving Private Ryan." Maybe they learn something.
