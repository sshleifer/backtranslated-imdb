Hillary Swank is an unattractive job in this unattractive job of a movie. Pat Morita, desperate for work, any kind of work, agreed to repeat her role as "Karate teacher" and bring her Karate brand to the silver screen once more, except this time, Hillary "skank" Swank is the student. <Br /> <br /> I can see the Hollywood writers excited about the idea that a "tormented and spoiled" woman assume the role of Ralph. The film does not work on any level and is boring at all levels. There is nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for someone to retain it. The film was made without thinking about making money because it is very bad. <br /> <br /> I would gladly spit out all the actors in this movie for having been involved with her and having the writers on the blacklist for her miserable and insulting efforts.
