The people who came up with this are SICK AND ILL. How the hell can you exploit people like that? By fooling people into thinking that this is real? I probably do not doubt that it is ... I saw this for the first time today in the series 7 and it made me feel sick to my stomach that I almost vomited. I just could not stop crying for these poor people and if that woman really had that baby, ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ I have a 4 month old daughter and it is absolutely scary that I would put a pregnant woman "really" in BOTH DANGER FRICKEN! You are bloody ANIMALS and you should be locked in for life allowing something like this to be put on television. If this so-called "reality show" is for real, then why is no one jailed for letting people die and not doing a damn thing about it? YOU DESERVE THAT IT BE FRIGGEN HUNTED DOWN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
