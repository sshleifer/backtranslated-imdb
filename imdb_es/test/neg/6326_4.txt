I just have to comment on this movie because I gave it a rating of 4, and in my opinion that's pretty high for a softporn smut movie. The real plot is a bit hokey (who would expect the opposite) but Hafron is incredibly funny, and offers everything with a cybernetic voice, making it easy for him. Whoever wrote the script definitely had some ingenuity! I must have laughed out loud ten times, and that's not a reason why someone buys this movie. The only softporn movie I've seen that has any other merit other than beautiful women (and believe me, Emmanuelle is absolutely beautiful ... just look at the cover!) <br /> <br /> Any movie that can entertain me considering what poor that was the plot and how bad the performance is, also considering that the film was not made to entertain artistically, so to speak, has at least four in my book. I mean, who would not look at this before stopping? Or will my mom shoot?
