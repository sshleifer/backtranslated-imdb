It is clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line directed by the characters. But immediately the story line makes you not like the new main characters. The overflight of the island and the dinosaurs below had no impact and almost seemed like a caricature. The entrance of all the action to the island is simply a repetition of parts of JP 1 and 2. The story line is predictable to the point of discomfort and its totally unsatisfactory ending made me feel cheated. This gave me another option than to award the movie 3/10!
