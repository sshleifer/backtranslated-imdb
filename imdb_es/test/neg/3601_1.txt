This is the worst waste of time I have experienced. Not even close to the first one. The plot line is difficult to follow: the plot was weak, at best. Everything seemed like three stories that tried to unite them and make a movie. He had some good lines here and there, and the attempt at the message was admirable, but they left Houston for New York to get to Dallas. It was really difficult to know in what period of time the present time took us. The film lasted just over an hour and it seemed we had sat there watching the movie all afternoon. There may be points for being honest, but a son should not have to do everything Kronk felt he had to do. Do yourself a favor: look at Kuzco again.
