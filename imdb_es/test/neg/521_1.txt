Bored, ridiculous and stupid "Submerged" is a waste of time. The shootouts were a joke, real people do not stand out in the open without any cover, hoping to get shot first! So many bad or bad things that are not worth the effort of listing, except one major flaw. At 500 mph for 20 minutes = approximately 166 miles west of L.A. and the water has a depth of 100 feet. Even so, none of the people would have survived the decompression if they were subjected to a water pressure of 100 feet for more than 20 hours when they were raised. Only a horrible one.
