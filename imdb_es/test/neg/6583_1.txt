Like Final Fantasy, if you look at a still picture, it does not look that bad. But when people start moving, it's absolutely horrible. The uneven and spasmodic movements, the terrifying lack of emotion and the lack of a feeling of life on my face give me chills. The characters do not even appear LIVE / organic. <br /> <br /> I saw a preview with my daughter, who fell asleep! She was not totally committed. For the record, I thought he would easily get involved with both the Pixar-esque movies and some of the "bad" 2D movies like Sinbad. <br /> <br /> The lighting is painful, giving children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin in a bonfire. Lip synchronization is bad, worse actually than in Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> I also seriously question Hanks playing five characters ... this was a great distraction during the movie. The role of the driver is disturbing, although in a way I can not identify it. It reminds me of my father's fake "phone" voice when he greets customers. <br /> <br /> I think this is the reason why the multiple roles distract: you are aware that the voice is the same, but still it is very different. It gives each character the feeling of being ACTED, instead of being true human characters. The illusion of reality is broken by the multiple role plays of Hanks. I've seen how the technique works, to Eddie Murphy, but Hanks can not come close to doing it with just one voice, given the horrible animation. <br /> <br /> I would not spend my money on that. this - wait for the rent.
