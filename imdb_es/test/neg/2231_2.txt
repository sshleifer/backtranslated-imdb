I rented this movie, knowing it would be bad (I've only seen a good Disney sequel and that was Toy Story 2), but it was much lower than I expected. I'm a fan of die hard disney and I do not believe in the aftermath of disney movies. For someone who did not grow up with the classics (either observing them when they left or renting them since you were born) is a beautiful story. I just feel that the plot crawled a bit too much, and it was predictable. What bothered me most were the voices of the lady and vagabond girls. They were too sharp. Although most reviews say it's not that bad, I think if you're a true Disney fan, you should not waste your time with it. <br /> <br /> Let's hope Disney does not do anything. More sequels of any of the other classics soon.
