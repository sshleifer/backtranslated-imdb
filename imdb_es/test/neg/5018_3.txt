It is not a bad concept. I just wish they had taken it in another direction. It's a movie that tries to be interesting, surprising you with bestiality to begin with, which works for most people (people with a stomach stomach). But besides this, there is not much in this movie. It's not funny or romantic, so, please, have someone change that label, and since I knew that bestiality is legal in most places and a million-dollar industry, it really did not surprise me. But most people do not know and I thought that the way the movie evolved after the secret came out was simply disappointing because it could have been one of those shocking, eye-opening movies that would teach the ignorant about of a fetish that is a reality for everyone. (yes, I did my homework) hundreds of thousands of people. So, if you like to watch bad movies that you can daydream about how you could improve them while you watch them, then have fun doing it.
