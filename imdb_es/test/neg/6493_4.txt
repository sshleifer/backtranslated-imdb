This is a very mediocre movie by Jackie Chan and one of his worst James Glickenhaus ruined it. I guess all the characters are decent, but the story is like that, however, Jackie Chan is still amazing in this, even if he looked bored. Jackie and Danny Aiello had a zero chemistry together, and it was very boring many times, however, the end was above average and it was quite entertaining, and had some good stunts! I have not yet seen the Hong Kong version, however, I am sure it is better that this fails, besides, the turn is very predictable! He really has no life and is insipid, and I do not blame Jackie for not looking happy with this, and if he did not star in this, it would have been unbearable and completely impossible to see. The inauguration is supposed to be memorable, but it's nothing I have not seen before and had a better performance, and I thought the whole movie was pretty lazy and it could have been an incredible movie if Jackie had control of it. Also, it really did not take root for any of the characters. This is a very mediocre movie by Jackie Chan, and one of his worst James Glickenhaus ruined it, not recommended even for Die hard Jackie Chan fans. The address is terrible! James Glickenhaus does a terrible job here, with an extremely soft camera work, bad angles and keeping the film boring for the most part. Acting is like that. Jackie Chan is INCREDIBLE as always, however, he is not his usual energy person, and he seems bored and said goodbye to the whole film, he did not have chemistry with Danny Aiello, and I do not blame him either! (Jackie's rules !!!!!). Danny Aiello is fine here, as Jackie's partner, but his character is a bit silly, and he had no chemistry with Jackie, he did well, I guess. Roy Chiao is decent as the main villain, but he was just going through the moves and it was not that threatening, but it's still great. The rest of the cast is average at best. In general it is not worth your time or money. * 1/2 of 5
