It is the only thing without grace that I have ever seen. It's sad that he tries so hard to make a good joke and all he does is curse and thinks his disgusting vulgarity is funny. He is the most bitter person I have ever seen. In all his act, he's trying to show how much he cares, and that's why he only shows how angry he is with critics and people with some taste and sense of humor who prefer to go through immense torture than going to see his " show". There are good comedians, there are bad and there are horrible. But this boy is in a league of his own. I am sorry for him and even more for the people who find him funny.
