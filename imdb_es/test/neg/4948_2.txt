This is a terrible movie. Angie Dickenson is a class act and she is always doing well, but she does not have many papers and she must have needed some money to make this film. By the way, she is on the screen less than 10 minutes. Oooh, wait, there's a redeeming feature in this movie: Meg Foster has a small part in this movie. Now, Meg has been on the screen for 35 years and is not particularly good, but she has the most terrifying eyes of any actress she has ever seen. By name, you probably do not know her, but one look at her eyes and you will recognize her. To summarize: the acting is horrible, the story bad, and even the filmography is terrible. A screen that goes black every time the director wants to change the scene is pretty silly. Look at anything other than this, even Mr. Ed repeats!
