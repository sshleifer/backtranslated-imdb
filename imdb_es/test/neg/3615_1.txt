Now we know where they got the idea of ​​Snakes on a plane. To put it bluntly, do not pay to see this movie. If you really want to lose 90 minutes of your life, then wire it or get it for free from NetFlix or Blockbuster. Do not pay to rent this. If you pay to rent this, then you are a stupid individual. The acting was horrible, the plot was horrible, everything was horrible, except the snakes. If they were real or generated by CGI, they looked pretty good. But with that said, even this movie has to be one of the worst movies I've seen. Even the nude dance scene was pretty bad and I got ahead of that. You do not feel, I did not warn you.
