Really I wanted to like this movie because I have admiration for Italian cinema scam (especially for scams Jaws!), But the fact is that the Monster Shark is not very good. All the signs of this being a big piece of garbage are there; we have one of the kings of shoddy cult cinema, Lamberto Bava, in the chair of the director, one of the best ridiculous cult actors, Michael Sopkiw, who assumes the lead role and a central creature stupid enough to give best of all, this type of film has to offer a run for their money, but somehow, the movie still manages to be quite old. The fact that the 'monster shark' does not appear very often is probably a good thing given the design of the creature, but there is never enough elsewhere to make the movie without him. The plot focuses on a resort on the south coast of Florida (or rather, somewhere in Italy) where several local people have appeared in the water without arms or legs. It is not long before local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before, and depends on a diverse group of several experts in the sea to catch him alive! <br /> <br /> The main problem with this film is that it always feels very useless, and as there is little development of characters or plots, even the least demanding viewers will probably start to get bored in a short time. . This type of film is not famous for being brilliant, although the funny element of films like 'The Last Shark' and 'Killer Fish' is unfortunately absent during most of the execution time. What I love about the main actor Michael Sopkiw is that he always seems to be taking himself seriously, no matter what movie he is in (even if he has only made four). This is certainly the case here, although Bava never really allows him to fully immerse himself, and he often feels as much like a spare tire as the rest of the movie. Much of the execution time is devoted to seeing the various characters of the American lager, and it is not very fascinating; although Bava manages to reach the end well with an entertaining action movement when the central monster finally manages to wreak havoc on its possible captors. In general, there is not much to recommend this movie. As I mentioned, I really like this kind of thing and I even got bored on numerous occasions. Only for fans of the Italian horror!
