A desperate attempt to make a sci-fi thriller "noir", but the film falls short. It does not have a credible plot, some of the key players were a joke (NO Lars Bom, it's great!). I liked the "access restriction by maximizing bandwidth". I finished it on principle, but I went home with the feeling of having lost two hours of my life ...
