wow, I just saw one. <br /> <br /> How is the production of CRAPPY in this movie. <br /> <br /> No kidding, I could literally have done it better. <br /> <br /> ALL the postproduction is defective, everything. Whoever has cut this movie must be excluded from the film industry. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the script was a disaster. absolute rubish. <br /> <br /> Not to mention Jack Bauer and his Patchy the Pirate with SpongeBob accent. WTF is your character doing there? But for me, the biggest flaw of all was the development of the character, the interaction, the dynamics, the dialogue. WOW. I can not believe how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 out of 10. 1 for Samantha, who is a great actress. Pity that the production has made everyone look like amateurs out there. <Br /> <br /> the other 1 goes to the cinematography, which was really good. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, my friend, this is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I do not. I even want to make an elaborate post about this, it was just a horrible production. Poor actors, they did not know what they were getting into ...
