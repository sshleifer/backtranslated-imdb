Seen a few months ago on Netflix Instant and I left a review there. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that most of the other reviews are very accurate. This movie was about bad writing, bad acting and bad direction. I also liked Russell and Pare "in the old days" and had high hopes for them. In my Netflix review, I mentioned that I lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich, but still watching the movie from the kitchen. When I returned to the living room, I was very confused when the last 5 minutes of the movie developed. I even rewound it to make sure I was not missing anything. This movie is totally crazy about how to make a "spin" ending. I suspect that the idea sounded good, maybe the script was intriguing, but the budget was so non-existent that sets were missing. And yes, I guess all those "bad sets" were an effort to give the viewer a clue. Everything he told me was "low budget". <br /> <br /> Anyway, the reason I came here was because during the weekend I saw a review of Shutter Island, and with what the reviewers said or did not say, lead me to believe that Shutter Island It's the same deal, only with a budget of 50 to 60 times more! (Actually I have no idea how much the Dark World will cost, but I HOPE they have not spent more than 1 million!) <br /> <br /> Then, having said that, I thought that if someone were to rewrite the script a little , they got a bigger budget for a better "look" (whether that means a better stage designer, or a better subsequent color, only someone with a vision) that could make Dark World an acceptable product. Now it seems that Shutter Island is doing that. It seems that they have the correct vision, but the scripts could still be disabled. Money can not buy everything, but it should be in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> PS My 2-star rating is for Russell and Pare.
