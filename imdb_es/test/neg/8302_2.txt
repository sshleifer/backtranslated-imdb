Okay, anyone who wants to see a great work of art should NOT watch this movie. A sophisticated film expert will no doubt feel dizzy from the horrible values ​​of production and the vision of seeing an excellent actor (Joseph Cotten) prostitute himself for a dollar. Mr. Cotten must have really needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the movie was crap. The same phenomenon happened with Dana Andrews, who at the end of her career appeared in the countryside and the horrible FROZEN DEATH. I know Mr. Andrews was overwhelmed by alcoholism, but why did Cotten make this mess ?! <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it is a reworking of the Frankenstein plot. The first half of the movie really seemed like they were doing a serious version but with serious flaws in Frankenstein's original story. Then, inexplicably, they introduced a daughter. This was not a bad thing, ... until then, out of nowhere, they decided to stop making a horror movie but make a soft core pornographic film. The change was dramatic and strange. It was almost as if they said "it's okay, Mr. Cotten has finished with his scenes and has gone home ... now, ladies, ... STRIP!". <br /> <br /> The problem is that in all levels, the movie is horrible, except for the monster's makeup. While it's not great, it's still very good to see. But poor writing, acting and a budget of $ 17.46 conspired to make this a monotonous and horrible movie, one so bad that throwing some nudity at perverts should not be enough to attract anyone to see it.
