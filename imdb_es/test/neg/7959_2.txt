I'm a big fan of Deepa Mehta's work, especially Fire and Earth 1947. Unfortunately, this movie of his does not have everything you need for a good movie. <br /> <br /> The film tries to show the plight of widows in India at the beginning of the 20th century and the new wave of ideas of their rehabilitation at about the same time. Shown with a child widow as a central character, although the plot is too banal from an Indian point of view, it could still have been a very powerful film. Oh! The film lacked both the sensitivity of Fire and the intensity of emotion on Earth in 1947. <br /> <br /> Even if history is supposed to be a fact, although there are hundreds of things that I would have liked different in that as well, the making of films is especially unfortunate. All is said. Everything is shown straight. Absence of sensitive implicit sentences. Absence of things left without saying. I just could not believe it was a Deepa Mehta movie. <br /> <br /> There were some characters from the very standard Hindi movie, like a widow with their own vested interests, or a father who has double the norm. of the highest quality. Can not you write a script without having these characters from old-style Indian movies? <br /> <br /> Many people cheered Deepa for making a movie and proving a point against Hindu fundamentalists. Well, I agree that it took a bold step, but should not one worry about the quality of the film, or is a controversial issue an end in itself? It is obvious that if you start with a story like in Water, you will end up feeling the pain of the widows in consideration, you do not need a director to achieve it. And the movie had nothing more than that! So, where is Deepa's contribution to the movie? <br /> <br /> And talk about acting, etc. - pathetic! Lisa Ray has a pretty face, an extremely pretty face, but that's where it ends. She can not speak Hindi; she can not emote John Abraham is not better. Most widows seem unnatural. The saviors are Seema Biswas and the young woman. Are fabulous. <br /> <br /> And this was a period movie, but the Hindi dialogues suck big time. Even there, the expression is as unnatural as it can be. There are no rustic accents !!! There are no local slangs. No, nothing. The only correct thing was probably the shooting sites. I thought that the vidhwa-ashram set was reasonably real. The overall blue tone throughout the film is also appropriate. <br /> <br /> But in general, do not watch this movie. You are not going to get anything. There is nothing in the story, or direction. If you have to see it, look at how the girl acts.
