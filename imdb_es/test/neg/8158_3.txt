I was hoping to see a more exploitative movie style, but unfortunately this turned out to be just a poorly made low-budget action movie that just does not have the talent for that. The story is about a very beautiful woman named Teri Marshall (Heather Thomas), whose boyfriend Rick (Jeffrey Combs) works for a secret agency and has invented a bulletproof motorcycle and can fire lasers and rockets, and has a helmet that can shoot them. as well. The head of the Bosarian agency (Martin Landau) has made a $ 5 million deal to sell it and sends two hired thugs to kill Rick and Teri and pick up the bicycle. A tall blond guy named Rolf (Dar Robinson) and his partner Hanna (Dawn Wildsmith) manage to kill Rick, but Teri survives. While at home, discover a videotape that Rick left describing his invention that helps Teri in what he should do next. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Teri is being chased by several agents and she is caught and tortured, but she does not talk about where she needs a motorcycle part, but receives the help of a federal agent called Waters (Martine Beswick), where they end up using the motorcycle. for a bloody shooting. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Fred Olen Ray, who has made his career making very low-budget exploitation films, but he made a serious mistake by leaving aside the aspect of exploitation. And trying to make an action movie. Apart from a quick shower scene at the beginning, there are no nudes and the usual excitement that viewers are accustomed to seeing in a Ray movie is nowhere to be found. I do not think anyone expected Thomas to undress, but she does not wear a sexy outfit. It's not that she stopped me from looking at her with her eyes closed in those tight jeans and admiring her almost perfect shape, but Ray really spoiled it in this case. Like all his films, the cast is fun to watch and many familiar faces have roles like Robert Quarry, Huntz Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr., Michael Reagan and Russ Tamblyn. Stuntman Dar Robinson died shortly after it was made and it is his last acting effort and the film is dedicated to him. You have to ask yourself why Landau would waste his time with such garbage like this, but I was interested in the casting of Combs in a very strange romantic role. Is Thomas good in this movie? Who cares! I think she showed that she could have become a movie star "B" if she wanted to, but it never happened. Ray loses everyone's time with this effort, although the cast is fun to watch, but he left out the elements that make him a pleasant filmmaker.
