Let's see, cardboard characters like Muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to do some exotic drug testing on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped. You'll make sure you laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their just deserts! It turns out that drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another world ... the world of religious fantasy! - Complete with cardboard demons that seem to be made of Papier Mache. Everyone is dragged into Hell, except by a poor boy who goes to Heaven where presumably Eternity can pass with the block bosses who created this Masterpiece of the Absurd. I think I would opt for Hellfire myself. Go see something else, unless you're drugged, in which case, you might like it! I could not hurt!
