In all the episodes, I never saw any real action, drama or comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot is very repetitive. <br /> <br /> **** Someone has something old and then someone else tells them a bit about this and how much it is worth, who did it and where it came from and how much it could be sold and if some work was done. <br /> <br /> Sowhile, I've been watching 30 of these, I realized that ... there's no drama ... no one loses a limb or life or gets divorced or is hit by a car or an airplane. <br /> <br /> There are no car chases. or explosions, not even a horse race with old carriages. <br /> <br /> All those weapons and swords and nobody goes in a wave of violent murders ... what's the deal? No pshycos, no assassinations with axes, old Englishmen armed with firearms in bad suits ... just yap yap yap ... you have an old tea and wine set from Germany in 1602, blah, blah, blah. .. <br /> <br /> I'm still waiting for someone with a time machine to go to the screen and ask about that, but no ... it never becomes and the only thing that happens is that it's a bit clogged English or a woman cheats on something old that was sold in Boston or China during the Ming Dynasty: a big EFFIN business. <br /> <br /> Can no one kidnap one of the potential customers and ask for a ransom? Is not there any extraterrestrial ship that destroys the entire floor? Who the hell writes this as a series and expects us to stay awake? This is as entertaining as seeing the paint dry, just with comments. <br /> <br /> There is no sex, no comedy or romance, no action, no suspense, no action, no drama, no mystery or martial arts. <br /> <br /> This show sucks! What happened to the supermodels that use thongs and launch lasers from a futuristic weapon? Antiques Roadshow - More like grabbing a blanket and a pillow and going to sleep show ...
