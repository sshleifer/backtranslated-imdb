I really do not know where to start. Imagine a movie that is so bad in all aspects, from acting to accessories and history, that it angers you. This is one of the worst movies I've seen and it says a lot because I've seen some bad ones. When I saw this movie, I knew it was a sword stroke, but I thought that he hears that he has kung fu and vampires, a combination that I thought could not fail. That's until I put this in my DVD player. How Ron Hall managed to ruin something as great as vampires and martial arts surpasses me. First the acting. For starters, I did not expect much here because it is an action movie and a B in that, but the performance here is so bad that I could not help but feel annoyed. The expressions and the vocal tones were out of place, there was absolutely no emotion in almost the whole movie and when there was it was so laughable that I thought I was watching Mad TV. Master Kao who should never have been born in the first place. In general, I have seen better acting in elementary school games. Then there is the action. Not even below par compared to the things that have been done in action movies lately. but still, the action was not a total disappointment, since Ron Hall seems to possess some martial arts skills. but even the skill that it has is overcome by the stupid things that it does, for example, the part of the film in which it starts to turn and then the camera changes. I almost broke a pillow in half. And the scene of the fight where his prison mate fights against the vampires swinging his arms towards them. WOW.OR, what about the part in the jail where Derek suddenly knows magic and can perform songs that make tap water holy water? and where the props go The guns look like Walmart toys, the teeth were stolen from the Halloween costumes and the words can not describe how bad the CG graphics are. I could continue for hours on all the bad things with this movie and believe me, this is just the tip of the iceberg. It's just getting a 2 because it made me laugh. Although I was laughing at how bad the movie was, laughing is laughing. I would say stay away from murderous vampires unless you want to laugh at a horrible movie or are planning to be tortured for long periods of time and want to practice.
