Ed (Kel Mitchell) is a teenager who lives for his job at Good Burger, a small but friendly hamburger stand in the neighborhood, while his friend Dexter (Kennan Thompson) also works there, but lacks Ed's determined dedication to his work. He accidentally destroyed his teacher's car, Mr. Wheat (Sinbad) and has to raise money to pay for the damages. When Mondo Burger, a fast standing mammoth chain, opens across the street, it seems that Good Burger is history, until Ed formulates a secret sauce that brings hundreds of new customers to his door. However, Mondo Burger's monomaniacal manager, Kurt (Jan Schweiterman), is determined to get his hands on the sauce and put Good Burger out of business. Meanwhile, Ed and Dexter must rescue Otis (Abe Vigoda), the world's oldest fast food employee, from Demented Hills Asylum, and Ed could find love with Monique (Shar Jackson) if he could stop thinking about the burgers long enough to pay attention to her Good Burger is a comedy directed at children, decent history, acting and, in general, a fairly harmless children's movie.
