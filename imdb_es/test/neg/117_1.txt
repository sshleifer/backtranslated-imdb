This movie is a waste of time. I hope that from an action movie it has more than 2 explosions and some shots. Van Damme's performance is horrible. He was never a great actor, but here it is worse. It was definitely better in his previous films. The part of his script for the whole movie was probably just a stupid and meaningless page. All the dialogue in the film is a disaster, as is the argument. The title "The pastor" does not make sense. Why did not they just call it "border patrol"? The fight scenes could have been better, but either they could not afford it, or the fight choreographer suffered for lack of ideas. This is a kind of low and cheap action cinema.
