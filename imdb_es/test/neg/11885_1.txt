A dreadful movie, stupidly insane about corruption in the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to be corrupt and inept. A member of the English Department of the university can only sign his name with an X. <br /> <br /> When it seems that a Senator with laces (Victor Moore) comes to the state to investigate, they all try to blame the state . He is an innocent but foolish character of Bob Hope. <br /> <br /> Is it any wonder that Vera Zorina did not get the role of Maria in "Por qu√© toca el campanas?", 1943. <br /> <br /> Naturally, the corrupt officials together with Hope they try to show images of Zorina with Moore to ruin him politically. Moore marries the restaurant boss he had insulted when he ordered a ham sandwich. She thought the reason she was upset was because it was a kosher restaurant. This is the extent to which humor is the absolute mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> When Hope tries to defend herself in Congress, she takes off from James Stewart in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." By then, the movie is too far away for a good response. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics are absolutely terrible. That song that praises Louisiana, sung in various ways, is absolutely terrible. Irving Berlin had something to do with the music of this absolutely terrible movie?
