In fact, I saw THE EVIL on the big screen. I saw it as part of a double feature in the early 1980s (I do not remember the other movie) when I was in my teens. The movie is bad, bad of cringe. Shamefully bad. The effects are atrocious (you can clearly see the cable that pulls the black girl across the floor). There is absolutely nothing of fear in it. In fact, I laughed throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The story tried to create this great accumulation for the climax, when we are supposed to finally see who is responsible for all the evils that happen and we see the greasy Victor. Buono, who is as terrifying as an exaggerated Twinkie. Seriously, what were you thinking? Buono, who was a villain in the Batman television series, is one of the most incredible actors on the big screen, and I can not imagine anyone feeling terrified of him. <br /> <br /> The BAD is almost forgotten. Now (for good reasons) but it's actually a very funny movie and I wish I could see this turkey again, just to see that black girl being dragged across the room by an invisible force with that very visible cable.
