-SPOILERS ------------ I am a fan of French cinema of the 60s and 70s but not necessarily of the most modern, so, to be honest, I saw it for Bellucci. She is very young here, extremely beautiful and in addition to this, this film is supposed to be where she met with Cassel, so it gives her some additional importance. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a very nice style that reminds of DePalma. Then, suddenly, we jump to flashback, and the advance and retreat continues, which tires us. I do not mind a flash back, but do it and it ends with the man. Anyway, the movie is still interesting to me until the moment when the first A hole defined in the plot, which allows the rest of the story, never allows me to enjoy the rest. I can allow small holes here and there, but do not base a complete plot on the hot air. This is the story of a man who is literally looking for an old flame. This is the main plot. I will go ahead, when the story at some point convinces me that there are really mysterious things that are happening, but in this It is a story that there is nothing really mysterious. Bellucci-Cassel are a couple, so Bellucci has to go urgently to some work in Italy (it's not the farthest place in the land of Paris) and she leaves a message, which for reasons explained later does not do it OK. So, these people do not have phones? Supposedly she was absent for 2 months (not exactly a century) and would not she call her boyfriend in Paris to see how he is doing? Of course not. Instead, even after she returns she forgets him. And that's fine, but later in the movie, she tells her friend that it was her greatest love and that she was ready to commit for the first time in her life. She could not call him for 2 months and then never tried to go back with him. And the character of Cassel? Supposedly he could not locate her in Italy, it is really difficult to find someone in Italy, probably as Siberia, especially an actress who is probably on the list even in the art articles. And after 2 months when I would return, it is very difficult to find her and ask for an explanation. One believes that she wanted to avoid it, but no, we discovered that they simply could not meet. So hard to find in Paris. Okay, I do not need to go any further, because this is the incident on which the whole movie is based. What's even worse, Bellucci is not really the star of this movie, but this other Bohringer girl is.
