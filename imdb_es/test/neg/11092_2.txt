I do not usually categorize a movement as boring. I do not like action movies and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie. In fact I enjoy a good rational and plot logic dialogue. Unfortunately, this movie does not have any of those characteristics. Diane Lane is the only savior in this movie and even her beauty can not save her. The terrible dominant music is equal to the moronic dialogue and performance. None of the actors is connected to each other and, as a result, the film does not connect with the audience. I suppose that the scenes in which the townspeople are marching somewhere should be added to the story but it seems that they were inserted just to fill the space. The scenes appeared ragged and incoherent. There were some nice pictures of the ocean and the beach that were beautiful.
