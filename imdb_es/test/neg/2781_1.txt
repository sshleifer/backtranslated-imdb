Another stupid "movie." The image quality is correct Sound too Music is medium. The boy tries to make music as in Halloween. <br /> <br /> For a rare moment, the producer / director chooses non-anorexic girls. It's because this "movie" takes a week and costs $ 10,000. Does it mean that when the producers have money, they choose all the anorexic girls? Good question. <br /> <br /> But the girls in this "movie" are physically correct. But they are not good actresses. None of the boys, too. But maybe it's only because the "story" of this "movie" has no value. <br /> <br /> I'm sure we give $ 10,000 to some teenagers who like the movie, and they can create a better movie. <Br /> <br /> Do not waste your time to see this "thing".
