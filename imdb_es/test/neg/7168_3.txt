Oh God! Book II is more a bad version of the original than a sequel. It's not so funny, its plot plays too much <br /> <br /> as a rejected situation comedy pilot, and the use of the slogan "Think God" is a different variation of the idea that worked much better in the original. John Denver had not come back for this movie and that made a BIG difference. George Burns, like <br /> <br /> wonderful as he was playing God, does not have the same chemistry with the girl he did with John Denver. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10, but only for <br /> <Br /> George Burns; the rest of the cast is nothing special. <br /> <br /> If you loved the first one, do not bother to see it.
