I recently rented this movie on DVD and I thought it would be an interesting option since I'm from the North of England (Bradford), and I was also interested in film. However, it soon became clear that this film seemed to lack a decent level of development in terms of scripts. The characters were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance. The theme could be an interesting basis for a movie. However, the delivery of this seemed naive and unfocused. <br /> <br /> The ending felt as if it were judging the characters, punishing and rewarding where the filmmakers felt necessary. This felt a bit awkward and silly, and seemed at odds with the "realism" used in the filming style. For me, the film dealt with the characters and the subject in a rather heavy and clumsy way. I felt as if the writer had already decided how he wanted to finish the story and prepared to interrupt everyone else to fit in. <br /> <br /> Another point that seems very important to me is diluted Ken. Loach feels the movie he had. It bothers me a lot that film financiers in the UK can not see that there is more to British cinema than "stark realism." It has become an almost certain option. The film is an infinitely wonderful playground for imaginative ideas and is not being exploited by film producers in the UK. There is a lot of talent here in the United Kingdom. It is unfortunate that most of these people end up making music and commercial videos 100% of the time or going to the United States. <br /> <br /> Love + Hate would have worked better if it had been reduced to 30 or 60 minutes and would have appeared as a unique television drama.
