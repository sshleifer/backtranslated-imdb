Ghost Story has an interesting premise of feminist revenge tales, veteran A-list actors, colorful retrospective scenes with witty youth counterparts of the old. scary staccato music that announces the horrors that are approaching, the atmospheric winter weather of New England and an excellent charismatic actress in the main role. Ghost Story could have been much more effective in black and white and in removing some of the more gruesome special effects, and in presenting a more convincing script (we should not have to wonder why the two acolytes that appear on the trailers are in the script). ) The biggest detriment of the film is Craig Wassan (definitely separated at the birth of Bill Maher) who, perhaps editing or just bad acting, is totally ineffective. He seems to "specialize" in reaction shots with his eyes open and his mouth open; There is not much personality here. However, the revelation is Alice Krige, pale, enigmatic and frightening beneath the placid exterior. However, his Eva Galli is creepy even before he finds his destiny; I mean, a young woman who says things like "I'd like to take a bite" or "Dance with me, little toad!" It is no longer in the land of the living. Ghost Story would have been much better in a low profile mode, Val Lewton. Exaggerated special effects completely undermine the cooling factor.
