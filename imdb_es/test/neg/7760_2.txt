Yes, I could not stop yawning, nor my partner. Incredibly boring: the 90 minutes seemed to extend to at least 3 hours, and I'm not even a fan of action movies, but this only falls asleep, unless you're a fan of the 70's turtleneck sweaters ! <br /> <br /> ** SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW ** If you expected something to happen, do not hold your breath, it's not like that! <br /> <br /> But seriously, it fails to convince or involve the observer. It's like a long, boring and quite disconnected dream. Frederic floats through it, can leave work whenever he wants, and with attractive secretaries who bring tea and messages constantly. Obviously it's not real life! And an office with virtually no paper or files, just a giant calendar to let you know that the movie is really taking 6 months to see it. <br /> <br /> Frederick never seems to be moved by any real emotion, neither his wife nor the children behave like rag dolls, in contrast to real life. Even Chloe, despite her strong points of view, never gives the appearance of really feeling anything. The only 3 seconds of any real feeling occur between a supervised couple in a cafe and have nothing to do with the plot. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there are some moral considerations, but if it's entertainment, or even the good photography you're looking for, I think this movie is incredibly overvalued by most viewers.
