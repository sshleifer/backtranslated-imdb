A great effort that achieves some success to adapt the classic story of Odyssey to a piece of the nostalgia period of the 30s. The adventurers on this occasion are convicted fugitives, wandering the Depression that suffers the South that gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> The greatest strength of the film is the wonderful soundtrack of music, which effectively evokes not only the time in which it develops. In, but the spiritual references that run rampant in the movie. In addition to its value for the tone of the movie, the music is simply fun to listen to. <br /> <br /> What paralyzes the movie is that the characters really are not so nice. In a comedy, you need that element to have fun with them in their misadventures. Instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, soulless, malicious people who really do not have any positive points at all. Nor are they imposing enough to make you hate them, so it is difficult to relate to them. They are offered as clowns, but like people who wear clown makeup and march in parades, they are simply not funny. <br /> <br /> Like the story that inspired it, the movie takes these guys to the track. "Odyssey", which meets a variety of symbolic characters (some even mystics). Everyone is marked with offensive stereotypes, the operative word is "stupid." People make fun of the right and the left, and as a result, nobody remains particularly interesting or attractive. The movie does not like its own characters, nor does it let you like them. <br /> <br /> Baptisms on the shore, beautiful mermaids, stolen cars, fist fights, radio preachers, people whipped with sticks; All are thrown to you in an unconnected way. Some evoke some laughter, others confuse you or bore you. I laughed when a nerdy guy hit the snot of a particularly nasty main character. But there were scenes much more uselessly useless; An example: a Dillinger type of the thirties bites cows with a tommy-gun. Comedy? Symbolism? Do not; simply violence without meaning, which detracts from the intellectual nature of the material of original origin on which this story is based. <br /> <br /> Other adaptations of the Odyssey are much better. Unless you're a fan of George Clooney, rent something else. But buy the soundtrack CD; the music is great
