This movie was total boredom from beginning to end. Well, I congratulate Boorman for increasing worldwide recognition of the events in Burma, but that is all he accomplishes. Approximately 10 minutes into the movie, I thought "oh no, here we go again", and I could have told you exactly what was going to happen in the next 80 minutes or so. Patricia Arquette was out of her depth in that role, and her performance was wooden and unconvincing. Keep in mind that, being loaded with such a conventional script, perhaps boredom is present, and was reflected on the screen. Much of the movie was just ridiculous. At one point, Arquette's old companion was shot and he prostrated himself on the ground. In the next scene, he is running through the forest, obviously trying to break the 100-meter world record. - Or maybe he's just trying to escape from Boorman !! If you find it difficult to sleep one night, then play Beyond Rangoon on your VCR and you will be snoring in an instant. I rarely criticize a film as strongly as it is, but in this case it is completely justified.
