The cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that happens throughout the film; we have Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr., Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and the screenwriter and director Curt Siodmak, the director of photography Charles Van Enger, the editorial supervisor Francis D. Lyon and the production assistant Herman Cohen behind that. The unfortunate Payton becomes the head of virtually every male she comes into contact with in the depths of the African jungle where she lives on the plantation of her husband Cavanaugh: Dr. Conway secretly desires it while Burr's capricious foreman it is almost literally closer, more hands. in. On the other hand, Chaney is (surprisingly) the relaxed but knowledgeable authoritarian figure and Strode is a native police officer. The plot is very simple but, frankly, it does not make much sense: after a particularly hectic dinner with thunderstorms, Burr and Cavanaugh (art that imitates life later) come to strike in the garden for their affection. for Payton and, conveniently for Burr, a great snake is crawling near where Cavanaugh touches the ground! Witnessing the event behind the bushes, the enigmatic maid of Payton (a native witch, no less), for some inexplicable reason, puts a curse on Burr (who in the meantime married Payton) who periodically turns him into a gorilla. .. starting from the day of your wedding (when your hand becomes briefly shaggy)! Consequently, Burr leads to getting lost in the jungle for days and days. even if the simian creature itself barely glimpses throughout the film. It must be said, however, that the version I saw lasted only 56 minutes when the "official" duration is given in 66, 70 or 76. Therefore, the film feels understandably hasty and disconnected, although never less than pleasant, since which culminates in the subjective persecution of Payton in the jungle by the gorilla, and the first is pursued by Chaney and Conway. To return to the tragic blonde protagonist of the film for a minute: after a promising start in movies alongside Hollywood legends like James Cagney and Gary Cooper? in, respectively, KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE and DALLAS (both in 1950)? her career soon plunged into Grade B territory (and lower) thanks to her own 'colorful' antics off the screen: her most notorious crime was being the cause of a much-publicized bar-bar brawl between gentle husband Franchot Tone and brutal former lover Tom Neal who ended with first in a coma and Payton left for the second shortly after. But that was not all: the nymphomaniac Payton also boasted that Woody Strode was among his conquests (a controversial issue at the time); the short-lived husband, Tone, after having caught the infidelities of Payton before the camera, spread the Hollywood photographic evidence and this practically served to end his days as a star? his last appearance in the film was Edgar G. Ulmer, MURDER IS MY BEAT (1955), which I have in my stack of "Unwatched Movies". The last 12 years of his tumultuous life were spent on Skid Row in the midst of agony, drugs, prostitution, beatings, arrests and even a stab. Before, eventually, dying in 1967 at his parents' house at the young age of 39!
