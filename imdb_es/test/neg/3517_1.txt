This film is a very bad example of uninspired narration, which tries to hide behind a facade of "artfilm", trying to surprise the audience with demotivated violence (against women) to cover their lack of psychological depth of the characters and internal conflicts. Everything in this film is pretentious, from the thanks to Bela Tarr at the beginning, to photography, acting, music, history and editing. When suddenly, without reason, they are forced to see approaches of Hungarian people who are "charismatically" in their boats, while the soundtrack tries to persuade him that this is supposed to be a dramatic moment, although they are only on the way. For the funeral of the local alcoholic, that's one thing. Putting completely unmotivated rape scenes as a surprise is a different thing, so I have no understanding. This film is really trying to enter a certain genre of artistic films (Eastern European drama type), but it lacks the subtlety, observation skills and "soul" that other directors have.
