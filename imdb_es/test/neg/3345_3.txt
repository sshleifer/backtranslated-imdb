I wish Depardieu could have finished his book and seen it become a dazzling success. At least he would have finished something. <br /> <br /> The film seemed useless, rambling and very elegant, like some other recent French films. Do not hit it. The most recent American films are useless and rambling and have no style. I suppose we should be grateful for the photograph that evokes a European city in the middle of a continental winter blown by the wind, and for the elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> But it may be too much of a good thing Golubeva is stumbling near the sea in the middle of the freezing night, with a bad accent on dreams and things like that. (There are some dream sequences that include things like swimming in a river of blood, you will love it if you are Vlad the Impaler). Many people die. Catherine Deneuve dies in a motorcycle suicide. I do not know why The Golubeva girl also dies, and I do not know why she dies. She receives a slap in the face, falls to the pavement and dies. <br /> <br /> Supposedly there is also an explicit sexual scene. I will have to trust his word because, although it is photographed with style, it is photographed with style in almost total darkness. Do not worry about children being surprised. In any case, they will probably already be asleep. <br /> <br /> Depardieu is not a bad actor. When we see it worsen by a handsome and well-groomed young man, well, handsome, except that it seems that his nose can not get out of his way, to a murderous physical shock, hairy and hairy, we feel sorry for the guy. Golubeva has a pretty, pale face, with huge half-open eyes and broad cheeks, like a doll. His next film should be a new version of Lewton's "I Walked With a Zombie." Then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band. I guess it's a band. From what I could see, the band consists of a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars. Each viewer will find that the resulting sound is interesting, but uneducated listeners who like "easy listening" may not enjoy it. If you do not like music, there is a reward because the sinister composer and leader are beaten on the head with Depardieu's cane. <br /> <br /> I must say that it was almost not worth sitting down. (And it's also a long suit). Sometimes it was like waiting in a car at a railroad crossing while a long, long freight train slowly resounds, sometimes coming to a complete stop. I wish I had some jokes.
