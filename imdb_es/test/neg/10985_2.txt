A few years ago I saw The smell of green papayas from the same director. My feelings about both films are, in fact, the same: beautifully filmed, but terribly slow and boring. I saw this movie in a preview, and I left after half an hour. I could not take it anymore. How can you make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are and how perfect their lives are .........? He had a fantasy about a forgotten American G.I, still wandering through the Vietnamese jungle, who did not know the war was over. How he would suddenly appear in the movie and begin to empty his M16 into the characters in the film. The red of his blood would make a beautiful contrast with all the green plants in the film ... So this movie did not captivate me very much! Time to leave!
