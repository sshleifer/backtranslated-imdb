While traveling by train, a woman (Stéphane Excoffier) ​​mistakenly leaves at a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night. He soon realizes that a strange lonely man (Jim van der Woude) who does not speak his language is the only person in that area and that was the last train on that road. The man lodges it in his house and they develop an unusual relationship and without words between them. <br /> <br /> "De Wisselwachter" is an overrated boredom, with a different but uninteresting story that leads nowhere. I like the Off-Hollywood movies, but this story is too absurd and has no message at the end. The sexual tension between the two main characters is funny at one time but too repetitive. I saw this movie on an old VHS and the image is too dark; I do not know if on DVD the image would be of better quality. In the end, I was absolutely disappointed with this feature. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Homem da Linha" ("The man of the line")
