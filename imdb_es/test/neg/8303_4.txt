A true classic of the garbage of the gothic horror! <br /> <br /> Uhm, actually, it's a horrible movie. Best of all: the naked nipples erected by Rosalba Neri. Intensely livable material. <br /> <br /> Oh, sure, Rosalba Neri is a good lady. I had never heard of her before this movie, but she is a very pretty woman. But, honestly, it was her nipples that did it for me, in that last scene, before the movie ends abruptly, all naked and erected ... Total sleeping nipples, man. Well, I'm sorry, let me take a little here ... <br /> <br /> Basically, I got what I expected from LADY FRANKENSTEIN: It's a shoddy and horrible movie with a big Frankenstein monster looking ugly and stupid. Couple of naked tits. And it has a castle in it. So I was not disappointed very much or anything. He simply crawled too much in certain places (the first resurrection of the creature continued for a long time, with dad Frankenstein just experimenting, talking, trying a little more). However, there was a funny and imbecile homage to the original Frankenstein: instead of throwing a girl to a lake, here the Mongoloid Franky took a naked girl and threw her into a river. However, I made myself laugh. <br /> <br /> Some of my friends praised a little too much about this movie. Maybe I was expecting a little too much. But Rosalba's erect nipples were probably worth it ... (Shit, I really need to stop mentioning her nipples). I think I just finished this user comment now.
