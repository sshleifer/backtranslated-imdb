I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. The more strange and imaginative the movie, the more blood and guts, the better, and I really fall in love with cheap films made if they are done well. Luther starts quite well ... his origins in the circus, a spooky career in a supermarket, the attack of an old woman and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farm, everything is in a good mood. When the woman's daughter and the woman's boyfriend arrive at the house, a hot shower scene occurs. When Luther steals the boyfriend's bike, the movie takes a turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> The characters are presented with numerous opportunities to: A) save their loved ones, B) ask for help from the police, C) escape, or (most importantly) D) KILL LUTHER ! I can not feel empathy or fear for the characters who are too stupid to help themselves. Chareters disapproves of the possibilities of armed with weapons and knives while Luther is away. Finally, a policeman arrives and is equally ineffective in arresting Luther, although at one point he has a rifle pointing directly at Luther, while Luther plays and makes his interpretation of the Polish chicken dance. I found myself uselessly training my television: "Make sure it's dead!", "It's gone, get out of there!", Or "Just kill it now!" <br /> <br /> Luther is a bloodthirsty savage, but he is not Hannibal Lecter. If you can not be more cunning than this egghead, you deserve what awaits you. In the middle of the movie, you'll be so lethargic with the destinations of the enthusiasts that only the morbid curiosity will keep you to the end slightly fun. This movie was recognized as one of the 101 best Fangoria movies you've ever seen ... well, Fangoria is almost right in the case of Luther the Geek.
