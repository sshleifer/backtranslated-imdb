The book, although not particularly good, was decent, but this movie changes it completely. Many of the elements of the story are consistent between the book and the film, but the character of Dr. Ross goes from a creatively written character who lives for money and ends up causing the volcanic eruption with her covetousness to a heart with her Manga, damsel in distress, who will not do anything if she even grasps the slightest hint that she could be less than noble. When movies change the book a lot but keep the same name, it should be a crime.
