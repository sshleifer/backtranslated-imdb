I stopped this movie at 48 minutes and I change ... I do not know ... maybe it's because I'm not Swedish ... or French (the Cannes commentator) ... or any of those other sleepy places of which the previous critics held forth ... they were born and raised in NY. I lived near San Francisco for a quarter of a century. and now Holland. I love a good independent film as much as the next movie enthusiast ... but this, in a word, is not funny. watch? Now THAT's funny ... you're thinking I made a mistake. I said, 'in a word', but then I said, 'it's not funny' ... no. no error. If this is your kind of humor, I would say that you really have not had much life ... consider your appreciation of this movie as a symptom ... and PLEASE, NEVER write another review ... A tendency to believe them when they are unanimous. even if there were only 3 revisions before mine ... I thought I might be able to save another person THE boredom ... the anticipation of laughter that never materializes ... YES I smiled once or twice ... when I started the movie ... and when I stopped it. That should be 10 lines.
