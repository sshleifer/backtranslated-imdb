I'm not sure who is having more fun, the people who wrote the reviews or the director of the film. I could not keep reading these comments or watching this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I can see a low budget western movie that is made with passion and interest in details, but using a garage with art deco lyrics, pastel colors, actors that seem to be asleep because the script is very boring and the boom that gets in the way of the camera every two scenes, which is definitely not my definition of "one of the best western movies". produced in the new Millennium. "<br /> <br /> Please, if any of you had friends in the movie, just say so!
