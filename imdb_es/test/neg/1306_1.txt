Well, as the headline suggests, this is not the particularly good movie I expected it to be. I thought it would be great with Mr. Monty Man himself, but tragically not. From the beginning, literally, I immediately lost interest when two women are just preparing the tea and then, suddenly, she points out that there is random water coming out from under the door, then a great flood along the route of the Home is hard to believe that they did not notice the rise in the water level outside or at least they heard it. I'm sorry this sounds like a tirade, but it really bothers me and has affected me. Most of the actors acted wrong and the story tried to copy almost all the clich√©s of each disaster film, but it just failed in that way. CGI was poor, I could do a better job using ms Paint, also directing the poor, and in the end I did not care about a character at all. Do not waste time, it is not surprising that it has been released directly to DVD. Well, thanks for reading xxx
