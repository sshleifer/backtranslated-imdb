Mr. Moto's Gamble has a fairly simple plan: when a boxer is killed in the ring with a mysterious poison, it's up to the mysterious Mr. Moto to solve the case. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by the number of positive comments for Mr. Moto's Gamble in IMDb. Because for me ... well, I found it extremely disappointing. I enjoy Mr. Moto and I enjoy Charlie Chan, but I can not say that I cared about this mixture of the two. For those who are not familiar with the story behind Mr. Moto's Gamble, it was originally a Charlie Chan movie. But when Warner Oland retired, some of the scenes and action were rewritten for Peter Lorre and Mr. Moto. As I indicated, the final result left me disappointed. Mr. Moto is not Chan. It is more mysterious, more athletic and more exotic. So, trying to put Moto in a Chan movie is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, it does not work. And listening to Lorre / Moto try to deliver one of Chan's characteristic euphemisms simply ends up sounding silly. Add to that the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already brief 72-minute run time consists of boxing scenes (something I never seem to enjoy) and that it ends with a movie I could not help but did not like. If I have to say something positive, I would point out Keye Luke's performance. But even he is not close enough to keep Mr. Moto's bet in my eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but a 4/10 is the best I can give this one.
