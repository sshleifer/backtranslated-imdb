I'm a fan of slasher movies, especially Scream 1-3, but this is just one killing after another. To my surprise, Part II is much better and the full story of the first part is summarized! So do not waste time with this and continue with Part II, you will not regret it because Part 2 actually has a PLOT and is quite ironic. First part: 1 out of 10 Second part: 4 out of 10
