I have read all the reviews of this video film directly. I agree that the movie is not quality "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact". However, if you are looking for a way to spend ninety minutes or so, then this is a movie that is bearable. <br /> <br /> I started watching the movie early in the morning hours since I was doing some geeky stuff. It was very nice, because I could alternate between what I was doing and watching the movie, without losing the rhythm. It's a predictable movie, and the acting is not up to some of the veteran actors (for example, Dennis Hopper). <br /> <br /> But I must point out that I paid only $ 2 (US) And as the old adage says: You get what you pay for! If you are looking for a film with a deep meaning that forces you to watch it again and again, this is definitely the long video. On the other hand, if you're looking for something to pass the time, then there's nothing wrong with Tycus (which by the way was called "Comet: Final Impact" in Mexico, where I found this video).
