This game is a genre of games that tried to take advantage of the entire Myst-inspired trend: walking, talking to people, solving riddles. The puzzles themselves are absolutely horrible, but I'll stick to the performance itself, which is just a little better. If you're looking for compelling performance from any character, you will not find it here, but it's worth buying this game, if only to witness the truly hilarious performance of Christopher Walken. His performance is so horrible in this game that he seems to be imitating someone who is posing as him. It is a caricature of itself. <br /> <br /> So buy this game if you're a masochist, you're a Walken fan or you just want to hear the word F a lot.
