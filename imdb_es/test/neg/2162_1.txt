I was given this movie by my uncle, who had received it for free with a DVD magazine. It's easy to see why he was so interested in getting rid of him. Now I understand that this is a B movie and that it does not have the same budget as the bigger movies, but surely they could have spent their money in a better way than doing this garbage. There are some pretty good performances, like Jack, Beth and Hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (droid killer, for example). This movie also contains the worst fight scene I've seen. The amount of nudity in the movie made it look more like a porn movie than a science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: a horrible movie
