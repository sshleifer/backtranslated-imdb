Threshed and tired, the phrases of a line almost make me cry. My 4 years left the room and ended up doing a puzzle. I do not know for what age group it was written, but the writer himself did not even want the credit. As for the song, it's fun. At least it was a decade ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Although I have seen many more times than this, they are still nice. Every time this happens, I try to encourage my son to look at something else. A positive note, which allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1, is that it encourages good moral values. That would have been encouraging, if someone had been watching.
