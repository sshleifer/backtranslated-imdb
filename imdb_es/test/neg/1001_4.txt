I'm a big fan of Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal) and I was amused to see them surprised by Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this surprisingly quite minor film that had all the ingredients to be so More. The scenes are too short In which portrays a languid, infinitely titled and useless son of a rich Lord are accurate and entertaining. But for a love triangle there was very little chemistry to talk about. The music had an annoying quality of movie of the week, and the voiceover was totally unnecessary. Clearly, the work of a director for the first time with a small budget who lacked or did not pay enough attention to good advice. Pity. <br /> <br /> I can appreciate how the people you hate at the beginning are the ones you like the most at the end, and vice versa, so there's a sort of character arc, at least in terms of perception. For example, Watson's character, while frankly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man, began to thank me almost at the end, particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had no control over her actions, and later when he simply stated that he would move back to his marital apartment, without asking for permission, without apology offered. And I went from disliking Wilkinson's relativist moral / control character to understanding him and not wanting him to change (unlike his wife). <br /> <br /> This movie went awkwardly from a whodunit to a "Love Story" or the drama of the disease "Steel Magnolias" without informing me enough about the fact, so I let myself guess distracted what could be the next twist of the plot long after they had all been revealed (was the Lord the one driving the car? The Lord's dog?) The scene in which the Lord visits Wilkinson and recounts brave that is Watson, the best nurse a dying boyfriend could ask for, the incarnate Florence Nightingale, etc. was fine until she started sobbing like a baby Good God! If you ask me, she is just another rich and carefree person with too much time on her hands, so she makes her work hard, giving the wife an unnecessary drama, her way around was just another way to occupy her empty life, the dying guy's thing was an added bonus for him la, since in some way he made his previous actions completely above reproach. <br /> <br /> Look, everyone would be better if Wilkinson had left her for his secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. Instead, he acted like a battered dog, his desire opened by the affection of his wife increased with each kick she gave him. I am not anti PC or anything, it just did not sound like reality, even after taking into account all the harsh realities of middle age that we all tend to face. The ending for me was (and not the director's intention, I'm sure) depressing. The film spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just do not belong, so I did not find any joy in the promise that their relationship would continue. I'm not above wanting my emotions to be manipulated by a story, it just has to be something plausible and not trite. Is that asking too much? <br /> <br /> My score: 4/10
