I could not last ten minutes in this terrible movie. It seems that the DV cameras have been filmed on VHS without the help of color correction or the microphone. <br /> <br /> As a filmmaker, I know the limitations of the creation of indy movies and, even, maintenance. Those things in my mind, I am surprised that movies can be made this way. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I can offer is that this film was distributed because I've seen much better films that are still looking for modest national or international ones. launching. I guess the box is what sold it ... it has a good illustration, but everything goes downhill from there. <br /> <br /> Side note: it seems that the director has 11 friends since there is no one in The Planet This would give this movie a "10".
