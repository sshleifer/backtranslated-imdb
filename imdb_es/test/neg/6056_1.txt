I survived the first hour of this and returned for the last ten minutes, only to say that I saw the end. If you want a * real * mythology, executed without faults, look for "The Odyssey" by Armand Assante. The great narrative does not need to be modified, the stories are fantastic by themselves. I just hope that Sean Astin needed the money. And Sophocles and Ovid must be turning in their tombs, wherever they are. <br /> <br /> At least with Sorbo's version, the tongue peeked implacably in the cheek, we knew it was mostly balderdash, but maybe it was enough interest. generated in the background story to send someone to the library. I'm surprised that Halmi can produce something so funny (the television series), and follow it with something without quality.
