What a sad surprise. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of the original series (starring Don Adams), I really wanted to do it. The poor deceive me This is more foolish and has more brain death than the bottom of a monkey. <br /> <br /> To say that it was bad would be a serious understatement. It is / was the worst movie (well, the first 30 minutes of one) that I have seen for a long time. I could not take more than the first half hour, I prefer to see how the hard drive disintegrates. <br /> <br /> I can tolerate the bad ... the bad is O.K. BUT with artificial Hollywood shit (and this has to be the worst in many years) I will not put it. This movie is a great insult to the collective intelligence of humanity! My five-year-old daughter could have written better, and she's not even dyslexic! I'm really tempted to try and see the rest, but I'm afraid I have better things to do ... like making a pizza dough and see how it increases. <br /> <br /> What a sad disappointment. No ... I'm stooped! What a scam! As Mel Brookes once said; "Piece of shirt!"
