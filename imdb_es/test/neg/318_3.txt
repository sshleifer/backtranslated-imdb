My mother and I rented this gem a few years ago while she was visiting for Thanksgiving. I have rarely laughed so hard. This is a typical low budget horror movie with silly special effects, a worse plot and an even worse performance. But do you really expect a classic when Linnea Quigley receives the best turnover? I thought not. <br /> <br /> As this movie has an entertainment value, I give it a 3 out of 10.
