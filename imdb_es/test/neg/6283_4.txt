"Tenchi Muyo In Love 2" is Tenchi's third film. It seemed that its creators took elements of the first two to do this. At the risk of giving spoilers, Tenchi is kidnapped and the team has to recover it. Nothing new there. A past love of Yosho is the bad boy. That was done in the second movie. The battle between Aeka and Ryoko is starting to get bored. The movie has almost no action scenes and very little comedy. Personally I do not know what the AICs thought, their creators. I gave this movie a vote of 4.
