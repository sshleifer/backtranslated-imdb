The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy. It is hardly a comedy, rather a boring independent film about a group of losers. Supposedly established in the 70s, little attention is paid to the details of the period, with a too silent color correction that takes its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the film's repetitiveness (maybe that's the point, but it does not contribute to the enjoyment of the visual experience). Just the gang of losers just like to spend time in one place, the stands. It seems that the package of the film as a comedy is intended to trick people into renting or buying this movie, which is a complete waste of time.
