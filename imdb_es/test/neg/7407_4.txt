* This comment may technically contain "spoilers" but it sure does not contain surprises * <br /> <br /> My cousin and I rented this the other day hoping to laugh at a typical amateur shitty excuse for a horror movie. Unfortunately, we did not laugh too much, and we did not get too scared. <br /> <br /> Outline of the plot: an airplane containing the daughter of a company manager and a piece of strange technology crashes in an area where our furry friend lives, so the company boss gathers a team of personalities, instead of expert hunters, to recover it. <br /> <br /> In the first 3/4 of the movie, things get pretty boring. It consists mainly of Big Foot shots lurking in the trees with the group members who occasionally listen to it and spend it as nothing. We also see several shots of the party through Big Foot's point of view, and apparently see it in thermal vision. <br /> <br /> To configure the plot, we have to watch the group sequences sitting around the campfire talking. On the possibilities to justify the existence of sasquatches and actions. "Maybe I can dodge the bullets ... if you see them coming." Indeed, later we see that he can. "There are a lot of unexplored lands where sasquatch can live in. Maybe this is one of them that was overlooked." And obviously it is. "Maybe the Sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of the members of his family." And of course, that is the case. Along with those scenes, there are a couple of "Oh, my God, it's the sasquatch, oh, wait, it's just you!" the scenes, and sadly, are among the most terrifying. <br /> <br /> Then, finally, people start dying. Well, 2 people at least. In addition, the bodies of past victims are discovered. The scenes of death are pretty boring. For the most part, it only remains in our imagination to show Sasquatch holding them and then to a different scene, but first, we are treated to some horrible screams outside the camera. <br /> <br /> Then, finally, we come to see the final confrontation of the protagonist with the monster. I must admit that I found it quite exciting while it lasted. But, unfortunately, it is short-lived, and after that we are treated to an end that makes a half-effort to look cryptic. Then, a closing text with a rather boring conclusion. <br /> <br /> I can not say I recommend this movie. It's not bad enough to give to the Mystery Science Theater 3000, and it's definitely not terrifying and boring enough to enjoy like a horror movie. Just do not bother with that.
