This review took longer to write than to see this movie. It is simply bad. The plot is terrible compared to television programs. It's flat, ungraceful and boring. <br /> <br /> It's clear that the LoG ran out of ideas long before this movie lit up in green. Spectators should read this as an example of not knowing when to stop. <br /> <br /> Bad editing, bad music, bad acting. Zero dynamism, zero chemistry. <br /> <br /> A movie that does not know what it is, made without any love for a mysterious ending that leaves you depressed and you feel a little angry for having lost so much money. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the LoGs received an offer they could not refuse, or maybe their egos have simply exceeded them. It's a gloomy marketing impulse that might have been better when the LoG was fresher and more inspired. <br /> <br /> However, I knew when to stop and I did. <br /> <br /> Please! Someone tries to convince me of the best points of this movie!
