I was very disappointed with this movie. I had heard some good reviews about it and, unfortunately, I did not see it in theaters. As a result of this, I was really excited to see it on DVD. I thought it was going to be a high-tempo horror movie with a lot of terrifying surprises, but instead it was a predictable movie with a snail's pace. He crawled and dragged without a climax in him and, after all the difficulties that those people went through to try to escape, the ending was completely frustrating. I gave this movie two stars for a reason. This is not your typical horror movie with a bad central boy who kills a group of people. The story makes this film unique and provides a change for people who watch many horror movies. Although I do not like this movie, I recommend that all horror fans see it at least once. You may like it surprisingly. As for this horror fan, all I can say is that I hope there is NO sequel to this forgettable movie.
