All I could think about while watching this movie was: "Will it ever end?" It was unbearably boring to see him. I wished I could just turn it off, but I wanted to do justice to this revision, so I fought the good fight and endured the torture of watching this movie until the end so that you, the good reader, do not have to endure that pain too. . <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have a great premise if you read the premise on paper. However, the film itself is not based on this premise. <br /> <br /> The initial scene features an extraction well in the early 1900s, where they are forcing children to transport dynamite in tunnels that are not large enough for adults to fit into. This seems to be preparing the premise for an interesting movie. But after 4 minutes, it is clear that this is not the case. The adults who committed these crimes are never punished; There are no consequences shown in the film for their actions. The initial scene is much better than, and completely irrelevant to the rest of the movie. The last time an opening scene misrepresented a film so seriously was the opening scene 28 days later, which was the only good scene in * that * full movie. Wicked Little Things / Zombies (a film so bad that they changed the title to try to hide their evil and sell it again) is exactly the same in this respect. The opening scene is the only scene visible throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Instead, the film moves towards the present. A single mother and her two spoiled, badly spoken children. This is when it would have been prudent to press the STOP button and never come close to the movie again. <br /> <br /> In the first hour, zombie children are barely seen. They get maybe 3 minutes of screen time, total. All they do is kill a pig, that's all. The rest of the time is spent showing the dumb mother and her foolish children buying things at the local store, walking through the woods and having inane conversations with each other. The silly teenage daughter goes and walks with other stupid teenagers and smokes grass with them. <br /> <br /> There would be no reason to worry at all if the zombie children dispatched someone in this movie. Each of the characters is both foolish and annoying, with no redeeming qualities at all. Not to mention one-dimensional and cliché. <br /> <br /> This film would have been * greatly improved * if the mother and her dumb children had been sent in the first 10 minutes by the zombie children, while driving to their new home, then the final credits ended. That right there would instantly change the score from 1/10 to 10/10. Honestly! When the foolish mother takes her eyes off the road and almost crashes into a pedestrian on the road, her daughter scolds her: "You almost killed us, mother!" Of course, anyone with common sense knows that if the mother had hit the pedestrian, it would be the pedestrian who would be dead, not the people safely locked inside the car. I guess this line was put on the film to show first hand that the complete stupidity of the main characters has no limits, and runs in the family. <br /> <br /> Wicked Little Things / Zombies runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes, but I definitely felt like 5 hours or more for me. Trying not to fall asleep was a tremendous challenge. It is not until more than an hour has passed by the time and 34 minutes that zombie children really bother to kill anyone. Then, the scene shows the silly teenagers drinking beer, leaving in a car and saying phrases like: "If you ever want to get back into my pants, it's better to start the car and get me out of here right now". Seriously, that is literally from the movie. Teenagers are so cliché, one-dimensional, badly acted, stupid and annoying that when zombie children finally manage to hack 3 of them 1 hour and 5 minutes after the movie, it feels like a cause for celebration. Of course, the "princess" silly smoker of bad mouth and beer drinker, the daughter of the main character of the mother, escapes without problems. What a buzzkill it was! He was on the screen longer than the others and, therefore, the most annoying of the 4, and the most deserving of a blow to the head. More reason why it should have been sent in the first 10 minutes, as mentioned above. However, keeping it close to 1 hour and 5 minutes is totally inexcusable. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is that long-duration films should be padded for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. So by keeping her alive a long time ago when she should be, they have 27 additional minutes to accompany the film with her and her mother running through the woods. After 1 hour and 22 minutes, it is the * second * time in the film in which the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine does not start while the zombie children come to look for her. <br /> <br /> Zombie children are completely generic. Never say anything. There is no character development for any of them. <br /> <br /> In the end, the 3 idiot and annoying main characters live. What, in my opinion, is the way the filmmakers give a final gesture to the player watching the audience. In my opinion, the filmmakers surely know that they have deceived anyone who has had the great misfortune to see the whole movie. Why not rub their faces in it or even give them the satisfaction of seeing any of the 3 main characters that should have been sent within the first 10 minutes, die. <br /> <br /> Avoid small things and evil zombies like The bubonic plague.
