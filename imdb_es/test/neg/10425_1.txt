"Wired" would have to qualify as one of the ten worst movies I've seen in my life. The writing and the direction show a surprising lack of imagination and I am sure that most of the actors still shudder every time someone mentions this movie. <br /> <br /> It does not work as a tribute to Belushi's unique talent, or as an accurate account of his short life. <br /> <br /> A useless mess without redemption features.
