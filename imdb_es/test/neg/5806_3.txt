What could be expected from any comedy produced by Adam Sandler, Grandma's Boy is predictable and so foolish that it's disgusting. Allen Covert plays Alex in the film, a 35-year-old smoker who works as a video game tester and had to move in with his grandmother and two roommates after losing his apartment. There are some twists in the usual plot: he has problems adapting to his new life situation, which in turn makes him have problems at work, which is particularly bad because he is trying to catch one of the new consultants in the office . Launch a strange boss, an almost extraterrestrial company star, a really nerdy best friend, some scenes in the burned marijuana store, a great party scene, and an original video game that Alex tries to finish alone in the mix that grandma has. Chico in its entirety. Allen Covert has a marginally good lead, Linda Cardellini is cute enough to be the office consultant Samantha, one of the nerds, and some scenes manage to spit a giggle or two, but none of that makes Grandma's son worth much the time of either. Most of the supposed "funny jokes" or "jokes", or whatever you want to call them, are nothing more than "humor" that would embarrass anyone in National Lampoons, Joel Moore is incredibly funny in his role as the intellectual author of the video game JP. and the whole movie actually manages to be boring and not funny or substantial. Well, at least the grandmother's boy did something for someone: Adam Sandler was able to get some paychecks for his jobless friends David Spade, Kevin Nealon and Rob Schneider.
