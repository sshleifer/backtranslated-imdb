The digital effects were performed at low cost and the action sequences lack suspense. This was essentially done for television and it shows. David Suchet looks bored and Nigel Planer looks down in shame! and as for the Dick Van Dyke London accent by Robert Carlyle, there are no comments! If you want to spend an hour or two when you do not have anything on, then it will work. If you are going to buy the DVD, wait a few weeks and pick it up in the Asda bargain box, because that's where it's heading. If the budget was bigger and Richard Doyle's book was followed more closely, it could have been something special, but as it is, it is a bit poor. Watch the trailer instead! Or read the book and see what could have been.
