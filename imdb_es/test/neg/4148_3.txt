Relesed de Troma (which is my favorite movie company) Unspeaksble is a messy horror movie that can be interesting but very dark and twisted. <br /> <br /> Started with a family in a car, they get into an accident that leaves a daughter dead and a mother deformed. The father eventually goes crazy and cuts prostitutes. He sees his daughter in other people. He kills for her. Meanwhile, his now deformed wife is being violated by his ordinance. These are sick people! <br /> <br /> Incomparable tries to be sick and disturbing and manages to make it like a good horror movie, it is not. Most of Troma's films have a sense of humor for them, but this one does not.
