I would give it a zero if they had that rating. The fun was not fun at all. I got tired of the movie about ten minutes later, but I stayed until the end thinking that I had to improve, but it was not like that. The others with whom I saw this movie also agreed. The acting was annoying. I'm tired of Jim Carey acting like the ham. The cast of support was not better. While this film was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker they stepped on when a large company went under, the vehicle for this would have been better served in another way. In fact, I did not like the main characters (Dick and Jane) so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic. I am trying to remember a scene in which I or someone I was with laughed and I can not. A film without value and a total loss of time.
