When Pam Grier did COFFY in 1973, it was an exciting but flawed movie. The plot was harsh and satisfying, even if the performance was often amateur. It was so successful that American International Pictures decided to repeat the formula the following year with FOXY BROWN: it's not a bad movie, but it's almost like "COFFY II". Now, just a year later, the studio had apparently given up creating something new for Mrs. Grier, since SHEBA, BABY was essentially the same plot of COFFY and FOXY BROWN once again. Because the idea was very recycled and because the acting and acting are so tired and low on energy, it really is scraping the bottom of the Blaxploitation barrel. <br /> <br /> Exactly like these other films, SHEBA, BABY starts with some local black mobsters lobby and eventually kill someone who loves Pam Grier. In the past, they had been drug dealers and pimps, now they were mafiosi trying to manage all the loan companies and pawnshops out of town so they could take over the market. And, like the other films, Pam is a one-woman success squad: she imparts justice and a good scream. And, like the other movies, there is a "cat fight" between Pam and a white lady versus "Mr. Big." And, like the other movies, Mr. Big is a white guy who pulls on all the strings. And, like the other movies, it's captured by Mr. Big. And, like the other movies, he does NOT kill her right away, but gives him a chance to escape (here, leaving a knife conveniently out there). And, like the other movies, he finally frees himself and kills his jive - @ $$. <br /> <br /> While this formula seemed interesting in 1973, for this film it was frankly a predictable bore. Even if you had not seen the other movies, it was still bad because the action was very slow, the punches and kicks seemed very slow and organized. The same could be said for the weapon game. In one scene, four guys with machine guns, an AR-15 and a shotgun attack. Pam responds by opening fire with a .357 revolver and killing 3 of the 4 and getting the other to surrender! Even if she is a good shooter, she was quite slow and the guys seemed to wait until she killed them! Also, not even a world champion shooter or Rambo could have succeeded with such one-sided odds: after all, these guys had very impressive weapons and were already aiming at it when they "deftly" pulled out their gun and dispatched it easily. These professional killers !! <br /> <br /> In addition to the slow and lame action scenes compared to any other Blaxpoitation movie, the film has many logical gaps that show that the writing was terrible, but the studio simply did not care. In one case, her boyfriend, "Williams," knew about the yacht and the Nu-tronic at the end of the movie, but Pam never told her: how did you know about this? In another, the police approach a boat full of hoods and the bell opens fire immediately. However, the policemen had no evidence that something was happening and the thieves started firing with little provocation. And, the thieves had .30 caliber machine guns and other incredibly powerful weapons, but in many cases they were killed by police officers who exercised .38s. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is a great example of "I've been there / done that ... a BETTER ENTIRE LOT". I love Blaxploitation movies, but this is too stupid and slow to deserve it, except for the fans of the genre.
