River Queen tries to group a complicated and radical historical narrative in just under two hours. There are some impressive battle scenes and the landscape of Wanganui is beautifully captured. However, the film suffered from some bad clues: Samantha Morton (Sarah) was especially unconvincing. There seemed to be an indecision about how the role should be played, like a defenseless woman thrown by fate or as a strong and determined character with a clear vision of her destiny. The character of Kiefer Sutherland, Private Doyle, seemed useless and, for the most part, unintelligible. The Irish brogue of Keifer needs a bit of polishing. On the other hand, Cliff Curtis, Morrison Tequila and Rawiri Pene (like Sarah's son, "Boy") were well-designed and credible. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of River Queen were especially compressed and hurried. It seemed as if they had decided to tie up all the loose ends before 120 minutes passed. E.g. How the hell did Wiremu know how to find Sarah and Doyle? Without explanation and very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> I went to this movie with an open mind. He had not read or heard anything other than his problematic production. What I experienced was a mix of New Zealand history, beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing.
