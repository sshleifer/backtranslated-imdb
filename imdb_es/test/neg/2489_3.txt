There is no real story. The film is more like a fly on the drama-documentary wall than a suitable film, so this piece can be a spoiler in itself. Teen drama about 3 young children from Singapore (very similar to UK chavs) who play endless school, run with gangs, fight, insult people on the street, get tattoos, hang themselves to do nothing, etc., they usually imagine themselves being hard and occasionally shouting challenging rap songs to the camera. Filmed in MTV style, fast cuts, crazy camera angles, close-ups and animated interludes. The dialogue could have been clearer in the original Mandarin and Hokkien languages ​​than in the subtitles and I have no doubt that some of Singapore's contemporary references will slip over the Western heads, as well as the cultural and political context, unless that is familiar with Singapore. This type of film for teenagers may be the first time it is done in Singapore, but it has been done before and has been done better in other Western countries, La Haine (1995), for example.
