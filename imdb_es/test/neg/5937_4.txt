After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and the other in Amsterdam, the main suspect is the leader Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) operating in the Middle East is assigned by his superior in Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) to keep under surveillance a "safe house" in Amman, and is associated with the Head of Security of Jordan. , Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Roger does not reveal the entire operation to Hani, and fails due to Ed's intervention. Meanwhile, Roger feels something for the local nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and approaches his family. When Roger plans another plan to capture Al-Saleem using the innocent architect Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman) as a lure to lure Al-Saleem, he endangers not only the safety of Sadiki, but also of Aisha, who is kidnapped. After the execution of Sadiki, Roger tries to negotiate the release of Aisha with the terrorists and intends to surrender to save the nurse. <br /> <br /> "Body of Lies" is a disappointing pyrotechnic journey through Europe and the Middle East Despite the names of Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. The IMDb user rating indicates that there are many viewers who, like this kind of fast-paced spy movie, use high technology, satellites and all kinds of disrespect for the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil that does not allow time to think. But that is not my case. It's boring and ridiculous to see fat Russell Crowe with a cell phone as a family man while his partner risks his life in a dangerous operation. The rich character played by Leonardo DiCaprio is poorly developed and, in my opinion, this great actor is a bad agent as an operative agent in the Middle East due to his biotype. But the movie never explains its connections to the Middle East. The rescue of Roger Ferris alive is also very stupid and corny. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rede de Mentiras" ("Network of lies")
