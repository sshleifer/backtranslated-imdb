I have to be honest and admit that this movie basically did nothing for me, except that it completely unnerved me. It is loaded with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, which is then linked to the discovery of a body of more than 40 years. The story really never seems to make much sense, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) starts having his conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I never realized that). Jones was fine in his role, although I thought he was really starting to show his age here. Horribly grumpy was John Goodman as Julie "Baby Feet" Balboni, who I guess is supposed to be a kind of local mafia figure. I just did not think Goodman would work in this role, although I admit it could be because I'm not a big fan of John Goodman. Somewhere in the mix Justina Machado appeared as an FBI agent, although I never really understood what the FBI was involved in, which could simply mean that my attention was still rambling from the screen. If it was explained, however, I missed it completely. Fortunately, this is a fairly short movie, so you will not waste too much of your life on it. 2/10
