those people, who told me "this movie is good": what a shame! This movie is for an audience that has no problem seeing everything (especially when it comes to tough guys, weapons, chases and robberies}. I would compare it to "The Inside Man" movie {the same time loss}. I'm tired of copying and pasting movies. And I'm unhappy, but what can I do? Fans of that kind of movies are much more ... if you want to see a good movie of that type, I will recommend you "Lucky Number Slevin". I do not want to say, I just do not like this movie {weak actors, weak script, weak action}. probably someone else will like it. Many people, many tastes. RIGHT NOW! "CHAOS" DOES NOT HAVE FLAVOR!
