Oh, man, I hated this movie. Of course, the site's locations were excellent, but that's the ONLY positive thing I can say about it. Now, I will declare from the beginning that I am VERY critical of the way weapons, especially firearms, are portrayed and handled in movies. Being a war movie, the performance was fine, but the handling of poor quality weapons in the movie would NEVER have been tolerated by a real SEAL team. The performance was more of wood than my first sailboat, the equipment carried (or the lack of it) was ridiculous, and the dialogue was, shall we say, without anything interesting. Well, with the exception of the journalist, which was actually prophetic. Watching this movie was comparable to watching "Palmetto" with Woody Harrelson, where each scene was so bad you could not turn it off, because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene. Like Palmetto, they certainly did. The scene in the water, where, after shooting the enemy's first, BLOW THE DAMN BOAT UP, therefore, having to face possible drownings, made me laugh so hard, that for a millisecond I almost thought it was worth waiting through the movie for. Then, Charlie Sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy to the depths of the ocean (the way it was filmed, with the many camera cuts, it seemed that they went down about 80 ft. Good continuity there ...) before trimming his throat. So stupid, that surprised me. On the other hand, that was the whole damn movie. I like action movies, but it is not. NOTE: The version I saw was a TV version, pan & scan. I can not imagine there being a difference, except for making everything happier shorter!
