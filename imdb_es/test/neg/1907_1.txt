The interference begins when Martin Sanders (Andres Bagg), unemployed, hears something strange on his phone, hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named Diana and who is about to join her. Soon after, Martin reads a local newspaper and sees the story on the first page about the murder of a prostitute and remembers what he heard. Martin trusts his friends Laura (Virginia Lustig) and Aaron (Oliver Kolker) but they do not believe him. Then, shortly after the same thing happened again, the phone call, the man, the prostitute and his death were reported in the newspapers. Martin decides he has to find the killer and end his wave of murders, but who is he? <br /> <br /> This Argentine production that apparently was filmed in just eight days (why so much time?) With a budget of about $ 3,000 (why so much?) was written and directed by Sergio Esquenazi and I can not believe some of the enthusiastic comments that Interference has on the IMDb. Out of 195 user ratings as I write this, 113 of them rate this garbage heap 10 out of 10, I'm sorry, but there's no way someone would give such a bad movie a literally perfect score of 10 out of 10. If the movie score in IMDb is fixed, then this is all, honestly I do not think that if you showed the Interference to 195 average people, more than 100 of them would qualify as absolutely perfect, in no way on Earth. The comments of the users are also surprisingly positive, all IMDb users who have only written comments for a movie, this. The only user (besides me) who actually wrote more than one comment gave a final touch 1 out of 10, which sounds almost correct. Everyone has the right to an opinion, but I would bet my life on the fact that most of those positive comments come from false accounts created exclusively for this big piece of junk. Where do I start? How on Earth can I adequately describe how bad the interference is? The plot is a disaster that basically lives or dies due to its terrible twists, while most twists turn an argument in your head and alter the perspective of everything that has happened before in an intelligent and relevant way and are real surprises here in Interference that turns destroy The first half of the movie makes it totally useless in a "did not happen" way and the turn is so mishandled that it leaves you asking more questions than answers. What made Martin go crazy? Why did you imagine the phone calls? Why did you imagine a murderer? Why did you imagine the headlines of the newspapers? No explanation is given for the behavior of Martin during the first hour of the film, there is only this absurd revelation that everything was in his mind and that's it, that's all the exposure that exists. Then there is a plot twist about Martin's missing wife and her lover before Martin, for inexplicable reasons, begins to kill his friends for no apparent reason. I'm sorry, but the Interference is so bad, it's so boring, it's so badly written and thought that, honestly, I can not think of anything positive to say about it. I'm sorry, but that's what I feel, simply, the Interference is one of the worst movies I've seen and it's a complete disaster both conceptually and technically. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb Interference, Interference was fashionable in only eight days. To be honest, it does not feel that way at all. No, it feels more like I've been shot in five days! The whole movie is a monstrosity, Interference probably has the worst night shooting I've seen. It is as if no attempt had been made to illuminate the scenes, it is as if the creators had entered a dark room or a basement or whatever, and only shot to the scene no matter if you could see something. The scenes set outside during the day have this horrible unnatural blue-green tone for them for no apparent reason that just looks silly and becomes increasingly irritating. This strange dye is not repeated in interior scenes, so they are also quite discordant and remarkable. There is no real horror or fear, in fact, I would say that Interference is more a thriller than a horror. When it comes to gore, there are two decapitated heads in a refrigerator, a knife is stuck in someone's mouth and nothing else. <br /> <br /> According to the IMDb, this had a budget of around $ 3,000, which makes Interference one of the lowest budget movies ever released commercially for sure? Some people think that just because a movie is low budget, all reasonable viewing standards should come out the window and we should accept any old shit, bad! To see this on DVD, you will still have to pay good money and personally I think we have the right to expect some kind of good product. If this can be released and praised as if it were worthy of an Oscar, then we can all release the video from our holiday camcorder (including embarrassing karaoke images and scenes of total blackness, since we forget to remove the lens cap) and win prizes at the next Cannes film festival! The acting is horrible, although the female lead Virginia Lustig is actually quite sexy and helps alleviate the pain of the last twenty minutes, as it has a fair bit of. <br /> <br /> Interference is an absolutely terrible movie, seriously, I beg you. Do not be fooled by all the false positive comments, there is no way that someone who is not involved in this or who has some kind of agenda gives 9 or 10 out of 10. An amateur disaster that is really horrible to sit on. through. I'm sorry, but that's the way I see it, sometimes you have to be cruel to be nice ... you've been warned!
