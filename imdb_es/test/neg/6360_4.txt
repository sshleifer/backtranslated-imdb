Critters 3 starts on the open road when Clifford (John Calvin), his teenage daughter Annie (Aimee Brooks) and his son Johnny (the list of two actors, Christian and Joseph Cousins, identical twins, maybe?) Return home from holidays. Suddenly, the tire of his truck breaks and they have to stop at a public rest area to fix it. While there, Annie and Johnny meet a boy named Josh (Leonardo DiCaprio, yes, that) who in turn runs into Charlie McFadden (co-producer of the movie Don Keith Opper) of the two previous Critter films. Charlie tells them the story of the Critters and the city of Grovers Bend, but they do not believe him. Meanwhile, in the van, a Critter lays eggs on its bottom, out of sight of everyone. Once Clifford repaired the tire, the trio set off for his home, a block of urban homes in Los Angeles, somewhere, with Critter's eggs along the way. Upon arrival, the eggs hatch and the Critters go directly to the block of flats, quickly eliminating Frank (Geoffrey Blake), the caretaker. As the night approaches for the few remaining residents, a fat woman named Rosalie (Diana Bellamy), a telephone repairman, Marsha (Katherine Cortez), an elderly couple, Mr. (Bill Zuckert) and Mrs. Menges (Frances Bay) must meet with Clifford and his children to fight the Critters. Josh also makes an appearance as his stepfather (William Dennis Hunt) owns the building. But can the group defeat the Critters and prevent them from becoming a dinner party? <br /> <br /> Directed by Kristine Peterson. I thought that Critters 3 was an incredibly thin film, but at least she can say that she made a movie with Leonardo. DiCaprio and not many people can say that! The budget for Critters 3 probably was not exactly a fortune, since all the production looks cheap, there are very few characters, very few Critters and I think that only 3 appear in the same shot at the same time and eliminates any kind of spatial angle, so you do not have to pay for the expensive space ship or for the special effects of a distant alien planet. David J. Schow's script is strictly numeric and very predictable. A group of humans is caught in an isolated situation with Critters and has no means to get in touch with the outside world for help, that plot scenario sounds very familiar, right? Well, it's the same as the previous Critters (1986) and Critters 2: The Main Course (1988) and many other horror films, so it should. Critters 3 does not do anything with the premise, nor does it even try to add anything to an old, tired and well-used story. Critters 3 is also very docile for a horror movie with only two people killed, the elements of the comedy seriously missing and the best joke. Critters 3 can be a Critter eating some beans and then throwing farts, very funny if you are about 5 years old. The characters are mostly horror movie cliches and quickly became annoying. There is virtually no blood or gore in Critters 3, just a few splashes of blood and, disappointingly, Critters 3, in fact, seems to show no violence. The special effects on the Critters are fine, but they still look like static and simplistic hand puppets that have very little movement. The performance is not so good and it turns out that Critters 3 is Leonardo DiCaprio's first feature film, to be fair to the child who is well. . Why the hell that Charlie guy has to keep showing up in these Critter movies? To give Critters 3 some credit, it's moving at a good pace and it's not boring, it's generally well done with enough production values ​​and it's a bit of harmless fun if it's in the right frame of mind and, fortunately, it only lasts 80 minutes Odd In general, Critters 3 is a good waste of time, but do not expect anything deep or meaningful. There's nothing really bad about it like a cheap horror movie, but I could not help but feel that I had seen it all before. An average time loss that is not as good as any of Critter's previous two films. Critters 3 ends with a 'to continue ...', as it was filmed consecutively with Critters 4 (1991) which, as expected, went straight to the video, probably to save even more money. Critters 3 is a pretty decent way to lose 80 odd minutes if you can watch it on TV for free, otherwise, do not worry.
