What to say about "Dead End Road" ... <br /> <br /> Let's say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been so ashamed. The acting, the writing, the effects and everything in this movie was just horrible. That does not even do justice! This movie was the biggest piece of trash I've had to watch. That's why I also stopped him about 20 minutes before the end because personally I did not care what happened to the characters. I have seen badly but this was definitely the worst. I got mad about this because I'm a fan of Poe and this was just bad. Just bad <br /> <br /> What bothers me the most is that you can not rate movies with negative numbers.
