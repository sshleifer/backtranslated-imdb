How many talented or at least charismatic actors ended up in this nonsense? Nothing is very good about this movie, but the worst things are probably the script and the direction. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this is the heart piece of director Damian Niemans, as it is written and directed (and acted as well). He himself is a card magician and seems to have named characters in homage to other famous magicians. This was his first feature film, as far as I know, and it is probably his last. <br /> <br /> It's hard to pinpoint exactly what makes him so poor. but I would say that the story and the characters are not credible (the script) and the direction does not give any impulse (the director). Plus ?? Poker scenes are bad in the worst Hollywood way (super hands, Hollywood rules)! The supposed turns in the film are totally predictable or totally incredible. They just end up tying a knot to a story that, in the best of cases, can be described as "a few decent scenes"!
