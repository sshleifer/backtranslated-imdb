I found that this movie is fine. <br /> <br /> On paper, this movie has everything a person could want! Romance, comedy, drama. A robbery to a bank, a unique cast, excellent music and storytelling. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie ended up being mostly garbage, and I'll tell you why. <br /> <br /> a) This is my biggest problem: the edition. This movie has by far the worst edition I've seen, less than ads from local car dealers. The editing could have been done better if a deaf Parkinson's patient tapped on iMovie with a dead cat. There are scenes in which two characters speak and you can see how their lips move and the audio / video is not synchronized because it is clearly folded. Why was it folded? I do not know! It's English folding English! The voices were made in a studio elsewhere in certain scenes! Could not you find a boom-mic ?! They are not expensive; Jesus, even I have one! And I do not make movies! <br /> <br /> b) Andrew Keegan's performance lacked. It really did not seem like he wanted to be part of this project, and his performance was the equivalent of a sketch made by D.A.R.E. for school children. At least John Krasinksi showed some enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Yes, John Krasinski is the only reason why I rented this movie, and it's the only real reason worth seeing. He made a good artful performance and was the most three-dimensional character. The character of Dean Edwards was quite thin, like Whats-her-face. <br /> <br /> Final word? If you are a fan of John Krasinski, this is a worthwhile moment. If not, do not bother. The edition
