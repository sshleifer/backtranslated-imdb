The first time I saw the trailer of this movie, I really wanted to see it. I thought some of the director's other jobs were pretty good, but I must say that I was disappointed. The plot involves a young woman, who lives with a widowed father and two with their two children. They move to a well-kept community, but not everything is what it seems; a kind of twin peaks. The woman begins to see, or not see, things in a town. During the first roll, I had a hypothesis and thought: "Can not it be the reason?" Well, the end was up to par, or rather, and gave us what I felt was a truly weak final act. The sound mix and the quality is excellent. I saw it in a theater certified by THX and I was impressed with the audio, and only with the audio. The image lacks substance.
