Automatic switch! Automatic switch! he has Chuck Norris as a truck driver and a karate teacher, he talks about juggling two different races. He gives a load that he can not deliver to his younger brother Michael Augenstein and then, when the young man does not show up, Chuck goes looking for him. <br /> <br /> What the young Augenstein has gotten into is a speed trap directed by Judge George Murdock, who comes from the Roy Bean school of jurisprudence. Of course, Norris deals with matters in the usual way of Chuck Norris and when he gets into trouble, the call goes through the CB so that all the truckers come to help their good friend. This speed trap known as Texas City has a bad reputation and drivers are very happy to help a friend. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chuck is a little younger and does not have facial hair. He has the tense look of a man who realizes that the Academy will not be looking at this bumblebee. George Murdock is acting exaggeratedly like would-be judge Roy Bean. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for Chuck Norris fans.
