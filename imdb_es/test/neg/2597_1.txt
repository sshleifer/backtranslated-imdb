They are literally the Three Stooges again, without the charm. This show is not more than the worst slapstick. I'm surprised that they actually have writers. The so-called jokes are completely random and "controversial" for no other reason than trying to be very (very) difficult to be controversial. And do people think that this is 'nervous'? Get a clue: this show does not require any thought, time, effort, money or creativity / originality to produce. All present references are aimed at anyone between the ages of 6 and 16 who would occasionally browse in People magazine. But I guess this is just what all children want, want and need today.
