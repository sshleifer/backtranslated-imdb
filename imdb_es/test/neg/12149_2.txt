Well, folks, this is another stereotyped representation of Gay life. However, the additional inconvenience includes a bad performance, a horrible script, no budget, a terrible sound and do not forget the impossible plot. <br /> <br /> It's Christmas in New York. The city of York and our history immediately "focus" on two male individuals, apparently lovers for some time. One of them has not let his parents (the right wing, types of religious fanatics) know that he is gay (which adds to the implusibility of the story because this guy is as important as homosexual men these days) and his parents come to him. They will stay in their apartment in New York, where he and his lover have just decorated for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The story continues to unfold around the arrival of parents, who nobody will like anyway and, through, only the obvious. And predictable ways: they come to learn that their son is gay. Tears were shed like my interest in this movie. <br /> <br /> The cast of characters seemed like an intro-acting course at the local community theater. The lovers in this film do not coincide, and there does not seem to be any cohesion with their union. <br /> <br /> The owner is flat and her attempt to be humanistic in the situation is not well cooked and certainly did not help to move the plot a little more. <br /> <br /> The dragkeen friend who walks to the aid of one of the lovers in his "moment of need" is stereotypical and gives a bad name to the unique art of dragging. <br /> <br /> Although some guys at night find that one of the lovers has a nice body (again, stereotyped images) this story does not help. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, especially if you are considering a purchase. You're going to shoot if you do it!
