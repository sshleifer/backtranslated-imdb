I usually love these movies. Give me a good B movie at any time, but this was just horrible. The performance (?) Was terrible almost to the point of turning off the movie completely. I thought I had seen the worst of all times, but this one is right up there with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! In all honesty, it was the performance that made this movie for me. <br /> <br /> I thought the actor was clumsy and the main man / woman was extremely bored. This movie had absolutely nothing in its favor. You may be asking me a ridiculous question here, but why the nudity and sex scene? Did the producers think that nobody would watch them if they were excluded? I think they were probably right! Where are Price and The Tingler when you need them?
