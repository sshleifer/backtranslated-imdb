Critics are falling over themselves within the Weinstein Sphere of Influence to praise this ugly, misguided, and repellent adaptation of the lyric novel on which it is based. The direction of Minghella with his fist in the fist of the extremely bloody oddity and chillona excessively episodic is one of the many false steps of this "love story of the civil war". Are you kidding? After Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law get together with a zero screen chemistry in a small town in North Carolina and they steal a kiss before going to war for Jude and her photographic memory of the girl she left Back, it's a two-hour test for the kidneys as to whether he will survive a lot of near-death experiences to reunite with his soul mate. Who cares? The amateur scene of Philip S. Hoffman, who plays a nasty and unpleasant role, pales the appearance of Renee Zelweger as a corn-fed dynamo that miraculously bursts into the scene of Kidman's lonely farm to save the day. Rarely has a performance of "look at me, I am acting" of conceit. Its pure and deafening nerve awakens the long-lasting ones for a couple of minutes until the haze becomes painfully thin. Launched by Miramax strategically for the consideration of Oscar and Golden Globe (what a sham), the Weinsteins apparently own, along with Dick Clark, the critical community and won 8 Globe nominations for their exaggerated failure. The resulting crime is that the prizes have lost their meaning and the small and less powerful films promoted by public relations become obscure. Cold Mountain is a film concept and an empty and bitter waste of time. Cold indeed!
