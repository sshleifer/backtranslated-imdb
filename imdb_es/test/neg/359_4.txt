The man with the golden arm (the film) is a decent vehicle for Frank Sinatra's career, but fails abysmally as a good adaptation of a fantastic book. You always hear about how books are "changed" when they become movies. Things are cut, muted, etc. Well, you can not even say that they "changed" anything with the movie. history. The characters and the setting are the same, but not the ambiguous characterization, the depth of the men and women of the Polish Chicago in the book. As for the configuration, it has become simply a stage of play, complete with the unnecessary "support role" of players who walk too busy on the inner streets and claustrophobic. The movie is a completely different version of Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When this happens, Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow, all lose their psychological advantage. Frankie's battery, a modest dream in the book, becomes all his passion in the movie (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And drug addiction is treated as shlock, exploitable. The acting is decent, especially Louie's, which is more threatening in the movie than the book. But it is a pity that this type of film can be considered a classic along with the book on which it is "based", the real story of Frankie Machine. The movie just shows that Hollywood can not do anything right without hindering and adding a happy ending. In this case, they simply changed it completely, downgrading an important and realistic story in Hollywood fluff. I'm sure I always had a prejudice because I read the book first, so I really can not treat the film honestly knowing how good the book is. In fact, I thought about turning the movie off (and I never do), just to not confuse its plot with the beauty of the book. But this is an overrated movie and, while it is not so bad, the book should come first, since it was the first. And it should have been the only history of Division Street and Frankie Machine.
