this movie sucks a big So many holes in the plot. If the devil is invincible, why does he require the protection of Arnie's bodyguards? I could not understand why Arnie did not show up for work for several days and then suddenly appears, takes all his arsenal and disappears again. Good job if you can get it. It is sad that the last 1/2 hour has to result in the standard end of arnie 'uzi 9mm'. Arnies' interpretation of a depressed policeman is to tilt his head and smell. I thought I had a bad cold for most of the movie. With a terrible script, Arnie is called "friend", "friend", etc. for 95% of the movie and suddenly we hear that they call him by his real name of Jericho Cane (where do they get these names?). The end is so good that it is better to have the bag of steers ready. Too bad that Gladiator has achieved the same end with 100% more class. <br /> <br />
