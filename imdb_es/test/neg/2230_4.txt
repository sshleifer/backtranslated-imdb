My Take: Typically routine and lazy directly to the Disney video attempt. <br /> <br /> Disney must have fallen in love with the tradition of the family movie that is the family dog. Many films have been dedicated with stories that only focus on man's best friend. Disney themselves have made a handful. They also made a handful of those who are literally dogs. Add this to that group. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the original for a long time, so I probably am not the right person to judge if this direct sequel to the video is better. . Anyone over seven is not the right person to see it either. Maybe only the youngest of the youngsters will want to see LADY AND THE TRAMP II: SCAMP'S AVENTURE, and even they would grow up and say it was not the best kind of family entertainment they had ever seen. I suppose to be fair, what I can say is that it guarantees a rental, but that's not much to say. <br /> <br /> This sequel practically collects the parts that remain after the original called classic. . Lady and Tramp now have a litter of cute Crocker Spaniel puppies ... and a mischievous mestizo named Scamp, which is a chip from the old block. Instead of the confines of the home, Scamp wants to run away with the other scrap dogs in the city, unknown to his father's own past as one of those mestizos in the streets. To capture the charms of the original, it throws the same love story of poor dog / rich dog, and vice versa. Scamp falls in love with one of the scrap dogs named Angel (and who would not do it with a name like that and a voice that sounds like Alyssa Milano?). Repetition of the famous spaghetti scene! Aside from the "cute" factor, there is nothing in the store for any audience in this lazy direct video work. Continue with the original. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
