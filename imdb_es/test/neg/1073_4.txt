I could not relate to this movie. I'm surprised that people praise him for being so "realistic". How many people in your school were victims of incest? How many homosexual athletes were there? How many quiet people you never noticed committed suicide? Hmmm OK, you would not know, even if they were. But in reality these are explosive problems that many of us never face. And yet, there are so many teenagers with subtle problems that could have been explored. But, hey, where's the 'entertainment' in that? <br /> <br /> Regarding the girl who committed suicide, I found that this is exploitative. In fact, I think that MANY people in high school at some point feel invisible, ignored and unwanted. But, what possesses someone to commit suicide violently in one more day of being ignored and going unnoticed? The filmmaker decided that this girl would commit suicide to make the film more provocative. And the graphic nature of suicide to make it even more provocative. I did not buy it as a real life scenario. <br /> <br /> And the problems of the other students with whom I did not completely relate. School bullying is explored but it has been done to death, we all know that it continues and that it really is a matter of resolution within that person. Closet homosexuality? Pfft, another cliché starts. That's what really, too many clichés. I guessed the ending at the beginning. There was predictable unpredictability if that makes sense. You have all these characters with explosive problems, and one with apparently none. And I thought, what is the point of this character unless she is the unsuspecting victim of suicide? And surely enough ... <br /> <br /> One thing I will say, and it is the salvation of the movie, is that it does NOT seduce suicide. Suicide is very graphic and heartbreaking to watch. It's a powerful scene (regardless of how clever it is) and one that rules out suicide as an easy option. But the film really is not very imaginative and it uses stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Not bad, but certainly not innovative Or worthy of a 17-minute ovation at Cannes?
