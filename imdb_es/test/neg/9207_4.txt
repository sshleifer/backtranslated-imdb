The first half of the movie is not that bad really. Although in reality there is not too much depth in the characters, the story is in some way funny and in general is fine, with potential to improve, which is not the case. <br /> <br /> In the second half, things get worse, not only for the characters in the film, but also for the viewer, who will basically wait for the story to reach its obvious end. <br /> <br /> The previous user's comment mentioned: "It's a love story, a road movie, a thriller, a comedy of errors, a movie of the 80s and, above all, it's a movie by Jonathan Demme. "<br /> <br /> Well, let me rephrase that:" It's about a boy, the story of the girls, they're driving in cars, the excitement is gone as it's very clear how things will evolve, there was no scene in this movie where you could laugh out loud, you have a bit of 80 feeling and yes, Jonathan Demme really was the director.
