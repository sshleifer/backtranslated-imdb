From the first shot of the meteor that falls towards the Earth, you know that something special awaits you. <br /> <br /> This is an ultra-low budget capture in a video movie about a group of teenagers stranded on a lighthouse island. with some monsters. History has nothing special and nothing you have not seen a thousand times before. The performance is not excellent, but it is not completely horrible, however, the special effects, of which there is a good deal, are, at best, ridiculous. In fact, if you can read this sentence, it is better than 50% that you can do a more credible job creating the effects of explosion and video composition in this film than the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The Salvation of the Movie - If you fancy a turkey from a Z-grade movie - it's always something that happens and never gets boring. And if you like to make fun of bad movies with your friends, you may find it worthwhile to rent it for a dollar. <br /> <br /> And I must say that I appreciate the opening joke, "that's the dumbest name for an island, I've never listened to it." Probably the best moment of the movie.
