When this show came to Disney, I love to start watching it all the time. It quickly became one of my favorite Disney shows, but somehow it became something that is disturbing and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Now I find something of the fun of the second and third season, they seem like a repeat. See some teen shows. I hat that garbage. The first season was very unique because it showed Sadie that she loved science, animals and creatures. The first season was very entertaining. I mostly do not like the second season for Ben. He bothers me and pisses the shit out of me. The plot in the second season also sucks and is just horrible.
