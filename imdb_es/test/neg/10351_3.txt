It's not too bad, but ultimately, it lacks the quality that the Australian series has. <br /> <br /> The jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (they should not be), the filmmakers think too much about cinematography (it's supposed to look like a home video) and it's like a serious version of Kath and Kim ... it's stupid. <br /> <br /> It's too normal for Kath and Kim to be. Kath and Kim are supposed to be two middle-aged women with curves who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes. There is no "Look at me Kimmy!" jokes Kim's fat friend is not fat at all and is not even a bit stupid. She is a stereotyped black / Latina girl. <br /> <br /> It's not as stupid or as fun as the Australian series. It does not compare. Nothing is the same. I admit, this program is quite funny at times, but it is NOT something like the Aussie series. I was looking forward to an American taking a Bogano family. They failed. It's supposed to be REALLY stupid and hilarious, but the actors do not act stupidly! For me, this is just a typical American television show. It's a disappointment if you want it to be something like the Aussie show. <br /> <br /> 2 stars because it is an OKAY program, nothing like what it should be.
