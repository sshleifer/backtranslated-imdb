I found that this movie is extremely homophobic ... the main character does not know he is gay until he realizes that he likes Barbra Streisand and has a loose doll. I felt so offended that after the screening at the Toronto Film Festival, I went and talked with the screenwriter to complain about this movie. This is the kind of movie in which GLAAD needs to work to have it banned.
