I loved discovering that TCM was showing this, since I love the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Joan Plowright ... This movie had a shine from Ann Harding, a wonderful performance by Frank Morgan, but the performance of others The movie more of a farce then the wonderful display that the subsequent film. Reginald Owen's Arbuthnot is painful to watch and you can not understand why his wife adores him. After watching the movie, I discovered that it was based on the theatrical work where the 1992 film is based on the book. The original film also felt as if it were a fragment of a larger piece and felt incomplete. Too bad it was a disappointment.
