I bought a film of this movie based on the recommendation of other IMDb users and I have to say that I was very disappointed. I'm a university professor and I showed this movie to my class; They voted unanimously that it is a terrible movie. I guess if you like the old Dark Shadows series, maybe you like this. (I liked Dark Shadows when I was a kid in the 70s, but now I think it's just horrible). The first half hour or so has the virtue of a certain fidelity to Wilde's novel. After that, the story deviates from the course, at least compared to the 1945 MGM version (which won two Oscars). Nigel Davenport as Lord Henry is really the only thing that can be seen in the entire production. Many of the other performances are bad, the music is melodramatic and the appearance of the film is terrible. Actually, it's not a movie at all, obviously it was filmed on video and it has that characteristically claustrophobic aspect of the BBC. The initial scenes are particularly poorly lit, the women's costumes are terrible (men look good), and many of the characters, including Dorian, seem to have a Victorian hairstyle from the 70s. The film does well to include a lot of Wilde's dialogues, but the voice-over narration in Dorian's voice contains a lot of trash that directly contradicts Wilde's character. I'm a big fan of Oscar Wilde, and I'm afraid he must have shot violently in his grave when this monstrosity occurred. His only improvement over the 1945 version is that the homosexual subtext is definitely more apparent, without being clumsy. I have not seen any of the newer versions, but if anyone is interested in seeing the story well told, I would have to recommend the 1945 MGM in black and white in this case.
