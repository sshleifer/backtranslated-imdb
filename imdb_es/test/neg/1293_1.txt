I really tried to give this movie a shot, but when I realized that most of the movie was being told by a group of bored officials who were walking and talking on the phone, I knew it was over. Much of this movie also seemed archival footage. That is simply unconvincing. <br /> <br /> The person on the camera continued to make these quick zooms without ANY REASON. It bothered me a lot, but I was wondering why the hell they thought it was a good idea. It does not add anything to a static scene of two people talking. This is not NYPD Blue or some police program or something like that. <br /> <br /> How is it possible that you have not realized that telling this guy a story of conversations of people in conference rooms and what is not, is ABURRANDO? Did not you see this mess? Anyway, this was just a really boring movie and it seems that whoever did it does not understand a good narration in the movie. <br /> <br /> Archive shit ... that's just wrong.
