I have rarely seen an action / suspense movie that was so boring. None of the action scenes is exciting, the story line is nothing special and, except for some actors, the acting is bad. Charlie Sheen (Squad, Major League) plays the Chief of Staff of the White House, who finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy that wants him and more dead people. Donald Sutherland (A Time to Kill, Fallen) plays a friend who tells him everything he can and Linda Hamilton (Linda Hamilton, Terminator, Dante's Peak) plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation. Charlie Sheen is well as a star, Donald Sutherland is a good actor who gives a good performance. Linda Hamilton gives a bad performance. With a bad movie, I can really like it if it has a good ending, but this movie has a very cheesy ending with some almost laughable things.
