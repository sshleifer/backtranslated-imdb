I felt that the episode from the previous night was slow and a bit boring at times. Honestly, I do not think it has to do with writing. Because I know that the story was well organized and tried to keep things in place. I thought it was not so bad, but in general I did not enjoy it. The biggest fault has to do with the director of that episode: Stephen Williams. I always hated the address of Stephen Williams. If Jack Bender continues with this episode of the premiere of the season, he would have kept it at a good pace and would have kept things afloat to keep things interesting. I'm glad that Jack Bender is directing the episode next week and it will be much better and I'm glad he directed the first episode of Syaid and I'm curious about what he'll achieve this time, since Stephen Williams had directed too many Syaid Previous episodes . <br /> <br /> I always keep thinking that Stephen Williams should be expelled from the program. He does not even do anything interesting with the show. <br /> <br /> Why does the opening have to be done with a target when it is in the helicopter? It was so boring! Bad perspective of the camera work too!
