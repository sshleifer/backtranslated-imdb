This was quite inevitable. This film is taken from "The Core" and from the film from which "Armageddon" was taken, and from the movies from which it was borrowed, etc. Except that this time there's Luke Perry. This cinematic version of the familiar plot of saving the world involves the super earthquakes that begin in the Pacific Northwest and also extend the entire ring of fire. It was soon determined that everyone on Earth could be condemned. So the army and some scientists build one of those high-tech drilling machines to go inside the Earth and fix things (it would not be so much fun if they did not have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet). There is even a line in which attempts to make the trip to Earth seem more impressive than the journey into space (such as "Armageddon"). It's a Sci-Fi Network movie, so the script is a disaster movie by numbers. There are internal fights between scientists and the military, there are lasers that melt rocks, people die and sacrifice for the good of all, and above all, there are special effects (weak CGI). Not original and not so entertaining. This is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do, especially if you have beer.
