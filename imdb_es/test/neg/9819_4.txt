Disappointing movie with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler. When they discover it, they force him to sign a document indicating that he acted on the orders of England. His refusal to sign the document takes us to the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Pidgeon is chased to England by the evil George Sanders and his cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little, but is as always. , the embodiment of evil personified. <br /> <br /> On the path of persecution, Pidgeon meets Joan Bennett, the latter with a wonderful cockney accent. <br /> <br /> History gets stuck a little as love develops between the two, but again as we approach World War 11, realism becomes the object of the day. know where that arrow will go <br /> <br /> It is very interesting that while Pidgeon flees from Nazi Germany, he meets again a young Roddy McDowall, one of the many co-stars of the same year in the memorable "How Green Was My Valley". How green was "Hunting man"?
