All the great horror films of the 70s, 80s and early 90s, from Psycho to Texas Chainsaw Massacre (The original was not heated on WB), until Silence of the Lambs. The characters in these films were based on the crimes of Ed Gein. The writers and directors took advantage of the true story to be inspired by the creation of some of the best fiction movie killers of all time. <br /> <br /> The old horror movies were great because even though the crimes were freely based on the facts of the Ed Gein case, they were really fictional and very far from the real story. <br /> <br /> In the case of this film, they created a fictitious horror movie in which they tried to capitalize on real history to sell a cheap and badly acted love story between two characters that nobody really cares about. In fact, in a * good * horror movie, these two characters would have been excellent victims. <br /> <br /> End of the conference ... <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was like wearing a little sticky underwear on a cold afternoon drinking a good cup of ice cream.
