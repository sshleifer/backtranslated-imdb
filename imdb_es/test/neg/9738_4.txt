Maybe it's just me, but this movie seemed more a continuation or a follow-up than a separate project. Why? When it was filmed (a few years after the war), most viewers probably knew why Rommel was so famous, why his death was so important to Allies, why he was Hitler's favorite general, but now, 50 years later, it is not. It is already so obvious. <br /> <br /> "Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel" is a decent war movie, but it just does not explain in any way how Rommel got his nickname, what was he doing about it? Allied considered him as his best general, why were his soldiers so afraid of Afrika Korps? That's what is missing in this movie: we see his fame, his character, his way of dealing with soldiers and enemies, but for example. we also see that Hitler was complaining about his achievements in Africa, calling him a coward, etc. So, we're missing the big picture here, it's "Rommel's story", but unfortunately the "Desert Fox" part is missing.
