A silly and violent thriller that is a scam of 'Deliverance' but without any charm and intelligence. The plot is ridiculous and the cast seems tired and anxious to be free of this nasty entrance. This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea at all times. It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make their living in a mess like this.
