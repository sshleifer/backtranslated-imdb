I'm sorry, but they left the impression that these commands fought against zombies before. But surely they did not act as if they had seen a zombie before. Jumping and giving them back as amateurs. Second, the characters are pretty poorly written. The actors did the best they could with what they were given, blaming bad writing and bad direction. Finally, and this is where the spoiler warnings are higher. They lose the sample twice and the girl Jennifer Holland does not know if she has been bitten or not. How stupid is that? As much as it hurts to be bitten, one might think that he would know, in addition to the gallons of blood dripping from his body is a good clue. Silly, the first movie had its flaws, but it has surveillance capacity, unlike this disaster of a movie, which I could barely understand once. I give to THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD 2: NO GUTS, ALL THE STUPIDITY THE CRAP-O-LANTERN
