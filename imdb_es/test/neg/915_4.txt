It is difficult to qualify the first effort of a writer / director. After all, it's one more movie than I've written or directed. James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting, but suffered an unequal flow. <br /> <br /> After all, the idea that a man (Ja Rule) has to choose between the life of the bully and follow the line is common, and even fall in love with the daughter (Tatyana Ali) of the man who You killed yourself. To do it again requires something original, and this film lacks originality. <br /> <br /> I was attracted to the inclusion of so many favorites: Tia Carrere (Trues Lies, Wayne's World), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Frank Langella (Dracula, Good night and good luck) and Ving Rhames (Palisandro, Dawn of the Dead). They did not disappoint in their performances, but they had little to work with. <br /> <br /> Direct to the video is becoming more common, but that does not mean it has to be a waste of time. Maybe Hunter's second year effort is more enjoyable.
