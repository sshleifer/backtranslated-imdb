This movie has one of the worst main characters in the story. I say this because he is made to be the hero when, in my opinion, everything he does in the whole movie ruins people's lives and causes problems. He can not do anything right, however, the film makes him look like the great guy that everyone should admire. He has temper tantrums at the wrong times, he has wrong postures about the things that end up getting people mad and killing him, he's too intrusive, too aggressive, too macho, assuming he makes the wrong decisions. and it has no common sense. <br /> <br /> This is a private detective hired by a successful painter to find the woman and child he left years ago. The detective finds the woman and what he thinks is her son. However, all sorts of things happen to make this story full of crime, drama and twists. It's made for television, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is pretty entertaining. Johnny Depp is very young in this case and has a horrible 80's haircut. He chews gum and throws a soccer ball for about 5 minutes and that's all we can see of him. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the exhausted VHS version of this is sold for $ 40 at online auctions. It should be only for the Johnny Depp collectors. It could not be because of the plot. Would not be. <br /> <br />
