It seems that all companies that enjoy the taxes taken by Romania for photography, give the image that disappears since 1994. Almost do not try to get the oldest car they founded, but never take pictures of Lamorghini, Ferrari, Aston Martin and all new Mercedes that are more the ones that you can find in some important countries. <br /> <br /> A second problem is that they filmed in some neighborhoods of Bucharest, where they had the possibility to clear the streets and put trash cans. Dress up people I do not know maybe the '90 clothes make them look so stupid that you'll realize that the script was maybe a second hand bought on ebay or worth it. <br /> <br /> I hope in the future to continue making movies in the USA. UU and earn a lot of money there to give us a little and shame our country. I have no reason to believe that someone understands the message (beyond my English ---: sorry)
