This Spaghetti Western uses three main American actors that take away a bit of the typical aura of spaghetti. The plan is about an amnesty that the governor of New Mexico gives to all criminals who wish to give them the opportunity to start a new life. In general, this kind of opportunity is limited to past events, but in this film it seems more like a license to kill because even new crimes (like, for example, threatening the governor) are forgiven. The story is an endless chain of murders where almost all the characters are only meant to deliver more corpses. Only the few cables have resistance. Clay McCord is tormented by nightmares related to a childhood event where, as expected, he killed many people. In the midst of eternal chaos, this type of reflection lacks credibility. Compared to similar movies, for example, BANDIDOS, none of the characters in this movie was nice to me. <br /> <br /> Apart from the weak content that is directed to certain clients, this film is well filmed, the scenarios are somewhat detailed and the performance is average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
