Woa, talk about horrible. Do not waste your time. I wish I had seen the other usage comments first. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I did not see the whole thing. It was too horrible. The worst, the worst of the dialogues ... I could go on and on. But what really made it unappealable was the address. The poor actors. You can not even tell if they have any talent because not only do they have pathetic lines to talk about, but the director did not give them any action. If you check the director's filmography on this site, you will see why this movie did not have a chance. <br /> <br /> This would not even be as good as made for the TV movie. <br /> <br /> Oh!
