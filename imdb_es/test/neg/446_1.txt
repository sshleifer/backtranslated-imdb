Lamentable and unnecessary sequel to a classic in good faith. An American werewolf in London was unquestionably a gem of a movie: humorous, insane, with just a touch of romance and very, very British that made me want to stop and sing God Save the Queen every time the movie ended. Then came this abomination. You know you are in real trouble when the cables are so unpleasant that you rejoice when they are killed, and actually start encouraging the lycanthropes. I tell you the truth, folks, I only managed half of this CGI farce before losing the will to live and turn it off. Absolutely regrettable and a putrid loss of time of either.
