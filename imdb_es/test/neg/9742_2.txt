How this character was once hired by the post office is very far from me. The test that postal workers take is very difficult. There's no way a stupid guy can work at the post office. Everyone in this movie is stupid and that is probably the point of the movie. How they could go their whole lives and not see an elevator is also disconcerting. I did not take this movie too seriously, but it was so stupid. So you try to start the car without your keys? Many horrible scenes and a horrible performance, and this movie is not funny at all. It's just a sad and stupid disaster. However, I liked the mom's dress. <br /> <br /> Send it to the sender as soon as possible.
