The main character is a plaintive and irresponsible study of how to make a party of grief. She loses it in the blink of an eye, acts pathetic, is schizophrenic, and left me wondering why on earth she does not understand why these "friends" of her have not called her in three years. (Get a clue, sister, you are a youth disaster!) I could not stand it or her friends. I never felt connected to any of the characters. To make the whole movie even more unbearable, someone did everything possible to stage the most frightening collection of knit and crochet hats that exist in the film for all eternity (this should only guarantee that someone is put to the test of costumes for a decade!) <br /> <br /> The performance was not horrible, but neither really credible, and in the end the only thing that mattered to me was the two hours I'll never go back. Do not waste time, go to a dentist appointment!
