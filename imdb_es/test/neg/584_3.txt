Although the comedies of Our Gang still have their followers, I must say that their attempt to graduate in feature films, courtesy of Hal Roach, was very brief. Why did Roach have to choose the Civil War since he is subject to all the racism that would accompany him? <br /> <br /> The risky southern gentleman Phillips Holmes receives the young orphan Spanky McFarland and his young black friend Buckwheat Thomas after Spanky inadvertently Exposes a cheat card on a riverboat. Everything is placid and serene in the Old South and then the Civil War ruins everyone. <br /> <br /> But even kids can love the worst in the world and there's nothing worse than those damn Yankees. They just come south and ruin it for everyone. <br /> <br /> Although criticized for his southern point of view, Gone With The Wind made a good case for the cause of the South and the blacks portrayed even though they were subservient as they would be. Out of necessity are still three-dimensional characters. Hattie McDaniel would not have won her Oscar if it was not like that. The character of Butterfly McQueen's Prissy, as silly and vacuous as it was, has a certain dimension. <br /> <br /> Here, however, is perhaps one of the worst racial stereotypes ever produced in Hollywood. The company of Spanky and Buckwheat shows that children get along, racial feelings are acquired, not consecrated. It is not the servility of the blacks that is objectionable, but its total acceptance. From that horrible watermelon song, sung in the title credits, General Spanky's message is bad. <br /> <br /> However, he got an Oscar nomination for the sound recording, probably one of the few Hal Roach. Once he left the field of short topic. <br /> <br /> General Spanky is far from Gone with the Wind.
