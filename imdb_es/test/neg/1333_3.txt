Yesterday I hired the DVD and, in the first place, it started badly, it's a movie with an aspect ratio of 4: 3, and it keeps getting worse, the acting is very bad and the movie itself is very predictable. myself: this is going to happen next and guess what happened? right ... <br /> <br /> if you want to see a good action boxing movie, do not look at this, you will end up disappointed with this low budget movie, like I did. Go and see Ali his way better!
