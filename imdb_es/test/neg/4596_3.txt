I rented this on my local Blockbuster under the SPECK title - that could be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this revision. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about serial killer Richard Speck, who killed several nurses in Chicago in the 1960s. When you see the movie, you have the feeling that it follows the crimes of the letter. Unfortunately, that does not work for a good movie. <br /> <br /> Another problem that I had was the almost constant music that allows us to know that it is a VARIABLE MOVIE, and an awful narration that allows us to know what Motivando a Speck is. The performance was average for this type of film; To give credit where credit is due, the film is very well photographed for my liking. Your mileage may vary. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are interested in the subject, it can be worth your time.
