A new version of a successful movie can be a difficult business at best; remaking a true classic, especially one that truly is the definitive film of a director like Alfred Hitchcock, is something else. And after seeing this version of 'Psycho', directed by Gus Van Sant, I immediately think of two things: what is the point and what the hell were you thinking? Especially in light of the fact that Van Sant used the same script (by Joseph Stefano, taken from the Robert Bloch novel) that Hitchcock used. The final result here highlights some of the finer points of film art: first, that a 'remake' should be just that; an update of the original, instead of a "copy" with new players; and secondly, shooting in color, using more blood and being a little more graphic only diminishes the impact of the film. Although this was a noble effort of Van Sant, ironically in the end suffers the same defect with which Norma Bates was affected: the "mind" of the film was divided; Half was Hitchcock, half Van Sant. And the two, although they fought, will never be tied. Van Sant, even working with the original script, would have been better to make his own film, in everything, instead of trying to duplicate exactly what Hitchcock did with certain scenes. The first plane of the film, for example, and especially the scene of the 'shower', possibly one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema. Copying Hitchcock, from the shots looking directly at the head of the shower to the drain, and using the same `skree! Skree! Skree! 'sound effects, even as a tribute to Hitchcock, again, just distracted from the story. And, if you take into account the performance of William H. Macy (as Private Eye Arbogast), you have another division in the psyche of the movie. Macy is an excellent actor, one of the best character actors in the business, and his performance here is excellent; but as good as he is, the attitude and delivery are pure David Mamet (with whom he has worked many times), and apparently out of context with what Van Sant is doing. So the film ends with a triple personality disorder: Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet. I felt like I was watching 'House Of Good Will Psycho Games'. <br /> <br /> As for the performances, Macy's was as solid as they are, and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) did a good job of creating an original character, escaping the trap of attempting an imitation of Janet Leigh . The weak links were Viggo Mortensen (Sam), who made Marion's boyfriend so attractive and unattractive that it made you wonder why he had anything to do with him in the first place; and Vince Vaughn, who, to put it in the most delicate way possible, was simply as horrible as Norman Bates. His complete performance was that of an actor playing a role (and not very convincing); affecting effeminate mannerisms and puncturing his speech with "spontaneous" outbursts of manic laughter, he made his Norman a caricature rather than a character, totally incredible and pretentious. It gave the movie the feeling of a recreation of a "true incident" that you would see on a television show; It would have been entirely in accordance with the sensibility of the film to move away from Norman sitting alone in his living room to a photo of Peter Graves with a sober face, intoning: "Such was the mentality of Norman Bates in that fateful, rainy night when Marion Crane He left his car and entered his life ... 'The cast includes Julianne Moore (Lila), Robert Forster (Dr. Simon), Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers), Anne Haney (Mrs. Chambers), Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), Rance Howard (Mr. Lowery), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Remar (Patrolman) and James LeGros (Charlie the car dealer) If nothing else, "Psycho" by Van Sant is a curiosity that shows that having a good director, a predominantly excellent cast and a script that is a proven product does not necessarily ensure success. Granted, today's era of psychology, 'American Psycho' and Hannibal Lecter have effectively taken advantage of a character like Norman Bates, but all There is still a singular intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between Norman, his mother and his victims that will always be intriguing and terrifying forever; but Van Sant is unable to convey that feeling of fear, that fear that squeezes the throat with this movie. If you ever made a movie that should have been directly assigned to the video, here it is. Better yet, if he had never been born. I rate this 2/10
