This was more a love story than one about an angel coming to earth, although at both angles of that story they are given a good part of the movie. <br /> <br /> If I took this film seriously, as someone who knows and believes the Bible, I would have kept it fast enough, but I do not think the general environment was mean or blasphemous. It was just ridiculous or just stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean, John Travolta like a dirty angel? Of smoking? Scratching your groin? To quote the Beatles? An "angel in war" who knows nothing about heaven? An angel that flirts with all women? Yes, everything is absurd and, of course, biblically incorrect. <br /> <br /> I could tolerate all that, but I do not know how many people, regardless of what beliefs they have, could endure a boring movie that turned out to be during the second half. It begins to creep when the romance between William Hurt and Andie MacDowell begins. Part of the dialogue during that romance is so stupid that it is an insult to any discriminating spectator. <br /> <br /> This is another film directed by Nora Ephron. Man, I can not believe how many incredibly stupid films this woman has written or directed. At least she is consistent.
