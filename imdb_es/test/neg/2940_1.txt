Get away as much as possible from this ... No, seriously I mean it. I know you can think that this is a funny, corny and cheesy Hong Kong action-style movie. I did it, but believe me, it's not. In fact, the only thing accurate about that description would be the words Hong Kong, and then they are only used in a strictly geographical sense. <br /> <br /> Yes, Donnie Yen has co-directed it. Jackie Chan has a cameo. The boy Ekin Cheng, from Storm Riders, plays the main role. He has vampires. It must be good, or at least fun, charming and full of action. Once again, it is not. <br /> <br /> I could ramble on why this movie sucks, I could dissect it, cut it into tiny, trembling pieces. But where to start? There's a lot to hate ... <br /> <br /> To make it easier, and to give some credibility to this hate festival, let me say that I'm usually a big Hog Kong movie fan. The heaviest drama, as well as the most casual action and / or comedy. The really good movies, as well as the really cheesy ones. I can sit for hours of bad captioning, jokes foolish enough for first graders to roll their eyes. I can handle lovers as chaste and celibate as a convention of nuns, that and almost anything else that the average movie viewer would hit with their metaphorical fingers on their way between the action sequences. Also, Hong Kong or any other origin: I love it when a movie goes from being bad enough to being bad enough to being good. <br /> <br /> But this: Arrgh! It's just horrible, stupid, irretrievable garbage. So far from being fun or charming is really painful. So derivative of the action makes a Bergman movie look like the Texas massacre. <br /> <br /> Why? Why waste such an opportunity? This could have been so much fun!
