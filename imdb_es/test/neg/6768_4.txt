I was quite impressed with this movie when I was eight or nine years old. The mobsters seemed very real to me and they threatened me, and I could see why people were afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing him as an adult, it seemed almost comical, due to the exaggerated narration and discordant details like the thugs of the thirties who drove cars that looked like the fifties. There is a certain harsh and unglamorous reality in the way criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad telenovela. The most memorable and funniest without wanting to accompany me is the scene in which Ma Barker and his children are shooting with the FBI and the children are killed. The narrator says something like "Maybe at that moment, for the only time in his life, Ma Barker became a real mother". This is supposed to be a time of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she has destroyed her family by her own greed, but instead, provokes laughter. A very strange movie that rarely shows anywhere these days. Fans of gangster movies can enjoy it, but more like a curiosity than a real movie.
