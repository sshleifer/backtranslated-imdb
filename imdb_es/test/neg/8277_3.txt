This film was pure, slow and laborious torture. Not being a fan of slasher movies and preferring classic horror, he may not be the best judge. Slasher fans can enjoy this as an early entry in the Slasher genre. I would really like the 90 minutes that I spent seeing this again. The only reasons to see this are: 1) a young Vanna White (before Wheel of Fortune) who has approximately 3 minutes of total screen time. 2) an early role of screaming queen Linnea Quigley (with nudity) and legendary beauty EJ Peaker as school secretary, who added a bit of humor and sex appeal. Otherwise, a band from the 80 called Felony makes an appearance that, although it is interesting, is prolonged too much in WAY. Like the movie ... I had to keep checking how much time I had left and I could not wait to "graduate" for a better movie.
