What the hell was the point of this boring movie? It seemed interesting at first, but quickly fell flat on his face. It's supposed to be based on a true story, but to shout out loud, are not there more scriptwriters in Hollywood? I've seen these guys in some of the best movies ever made, the defoe can play almost anything and when I see that it's in a movie I do not have a problem renting it, but I'm starting to wonder. great actor is also slipping; Maybe its hard or just losing your senses. The dialogue was long and terribly heavy, especially at home with the family. I wonder if the actors thought they were successful here. maybe ... uh..an oscar?
