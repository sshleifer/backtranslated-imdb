This is one of the worst movies I've seen. Not only is it a comedy, it is not fun, but it is also very badly done with an exaggerated direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects. <br /> <br /> The two "heroes" with their fancy language are simply annoying and quite confused, they were touching each other genitals all the time. But the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give a little bit of appeal to that film, by referring to German history and showing the sensitive aspects of the "heroes", which find their highlight by showing how Erkan and Stefan heal to a woman with mental illness. his "cheerful" lifestyle (!). But I did not expect anything better from director Michael "Bully" Herbig, who also made two non-funny TV shows, a non-fun western movie and a SF comedy movie almost no fun. But Erkan and Stefan had been, just a little bit, better at some of their support programs. For me, the only good thing about the film is Alexandra Neldel, who is very beautiful to me.
