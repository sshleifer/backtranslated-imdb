The Mexican werewolf in Texas is located in the small border town of Furlough, where Anna (Erika Fay) lives, her best friend is Rosie (Martine Hughes) and she has a Mexican boyfriend named Miguel (Gabriel Guti√©rrez) who is determined to track down to a beast. He has been terrorizing the city, killing livestock and several residents, including some of his friends. Local Mexican legends speak of Chupacabra, an evil creature of myth and legend. Erm, I'm fighting now because really nothing much happens ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Scott Maginnis. I'm not going to walk around here and I just say that the Mexican werewolf in Texas is horrible, period. The script only mentions the word werewolf once and the rest of the time refers to a Chupacabra, in fact, I suspect this was not really conceived as a Wolf Man movie. The creature 'Werewolf' looks mostly hairless and more like a vicious dog, there is no reference to someone changing during the full moon and actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions, there is no transformation scene and in the end, when it kills, it does not change again in anyone either. To be honest, apart from the title, here is nothing to indicate a werewolf movie, and even then the title is just a scam of the very popular American Werewolf in London (1981). This is the kind of homemade junk that I personally think is killing the horror genre, how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981) , Halloween (1978) or Friday the 13th (1980), all made with shoe string budgets, maybe The Blair Witch Project (1999), but that's all in recent years and the shit like the Mexican werewolf in Texas It has no chance of being considered a classic. The characters are horrible and things just happen around them, the dialogue is rubbish, the rhythm is terrible, the story sucks and practically sent me to sleep and, in general, this movie sucks, I'm sorry, but I do not know How to describe it in another way <br /> <br /> Director Maginnis does not do anything for this to be seen, there is the annoying camera-type handheld camera that could easily cause someone a headache and a quick 'blinking' and will miss something 'editing What simply annoys and irritates in equal measure. It is not scary, there are no nudes, there is no tension or atmosphere and the special effects are terrible. The monster really looks poor and it is not surprising that Maginnis keeps him in the shade or that he cuts his scenes so fast that you never see him well. The image also has virtually no color, whether it is almost intense black or over saturated desert sand oranges, which causes the thing to become an eye pain as well. The gore consists of some false guts (blink and miss them!), Some bloody wounds and an amputated arm, great thing. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of approximately $ 300,000, I admit that the budget was low, but I simply refuse to accept that, to make such a garbage movie, there are a lot of low budget horror movies that They make their meager budgets go far. Everything looks like a home movie, has no style and is completely bland and boring to watch. The performance also sucks, although you probably already knew it. <br /> <br /> The Mexican werewolf in Texas will probably trick some people into renting it, buying it or seeing it, because they might mistakenly think that it is a continuation of John Landis's classic, that it is most likely that it's not and it's not even a proper werewolf movie. Do not be fooled, this is horrible and I'm sick of having to waste time / money on this homemade amateur shit like this.
