A THUNDER SOUND. One of the best short stories ever written. By one of the greatest Grand Masters of Fantasy, Ray Bradbury. What a great story <br /> <br /> But what a vomiting movie! <br /> <br /> In Bradbury's science fiction tale, a company called Time Safari offers big game hunters the chance to go back in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule number one is: Stay on the road, a floating metal walkway that ensures there is no interaction with the prehistoric environment. During a hunt, a man leaves the path and inadvertently crushes a butterfly. When the hunting party returns to the present, the world, as they know it, has changed drastically. Although there are paradoxes in any history of time travel, Bradbury's story was a rapid jugular strike, a parabola of the domino effect. <br /> <br /> In 1952 a thunder sound was published (according to Wikipedia, the most published science). fiction story of all time), and illustrated the theory of chaos, Darwinism and the butterfly effect (which would only be coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury's story, the wonder of time travel was overshadowed by corporate greed, in turn overshadowed by mortal danger to the very existence of humanity. <br /> <br /> While I was in the film, A SOUND OF THUNDER (directed by the mismatched Peter) Hyams, CAPRICORN ONE, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO), a handful of bad actors go through the time portal again and again to try to correct their mistakes, like a excrement version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The film has nothing to do with the powerful story of Bradbury, except the initial shake of the prehistoric hunting party in time. With the story of Bradbury, they take enormous liberties: baboon-faced reptiles, plants that surpass Chicago concrete, waves of time waving through the city, CGI insectoids, for which Bradbury should sue the filmmakers and breeches of the filmmakers . <br /> <Novice writers Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier should start a Big Balls Agency, for thinking that they could really add elements to a Ray Bradbury story that would improve it. How do these guys walk in a straight line with such big balls? Ben Kingsley is the corporate owner of Time Safari, with a wig so bad it looks like a wig, Edward Burns is his lead hunter, Travis, and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron MacClannough, in BRAVEHEART) is the scientist with the best breasts. <br /> <br /> I can not relate the hundreds and thousands of atrocious stupidities and asinine bits of dialogue, but here is one, said by David Oyelowo as a kind of "scientist": he refers to the Pleiades. star cluster, "The Seven Sisters, they look like stars, right? But each of them is a whole galaxy." Uh, no, idiot scientist, they're actually stars. <br /> <br /> Those three imbeciles who rewrote Bradbury's story forgot that they knew nothing about physics or astronomy. Or writing. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is Catherine McCormick's breast against her disheveled blouses of too small size. <br /> <br /> - Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for The Mania of the Poffy movie).
