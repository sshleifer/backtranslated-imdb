Worshiping Andersen's fairy tails as a child and recently having seen some interesting documentaries about this strange, though brilliant author, I was eagerly waiting to see this movie made for television. Unfortunately, the experience was nothing more than a disappointment that left me in anger and confusion. First of all, the story / script is full of inaccuracies and fantasies and, in this way, it creates almost a whole new story while shamefully abusing Andersen's fairy tales, probably to sell the shit to fools like me. Secondly, the pretty boy actor (do you really ... have you ever seen an image of the real Andersen?) Kieran Brew manages to portray Hans Christian as mentally retarded instead of the bright though very disturbed character he really was. Although annoying and irritating as Andersen, Brew lacks the charisma required to create any feeling of compassion. In third place. The love story between Andersen and the fictional Jetta (who really should be Henriette, the wife of Edvard Collin) ... Why? This man has lived such an interesting life, it should be enough as a basis for a great movie! <br /> <br /> This could continue to be a very long list, but I think it is safer to recommend all of you to do so. spend your time and money on something else instead.
