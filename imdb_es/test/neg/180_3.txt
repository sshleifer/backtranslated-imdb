This film seems to be an exhibition of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. Wineries around the world are increasingly joining large conglomerates (the US producer, Mondavi, in the case of this film) or paying high-priced experts to help them make "the perfect wine", and as a result, the Wines are becoming very standard and predictable. For some, this is a good thing (especially because few can afford $ 50 or more for an everyday wine) and for others it is horrible, since the uniqueness of the smaller wineries is disappearing. I can really understand the concerns of both sides and I do not think there is a villain or hero in this business. Sure, good and cheap wine is good, but as with beers (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping (European shopping centers are almost indistinguishable from Americans) and mega-stores like Walmart / Asda) are removing much of the uniqueness of "the little ones". So I was definitely ready and willing to listen to these filmmakers. However, with a product that lasted almost two and a half hours and a general lack of attention, the film simply became too big a task to see and I lost interest. A focused film of 80-90 minutes would have been MUCH more effective, especially because the average viewer is NOT an oenologist (that is the word of maximum expression for a "wine aficionado"). <br /> <br /> The positive side is that the filmmakers are smart to not talk much, and they just let those on both sides of the subject talk. In addition, the subject is so relevant and timely. However, despite having chosen a good style of documentary realization, the film simply follows its path, is too long and ends up making a very boring movie.
