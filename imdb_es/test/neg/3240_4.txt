So many bad critics, it made me wonder, what do people think while watching a simple movie made by a rather bad director? Did everyone expect an impeccable super-hit movie? No way, you can already see it, Raj Kumar Kohli loves multiple star films ... All his previous works were multiple stars, but nobody was perfect. Take the first Jaani Dushman, for example, many defects, but it's still fun. Anyway, following the movie, the film Jaani Dushman is a Hindi fantasy film about a snake, which can take any form (Armaan (Munish) Kohli) that is avenged by the suicide of his lover (Manisha Koirala) on people what caused it . It's pretty good, with a great stellar cast. But I think it could have been much better. For example, take the script, I can not say it's perfect. For example, take ages: <br /> <br /> Are you still studying at the university for 40-48 years? <br /> <br /> There are many many more, I will not list more, but there are a dozen more. A solid 5.5 is good for this. <br /> <br /> **. 75
