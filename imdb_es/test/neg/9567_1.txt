If this does not appear on all the "do not look" lists, it should be only because those who maintain that particular list are not aware of its existence, which, whenever that is the case, is the acceptable alternative. I'm not kidding you, this is a "bad" movie. Joseph Meeker returns from the dead, with several vague and indefinite supernatural powers, the most used of which seems to appear in new, increasingly comical and ridiculous (and never frightening or creepy ... in general, when this happens). the last of them ends up being weird and the attempts at the first simply do not work, they include clothing and stereotypes / archetypes, and he is played by David Keith (whom I respect in ... well, at least Daredevil), making a majority of the times not very inconsistent (which could also have to do with the script) and, often, the superior performance. A character or two have personalities so incredibly irritating that it is painful to see them. The edition thinks it is considerably smarter than it really is (and what the hell did the red dye have for the flashbacks?). Cinematography ... oh, dear. Framing, coverage, effective use of the angle (that could also be attributed to editing), please, guys, stop me when I say something that you have ever heard about the existence of. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, this is a pretty bad excuse to put something more valuable in the projector than an unexposed movie. But why stop there? The plot is simply poor. The basic idea has been made, and it has done much better than this (The Crow would be one). The way it is said is naive, and while there is an explanation behind the flashbacks, it still does not satisfy. The stimulation is almost nonexistent. Lead is clearly unpleasant, and there is more personality at the door of a barn, not to mention that they are also considerably less wooden. Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas? In the name of all that is good and just (pun), what are you doing in this? Perine, you were funny before this, on The Drew Carey Show, Nicholas, well, I had not seen you at all before American Pie, but if nothing else, you * were * funny later, and in those productions, the fun was intentional. The dialogue is ... the less said, the better. The language has no restrictions, and tends to be stupid. The violence is badly done, and it does not even seem that they care about trying to hide it (implying that it could have been the smartest strategy). Characters, do not make me start. Why spend so much energy in portraying events that are not interesting, sometimes absolutely illogical? The more you think about this, the worse it gets. It is not even passable as a "horror movie" or a B movie (you can go through the rest of the alphabet and go even further), you could not scare it into the most terrifying day of your life if you had an electrified healing machine. I recommend this only to people who want to refute how bad this is, and do not say I did not warn you. 1/10
