There is something intriguing about disaster films. The simple and primordial premise can lead to several great stories. Of course, most disaster films tend to explore familiar territory, but I can usually live with that. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Flood probably marks the lowest point in the history of this subgenre. Robert Carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the film, although screen time is divided between different locations and characters. It gives a barely decent performance. In addition, Joanne Whalley is very unequal. Veteran actor Tom Courtenay (who played in Doctor Zhivago for the love of God) is particularly bad. I mean, his time is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor. What a shameful performance for that man. The rest of the cast goes from decent to really bad, with one exception: Jessalyn Gilsig, who I thought might be there as a plot device / eye candy, gives by far the most compelling performance. It does not mean much, considering how bad everyone is, but it's still nice to see that she cared. <br /> <br /> The script is really bad, confusing and clich√©. Some of the worst lines I've heard in a long time are delivered by the actors, one after the other. You've seen this story thousands of times. Use each of the dramatic tear-jerks and hooks you've seen in "Outbreak," "Armageddon," the Poseidon movies (original and remake) and many others. <br /> <br /> The address is horrible. No sense of time, nothing inspired. The shots are vapid, dialogue and action do not flow. The edition is bad, but how is a disaster published? Undoubtedly, this film tried to rely too much on CGI (quite poor). The human factor, the drama and the struggles of the characters are overlooked. The scenes in which the characters must face the flood are rare and badly done. The feeling made for television nausea. Is it supposed that some guy drops a rope from a helicopter? No problem, let's show it inside a helicopter and do a really poor editing / cutting job and have the following picture with it on the ground, in the most obvious way possible. <br /> <br /> The score of the movie is quite poor. Everywhere, without time. <br /> <br /> The end is probably the worst I've seen in quite some time. Very much like they ran out of ideas. Discard it, you can not run out of something if you never had it in the first place. It must have run out of budget. <br /> <br /> This is a really amateur job. I give it a 2 for using London as a location, which is a nice change, because Gilsig is really decent in a key supporting role and for the few CGI shots that were decent (those of the water that are closing on London and the doors ). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and check out Day After Tomorrow or almost any disaster film before it. This includes older classics such as The Towering Inferno.
