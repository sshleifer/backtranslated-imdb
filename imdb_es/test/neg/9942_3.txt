This is one of the many attempts of the USA. UU To remake an old classic British television show, which is more famous than this one. As far as I can see, none of you mentioned or acknowledged that you knew there was a television program from the 50s and 60s called "Secret Agent Man". The original agent of The Secret Agent starred the great Patrick McGoohan (The Prisoner, Braveheart, Ice Station Zebra, The Phantom, etc.) a man who was chosen to be the first James Bond, but rejected because McGoohan was a very devoted man and he considered the possibility that James Bond's bed would jump and violent ways of being against his values. <br /> <br /> This show was done in black and white, and it is a pity for those who have not seen it, you are missing a lot. The character that Mr. McGoohan played in "Secret Agent Man" was called Drake, and after he finished with that show, he went on to the very popular, if at times extravagant and controversial television series called "The Prisoner." The character he played in "The Prisoner" was that of an agent whose identity is not revealed, he is kidnapped and transported to an island where he does not know where he is or who was responsible for the kidnapping. What he does know is that his captors want to know the reasons behind his resignation from the British Secret Service, and on this island the population has no names, but they are called numbers and the Patricks character is assigned a number that is "6 "It was argued that his Prisoner character was actually the same character he played in Secret Agent Man, but McGoohan himself questioned it. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is the unmistakable famous musical theme that the original Secret Agent Man generated. . It was written by Johnny Rivers, a famous pop musician of the 50s and 60s, and from what I read some of you think the song comes from THIS version of the program. You are very wrong about that. It was Johnny's and it comes from the original television series, so let me help you clarify the facts. For those of you who complained that the program name was stupid, well in England, it was actually called "Danger Man" and in the United States it was titled "Secret Agent Man" by a supposedly stupid name that the program was fairly good. when it was first broadcast. <br /> <br /> Of course, this current program has little to do with the original, there is no main character named Drake in this, and I think they did everything possible to make this program their version of "Secret Agent" man". But he does use the remade version of the original song, so he tells him that this program was actually made to be remade, even if it's a remade lower version of the original series.
