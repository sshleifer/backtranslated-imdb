The New York lawyer plans to get rid of his senile mother after meeting an attractive and available woman. The screenwriter Robert Klane, adapting his own novel (the kind of pocket book that children would buy for dirty parts), does not seem to have any knowledge of mental illness: for him, it is just an excuse for comedy and eschatological jokes . George Segal, who in the 1960s starred mainly in war movies and espionage, had become, by this time, one of the greatest comedians in the United States; His crazy reactions and crazy answers only rival the inscrutabilities of his mother. Segal combines well with Trish Van Devere, and their moments of connection (although they are also played to laugh) are really the only sequences to which one can gravitate. Ruth Gordon, as kind as she is, is simply too much, and more of her equals less. This is one of the worst directed and edited movies I've seen of so-called professionals. Promising scenes that are ultimately not fulfilled for the full effect are randomly disconnected from other moments that are constantly shaken, which makes the rude and rickety film self-destruct long before it actually ends. * 1/2 of ****
