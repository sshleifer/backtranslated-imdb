The only interesting part of this movie is that it's jazz and reggae New Orleans back drop. Try to be one of those movies that has two struggles that the heroine has to overcome, one from the past and one from the present that fails to do so convincingly. The acting is bad and the direction is even worse. I'm not at all surprised that this has gone directly to the video. The final result of this film leaves no one satisfied or convinced, including the actors themselves.
