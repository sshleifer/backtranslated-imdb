Whatever PC Enforcers Committee, the person in charge of this film has achieved something that I never thought possible: take some truly talented actors (Davis, Hardin and Taylor) and make you want to make sure that you will never find them in a closed space, never. The feelings that underlie the script are so absurd and idiotic that it is impossible to understand or imagine to which audience this image would seem attractive, and much less fun. Architecture students, maybe? <br /> <br /> Only one scene is visually intelligent: Marcia Gay Hardin, with all the movements and rhythm, in one bar manages to exude more style and energy in ten seconds than the rest of the rest of the film was added and it multiplied to the tenth power. As for the other cast members, they probably will not want to include it in their résumés.
