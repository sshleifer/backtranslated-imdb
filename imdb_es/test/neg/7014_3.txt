A good design set. Good songs, although like the other guy said they do not perform with a lot of energy. Bea Arthur, doing her best to do something with the material, had an occasional good conversation as Mame's friend, Vera, and helped the song "Bosom Buddies" advance. Apart from that, there is nothing here that is worthwhile. Slow pace, incredibly bad cinemography, not very good singing (except for Robert Preston), a horrible script, bad acting (except for Bea) and a horrible main actress. Who thought that Lucille Ball would be as good as the elegant and life-loving Mame? The heads of Warner Bros. had no doubt in the crack when they decided not to use Angela Lansbury, who had done so well on Broadway, and instead use Ball, which was not as fun as it was 20 years ago. , he could not act in the "right" way at all, and he used a painful croaking as an excuse to sing. Even if (maybe because) making the film was difficult for her to do and even if she financed it, it's just not Mame. Auntie Mame is a better movie and the soundtrack of the Broadway musical with Lansbury sounds great. For the most part, there is nothing here that is great, attractive or interesting at all. Forget it, unless you're a big fan of Lucy who thinks she can not do anything wrong. With luck, after seeing this, you will realize that she was only human.
