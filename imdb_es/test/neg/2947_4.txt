This movie reminds me of Harry Potter, not the style but the marketing strategy. There may be part 2, part three ... until one day the product life cycle ends, of course with the condition that part one has a commercial success. So many things seem to be hidden and, therefore, the story seems quite incomplete. The action design is boring. The design of the set is fine, but it is not good. Maybe Edison Chen is a great star someday. It really looks lovely even on the big screen. The most impressive is still Anthony Wong. 4/10 <br /> <br />
