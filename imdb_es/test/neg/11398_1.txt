In fact, I still have doubts about whether there is anything in this movie that I like. As for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. The performance was very bad in my opinion. It is not very likely that Antonie Kamerling obtains a status of Rutger Hauer. Some people will wait for you anyway. First let him work on his pronunciation in English. If you see the "trip" to Paris of these actors (DVD-extra) you will most likely want to make an exit. Advice for Beau Dorens: stop your acting career, you will never succeed ... To the 2 main 'actors': grow up, please. Being generous, I would give 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
