A dark and funny story that involves a policeman who has a first hand experience with vampires and decides that he should quit his job to pursue these evil beings. The fight scenes were as hokeyas as the interpretation of a World War II battle in a high school student. The delivered lines were said as if the actors were not motivated to be there. The accessories were bad because they did not even seem to work in the least amount possible. Most of the film seemed shot in someone's basement (in some scenes you could see the beams at the top of a scene that did not look like a basement). The plot had no motivation to move forward or backward, it only seemed to have stopped at times without any reason for the actions of some characters. Sometimes I felt that the sound effects were out of place for this horror type genre and more than a cartoon series. It is similar to the movie Blade, in the sense that he is a hunter of African-American vampires. However, that's where all the similarities end, and the movie is more like a parody of Saturday Night Live.
