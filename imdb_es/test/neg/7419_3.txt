One minute in THE UNTOLD and the techniques of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PREDATOR are already up. Does this mean that we will be seeing many trees? Surely we will. Will we see an Austrian bodybuilder exploiting things? Well, this movie has the budget of a TVM, so the answer is a resounding no. Does anyone like these soft porn programs like BEDTIME STORIES? Well because there is a scene in this that looks like this kind of shows. Unfortunately the only thing you see is cellulite. Do you like it when the screen fades in black during a TVM? Great because this happens between each scene in THE UNTOLD. In fact, it also happens in every scene. Did you enjoy MILLIONAIRE - A GREAT FRAUD? Fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded commander, Charles Ingram, the contestant who tried to swindle the show with a million pounds. Seriously, one of the characters looks like Major Ingram. I kept waiting for him to say, "It's a bear, it could be a bear, but it could be a big foot, cough, cough, yes, it's a big foot, cough, it's definitely a big foot, cough, yes, I'm going filming it Final answer, Chris "<br /> <br /> Oh, and I mentioned that all the above points are positive points? <br /> <br /> WHAT'S NOT COUNTED is not the worst Bigfoot movie I've seen, That award goes firmly to NIGHT OF THE DEMON, which I saw more than twenty years ago and I think I've only seen less than a dozen movies that are worse in all that time, but that said, THE UNTOLD is still a very poor movie almost all aspects, especially in the editing, as other critics have pointed out, it seems that complete fragments of the film are missing, while there are other fragments where the scenes come together in the wrong order.This is a really bad movie that deserves much less that his grade of 5.1, I give him 3 out of ten and I'm being very kind.
