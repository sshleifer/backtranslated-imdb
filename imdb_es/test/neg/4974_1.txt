I started seeing this because I was looking for a good background comedy for my Sunday morning. Then I realized that it was going to be a road movie and I decided to really see it. <br /> <br /> The first 15 minutes were terrible, but I wanted to give it a try, because I never judge a movie without looking at it thoroughly. Then things started to improve a bit. This seemed like a good road movie about friendship ... But then the movie started to have horrible predictable cliche turns and when the movie ended, it made you feel like you had wasted time. Does this have something to say? Why did you make a movie like this? And I did not expect a modern Citizen Kane, but even so, I have several ideas of how this film could have improved. <br /> <br /> So follow my advice; Leave this alone and go see a real road movie. There are many of those. I will not make the directors of those films look bad by putting their names in this review. <br /> <br /> 1/10
