If this movie were outrageously poor, it would be fine, the problem is that many take it seriously. In short, some points: <br /> <br /> - There is no history, there is no focus, there is no advantage and all the questions raised can not find an answer. In general, the film is extremely repetitive and boring (I have been in African countries devastated by the war several times and I found all the persistence in the local misery and the despair very painful but still without meaning). <br /> <br /> - The questions raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are not questions but statements. <br /> <br /> - I am not a documentary maker, but what is the point of raising, for example, the issue of arms smuggling, if the only element that is brought to the audience is the statement of a local reporter? The director does not even bother to show us at least one sequence in which he would be waiting near the airport trying to spot heavy trucks leaving the area just after a plane landed. <br /> <br /> - The history of the fish takes less than 5 minutes, and is only compatible with a sequence in which the director films a documentary that is shown during a local conference. Did this guy do any work at all? <br /> <br /> - Extreme poverty shows up all the time in endless sequences, but where is the point? One can go almost anywhere in Africa with a handheld camera and, unfortunately, take the same pictures. Where is the great news? <br /> <br /> - Recording the prostitutes looking and crying over the images of their murdered friend and his partner in prostitution is the worst emotional manipulation that can be seen these days on TV and real television. <br /> <br /> - The parallelism between the famine that devastated the country with more than two million hungry people and the export of fish is absolutely useless, dishonest and has no more sense than manipulating the spectators in anti-globalization and the anti-Western feelings. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting debate in France after an academic published a very detailed commentary on the film, which brought together several journalists who worked in Africa for decades to investigate a little more about various details. It turns out that: <br /> <br /> - The waste of fish that is shown by drying in the sun and collected by some local people is not intended at all to be consumed by humans, but is collected to be exported by a reasonably good money for animal feed purposes. I think I'm not the only one who has had the impression that the director suggested exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> - The contraband of arms is a reality (but, again, where is the great news?), But not the This way this film explains the problem. If the empty planes that land in Mwanza are involved in the smuggling, they actually unload their shipment in a different place in Africa, then they go to Mwanza to collect fish so as not to empty the trip again (which means they really land empty). Mwanza ...). <br /> <br />: people eat fish locally, contrary to what the film suggests (around 40-60% of what is taken from the lake) and thousands of people make a living from it. Good for them! It is a private business of that kind that one day will take African countries out of poverty and not Western laments or endless foreign assistance. <br /> <br /> I can not say how surprised I am seeing the success of this movie!
