As the other guy said, you can count the words that have been said throughout the film in one of your hands. Too naked, she undressed like 7 or 8 times in a second and a half, far beyond your nudity. I'll find a movie behind that movie, He killed her the whole movie, bad acting, bad story, bad language, Carmen was swearing the whole long movie, so you come out of that movie, pornographic scenes and dirty language, To many gaps in the movie, a great silence from time to time. The only good thing about that movie are the beautiful places where it was filmed, otherwise, it's an hour and a half of your life that you're going to waste, so if I'm going to see that movie Good luck It's really Sux
