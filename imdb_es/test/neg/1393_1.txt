I love stand-up comedy. I love listening to the raw thoughts of the stand-up on stage, as they attract the audience of their classmates the different life experiences they have had, or the things they have thought or seen that they only thought were so good. Great that they had to share it with someone. <br /> <br /> There used to be people who were dealing with a person that everyone could relate to (Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or they were so crazy you could not help but laugh with them while they laughed at each other (Richard Pryor) And then there were the comics that make you think, like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a madman, was the smartest guy in the room, who called on people to rethink the things they saw when they walked and They realized how fucked up they were. Things were and the ease with which things could change. <br /> <br /> Now, this may seem like it has nothing to do with "Mind Of Mencia", which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy. Central's horrible solution to loss. of the "Chappelle Show", but he does it. Carlos Mencia dedicates half of the show to making criticisms for his audience, sometimes in popular themes, most of the time only in racism and racial stereotypes. Try to be the three previous types of stand-ups. He makes a theater character, a Mexican named Carlos who, despite the stereotypes, is a normal guy. Then he proceeds to try to laugh at others, at people he calls racists or simply at those who do not agree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents parodies to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see their point of view. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia always says he is showing a point of view that people do not use. I do not see, however, what it is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and jokes about death, but stupidly encourages people to listen to them and do the only thing that helps them stay around : laugh. <br /> <br /> The promotion of stereotypes is usually the lowest, but easiest, way to get laughs in the stand-up. The best comedians, who, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels that he is in good company, they do not have to resort to them. They speak universally, and they ask you to laugh IN absurdity, instead of that, as Mencia encourages. As you create more parodies or "real life" situations that require racism or the offensive of others with their use, they tell us, instead of asking us, to laugh, and present these absurdities as truth, instead of just extremes of it. <br /> <br /> His show is an insult to the minds of those who see him. Mencia does not give us comedy and asks us to digest her and take from her what we want (something that, however much I hate comparing them, was "the best quality of" The Chappelle Exhibition) tells us exactly how we should see and react to it , which, according to him, is to put on a stupid face and say "Dee Dee Dee Dee!" This show is called appropriately. In fact it is a show about "La Mente de Mencia". It is Mencia's mind, in its totality, and, as such, it is no more than silly entertainment. The program is tailored to give life lessons to its main audience, from 14 to 24 years old, about how stereotypes are bad, but the racial attack is fine for Carlos Mencia, and therefore it should be fine for you!
