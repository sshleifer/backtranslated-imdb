Just listen to the Broadway cast album and the voices of Barbara Harris and John Cullum, who do wonders for the wonderful score of Lerner and Lane. Then, with that beautiful cast recording in mind, watch the movie, with Streisand as Streisand, and Yves Montand reading his lines with a French accent so intense that a chainsaw could not cut it. The best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what Montand does to the introductory part of the title song. Listen as he sings / says: Could someone among us have a clue or a clue, what magic of magic and voodoo can he do? (That part sums up the problem that results from the release of "name stars" in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles.) I can just see Rex Harrison entering that scene and suggesting that Montand could also learn to Do justice to the beauty of the English language. <br /> <br />
