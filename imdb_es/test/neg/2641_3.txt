This "horror" movie lacks any horror or even slight suspense. Even the gore is not good. The argument would have some promise if someone did care about what they are writing / filming, but the people who made this movie obviously did not. Basically, the film proceeds in a series of attacks and starts like this: <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy. <br /> <br /> "Milo" hides in his yellow raincoat or rides in the front of a car on his bicycle. <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy and ramblings about her passion as a school teacher. <br /> <br /> Someone is killed in an unsatisfactory way. <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy and raises some false sobs. <br /> <br /> Are we seeing a pattern here? If you do not, you can enjoy this movie. Otherwise, look something else. The budget is low, low, low AND SHOWS (unlike saying, THE EVIL DEAD, which makes you forget your trash budget), and the acting is bad, bad, bad (with the possible exception of the concierge) . In general the film is boring, boring, boring. I can not think of a single scene that is really well made. In fact, I was so upset by the movie that I actually turned it off ten minutes before the end, something I rarely do ... heck, I saw HANDS, CLONES and WILD WILD not MSTED all the time. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Save yourself and look at the PHANTOM again.
