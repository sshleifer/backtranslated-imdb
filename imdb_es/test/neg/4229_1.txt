I just had the misfortune to see this really horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Think of that scene in Magnolia at the end with the slow panning of that woman. Now, remove the pan, add breath and unshaven men to the mix, and you will have what were the full 2 ​​and a half hours of Humanity <br /> <br /> The Inspector is a real dolt, not even a dolt, just a silly fool, slow simpleton movement. The way they once solved a crime surpasses me. <br /> <br /> Mandatory sex scenes are horrible and rewarding. <br /> <br /> The final villain of the piece (he raped and killed an 11-year-old girl) is sign-posted very early and it's not surprising unless he has a similar image. <br /> <br /> Uninspiring camera work. <br /> <br /> The director was there saying that it is up to the audience to provide their own interpretation of the procedures. I guess he also meant that they provided their own dialogue (everything is full of errors, which increases their level of boredom), the ingenious work of the camera (only static shots, completely eliminating the obvious beauty of the landscape in which it was filmed the movie) and the plot! br /> <br /> Really horrible. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10.
