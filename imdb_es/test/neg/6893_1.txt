This is a lower than average martial arts movie that is worth seeing because of the value of comedy due to the part in which a couple of symbols are used as weapons. That's what there really is a lot to say about this film that is lacking in all the departments because the martial arts are not so good either and with all the films of this type the dubbing is BAD
