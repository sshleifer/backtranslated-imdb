I know it sounds crazy but yes, I'm a big fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and I'm proud of it!). I hated part 3, and then part 4 comes along. I was like you were kidding me with this? Kid 'n Play is not found anywhere in this movie, and that would have been fine, if they had not foolishly titled the movie House Party 4, as if in some way, shape, form or fashion were related to their predecessors . . Each time this movie appears late at night in the USA. UU., I shoot my television with a rifle. Frankly, it's really so atrocious. * hurling * <br /> <br /> As the only remaining Kid 'n Play fan who will really admit to being a fan (tee hee hee), I was horrified. Do you remember that stupid group of an immature child? They sneaked into House Party 3. Okay, well and good, but how can it be that part 4 is just about them and nothing else and it also seems that they are not even the children of part 3. * confused! ! * House Party Fans: do yourself a favor and stick to House Party 1 and 2 and Class Act. Beyond that, everything else is ridiculous.
