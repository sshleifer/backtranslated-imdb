When reading the comments of other users, the review of A666333 has articulated most of what I was feeling throughout this predictable movie story, clich√© versions of lesbian / straight (ie, a heterosexual woman becomes a lesbian and concludes that her husband is abusive and aggressive). <br /> <br /> In addition, the score was severely disappointing. It was a soft, soft and sentimental music, another common cliche in the movies about lesbians. The film would have had some interesting dramatic moments if they had not been destroyed by music. <br /> <br /> Some scenes related to sex and eroticism also seemed to me attempts to increase the value of the shock, including parts of the final performance scene. The conventional "hot and steamy" moments were as boring as the score too sentimental. For example, during the pool scene, the women kiss, and then the camera moves over the abandoned wineglass, the water that flows, the sound of its heavy breathing over the soft shock of the waves. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked the most was the costumes and the stunts. They were well choreographed and the development of the attraction between the two characters felt very natural during the training scenes. I smiled genuinely during those, and during the last scene with the police officer. But they were not enough to balance the negative aspects or make me enjoy this movie.
