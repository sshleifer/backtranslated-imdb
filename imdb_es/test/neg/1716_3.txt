It's certainly a direct video, but the story is not as bad as most other reviewers think. I quite like the fact that the hero is doing the wrong thing most of the time. <br /> <br /> The reactions of the hero and the reactions of the rebels are simply human. The Hopper character is actually playing God. That could be the right thing, but we can not like it anyway. <br /> <br /> In the end, the player god is condemned to death, and the hero, who would have spent his own life, can live. A whole moral. :-) <br /> <br /> The most unrealistic thing I saw, is that the Earth is working very well without the Moon stabilizing its rotation.
