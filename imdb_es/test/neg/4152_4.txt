Those born to Vietnamese mothers and GI parents often found none. The Beautiful Country is the story of one of those children, Binh, rejected by his rural village who then struggles to find his American father. The film begins with a green and wild country, but it descends to dirty ugliness and sweaty boredom. The considerable talents of Tim Roth and Temuera Morrison are wasted on useless and ill-conceived papers aboard the rusty freighter that carries Binh and is dying brother across the ocean with what appear to be images of stormy seas. The city of New York offers slave labor and clich√© characters. Although very unequal since its inception, the great curiosity of this film is the final segment. Nick Nolte is given the maximum turnover between the cast. In a joking tone, I suggested that he probably would only be in the final scene and it was not far from the truth. As the trip takes Binh to Texas and his father, the film acquires a serene and austere simplicity. A tenuous coexistence unites these two men in a family of father and son. The ninety minutes of trash that we have just seen is rewarded by a deep and subtle interpretation of Nolte as they interact slowly. The credits rolled and I was surprised to see the names of Badlands executive producer Edward Pressman and West Texas native Terrence Malick.
