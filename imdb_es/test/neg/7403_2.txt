This movie lasted three hours, including commercials, on the History International Channel last night. But it felt like three weeks. It was not the cheap, funny and pointless representations of the bombing of Dresden. It was not that the film is stripped of almost the entire context surrounding the Second World War. It was not even that the bombing itself often appeared as nothing more than a great inconvenience to a silly love story. No, it was the characterizations of wood without distinctive features that took life out of history. Oh, and the fact that if it's possible for a movie to be obsequious, then Dresden is that movie. Perhaps a better title would have been DRESDEN - AS URIAH HEEP WOULD HAVE EXPERIENCED IT. <br /> <br /> It is especially this last point that irritates him. Was the bombing of Dresden a war crime? The creators of this movie think so. But in the typically emasculated way that Germans have come to approach World War II, they can not say that without meaning "peace" and "no more wars, anywhere" as if they were Mother Teresa. And, it is also typical of the German gifts to the British in particular, there is a difficult effort to crawl before "Britishness", while loading all the "fault" of Dresden to a person, Arthur Harris. <br /> <br /> Did I say a person? Well, not at all. At the beginning of the film, there is an exclamation of the main character, Anna, with whom we should all sympathize. "Damn Americans!" He yells, watching the bombs fall. And a few minutes later, a radio voice broadcasts warnings about the "American terror bombing" that is being inflicted on the Germans. <br /> <br /> Notice the word "terror". I have it? Actually, it is the Americans behind the inhumane targets of German civilians. It does not matter that the American strategy for almost the entire war in Europe was the bombing of "precision" of the industrial and war manufacturing sites. It does not matter that it was the British who enthusiastically adopted the "bombing" of the civilian targets area in Germany, even before the Germans attacked the British. No matter that the Americans bombed during the day, they suffered more casualties in the process than the British, to hit targets of precision, while the British bombed civilians under cover of the night. It does not matter that the Americans, essentially, have been taken to the real bombing campaign of the RAF, kicking and screaming against it. It does not matter that most US officials, from FDR to General Dolittle, opposed attacking civilians, while Churchill and his generals could not wait to do so. <br /> <br /> No, in DRESDEN, both the Germans and the British, with the exception of "Bomber" Harris, are innocent of a doctrine, is intimate, created by the evil Americans. And only the strength and power of a love story between a German nurse and a downed British pilot can adequately explain the "truth" of the atrocity. On the right. <br /> <br /> By the way, for the youngest and probably least read readers of IMDb, the first and so far only literary effort to give a reflective voice to the bombing of Dresden was the pacifist novel written by Kurt Vonnegut, an American prisoner of war in Dresden at the time of the bombing. I suppose the German ZDF could not find a pretty nurse for Billy Pilgrim.
