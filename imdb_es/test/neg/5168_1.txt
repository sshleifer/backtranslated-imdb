Of all the bad comments about this film and add them, I feel the same. It may seem that Australians are weak, rather than brave soldiers. In this movie it was very terrible and too graphic. I did not see enough heroism, just more cowardice, which is just as big because it's nothing I read. We do not need extreme violence to be able to use our vivid imagination of what happened. It's like saving private Ryan where the Nazi is slowly pushing his knife into the soldier. For example, Mel Gibson is an exaggerated director for his films, not because of violence but because of the level of historical inaccuracy. Letters of Iwo Jima was one of the war movies that was close enough to the story (although it could be wrong), except Flags of our Fathers and Bridge of the River Kwai. It is better that you read it, it is an insult to the victims and the fallen, if you do not say it right, and the film went on too long, there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and there was not enough retribution from the Australians to kill the Japanese . soldiers Just read the story on the internet, magazines and books. Movies always kill the sense of accomplishment. What they did to prisoners of war in Singapore and the Philippines was simply appalling to civilians. It just makes me proud to see that the goodies beat the bad, but movies like this ruin it.
