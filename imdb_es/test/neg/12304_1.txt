An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful book for children. Rude and inappropriate humor, some terrifying parts and an unhealthy story about the mother's boyfriend who wants to send the boy to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for children who will probably want to see him because of the book (3- 8 years. Do not waste your money, your time or your good judgment.
