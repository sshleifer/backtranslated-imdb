Apart from Frank Kress (who played Abraham Gentry), an appearance by Henny Youngman and the last few seconds of the movie, there was really nothing particularly good about this movie. The reason why she currently has a rating of 5.3 and that some critics love her surpasses me: the movie has 99.44% shit ... and that is exactly what I would have expected from director Hershell Gordon Lewis. In the sixties and seventies, Lewis was known for making a series of exploitation films with an incredibly low budget, such as BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER A GO-GO. However, in recent years he has been baptized as "the father of blood" and has many, many fans, fans who ignore the ineptitude of their work and only focus on the innovativeness of some of his films. But aside from the liberal use of fake blood and real guts, deep down, their movies are pure shit, and they do not believe in scores of 9 and 10 for their movies. This would be like putting a velvet painting of Elvis in the Louvre !! <br /> <br /> The film is about a series of very scary murders that happen to strippers. When I say scary, it is very bloody and sick for 1972, although by today's standards the special effects seem incredibly boring. So, while in the film some very devious and cruel murders happen (I prefer not to explain them, they are of a very sick mind and show a particularly sick disdain for women), at least they will not discourage you because they got so bad. Many cases are cutting rubber dolls and mannequins. But having them do some of the sick acts, even if they are unrealistic, is quite unpleasant and shows a lot of misogyny. <br /> <br /> The only hope in the movie, since the police are all idiots, is a guy named Abraham Gentry, whose manners and style of speech are very close to the stock actor, David Lochary, of the first John Waters movies. While his performance is bad, it is so extravagant and fun that he kept my interest. It could be quite funny and strangely this is the only movie he made! It was also strange that so many women loved him, especially because they did not seem like his type. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the people in the movie, they are cretins and idiots who might not act. In fact, I had the hope that they would kill MORE, they really had it to come! None of his performances were as credible as possible and, apparently, the director NEVER re-shoots a single scene, since most of the scenes in the film were worse than those in Ed Wood's masterpiece, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE . In fact, for many of the women in the film, the only prerequisite for their appearance in the film is that they are willing to take off their clothes. Now I know this sounds pretty bad, but most of them were incredibly unattractive and looked like junkies getting naked to get their next solution. When these ladies take off their clothes, the men in the crowd give them money to put it on again (wow, Henny Youngman SHOULD have said that in the movie). But, considering Lewis' budgets, these were probably the best "actresses" he could get. <br /> <br /> In general, a bucket of poor quality bile that manages to be worse than most of the director's other movies ... and that's saying a lot! He is violent (but stupid), anti-women (treating them like flesh and things to mutilate) and is totally incompetent from beginning to end.
