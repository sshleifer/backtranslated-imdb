This has to be the best practical joke of all. I'm surprised that all the other actors kept a serious face. I may be wrong, but the impression I have of this movie is that they tricked Frank Stallone and Joe Estevez into acting in this film that has a budget of just under $ 40, depending on how much the nerf receivers' teams cost. of the painted spray, create The most incoherent film ever created, and sit back and laugh at the fact that Joe Estevez and Frank Stallone were not involved in the joke. <br /> <br /> If by chance they were not kidding and legitimately trying to make a real movie, then I feel sorry for everyone involved in the creation. I have had many love affairs with the corny movies, but this movie is so bad that I can hardly see it. They repeat "special effects" without meaning so many times that it is obvious that they only tried to hide the fact that they only filmed 30 minutes of images. If they saw me forced to watch this movie repeatedly, I would reproach myself unconscious with my own hands after about one and a half times. No offense to the great Frank Stallone, but I'd rather see Sylvester teach a finger painting class for 10 hours than watch that movie ever again.
