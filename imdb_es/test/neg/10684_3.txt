After a nineteenth century double gun that goes wrong, a lovely young woman becomes a vampire. Not only does she become one of the undead, but she also uses her gothic, tempting person to maintain her talent as a cold-blooded killer. This is a low B grade feature that should have gone directly to the video. The violence is vicious and bloody, but actually quite mild. The line of history is so weak and the dialogue is so neglected that it is difficult to arouse much interest. Eileen Daly is the protagonist of Lilith Silver. Also in the cast are Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth and Isabel Brook.
