To date, this is still the worst crap I've seen. So annoying that I even complained to Blockbuster about storing it. Some friends and I rented it after looking at the back cover thinking we were in a good horror movie. The plot line seems to change during the movie and there was a lot of irrelevant stuffing. The movie ended abruptly, I guess they ran out of film. The quality of the sound was serious and the first female character had a thick Spanish accent, although anyway she said a complete nonsense. The guy provided a bit of candy for the eyes until his strange assassination attempts. After losing all the time to deepen the discussions about the workshop and its multiple power tools, choose to put a plastic bag over your head. In summary, I think you have to see this movie to believe that it really exists.
