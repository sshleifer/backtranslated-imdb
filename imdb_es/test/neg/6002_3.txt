Predictable, bloody, too cunning, mediocre. Do not waste your time, there are many much better movies out there. <br /> <br /> The resurrection begins well, but the plot quickly becomes repetitive. My level of interest fell constantly. At the end of the movie I was glad that it was finally over. The characters never fully developed. The cinematography is muddy and the POV rotations of rapid change, although they may be impressive in 1999, currently only serve to label the film as an attempt to replace the plot and substance of the character. Filming tricks have some purpose (they transmit tension and anxiety), but they are constantly used in excess and, ultimately, become counterproductive. A shame in general: the film / story obviously had potential and the producers / directors and actors obviously have technical skills. A disappointment.
