Wow, what a cheesy movie this is! It starts looking like he's going to be a bully in the background, with the camera following the dogs running through the woods. Then it becomes a bit boring and follows the story of some girls who move to a house enchanted by Indian spirits. Then we received many pictures of a partially dressed girl and another naked girl in the bathroom. Suddenly, it gets really corny when the "zombie Indians" emerge from the earth and start terrorizing the girls. We even have a samurai Indian. <br /> <br /> This movie starts quite boring, although I found that the story of the four Indians who were buried alive is quite interesting. Once the Indian zombies (or whatever you want to call them because they are not technically zombies) begin to terrorize the girls is when all the fun begins. This is not a special movie and it can not be taken seriously, it's fun to watch when you're bored or when you drink with friends. I can not help thinking that it would have worked better as a short story because the first half is tediously boring.
