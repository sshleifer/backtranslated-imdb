Worst.film.ever There is nothing more to say. Aaron Carter is totally repellent and the rest of the cast must fire their agents immediately. It really is a terrible terrible movie from beginning to end. I wish I could be more eloquent in describing the many films (oh, so many) failures, but I can not bother / get too angry to form the right sentences. <br /> <br /> In short, I hated absolutely everything related to this film and not in a "bad as good" way ... <br /> <br /> It was not adulterated. <br /> <br /> Gavin
