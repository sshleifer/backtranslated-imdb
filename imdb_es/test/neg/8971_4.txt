This feels very forced and condescending to a great extent. The whole plot is extremely forced, especially the "gallant" effort to save the university from ruin, and the moralistic nuance (especially by the protagonist) laughs a little. <br /> <br /> But there are one or two comics. The moments that do help relieve boredom and dance are quite funny (especially for the supposed fans, ha ha!) <br /> <br /> The owner of the store and the young man who do spectacular tapping dance They were the highlights. And I also liked the impressions of Peter Hayes about Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman.
