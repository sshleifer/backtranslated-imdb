I do not expect much from ghost stories, but I do hope that a story makes some sense! Is that asking the writers and filmmakers too much? When the bad guy suddenly becomes a homicidal maniac just because a group of crows starts to peck at him, then I have a problem spending $ 9.00 for a ticket! Alfred Hitchcock would be turning in his grave. Did not anyone learn anything in your college 101 movie class? A good movie has an INTERESTING story at its roots! <br /> <br /> Here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie: If you have desperate financial problems, go from Chicago to the middle of nowhere in North Dakota to grow sunflowers (do not kid yourself!). If your child has severe neurological problems as a result of a car accident, move away from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to a small isolated town, which, at best, has a community hospital. Hire a vagabond to live and work with you, out of the blue, without consulting any reference, when you have a teenage daughter, a wife and a small child. (I'm glad you're not my parents!) <br /> <br /> A city where everyone knows that everything would have no problem in missing a triple homicide, just outside the city. And, of course, blame the madness of man for a bad harvest of Sunflowers! (Does not nothing grow in North Dakota?) A couple of days after he bought his house in ruins, with huge vines growing everywhere, he reminds him of Jack and the Beanstalk, a type of X-Files, the Smoker, (I'm glad to see that the cigarettes did not catch him, I guess he does not inhale!) Suddenly he will surprise you as you work to offer you the sale price of your house, plus 15% more, for no reason! <br /> <br /> I think you have an idea. I've seen so many scary and forgotten movies in the last month, it just amazes me! Is it so hard to make a movie that does not treat the audience like an idiot? I'm glad that at least the ravens of this sad movie have had some brains! I would like to be able to say the same for anyone who thinks they are going to make money with this celluloid garbage!
