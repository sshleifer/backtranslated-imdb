This is the movie is really bad. I like to turn on the TV while I take a nap and this movie seemed like it would be a good thing to sleep, and I was wrong. My body literally woke me up from sleep and said: "Hey ... this movie is horrible ... you have to see it". I love bad movies with bad actors and stupid plots. Something about unintentional comedy sets me off. This movie is awesome shit. I really do not know how to express it correctly, apart from recommending that you look at it just to see how bad it is. I mean, seriously, you should see it with people. I was making the best jokes out loud during this movie and nobody was there to listen to them. <br /> <br /> Worse than Swimfan. It's so bad
