Starring Tomas Milian and Manny Perez ?? 'Washington Heights' is a low-budget drama located in a Latino neighborhood in New York. <br /> <br /> A young comic book artist (Manny Perez) wants to escape from his Latino neighborhood. When his father is paralyzed by the shooting of a thief, the young man is forced to run the family winery. <br /> <br /> The film was shot on a budget (low resolution video and poor audio) with low profile actors. <br /> <br /> The plot flowed well for 85 minutes, but the last 5 minutes were just terrible. We do not know for sure if Perez and his girlfriend stayed together and if Angel ended up in jail for the shooting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
