Two days ago I had the opportunity to watch this movie on Cable (TV-Asia). I have been very disturbed since then. The movie "Baghban" has been very successful in portraying only one side of real life. It is very partial to parents. Have you ever thought of another side (children)? There are few parents in this world who only give birth to their children but do not provide the correct parental care. I am a victim of that. Why do you (parents) want to have 5 children in your life if you are only earning Rs 2000 per month? They made me work in the streets along with my brothers. I have no idea how I managed to get to IIT from there. It's been a long time since then but I still do not think so. Now I am a scientific researcher here in the United States. I have provided all the needs to my parents along with the care of my two brothers who stay with them. They could not provide us with basic things when we were children. I think this movie is very resentful. It is very partial. It has hurt my feelings very deeply. I strongly urge the producer / director of this film to also look at Indian society from another point of view and make another film. You can contact me at john_simension@yahoo.com
