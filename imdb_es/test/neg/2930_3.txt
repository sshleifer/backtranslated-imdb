Well, in general I like Iranian films, and after having seen "10" of Kiarostami the night before, I was expecting a great movie. I was very disappointed. This is, by far, the worst Iranian movie and one of the most boring Asian movies I've seen. If you've never seen a Kiarostami movie before, look at "Ten." If you want some good Iranian movies, you can also try "Sib", also known as "The Apple". This movie is divided into 5 parts, and only the fourth, with some funny ducks, is worth seeing. If this is the first Iranian movie you see, you probably do not want to see more. I do not blame you, but you will miss some great movies.
