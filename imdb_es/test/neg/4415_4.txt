There are a series of movies that my high school friends and I used to joke about. They are mostly works from the 50s that appeared on television in the late show. This was one of our favorites. The soul of a fallen native came to life on a tree stump with a frown. Now my friends said that if you looked closely, you could see that the thing had shoes. I never saw this. What strikes me most is that the natives seemed to be white men with black paint on their faces; some looked like a kind of Italian. They also spoke with the strangest bell that did not seem to fit with their situation. Like mummy movies, the mobility of the thing did not seem to offer a great threat. In a confrontation, one should only walk fast; I guess it's the old element of surprise. If you see this, do not take it too seriously. Be happy to have a battery of old horror movies that gave us so much joy.
