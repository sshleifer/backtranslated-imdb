It is assumed that this is the story of the life of a man named Wirey Spindell from age 8 to 36, narrated by the character in each moment of his life. So, for example, when he is eight years old, it is the voice of an eight-year-old boy who makes the narrative; when he is in high school, he is the one who does the narration, etc. That's the only interesting thing about this movie. It seems that every actor who plays Wirey is a separate character. Not only do they not look alike, but their life experiences do not seem to match. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a strong cold.
