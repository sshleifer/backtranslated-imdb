Being a child of the 1980s, I grew up with numerous educational and entertainment programs (or both), and I continue to learn so much from them now that I admire the wisdom of those who worked on them. After learning that Sesame Street, to give the best example, was not solely responsible for the fact that I could read at an adult level before I could walk, it only increased the level of disgust that I feel not only towards the Lyon corporation and your product. , but those who defend them, too. As if he had faith in those we assigned to protect ourselves or our children, the fact that Barney & Friends still contaminates our airwaves after more than a decade is a disrepute not only to the FCC, American commerce and its creators. . It is a loss of prestige to all humanity. In a world in which the police, welfare services and child protection agencies can harass me without being denied by simply being born different from those in power, however, broadcasters can send this information to my home without opposition. bad with people. <br /> <br /> You see, in a world where we are expected to behave as adults and realize ourselves, what we say to our sons and daughters is important because it will often have consequences much later. we left. Not only are our attempts to make our children more normal, more similar, more thinking, potentially devastating, what we end up teaching them to be normal also has an important role to play. So the question becomes one of the things that Barney is teaching our children to be normal. Apart from lessons like the ones we are not good at if we do not have good feelings, or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we fall short, other shocking things that are shown in the Barney program include Barney sexually abusing children. The issue of abduction and child abuse is a major problem in our society, and it has been since we started trying to pretend that it was not, but that would qualify as one of the most inappropriate ways to present the topic. <Br /> <br /> So far I have only mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally damaging lessons presented by Barney himself. In addition to the problem are the children shown in the program. I use the word children freely here, since the range of ages shown ranges from three years to fourteen. However, no difference in the emotional response is shown in either extreme. Fourteen-year-olds react to Barney and their proposed situations in the same way as five-year-olds. Experts in child and adolescent autism believe that this is an incredibly bad thing to expose children. Adults on the autism spectrum who faced increasing problems as their needs were not met, but were ignored outright, have a tendency to see this and feel the need to do the kind of thing with Barney that would make them cry at fourteen years. As irreverent and sick as the programs aimed at the older children's market were, as you can not do that on television, they amaze Barney by showing that not only do different ages respond to the same thing differently, so too They make different people. <br /> <br /> So in response to mdmireles1295, I must say that I hope they do not have children. For every time I see a father showing his children this nonsense, it gives me an overwhelming urge to inform the police about child abuse. And I speak like a man whose education was dominated by abuse. They could sing about manners, love, care or share, but the examples they show are not only as unbalanced as the opposite of education, but they are so devoid of realism that they become dangerous, as The Light Triton has already pointed out. The kind of lessons that children learn from Barney is that people do not vary, feelings must be suppressed at all costs and the rules are completely arbitrary. When compared to the lessons, that variation is what makes the world turn and even the bitterest feelings have a purpose that television taught me when I was a child, it still surprises us that the authorities have yet to intervene and take out this crap of the trash. air. If a father did to his son what Barney does all over the world, they would face criminal charges. <br /> <br /> So, I gave Barney my favorite score of two out of ten that I give to all the garbage without any exchange. value. In a world of adults who know how to adequately respond to their children, it does not take place.
