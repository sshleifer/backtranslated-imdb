I'm a big fan of science fiction movies. So, when I saw this movie in the EPG, I thought I was expecting a nice night. What a disappointment ! Such a poor exhibition of "special" effects that I could not imagine in 1980, but in 2005? Come on, why would you do the special effects of a helicopter flying in the desert when you can shoot a real one at a much lower price (I suppose)? And those murderous "muppets" ... well, I could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage. You can expect to have a low budget on a movie, but I do not think it's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget. As for the "star" of the movie (I use many quotes tonight ...), Lou Diamond Philips, the guy is not even an actor. Maybe I should have stayed in martial arts movies. In short, a horrible movie. Maybe I'm in a bad mood tonight. Then again, maybe not. A sincere 1 out of 10.
