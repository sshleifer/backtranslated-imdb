In general, a film that starts badly remains bad in a monotonously descending pattern. This bad movie began to improve before starting a steep dive. The performance, except for the male antagonist, was horrible. The plot was essentially a configuration for the final main scene, which is probably good as a performance, but it was wasted in this movie. I'm not sure why this movie was made.
