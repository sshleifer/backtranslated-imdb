Do you know that commercial mouthwash where the guy has his mouth full of Listerine or whatever and is trying to avoid spitting it in the sink? That is a great metaphor for this movie. I kept looking, although it was really difficult. But keeping the mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a fresh mint feeling. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I should have spat it out when I had the chance. <br /> <br /> The premise is corny enough to be fun. For the first time in a thousand years, the Gargoyles have returned to Romania, and all the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things have long been dead. It depends on Michael Pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the Gargoyles go crazy. Unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in a bad dialogue and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of human leaders. The best performance is performed by CG Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie feels like Van Helsing's from a poor man. If you check your brain at the door, this could help you get through a sad Monday night. I gave it 3 out of 10 stars.
