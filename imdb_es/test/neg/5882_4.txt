The Hebrew hammer is a smart idea wasted, since the execution is weak. As often happens with iconoclastic humor, it relies excessively on outrage to generate laughter, which simply is not enough. The bad taste mood has two elements, bad taste and humor, and both are necessary here, but the humor is quite scarce. As a result, it is often painful to watch, all the more because of the good intentions of the artists, particularly Adam Goldberg and HH himself. However, The Shaft references are fun, but only for those who know those films, and they certainly do not carry The Hebrew Hammer. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that many of the jokes are based on the knowledge of American Jews. culture, and many in the audience simply will not understand the jokes.
