Back in college, I studied marketing and, although I lost many classes and never paid attention, I will always remember the main and most essential principle of marketing, namely: it is not what you sell. It's HOW you sell it! This principle is fully applied to "The Devil's Triangle", since it is basically a beautifully wrapped and attractive but empty package. Writer / director Richard Winer knew exactly that he had to divert the viewer's attention from the main inaccuracies, so he introduced some elements that never fail when it comes to providing a spooky atmosphere, like the sinister voice of the narrator Vincent Price and the bug rare. The music of King Crimson. And I guess Richard Winer's dirty little tricks worked very efficiently, since there was a big hype in the Bermuda Triangle in the mid-'70s and, literally, in every movie. Was it an inaccurate documentary or an exploitation film of poor quality? Covering the issue he won a lot of money at the box office. "The Devil's Triangle" overwhelms him with data that are not structured and often irrelevant, but the dramatic dramatization of the facts and, of course, the intimidating voice of the almighty Vincent Price generates an atmosphere of fear and chill. The narrative constantly jumps back and forth in time and covers a massive amount of "strange occurrences" and "mysterious disappearances" of ships and planes in the Bermuda Triangle over a period of almost a whole century, but the reports remain extremely vague at all times and the eloquent Mr. Price invariably ends each chapter with the sinister words "Just another unsolved mystery of the Devil's Triangle?" After a couple of cases, the whole formula just becomes laughable and almost pathetic, but I think it caused a genuine mass hysteria in 1974. The documentary expands a bit more on the most notorious mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle, like the five aircraft of the military Flight 19. It disappeared inexplicably at one time and in the peculiar case of the USS Cyclops vessel, but even in these chapters only a minimum of useful information is given. The cameras never dive into the water to explore the depths of the Bermuda area, for example, and the testimonies of the alleged witnesses to the real life of the dramas seem suspiciously staged scenes of action. If you are looking for an informative and objective documentary about the Bermuda Triangle, I certainly would not recommend this movie, but in case you want to sit and listen to the mesmerizing voice of Vincent Price for almost an hour, this is your chance. !
