Actually, there are some good reasons why a person should run the risk of going totally crazy to see this program. The breasts are pretty, although some of them are not that real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. Seeing the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is an ideal place to take things slowly and not worry too much about being devoured by a rubber shark. It is always good to remember that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not the god, but a god. It's not so much about his acting skills, since there are not any, but his chest talks a lot. Also, there is no KITT in this series, which is good, since Mr. Hasselhoff said in an interview, that he always thought that KITT was gay. Of course, that could make him look like an idiot, but considering the other statements he has made lately, it should not surprise anyone. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this is the kind of show, which is totally harmless to people. It gives us a lot to look at and a lot to laugh at, which is something that many humorous shows intentionally do not give us. I must say that it is not surprising that Borat has fallen in love with Pamela Anderson. I enjoy watching the show. No, it's not a great show, it's really pretty horrible, but I enjoy watching it. It's basically like a B movie that goes on for a decade.
