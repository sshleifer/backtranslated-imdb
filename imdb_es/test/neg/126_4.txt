It's worth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like action movies. This has the usual car chases, fights with the great style of kicks of Van Damme, firing battles with the shotgun loading 40 projectiles and even terrorist style bombs. All this is entertaining and handled competently, but there is nothing that really surprises you if you have seen your part before. <br /> <br /> The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, which is intelligent but hardly deep Many of the characters are very stereotyped: the angry veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the crooked policemen, the indifferent federals , the boss of the station of the hard lady, the crooked politician, the fat federated one that seems that it was cataloged like the Mexican A film of Hollywood of the forties. All acted passively, but again nothing special. <br /> <br /> I thought the main villains were pretty well done and pretty well acted. At the end of the movie, you certainly knew who the good guys were and which ones were not. There was an emotional impulse when the really bad got their just deserts. Very simplistic, but then you did not expect Hamlet, right? The only thing I found really annoying were the constant cuts to VD's daughter during the last scene of the fight. <br /> <br /> Not bad. Not well. Passable 4.
