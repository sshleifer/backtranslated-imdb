The Texas Revolution of 1835 to 1836, including previous and immediate periods, is described in this mediocre 3-hour film made for television, whose only redeeming value is to bring light and pay homage to Stephen F. Austin. called "Father of Texas," whose life story had been eclipsed by that of the legendary Sam Houston. The rest of the film is simply the usual story of "Santa Anna is a tyrant" and with a weak attempt to show the Mexican perspective with a fictitious Hispanic character that shows a stereotyped Latin machismo. Combined with short low-budget battle scenes, such as Alamao and San Jacinto, this film is recommended only for lovers of real history who do not come from Mexico. To his credit, the Mexican uniforms seem accurate and the romantic secondary plot (another love triangle) does not occupy much time on the screen. In general, this film describes the violent secession movement of the Anglo-Saxon racial minority of Texas as a positive and just revolution against the Mexican tyranny personified by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, the so-called "Napoleon of the West".
