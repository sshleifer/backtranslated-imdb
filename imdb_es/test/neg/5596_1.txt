Of course, this movie set in Eastern Europe is full of sexy, but it has absolutely nothing to do with Nicholas Cage's movie "8mm". The daughter of an ambassador and his girlfriend mingle with a local woman in a trio that ends up being recorded. The tape is used to blackmail and the bets increase more and more as the couple tries to solve them by themselves instead of going to the authorities. <br /> <br /> Sex comes and goes, and it would be the only reason to rent it, I suppose if you like this kind of thing, and it's pretty free towards the middle when we cross the porn scene looking for the "other" woman". Definitely, I wonder how he got to Blockbuster, even with a restricted sticker for young people considering that it's just a clue on the edge of the soft core. (Oh, that's right, it's the double standard.) Real art films like "The Dreamers" and "And Your Mom Also" receive castrated R versions, but Straight To DVD trash like this has the proud UNRATED poster attached. br /> <br /> The acting is horrible, the plot is insensibly unoriginal, but in reality the worst offense is the idea that this is an 8 mm sequel, I would give the film a D for a grade and I will be kind, but considering that they tried to deceive me, he gets the F that he frankly deserves.
