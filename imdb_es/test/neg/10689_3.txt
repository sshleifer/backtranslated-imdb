Given the budget and the inexperience of everyone involved, Livin 'tha Life could have been worse. Jamal wants to be Chris Tucker (whom I've always found very annoying), as an earlier commentator has noted, but Peanut (Edward D. Smith), while some of his (over) reactions continue too long (a director's problem) , has some comparatively subtle and funny moments, such as when trying to instruct Jamal on the proper method to smoke an articulation with a friend. Throughout all this, it is generally more balanced and more typical than Jamal, which may have been the germ of a good exploration of the contrasts in the relationship, but it did not develop very far. <br /> <br /> But the inexperience of The writer / director / cinematographer / etc. There is no excuse for his lack of attention. Have you ever seen a movie? Faces are important! Have you ever heard of a close-up? Even Ed Wood could make a close-up. I do not think it's a budget problem. I was only able to give a general description of what any of the actors looks like, and not just for the first shots, but for the lighting ...! Lights for outdoor shooting can cost too much, but you can make a reflector with pieces of paper! That would have required moving the camera closer to keep the reflector out of the socket, helping to solve the foreground problem at the same time. If that is too technical, you can change the actors so that they are not in the shade, or you can expose them to the shadows, and if it had not been filmed in L.A. I would say that it takes advantage of the cloudy days. Needless to say, the films he steals are all, with the possible exception of Weekend at Bernie's, better than this, but Livin 'tha Life would have left a much better impression if he had not made the viewer squint. the path to glimpse what the human element has been. <br /> <br /> PS The scene in the barbershop is just stupid.
