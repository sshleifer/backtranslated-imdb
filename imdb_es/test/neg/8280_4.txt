Quite lame and horrible slasher about someone who kills members of a high school track team after their star runner dies during a match. <br /> <br /> Christopher George gives a hilariously exaggerated performance as an athletic team coach. I do not think ANYONE has taken the track and the field as seriously as Chris does here, not even in the Olympics. It's a typically divine CG performance, and if you're a fan of the man / legend, you should run out and grab a copy. <br /> <br /> But we look at the murderers in search of the murders (you know that's true), not the performances, and the graduation day is not fulfilled in most of the counts (there is a really good death) . The real horror only comes during a performance by the band "Felony". I've never heard of them? Look at graduation day and find out why.
