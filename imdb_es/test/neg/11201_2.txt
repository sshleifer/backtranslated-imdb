Has this happened to you? I go into my local video store and I see some newcomers in the "black cinema" section. I see a copy of a new arrival from a movie I've never seen called NAKED ALIBI. It's from one of those video mail companies that offers (mostly) "dupey" looking for hard-to-find copies of titles. The description in the box sounds good. The movie has players that I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame and Gene Barry). So I take it home and I see it. Around ten minutes in this movie I began to have doubts. About half of this movie started to upset me. When the movie was over, I not only disliked it, I despised it. The film begins with cops questioning Al Willis on suspicion of theft. Apart from being drunk, the police have nothing against him. When he pushes a policeman and demands that he be allowed to go home, the police beat him. Detective Conroy arrives, lets the cops finish the beating and then announces that Willis is safe. Willis swears he will take revenge. Later, one of the policemen is shot to death. With no other evidence that Willis is "sore" from the beating, Conroy makes him his only suspect, even though his boss names a couple of mobsters as suspects. Conroy arrests him, but for lack of evidence, Willis is released. The next day, two more policemen are killed by a bomb. This time, Conroy goes to the bakery that Willis has and tries to get him a confession. Conroy does not know it, but a local journalist whose newspaper has been accusing Conroys of police brutality takes a picture of Conroy trying to strangle Willis and Conroy is fired. But Conroy continues his search and Willis flees to Mexico, where Willis has a lover. Conroy manages to convince his lover (whom Willis deals with rather harshly) to help him prove that Willis is a murderer. What this film lacks is a convincing script. The script looks as if only a draft has been written and the shot will start before the script is completed. Things happen, the personalities of the characters change, the twists in the plot occur without any real reason, except for what the script requires. Aside from the fact that Willis likes to tip a glass now, there's nothing in the first part of the movie that makes us think he's a crazy killer who cheats on his wife. He treats his wife, his son and his employees well. At the beginning of the film, one has the impression that it is Conroy who has a loose cannon. It seems to casually approve of police brutality. Conroy, for no reason is convinced from the beginning that Willis has a criminal past. It seems to operate under the slogan of the former communist Bulgarian secret police; "Everyone is guilty of something, we just have not discovered it yet." Later, Conroy shows kindness to the lover and the young son of Al, now we are supposed to like it. Sorry! The first impression I had of Conroy stayed with me too long. And he is also a foolish cop. Only after he is fired and leaves for Mexico, does he conduct a background check on Willis and discovers that he has been issued a warrant of arrest in Maryland. Why did not you think about this before? Because this movie had not spent enough execution time. The cast is good. Gene Barry does well considering how poorly conceived is his role as Al Willis. I'm a big fan of the crime thrillers of the 40s and 50s, but not only did I not think that this movie was good, but it left a bad taste in my mouth (something that many modern movies do, but the oldest rare movies they do it once).
