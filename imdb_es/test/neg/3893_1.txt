Now, do not get me wrong, I love a good movie and after watching The Thin Red Line (and I love it) I was anxious to locate Terrence Malicks two previous films and, having seen Days of Heaven, my enthusiasm to see Badlands practically it has disappeared. <br /> <br /> I've noticed a lot of criticism for the beautiful picture, but I saw this movie on a terribly old vhs tape that made it look very horrible. All I can say is that I hope the picture was excellent, because it would have been one of the only things of interest in this movie. Not since the Replacement Matadors have I fallen asleep during a movie. This movie felt so long (and it was not!), The edition was choppy and disjointed, the story did not exist, the voice-over was an incomprehensible incoherence, the characters developed weakly, and everything was unforeseen. I know Malick was not sure how to make the movie. Consequently, he recorded a lot of images and then spent around two years editing in an attempt to put everything together. This is very evident on the screen. Everything is destroyed, every time a scene seems to gain some momentum (or some development of the character), it becomes boring scenes of people doing boring things. It was as if someone had tried to cut a history of archival images of people they cultivated. The few good points are the music and the scene of the chase near the end, but those things are not close enough to keep the interest. Normally I would let a bad movie go by without being too vocal, but when it's so overrated, you have to say something. <br /> <br /> Maybe a farmer would like ...?
