Why do you ask? Does this man claim to have the truth behind the existence of the Almighty? Well, your deductive logic, my friends, you will see that I know that God exists because Satan does. How else would my poor eyes have been soiled in such a horrible movie? Yes, there is no doubt about it, on a cold Friday in 2006 Satan possessed me and forced me to watch this movie. The one that You ask; The devil makes small girls spit up vomits and climb roofs, why waste time making you watch this movie? My only conclusion to that question is that Satan believes that seeing Camp Fear is the worst form of mortal punishment, not taking your eyes off or making you speak in tongues, but that you sit without thinking for an hour and a half of the most frightening film in the world. history . Can this movie be as terrible as he says? Yes, my friend watching this movie is the equivalent of being kicked in the sack some fifty million times, maybe more. But maybe I'm being too hard, this movie has some moments, the beginning, for example, begins in a house of sisterhood of women with many topless girls; Now I'm never in a sisterhood of women. I'm not sure if the girls really do this, but you can always pray. Now that the five minutes of tits and buttocks are over, they present us with a scene on campus at a women's university; the girls themselves (about eight in all) are in an archeology class, where they talk about virgin sacrifices and ancient mounds. Suddenly, the class teacher (who apparently is the only man in this girls' school) takes a handful of his nubile students, in addition to his girlfriend, to a remote lake in the mountains, his searches, to find ancient artifacts Indians Yes, of course, we know at what angle you are launching. Now here is where the movie starts, the group of five, four girls, a guy stops at a gas station to get some directions, but here is a gang of motorcyclists stops and harasses the girls, only to finally leave them alone. go by separate ways Continuing, they arrive at a "camp" that consists of four trunks and some trees and then things start to go very badly. First the prof. and his girlfriend will wander to spend some time alone when one of the girls is in charge of finding them, only to be captured by an unknown force. Continuing with the other two girls, he starts looking for the missing girl when the bikers, plus a drunk, come to look for them, to their plan, to rape the girls and do horrible things to them. The movie continues with something about a druid who needs four virgins for a sacrifice to save the world from some type of water monster before the year two thousand; but there is a problem for this plan, Mr. Druida, one of the girls is defrocked just before us, so that plan disappears. Now, since I said there would be spoilers, I'll go ahead and ruin the end of the movie for you, the four girls are kidnapped, drugged with a green sticky substance and then ready to be sacrificed, after one of them dies the two The remaining cyclists and the prof. come to save them; they stand on a ledge where the non-leader motorist says: "I think I can get there!" Only to jump and break his leg. The prof. He runs to the man and submits only leaving the heroic motorcyclist, who was once a victim of rape, left to defend himself from the giant druid of 6'3. "First he makes a pathetic attempt with a stick, then he pulls out a knife, the knife reflects something of lazer, make a lightning bolt inside the mouth of a golden snake and ignite the druid in the fire instantly, after the wounded are taken on emergency stretchers and reflect on whether everything is over, just so the bubble of the lake that shows the monster inside it still alive, it is the film and this is my criticism, which unfortunately will not be read by most of the eyes since this is only the fifth published review of a movie that has been released for fifteen years Fortunately, Satan can only reach some of us and not all of them.The judge would like to make a sincere apology to the poor girl from Circuit City.I'm going to let her lend me this movie. "Sorry, Sheil a, please, do not hate me for letting you see this. "
