After the mysterious death of an old friend, a group of teenagers is in possession of Stay Alive, a horror video game based on the horrible story of Erzebet Bathory, known as The Countess of the Blood. The group begins to play the spooky game. Soon they will be killed one by one in the same method as the character they played in the game. As the line between the game world and reality disappears, our heroes must find a way to defeat the vicious countess of blood. "Stay Alive" is an incredibly poor movie for teenagers, without any hint of suspense. Writer and screenwriter William Brent Bell has not the faintest idea how to make a horror movie that can be seen. almost non-existent and the story does not make sense. The dialogue is absolutely bad and the actions of all involved are shameful. "Stay Alive" is easily one of the worst horror films of 2006. Stay away from this stinking stench.
