When A Stranger Calls belongs to the group of remakes this year, with films like Poseidon just over the horizon. Director Simon West (With Air) directs this updated version, with a lot of relatively unknown releases, indicating that the death rate is high (it is not), or that established stars are moving away from a potential turkey. <br /> <br /> Coming to a relatively short 87 minutes, it consists mainly of two acts. The first, which takes a full hour, is the configuration. Our heroine, Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), accumulated 800 minutes of talk time on her mobile phone (do the math), and as a lesson of responsibility, her parents had confiscated her cell phone and punished her. To pay off her debt, she works part time as a nanny, and taking care of the rich children of Mandrakis is her first step. <br /> <br /> The huge mansion of Mandrakis receives a full treatment of the tour, since that is where all the action will take place. A lot of rooms (for a good hiding), an aquarium-pond the size of an indoor pool (to get wet, for the wet shirt treatment), and verify this - motion detector lights, which you know will contribute to the alarm. With the manipulation of lights and shadows. Naturally, the jokes, the false leads are plentiful, which reinforces the execution time of this act, but most of them fall flat in the suspense department. acting through his voice instead. Recent attempts include Edward Norton in Kingdom of Heaven, and V by Hugo Weaving for Vendetta. Here, Lance Henriksen does the honors for the anonymous, nameless psychotic killer, but he simply collapses. Why? The script does not give much dialogue. The majority of the telephone calls were of a silent nature (mind-masturbatory), which I felt was a waste; They could also have thrown something unknown in their place, and work will still be done. <br /> <br /> The second act, where the main action takes place, is too little too late. And the coachman, well, is purely a coachman. Those who expect blood and blood will be disappointed, as it is basically a one woman show to keep their attention in the first hour (the eye candies are always successful), and this act will resolve everything in a fast double time, as Rachel McAdams in Red Ojo. Do not expect any form of character development, or subplots that get involved. <br /> <br /> The ending tried to be too smart for its own sake, and it was presented as a cheap way to finish the movie. There is not much to highlight in this movie: do not scare, or emotions, or enigmatic villains, and many security flaws, especially with the door alarm, the only thing for which it is good is to provide a number for 4D.
