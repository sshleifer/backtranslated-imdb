The director is sweet, as is his co-directed wife Shira Geffen, but his movie stinks. It has its moments (and some nice girls), but there is too much of everything: "Am√©lie" meets "Breaking the waves" and "Pauline on the beach". You want to know more about the wedding photographer and about the girl he likes the most when nothing happens, either in movies or in real life. Instead, you get a suicide writer, a neurotic actress and a social worker of illegal immigrants with a heart of gold. It feels like there is more than one really moving story hidden in the script, but at first glance it's a lot of wasted stories and sentimental nonsense. It is difficult to sit as is.
