A spaceship that crosses the galaxy meets a mysterious cargo ship apparently drifting into space. The crew investigates, hoping to claim their cargo and acquire the ship. However, once aboard the ominous vessel, their own ship is mysteriously deactivated, leaving them to fend for themselves and fight, except Count Dracula or Orloff, as this creature calls itself. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad start. I mean it follows any number of typical science fiction / horror plots. The genres have existed long enough for even the most original story to invoke inevitably the comparison with some other movie. But, when you start with a pretty typical terror convention, the legend of Dracula and the vampires in general, and combine it with a fairly typical science fiction convention, a crew encounters something and is isolated to fight whatever it is that have to face. It is better that the filmmakers have some ingenious up their sleeve to print their own brand in the family genre. <br /> <br /> Director Darrell Roodt, who also wrote Dracula 3000 with Ivan Milborrow, is primarily responsible for this total failure. So, no, Roodt and Milborrow have nothing under their sleeves, except their arms. <br /> <br /> This movie begins with a sinister tone, with a voice in very low voice delivered by Caspar Van Dien, which essentially provides enough exposure to explain who the crew in your ship are. I must also point out that the Van Dien character is called Van Helsing. And, oh, very cleverly, this Orloff character is from the Transylvania planet in the Carpathian System. Seriously. I mean, come on guys, we understand. And, again, do not be silly and use those names unless you have something special in the store. <br /> <br /> Then, after Van Helsing's presentation of the crew, we have, essentially, a movie about this crew trapped. in a spaceship with a vampire lurking. <br /> <br /> I am a very lenient bystander when it comes to low budget movies. From time to time, they can be brilliant, watch the first two films of Raimi's Evami Dead. Dracula 3000 had a decent budget, enough for some decent special effects and for the salaries of the 3rd. Strings like, Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio, etc. However, unlike the EVIL DEAD movies, there is no talent behind the camera. In front of the camera, the talent is marginal, but I'm going to give the actors some benefit of the doubt. It really seems that they do not know what to do. The best actress of the group, Alexandra Kamp-Groenveld, is assassinated quickly and the always pleasant Udo Kier is reduced to being an exhibition vehicle for the spectator as the deceased captain that we listen and see through a daily video. Grant Swandby is also fine as a teacher, but it is difficult to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and rides a wheelchair. And, yes, it is a wheelchair, since it has nothing futuristic. As for the rest of the actors, well ... I'm sure Coolio really tried to get scared after becoming a vampire, but, well, I do not think the irritant qualifies as scary in most people's books. Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak do not offer much either. Lister is never really more than the big black and muscular stereotype of IL. Eleniak really seems unhappy throughout the movie and never tries hard. Eleniak is a pretty girl, even in her mid-thirties, but she seems a bit exhausted and disinterested for the duration of the movie. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Count Dracula / Orloff played by Langley Kirkwood. To be honest, I can not remember exactly who the vampire is supposed to be. He introduces himself as Orloff, but at some point he recognizes himself as Count Dracula as well. Go figure. In any case, you will be surprised by how scarce this vampire is. Have you ever made a scene in which the hosts of the corny horror shows that local networks would have on the schedules of their creatures? Yes, it's so bad. Langley Kirkwood, the actor who plays Orlock, must have found it almost impossible to concentrate on such a ridiculous team. I'm sure his friends are still bothering him. <br /> <br /> There's not much in the plot. The vampire is the last of his kind and wants to go to Earth, for some reason, and also, there is some lip service on wanting to defeat Caspar Van Dien's character, Van Helsing. Most of the crew turns into vampires, including Van Helsing, and the crew uses conventional machine guns and pistols to try to defeat them before discovering the old stake in the heart routine. Yes, that's right, bullets, and yes, the year 3000. Maintaining that disconcerting vein, one of the main areas in which the crew is locked up while fighting vampires or vampires, because in reality there is never more than a threat for them. It's full of old Soviet posters and badges and so on. What? There are also references to God / religion being outdated systems. But these references just confused me. Did the Soviet Union return? Is there any point that Roodt and Milborrow want to explain with this? Actually he never goes anywhere, seems silly and the posters, etc., seem cheap. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film is shot and edited competently. The cinematography is nothing spectacular, but it is clearly done by professionals and I did not have any problems with the special effects. The ships look like ships in outer space. Although, as I write this, I remember how horrible the corpse of the captain is when the crew discovers it. What were you thinking? Why did not someone say something? Do you see how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without resorting to the negatives? I suppose, ultimately, that is the thing. Regardless of the positive aspects that this science fiction / horror debacle attempts and grants, you will be overwhelmed by its lack of quality. <br /> <br /> Poor Udo Kier.
