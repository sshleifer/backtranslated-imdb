The biggest and most disconcerting things in the Raptor film that ended for Tyransaurus are identical to Carnosaur, except that the children in the magazine were a little better at acting and in action than the adults. The similarities with the films of Carnosaur was a rather poor choice in the plot. The only thing that came right was the beginning with the kids in the jeep. Then the plot went downhill from there. It would have been nice if a different plot had been devised, instead of cloning the previous films. The raptor movie should have taken the lesson of the series Jurasic Park in several plots. The only movie that has recently approached a good dinosaur movie is Aztec Rex. The repeated scenes, as taken from Carnosaurus movies, leave a person thinking about those films.
