Now this is a bad movie if I've ever seen it. In one of the best years of the film, 1999, Detroit Rock City competes with Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West for first place in a barrel of drug addicts. The plot is masterful. Four scrawny youngsters from high school finally have their chance to see KISS hard rock theater for the third year in a row. Then, when their tickets are worked by an ultra-religious mother who smokes chain, friends rush to get to Detroit, and I'm sure they can find out the rest. <br /> <br /> Well, not exactly; the film takes extreme measures to explain how the four members of the band (no, not Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter) get these tickets: lose their virginity in a confessional; saving a smoked bimbo and your mother's Volvo (from soprano Steve Schirripa, however); preventing a robbery in the middle of risking one for a debt of a 12-year-old child; and, of course, undressing to the essentials for MC Ron Jeremy after preparing a blender with leftover bourbon. It sounds funny, does not it? Maybe Detroit Rock City is right with all this nonsense about how extreme these fans can sometimes get. And we understand that this movie is a comedy; It is supposed to be filled with slapstick. But does Detroit Rock City aim for the right audience? It is classified as R, which means that it is the only way that prepubertal adolescents, the audience as I see it, to which many acclaim this classic is that the voyeur of the will is through illegal terms. <br /> <br /> Detroit Rock City also fails At the touch of the late seventies. The texture quality of the camera is too bright and too bright, losing the necessary style of films like This is Spinal Tap and Sid & Nancy. This would have allowed audiences to feel "at home" with the times. The simple fact of disguising children with grunge clothes before the 90s and placing others in 'disco infernos' does not work. The environment means something you know; I doubt Detroit looked so glamorous in '78. If there's one positive thing in this movie, it's the hard rock soundtrack of the late '70s in the early' 80s. Van Halen, AC / DC, whatever, it's all here . Of course, we can not forget KISS, the band suitably submitted at all times. <br /> <br /> What the movie can not noticeably handle are the questions about why the Satin Service Knights (actually KISS) were so badly seen by moms across the country. Of course, strong rock and diabolical makeup could be part of that; The incentives for young people to explore themselves and have a good time can also be just reasons. But what does KISS say in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group? What separates these anthems of "rock [ing] and roll [ing] all night and party every day" from the rest of the music? Most likely, these questions remain in a musical communication class and not in the films that should answer them, simply because they are KISS and they do rock and we must do everything possible in our power forgiven by God to see them. <br /> <br /> 1.5.5 stars
