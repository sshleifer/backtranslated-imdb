The movie (DVD) "The Tempest", directed by Jack Bender, was published in 2001. It did not reach the German cinemas and neither the director nor an actor could receive an important prize for this film. The film refers to Shakespeare's play "The Tempest", which was published at the end of the sixteenth century. The director tried to create a modern version of this work, but failed. At the beginning of the film, the owner of the plantation, Prosper, comes into conflict with his brother Antonio about the treatment of his slaves. Antonio makes a trip to his brother and tries to kill him, but with the help of a witch, Prosper can escape and flees with his daughter and a slave named Ariel to a small island near the Mississippi River. For more than twelve years he has lived isolated in this island, until a luck allows him to take revenge on his brother ... If Prosper will be lucky, he will have to discover it for himself. <br /> <br /> In My opinion, this movie is really a bad attempt to create a modern version of William Shakespeare's original work. The story of the film is as confusing as that of the characters. Prosper does not have the same powers as in the storm ... END OF PART I
