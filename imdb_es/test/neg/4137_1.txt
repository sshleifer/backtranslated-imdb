A vacation on a boat, a married couple, an angry waiter and a shipwreck are the reason for this beginning of the movies. <br /> <br /> I like tits. There is no doubt about that. But when the main character is allied with whoever has the most fish at the moment, especially having sex with them and playing the role of constant victim, my anger rises to a whole new level. Take two men (a husband and another man), place a pure bomb woman in their midst, and a desert island, subtract all their moral problems, and a lot of moral problems to the men and mix them in a large bowl Arguments, fish and a zippo lighter, you will think of a scrap movie like this. <br /> <br /> The acting is, I would say, good. There are some bloopers but not many from what I could see. The main female character makes me sick. This is due to their lack of moral values. The man with more fish catches his attention. Although one of them is her husband, she sees no problem in being unfaithful with (Manuel) the other man because "I must do it to survive". How can you justify having sex with another man to fish when your husband is 30 feet away? And will not even benefit from it? The female character has absolutely no problem to justify anything she does. If you do not get approval for your actions, you are a victim. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to watch this movie. This is the kind of movie that will make everything that sees this year a pleasant cinematic experience.
