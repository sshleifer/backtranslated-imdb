Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is a director of bloody horror films that is beginning to feel the effect of filming too many bloody scenes. Visit your local psychiatrist to see if you are losing your marbles; This turns out to be a bad idea, since the psychiatrist is actually a crazy killer responsible for a series of grisly murders. Seizing the opportunity to turn Fulci into his fall boy, the deranged doctor hypnotizes the hack he believes is responsible for the recent series of murders. <br /> <br /> On the surface, Cat in the Brain seems to be a fantastic treat from the god Lucio Fulci, sprinkled with spaghetti. Filled with chainsaw dismemberment, ax attacks and several other bloody murders, the film certainly sheds enough claret even for the hardest gore-hounds. But when one looks more closely, it turns out that many of the gruesome scenes are removed from previous films (mostly, Fulci's "masterpieces"); eliminate them from the equation and one is left with an ingenious basic idea of ​​the plot that is completely wasted, a bit of nudity, and the terrible interpretations of Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as a psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, it becomes an incomprehensible mess, with the footage "borrowed" inserted randomly, without trying to make it convincingly in the story. If you've seen Fulci's Death Touch and the Sodom Ghost, or Mario Bianchi's Assassination Secret, then you've already seen the best fragments of Gato in the brain before. <br /> <br /> After a lot of bloodshed, the film wraps up pretty quickly, leaving the viewer bewildered and somewhat deceived. Look at the film if it's Fulci's completista, but I'd suggest looking for the movies that took the "good bits".
