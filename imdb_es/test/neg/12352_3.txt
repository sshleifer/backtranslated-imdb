Rabbit Fever is one of those cinematic oddities. It's a nice 90-minute moment, it demands little from the viewer and offers so much, and on any terrestrial television channel, even at prime time, I think Rabbit fever would be quite welcome. Which makes me wonder why it was introduced in theaters. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed in the style of a television documentary and presents 6 women who have an addictive relationship with the Rabbit Vibrator. The film focuses mainly on investigating a supposedly addictive quality of the famous sexual aid product. The narrative is 100% insensitive. <br /> <br /> The story is solid, an introduction to some nice and well-rounded characters, some nice background story, characters and peripheral situations becomes an attractive story, and nice conclusions. Unfortunately there is nothing that feels ready or new. <br /> <br /> Rabbit Fever has some sharp moments, some switches that hint at what the writers are capable of, and all the credit for them is not just 90 minutes of jokes and innuendo, I could probably see it with my mother. But there is a laziness in some of the scenes that hold it, those moments happened, you're ready to do it, when you want it to be scandalous, and all you get is a small portion of sit-com. <br /> <br /> I chuckled, left the theater feeling empathy for the characters, but I also left with the bitter idea that someone had taken a 90-minute roll for television, light entertainment and I tried to include it in the national cinema. <br /> <br /> I think that Rabbit Fever achieves something of what was proposed, it is a peculiar theme, a rounded plot, a well presented cast and good fun for 90 minutes. But there is nothing in this that can justify the extravagance of a cinema environment. Quite the opposite: a few commercial recesses would have given the viewer the opportunity to take a break from the life that seems to be missing from Rabbit Fever.
