Not me. If it was about that, I could kick a dog's ass, and that's why this movie does not work for me. If it was me against the alien, or Jason ... Or ... Hell, I do not know ... ANY OTHER HORROR FILM ANTAGONIST, then there would be no competition and they would give me my ass without divine intervention. A horror movie works because it puts people in a situation with a creature, person, being, entity, whatever, who is more powerful or clever or smarter than they are, and then people think "well, what about if that had happened to me "? they get scared, and that's why this is a horrible idea for a story. I can not imagine myself being terrified by a dog, so I'm not afraid.
