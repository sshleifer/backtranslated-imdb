Anyone who thinks that this movie is great, needs to be looked at desperately. It seems to me that this movie was made as a joke. It does not have good points at all. The accessories cost around $ 10 and the whole set looks like it could fall at any time. Why are films like this done in the first place? This also had two of the most annoying characters I have encountered in the young man in the spaceship and the twentieth century Southern peasant. This movie is almost as bad as "Cool as Ice" starring the incredibly talented Vanilla "misunderstood" Ice.
