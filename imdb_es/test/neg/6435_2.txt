License fees to monitor this garbage, and pay it with hard-earned money? No humor, no hint of laughter, God knows how he won a BAFTA! <br /> <br /> We have now been subject to "Eastenders" for twenty years. When, oh, when the great British public will see this horrible soap for what it is? Crass Pap! This program no longer represents the reality in the East End of London that everyday life in Beirut, and never has. <br /> <br /> The Eastenders I know (the real ones) are kind, brave, hardworking and loyal. And one of its greatest attributes is humor. It was the Eastenders who went through the worst of the bombing in London and even got Hitler's two fingers. And what do we see on our screens during five days of the week (including a bus)? Nothing more than a group of weak moans, moaning, "dead from the neck up," who seem to do little more than sit in a pub all day harassing each other. What a great announcement for Britain that is !! Do the writers really believe that this garbage is pumping? Obviously, the shaggy-minded public section does it, but then I've heard that, apparently, anyone can be brainwashed to believe anything.
