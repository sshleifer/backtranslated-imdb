I imagine that the company that made this movie wanted people to think about Conan's movies, but unfortunately for those who did this, it does exactly that. You will think, man, Conan's films were very good ... this is totally boring and stinks. The story, who cares? It's not going to help you to like this movie more or less, since it looks like a really cheap movie. Arnold, it does not seem that it belongs to this one, why he accepted to interpret that the paper surpasses me. Well, probably for the money. I love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine. Lame! This movie is simple and simply terrible.
