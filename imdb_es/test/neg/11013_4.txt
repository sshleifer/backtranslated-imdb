If you really REALLY enjoy movies with ants that build earth mirrors, eat no-ants and conquer the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a couple of scientists working in a biological vault communicate with highly intelligent ants (the smartest actors in this film) in an attempt to thwart their plans for conquest and extermination. Throughout the film, the two scientists (and a girl who rescued from the ants) use everything they have at their disposal (computers, green dye and horrible performances), but without success. I guess they just could not buy pesticides because the movie would end too fast. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie "Phase IV" is a mystery. This is not a spoiler, but "Phase I" starts right after the opening credits, while "Phase IV" is not reached until the end credits end. Apparently, the director knew that the film would be tedious to pass and he placed phases 1 to 3 throughout the film as a kind of progress report: "Hang on, dude! Only 1 more phase until the end credits! " As an episode of MST3K, this was not very good for two reasons: 1) This is from Season 0 in KTMA when they started for the first time, so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons; and 2) This movie is so bad that neither J & TB can lighten it. There are one or two Gamera references, as they had just completed the riffing of 5 Gamera movies. <br /> <br /> The movie has a trick / surprise ending, but I was so happy to get to the end because the effect was lost on me. .
