Katharine Hepburn is a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking, and local people think she is a witch. Kate works too hard trying to convince us she's a bitch in the background (called Trigger Hicks!), But you can see she does not even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario. Robert Young, who smiles constantly, plays a foreman who works in the construction of a mountain dam that becomes Trigger's first crush ... but, unfortunately, he is married! No amount of white magic can resurrect this formula, based on a game and brought to the screen by R.K.O. With a too broad flourish. It is impious, and you can hardly see it. * 1/2 of ****
