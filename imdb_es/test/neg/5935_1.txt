The first time I read about the Left Behind series a few months ago, I made a mental note to verify it, since I'm interested in the way religion is used to control people in our increasingly hateful world, so Imagine my surprise and joy. I found a copy of Left Behind: World at War in my local library, innocently nested among the big-budget action movies. <br /> <br /> Now, as a movie, it is extremely poor. The performance is taken out of a primary school production and the "special effects" would have been outdated in the early 90's. Being the third part of a series, the story would be unintelligible to anyone who has not seen or read about the others Left Behind movies, and even with my previous knowledge it was still pretty ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In the religious Front, I do not think that someone who was not already full of the spirit of the Lord will find something in the film to convince them to change their attitude. How are you supposed to fear the Antichrist when he has a Russian accent comedy, and the worst of his powers is a sorry CGI? <br /> <br /> However, my main problem with this movie is the blatant attempt to try it. tricking people into believing that it is a big budget action movie. When I picked up the box and read the speech, I immediately noticed something strange ... nowhere in the package was there a mention of the true nature of this film. For someone who does not know, for all intents and purposes, it was proposed that Left Behind: World at War was not different from the last Tom Clancey. Nor, in the copy I rented, did he say anything about the third in a series. <br /> <br /> Considering that the premise of the series is that the Antichrist has deceived the whole world, I find it extremely hypocritical that the filmmakers tried to deceive me TWICE before I got the counter! If you are so firm in your beliefs, why not be honest about it? <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that, had it not been a "Christian" movie with the integrated fan base that accompanies it, I seriously doubt that I'd ever seen the light of day. If Cloud Ten expected to see the error of my ways and surrender to God, I am afraid that I would have died of boredom and / or that I would have laughed to death before I had the chance.
