I'll say one thing for Herman, USA US: probably will always be good for the Minnesota public. I can not imagine there being another place in the world where a reference to Bemidji's quick life or a phrase like "I knew something was wrong with the boys from Iowa" would bring the house. I really enjoyed the first hour or so. Basically, a group of lonely peasants take out a personal ad and find their city besieged with willing women suitors (is it a specific word for each gender?). It is not progressive, no doubt, but it is quite charming in its own right. Too bad that the filmmakers felt the need to tackle an artificial secondary plot about an intriguing gold medal and her violent husband. In general, it's too cloying for its own sake, but you have to give some props to a movie with the guts to give a guy with Kevin Chamberlin a nude love scene. I will always applaud the description of people who do not meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual and affectionate human beings, but that is not enough to redeem Herman, EE. UU To paraphrase Jello Biafra, it is a nostalgia for a time that never existed.
