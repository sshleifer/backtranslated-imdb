It's terrible! It is as if someone had given a child a defective video camera and $ 30 and told them to make a movie. Even then you would get a better and more professional movie than this one. The story is so silly that you can say there is not one. I do not think the guy who did this knew what to do at all: watching foreign art movies all day is not enough to turn someone into an instant director. The acting is very bad, really at the kindergarten level and the writing is just horrible. The only scene I did not hate was the caravan accident, but even that just means it was a little less horrible than the rest of the movie. How do people get financing for these things? I do not care about alternative films, but should not they at least not be a big pile of cow dung? I would call amateur "milk price" if it were not an insult to the fans. It would not even be a good movie if you were drunk or drugged!
