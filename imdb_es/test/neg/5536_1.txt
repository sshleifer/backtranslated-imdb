So this ugly guy with long, nasty hair and his girlfriend end up in this house and they argue and argue over their old girlfriend. There was supposed to be something terrifying, but I did not see anything that scared me. There is a mention of a sea demon, but that is not going anywhere. I wish I did it because then I would have removed the tension of the jealous love triangle. The title of the film makes it look like it would be a terrifying and exciting movie, but it is so far from that I could not believe it. I waited and waited for him to finish and was so happy when he did. It was not up to the title as I should have done so boo hoo hoo. The cover had a great image, but you should not judge a corny movie for its cover.
