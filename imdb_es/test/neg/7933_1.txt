** Maybe the spoilers ** ** It's hard to spoil this thing more than it is, but just in case ** Gee's, I do not see how anyone would have liked this renovation! It was like a program "made for TV" and still quite boring for that. A lot of fake snow, bad acting from the best stars, bad action and that pine forest in Detroit. What the hell? I really did not think this would be a great movie, but I hoped to be entertained. No, we fell asleep halfway and had to finish it the next day. I could have jumped the rest easily (but then I would have missed those big pine forests!) I'm so glad I missed this in the theater! Bad enough to have lost $ 3.50 in the video store. And I am a lover of police movies, action and drama. This was a very stinky 1 out of 10 stars. Give me the original any day !!
