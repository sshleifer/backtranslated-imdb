This movie is pretty bad, aggressive, does not play well, is not well directed, seems low budget, low quality, emotionally weak and disconnected. after seeing the previous comments, I went to see it, but if you try to compare it with the apocalypse now, PLATOON or any other, you are really out of place. This movie looks like an old movie from the 60s with a cast of adult Neanderthals, not to mention (or actually does), without paying attention to details like changing rounds, low-budget fireworks and all kinds of badly filmed features. although you can see, if you would like to see it as an early development of the movie document ... do not come back! <br /> <br /> p.s - after all, the guys are pretty good.
