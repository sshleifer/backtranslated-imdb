The BBC and the Art and Entertainment Network should be ashamed of themselves for imposing this unfortunate production in the world. The acting is, with the exception of Robert Hardy as General Tilney, amateur at best and terribly painful at worst. The costumes are exaggerated and present some really macabre excesses. Was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats? Surely EVERY woman in Bath had no feathers on her helmet in the early nineteenth century. The production values ​​are deficient and the rhythm of the film makes one feel hurriedly and awkwardly edited at the last moment. All in all, an agonizing film that I had to force myself to see to the end. It's a shame, since the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and shooting on the spot. Compared to the sublime "Sense and Sensibility" of Emma Thompson or the extraordinary production of "Pride and Prejudice" of 1995 or the subtle intensity of "Persuasion" of 1995, this production of "Abbey of Northanger" surely has Jane Austen turning in his grave.
