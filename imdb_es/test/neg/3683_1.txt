The gates of hell opened and spit out this movie, then closed again. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie makes me appreciate other movies I've seen, like all the other movies. Nothing makes sense in this movie. <br /> <br /> It would really take a long time to mention all the problems in the plot. In fact, except as a warning, it really is not worth wasting some of the almost infinite space available on the Internet when writing about this movie. <br /> <br /> From now on, I will check IMDb before watching any movie. . <br /> <br /> Alright, IMDb forces me to write more about this movie. I guess I should warn you about Edison Force while I'm at it. But if you had to choose between the two, choose Edison Force.
