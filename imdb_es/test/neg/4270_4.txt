Now it is OK. This is a terrible piece of television. the work of the camera is frightening (I have to remind you of the crispy gravel so strong that you can hardly hear the actors speak) Lady Bertram has the most annoying voice in the whole world. Anna Massey is "acting" in such an incredible way. and the lack of chemistry between Fanny and Edmund goes further. Besides, Bertram girls are not pretty enough, and the guy who plays Henry Crawford is horrible. To say that camera work is unreliable is an understatement. I observed this adaptation during Christmas, and I believe that in any other circumstance I would not have been able to bear it, and I certainly could not have justified the lost time. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Faithful to jane's adaptations. so I could not stand the film adaptation or the recent film of pride and prejudice. But see any other adaptation, even emma is better than this.
