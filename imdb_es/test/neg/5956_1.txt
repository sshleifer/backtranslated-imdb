Where do I start? The box should have been enough to get me away from this attempt, but from the beginning I was taught not to judge a book (or a movie), so I ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and rented it anyway. But common sense should tell you that if you can not make a single still image properly, how sad will the movements be in the future? Yes. They were pretty horrible. <br /> <br /> The actors in this film seemed totally unaware that they were being filmed, as any expression seemed to be fine, regardless of the situation in which the characters were or what they reacted to. <br /> <br /> However, a good story can compensate for the disadvantages of low budget productions. Good dialogue can lead to a poorly funded attempt at times. Unfortunately, this was not one of those moments, since the story was as weak and non-existent as the other elements required of a good cinema. <br /> <br /> There are simply no words to describe how bad this was. <br /> <br /> Maybe you can get the idea of ​​my rating of -2.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
