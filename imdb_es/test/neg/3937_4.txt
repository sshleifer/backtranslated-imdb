Bruno in Petites Couperes, by Daniel Auteuil, is a middle-aged model of his Pierre in The Separation of Christian Vincent 10 years ago. In both films, youthful trust in the ideology of the left and love (mutual metaphors) disintegrates into paranoia, manifesting itself as an aggression trapped in Pierre and womanically comic in the most recent Bruno. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for fans of Auteuil, the actor has become dependent on a uniform fatigue in the world (not unlike his compatriot Johnny Hallyday in the recent l'Homme du Train de Leconte). Acting is not, and becomes more frustrating as the movie progresses. Pascal Bonitzer does not help as a writer / project director. His sequence of episodes superimposed on the symbolism of connection does not mask the lack of rhythm of the film. She was particularly furious that a cameraman who was obviously shaking from the cold made the Grenoble backdrops virtually redundant. <br /> <br /> Krisitn Scott Thomas almost rescues the show with her female Bruno counterpart, Beatrice. She dramatizes the vertiginous contradictions that Bruno intends in a character of increasing complexity to the point of becoming surreal. However, Bonitzer can not sustain this, and the plot of the flag requires Beatrice to match another bourgeois mannequin. In doing so, Bonitzer shows and then denies Scott Thomas the Oscar cabinet. <br /> <br /> The submersion of all the characters to the bourgeoisie can be a viable and tragic result, but in this case it is an escape from a cadence. (unlike the brutal and painful outcome of The Separation). A serious disappointment, 4/10.
