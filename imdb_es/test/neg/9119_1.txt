If not for the fact that it is a 2 DVD game paired with the original United States Graffiti; had it not been for the fact that I had been here in Iraq for several months and, at this moment, I will see almost anything, I would have thrown this movie in the trash after the first ten minutes. This movie was terribly bad on so many levels that I do not know where to start. He acted wrong, shot, directed, wrote, scored, edited. The first incursions of my 9-year-old daughter into film making are superior to this, and she was filming the sleeping dog. (Now that I think about it, I give that piece of cinematography 9 stars, but I'm partial.) If you have the slightest appreciation for the quality of filmmaking, avoid this piece of garbage at all costs. No character in this movie has a single redemption quality, except for the Icelandic girl who does not even have a single line in English. I will not waste more of my time describing what a bad movie this is.
