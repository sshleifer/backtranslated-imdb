* Critics do not mention spoilers * <br /> <br /> I rarely comment on users, but this is a movie that I do not have any problem with defamation. This movie sucks, and its mediocre rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such a pulp. The bone collector is not at all the same movie caliber as Silence of the Lambs or Seven, despite what his ad says. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The rhythm of this movie was extremely slow. In fact, I went for about 10 minutes halfway and returned to the exact scene with the same character without any progression (I mean the part in which the character of Angelina Jolie debates Denzel by cutting the hands of a corpse) . The movie is not terrifying at all, but try to make up for this with a secondary love story, though the sexy character of Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington. Of course, what you get is something comparable to the mentor-student relationship, as seen in the brilliant Silence of the Lambs epic with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and I was personally defeated by the villain to kill Denzel off to avoid the giggles between the two. With such a horrible movie, I was almost waiting for a plot twist or some kind of spectacular situation to end up giving the film some credit, things that mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream achieved. Anyone with a fourth-grade education can see the end of how it will be resolved (a situation that mimics Alfred Hitchcock's back window). The cliché that the killer explained his motives did not have enough inspiration, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid that it made me throw milk on the screen. Esoterically speaking, I even think that the murderer's intention was completely lost when Denzel happily recovers from his loss by the proverbial "chess game" and messes with his favorite project, Angelina. <br /> <br /> If you are a movie fan With original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (like I am), you will not appreciate this movie. If you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch up with every Hollywood cliché you've ever had (the nightly twist of someone other than the killer, the ridiculous serial killer and the main relationship of investigator, the horrible "woman who tries to survive in a male-dominated workforce (also known as SOTL), watch this movie ... but even then it's too slow and you'll get bored."
