Every time a film presents a dwarf or a dwarf in a prominent role, the odds are 10 to 1 in which the director released it because he did not know what else to do to keep the film interesting. In this case, the prominent little man is not so bad, he manages to maintain his dignity during most of his scenes (except in the part where he drags the protagonist down the dungeon stairs), but the film itself uses it . like a chew toy for dogs. <br /> <br /> The problem here is common with low budget exploitation films: here is a germ of a decent idea, but the director and the screenwriter do not know how to develop it. A good director would take the various elements of the story: brain transplants, mad doctors with secret laboratories and dungeons, car chases, fist fights, monstrous Frankenstein style assistant of vertigo, mind control, treason and conspiracy, etc. Exciting, involving films full of cheap and fun emotions. <br /> <br /> Instead, what we get here is a group of people who stumble and argue in the doctor's laboratory, then a cheesy operation in which the patient bleeds tempura paint, followed by some of the same people who stumble and argue in the doctor's lab, a little more, followed by another subgroup of the initial group that drives and suffers an accident, followed by an escape scene in the dungeon that is mostly about a woman who is put back the shoes, followed by a chase on the roof (the highest point itself) of the film), followed by a confusing series of events where everyone in the film seemingly escapes from everyone else, followed by a lovely walk through the countryside where everyone chases, collides, attacks or escapes from all AGAIN, followed by, well, not much more. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in here is a terrifying peroxide blonde dressed in white, a well-intentioned heroic guy who is quite attractive, a three-foot lab assistant, a big lunk with a mass of melted gum stuck to the side of his face, a child who wonders in the middle of the film to provide more of the "Frankenstein factor", a brunette who falls in love with the hero for no apparent reason, and the crazy doctor himself, who must be the man more fortunate in the history of the evil super-villains, because nothing goes according to his plan, but things work for him anyway ... and all because he remembered to put an electrode in the brain transplanted at a point of the operation . <br /> <br /> This was not in any way the worst movie I've seen, or even the worst exploitation movie I've seen, or even the worst exploitation film I've ever seen, but it's just there. , oozing modesty and lack of attention to detail at every point, and there is no real reason for even bad movie enthusiasts to see it.
