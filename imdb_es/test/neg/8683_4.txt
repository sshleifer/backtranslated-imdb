In this Silly Symphony, a country mouse visits his cousin in the city. Most of the short is that the two mice explore the table. The animation is fine, where this short suffers is due to lack of humor. Maybe I just saw this "dinner table adventure" with too many Tom and Jerry shorts. Even though this came first, I just did not find it so nice.
