Let me say first that I am a believer in ghosts, and in fact I know they exist. I have had enough experiences with them to know that they are there. <br /> <br /> What I hate is the people who introduce the Bible and religion in all this. People forget that there is more than one "Bible", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways of interpreting what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God, and not everyone believes in a typical stereo religion. <br /> <br /> Religion does not make everything a fact, one of the things I should mention in the Bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant Bible beater is breaking the rules written inside them ... you are supposed to never use more than one cloth at a time, slavery is fine and you can kill your neighbor under certain circumstances. None of this, "Oh, that was the Old Testament, and now we have the New Testament." If the Bible is the word of God, and it can not be changed ... there should not be changes or versions. Religion is full of misunderstandings, mixed facts and people who follow him so blindly that there "there is no other way". The excuses used by these blind followers are pathetic, or they themselves can not explain the discrepancies correctly, and instead use excuses that have been given to them by their Pastor or teacher. <br /> <br /> But anyway, in the review. I am a decent fan of "Ghost Hunters" and when I heard that this program would arrive soon, I was very excited and thought I had some potential. As much as I like to see "Ghost hunters", I do not like some of their members, and I do not like the way they can fire a place that is being chased, but I can not explain anything that is happening. The fact that his research team does not detect it does not mean that the camera that filmed the program did not detect it. I'm glad they're skeptical, but it's like they do not understand that the fact that you did not get anything in your tape recorder and the movie does not make the place happy or not. If the ghosts were so easy to capture, it would be known as a fact, not as a belief. It is rather a kind of "right place at the right time", as well as if there is something there, what makes you think that it will "act" for you? This show is a bit silly. It is usually boring, and there is a lot of talk, there are many psychics, but almost nothing happens. The filtered narration of the main guy is usually boring to listen to or basically not necessary. <br /> <br /> In addition, the confidence in the psychics is too abundant, since I believe that very few of them are really gifted. Silvia Brown is one I definitely believe in, but most of the time it's hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this program, but of the few that I have seen it still has not impressed me very much.
