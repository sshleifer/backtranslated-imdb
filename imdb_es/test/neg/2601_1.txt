This is the most overrated program on television. I think people continue to see it because they think they should, because it has become a "great" show to see and talk with their friends about the next day at work or school. it seldom actually causes more than a giggle and never provokes any sense of irony or thought from the audience. All jokes are interchangeable with "punchlines" that seem to come out of a hat. the total lack of originality combined with the even slower turn that it has generated (see: American Dad) makes me question the intelligence of an audience that continues to maintain this horrible show on television. I do not award points to a family type, and may God have mercy on your soul ...
