I love the Jurassic Park movies, they are three of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> And I hate this game, if there was a game I wish I did not have for the Super Nintendo. <br /> <br /> How can a game based on a classic movie be too horrible? And to make it worse, I got scared of this game when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> How silly that was, but again it was a boy when this game came out for the first time. <br /> <br /> The game in this game is strange. One minute is an action game and then a shooter. What is wrong in the world when making a decision when creating a video game. <br /> <br /> The sound in the game is just terrible to hear. <br /> <br /> Music is too sick to listen to. <br /> <br /> The controllers in the game do not work most of the time. <br /> <br /> Jurassic Park the game is just a waste of time and money and it will not be a classic. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs
