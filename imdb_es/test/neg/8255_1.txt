A truly masterful piece of cinema. He managed to put me to sleep and stun my mind. So boring that it induces sleep and yet, so ridiculous that it made me wonder how these things are done. Avoid at all costs. That is, unless you want to take an invisible cranial punishment, in which case I highly recommend it.
