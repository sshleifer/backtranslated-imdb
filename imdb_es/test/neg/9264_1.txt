Well, after the exaggerations that surrounded the film and after Surya labeled the movie as PATH-BREAKING, I went into the theater expecting something big. Chico was disappointed. <br /> <br /> First, the characterizations in the movie are SO strange! What wife would do what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? An idiot, coo-coo? And what was the point of her presence in the rain with her son (Baby Shreya) after she and her husband had a fight? What was the purpose of that scene anyway? To start a vulgar shot "Maaja Maaja"? The song not only was not preserved aesthetically, but it was not necessary in the script either. IT IS NOT NEEDED AT ALL! Second, the first half of the had virtually no history. The entire first half was a FREAKING drag. Each scene in the first half of the film had no meaning for the actual story of the film. And also, how did Aishwarya (Bhoomika Chawla) change so radically all of a sudden? And how did Gautham (Surya) and Kundhavi have a happy life together after six years, even though they were so unhappy about getting married? And if Gautham loved Aishwarya as he said yes, why did he marry Kundhavi even if it was his uncle's death wish? WHY? That's the question you keep asking while you watch the movie! And just what is the end for Aishwarya? After all, was she Gautham's first wife? Krishna, the director of the film, said he worked on the script for two years, but his script is flawed and leaves the audience completely irritated! Third, Krishna's unimaginative imaginations of Rahman's impressive ones are simply disappointing. Surprisingly, Anthony's (usually excellent) edition for the song "New York Nagaram" just sucks. The whole song looked like a slide show made in Microsoft Power Point! The choir "Munbe Vaa" by Rangoli was wasted showing Gautham PLAYING FOOTBALL! Who wants to see the bloody guy playing soccer during such a beautiful choir? Also, the whole movie just needed TWO songs. Munbe Vaa and Kummi Adi. The rest of the songs that include "Machakari", "Maaja Maaja", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" are simply not necessary. Rahman's good efforts are simply wasted on a stupid movie directed by an amateur director! Fans of Rahman, you ask why Rahman is still moving to Bollywood. After seeing how his songs are represented in Kollywood, why would he want to stay here? What is more irritating is that, after Krishna decided to include Machakari in the film, the song was cut in half, which really annoys. <br /> <br /> Surya looks handsome in his new shoots, except those who are in the university scene. and packages in a regular performance. Their expressions during all the songs in which they performed really do not conform to the way the singer sings the songs. Was Jyothika acting in the movie? All she did was cry! Would you call all that crying acting? One of his worst performances! Also, her new hairstyle does not fit well. It looked much better in Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu. Their costumes during the song "New York Nagaram" are far away. Bhoomika Chawla is simply beautiful during the movie and does justice to her role. The Vadivelu comedy is ANNOYING. When you're looking at it, you want to be able to slap it in the face. Santhanam is the spectacle thief during the comedy scenes. And why the devil did Sukanya accept to play such a tiny role that anyone could have done? And why is her makeup so heavy when she has the perfect complexion? Music by A.R. Rahman is simply amazing. They deserve a special mention "Machakari", "Munbe Vaa", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal". The cinematography of R. R. Rajasekhar is fine and is not as good as in his previous films, although the stage during the song "Kummi Adi" deserves a special mention. The Anthony edition is really disappointing. The film is so risky and could be cut severely. <br /> <br /> Krishna's address simply stinks. The dialogues (A.C. Durai and Krishna) are too cheesy to digest especially the part where Bhoomika professes her love for Surya. The script and the script (Krishna) are horibble. The movie moves in the most interesting rhythm ever. And Krishna's script is simply full of unexplained subplots. <br /> <br /> And for the love of God, why was there so much publicity in the movie? Pepsi, Maggi, Suzuki, whatever. Was the producer of the film (K.E. Gnanavel) on a budget or was he just desperate? In general, Jillunu Oru Kaadhal is a wet squib. With a title like that, one would expect a comforting and comforting love story, but what you end up with is a painfully frustrated love story. Really, really disappointing.
