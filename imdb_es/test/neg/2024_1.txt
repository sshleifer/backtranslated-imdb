Have I seen a movie worse? No, I can not say I did it. This was pathetic. If the director is still alive: 1. He should not be. 2. I should be ashamed. 3. God, how I would like to get my 2 hours of time completely lost in your $$. <br /> <br /> To give you some tips on the "movie": <br /> 1. (I am a man) and I would prefer to make a papercut in the opening of my urethra before seeing this again (seriously). <br /> <br /> 2. It has some well-known names (Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio). They do not help, and their film careers after this "movie" have officially ended by the way. <br /> <br /> 3. Dialogue is the worst I've heard. "I want to ejaculate in your bozonkas"? What kind of writer did they have in this movie? Did he still use hooked phonemes and only confused his letters to make these horrible phrases? Or was he trying to get the Director killed by the few people who saw this? <br /> <br /> 4. Look at this "film" upside down. Because I PROMISE you that you do not want to see it forward. <br /> <br /> 5. This "movie" would make Helen Keller get up and leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6. The movie set looks like a McDonald's playplace of adult size. I was waiting for this so-called "Dracula" to fall into the ball hole at some point in the movie. <br /> <br /> 7. Also, I like that in the year 3000 they still have headphones with wires that go to their mouths. There is no bluetooth, no wireless headphones, no chips are placed in the brain, but they use headsets borrowed from a telemarketing agency that closed in 1983 (good job manager in this case) Really professional, I hope you are currently unemployed and reading this.) <br /> <br /> 8. I do not know who was in charge of the special effects, but I could have done better in my garden with my VHS camcorder that has no battery. <br /> <br /> 9. I was a devout Catholic before this "movie". But since I saw it, I know there is not a God, because if there was, I would not have let this movie happen. Now I am an atheist. <br /> <br /> 10. I'll be honest, I can not talk about the end. The last time I tried to explain it, I fell into a coma. <br /> <br /> People, no matter how boring you are, curious (or brave), for a lot of laughter, THINK you will come out of this movie, please DO NOT LOOK AT THIS. It has literally ruined my life. AVOID ALL COSTS! <br /> <br /> Tell the director: I hate you. You have ruined my life. After seeing this I feel empty inside. My wife and children have abandoned me and they hate me because I could not talk or I barely moved after seeing this. I lost my job, my dignity, and above all my pride. I will never forgive you in this life or in the next (which does not look good with my new beliefs).
