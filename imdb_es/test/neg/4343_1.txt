"This life" is truly as bad as it gets. His cast of mercenary, lascivious, ruthless, duplicate and superficial characters are thought as a reflection on their environment after the eighties and I have to admit in this regard that it is a precise creation. Unfortunately, it does not leave me anything to sympathize with or worry about, and I consider it one more step towards the higher rate television phone in scams; Surprisingly bad, cheap, reality and television saturated with 'celebrities'; and other cutting and running attitudes that have destroyed this medium and, in fact, a large part of British society. Does it sound exaggerated? I do not think it is. In this sense, programs like 'This Life' have been as influential as they are often called.
