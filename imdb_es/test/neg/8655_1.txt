I would give this movie a 1/10. This film lacks common cinematic substance and concentrates too much on the "current trend" of Bollywood films. I definitely would not recommend the teenagers to watch this movie. What really makes me feel dejected is how a banner as impressive as Yash Chopra Films could succumb to such a horrible production. They may have forgotten to take into account that there is also a larger audience than the "adult" audience, which when exposed to this type of thick films, can ruin their growing mentality and succumb to things that lack meaning and recognition. > <br /> In general, movies should not only be entertaining, but should also be part of some sense. Certainly, this movie is a huge disappointment for Yash Chopra fans, especially for me. I'm really disappointed by the plot, the acting and everything else. Why can not people put in some substance that can be appreciated after being confronted in the movies, at least for once throughout the movie? The point is clear. I would like to briefly express my opinion: "Horrible - Deception - Large amount of adult material - Lack of sensible" substance "- Lack of normal psyche - No value - I could take a Cornetto or a chocolate Temptations instead"
