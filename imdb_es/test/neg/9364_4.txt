The film of the film course this evening was The Legend of the Fortress of Suram and during its 87 consecutive minutes, managed to jump quickly to my five most difficult films of all time. That is hard to see; Films so different from everything else that you are seeing something totally strange. A brief synopsis would be: a group of Georgians are trying to build a fortress to defend themselves against the invaders, but every time they are about to put the finishing touches, for no apparent reasons, it collapses. So they go and see a fortune-teller who advises them that if they want the fortress to remain standing, they need to find a young, tall blond boy with blue eyes to be buried in one of the walls during construction and his presence. It will ensure that the construction work will be completed without problems. And, indeed, in those final moments there, he is happily being smeared with cement and eggs, laughing while buried alive, with only his mother to cry. <br /> <br /> It's actually a pretty simple story. But the director, Sergo Paradjanov, who worked in Soviet Georgia in 1984, not long after serving a fifteen-year sentence, does not follow any of the filming rules to which we are accustomed. There are very few close ups. Very often, the action that we must follow is hidden in the lower left corner of a landscape shot, extraordinarily easy to miss. There are very few close ups and, sometimes, it is difficult to know who does what to whom and why. From time to time, the film begins with digressions that have no relevance to the main plot and generally serve to confuse the viewer. The music is completely crazy, with found sounds, on-screen instruments and apparently random church organ. At times when nothing seems to be happening, someone will enter a template, almost playing time until the next scene appears. But, on the contrary, there is an obvious cinematic voice behind everything, so you are bound to try to understand the message, whatever it may be. One of those times when your eyes are glued to the screen simply because you can not believe what you are seeing.
