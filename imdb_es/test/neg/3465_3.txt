How many times should I write the boring and non-funny words on this page until I get to ten lines? George is about an original actor like Alfalfa of the little Rascals. Although that is probably a slight alfalfa. How many times have I infiltrated these overpaid actors before I learned that there is only one law in the film industry? Take the money and make a movie, even if it's crap. They spend millions making this movie, but they can not take a moment to see the final result. And Renee GoAwayZigger must stop consuming the illegal drugs she consumes and seek medical help for the facial problems she has. At least I hope they are drugs, since it is quite unattractive while talking by the side of your mouth. This movie was neither funny nor dramatic, and these tricks should stop doing this shit. George and Renee, should be ashamed of themselves and stop being apathetic.
