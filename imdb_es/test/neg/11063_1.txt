This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. On par with Blair Witch and just as annoying. The flashing lights on the helmet made things difficult to see, and I think epileptics should pay attention, as there are moments with strobe lights that make this movie even more annoying. I think if they had been calmer, they could have found a way out. Then, when you think that the geek could appear triumphs, he even resorts to a nervous breakdown. Oh, and when the guy who has sex realizes that when the girl says she can hear something. She can really hear something. One of these guys must have seen at least Scream (where they call attention to those things). It is also a big disappointment when a premise offers so much promise and then someone writes the script. Sorry, folks, I received this weekly in the video store and I would still like to get my money back.
