This should be rated as one of the worst movies of all time. The film was screened at the Italian Film Festival in Melbourne, Australia. After the screening, I not only wanted my money back, but also the 1.5 wasted hours of my life. I have a very broad tolerance level when it comes to the indulgences of some European films, but this is one of those films that are selected for festivals based only on the filmmaker's reputation. This film is proof that, while those selections can satisfy the egos of the filmmaker and the selection panel, there is absolutely no joy for the audience. There is no character development at all, the plot is a confusing mess, the style does not make sense, the selection of shots is atrocious and the editing is worse. At the end of the first roll, you will ask yourself if you entered the wrong cinema, and at the end of the third roll, you will be asking to be taken out of misery. This movie is an abomination.
