Special previews are always a good time. No matter what movie you're watching, the theater will always be full of people who have been waiting for the movie, like free stuff, thought it would be something to do or just get lost. Either way, no matter how good or bad the movie is, only the audience will make it pleasant. Now, when that movie is a PG-13 pseudohorror movie (can you really delve into the horror when the MPAA is on your back censoring everything?) You know there will be chats, laughter and restraint. With The Messengers, the crowd did not disappoint by giving numerous outbursts and warnings to the characters on the screen. As for the film itself, I feel sorry for those involved, since it really could have been much better if it had been the right rhythm and it would have allowed me to stretch my legs beyond the progression of fear / fading to black / show that they have had these movies. In the end, we are shown a boring and arduous story, without surprises and few moments of real suspense. <br /> <br /> History is common. A family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try to rebuild their relationship with each other. Once installed, the spirits of the house come out to the reformed and problematic child, whose past makes it even easier for the parents not to believe everything that is said to them. Of course, the child is not crying wolf and those around him only discover it when it is too late. I will give credit to the Pang Brothers, (directors of the acclaimed The Eye that I would like to see more than before to see what they can do without the interference of Hollywood, supposedly the referrals in The Messengers were made by another person, but the brothers retained the credit it is a shame what our study system does to foreigners, especially when it came to creative independence, which made the films what brought them and not the background interference), to have an appropriate style and maintain the weary plot a little fresh. Unfortunately, I must also give them credit for the almost unbearable slowness. Similar to why I did not like What Lies Beneath, I could not stand the prolonged suspense, which goes so far as to make him laugh. When our heroine and her brother stand in a hallway with a ghost behind them, the scene lasts about eight minutes, with only static, strangely composed approaches and changes in the depth of field to finish and do not culminate in anything at all. For being only 84 minutes, I almost believe that it would have worked better even shorter. <br /> <br /> In addition to a very effective opening sequence, with the fantastic Jodelle Ferland (strangely playing a child) and a great atmospheric credit In sequence, the only thing that saves the movie from total trash is the performance. With the exception of Penelope Ann Miller, who first made me wonder what happened to her and then, after some scenes, she made me understand why I never asked that question in the years that she was absent, and Dustin Milligan, lacking credibility, the The acting is very strong. Dyan McDermott does a good job as a father trying to keep his family together during all the difficult times. He has many small moments of light comedy to counteract his serious and dramatic role. William B. Davis (the favorite Cancerman of all) is used effectively as an almost premonitory character, unfortunately not used anymore. Our real stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett. Stewart interprets the emotion very well and she shows promising as an actress with this and Panic Room on her resume. As for Corbett, if he had not achieved his role, the whole movie would have completely collapsed. I would like to give him more work since I have enjoyed it since the underestimated series "The Visitor". I still need to see his first role in "Northern Exposure," a show I have not seen yet. able to catch up with It's a shame that it's probably more recognizable by the overrated My Big Fat Greek Wedding. <br /> <br /> In any case, The Messengers gave me a good introduction to the work of the Pang Brothers and revitalized my desire to revise their Chinese horror catalog. The mood and the performances were there; It was just the simple, empty story that needed too much space to make a movie. If they delved deeper into other characters, instead of just Stewart, it could have been more effective at the same time they had something else to show in ten-minute scenes of nothing. If our protagonist is the only one being attacked, there is no suspense as to how far the creatures will go to harm him. The moments of danger had no gravity for them and, until the end, they simply remained as stuffing. However, I am excited about the free comic that was given after the special screening, since I hope the medium allows a faster rhythm story to absorb before it tries to surprise.
