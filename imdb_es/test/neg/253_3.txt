I've seen this movie twice in the last six months (what I'm going through so I do not have to). The first visualization left me half mad and babbling. The second display at 5 am on a rainy morning was a little better. he just screamed in agony once. <br /> <br /> It seems that Pocona (the Aztec mummy) had the sympathies of a certain Aztec princess who "was supposed to be her maid". Obviously the business was given and they were put to Death for that. (Now that's serious!) But before they do, the film tries to kill us with a screeching Aztec ceremony. The song will bleed your ears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is a habitual reincarnation without meaning. Not to mention a treasure map on a breastplate and a bracelet guarded by that vague belly, Pocona. For this time, Pocona seems to have been in a situation of 2000 years and is behind the profaners of his grave. Their moans and moans sound as if they had a bad case of the revenge of Moctezuma (or read the script of this film). That will make your breath stink. <br /> <br /> An evil Dr. Von Krupp seems to want the Aztec treasure (possibly to finance acting lessons and script writing classes) for the cast and crew). It's called The Bat because in The Curse Of The Aztec Mummy he was wearing a bat as a cape, hat and something like a ski mask on his face. I guess it's better than the fat man who laughs. <br /> <br /> The bat in the typical fashion of mad scientists wants to rule the world. He emphasizes this by rolling his eyes, laughing maniacally and chewing the landscape. He has armed an invincible robot. It seems that the 'bot' was made with a dustbin, a spider and the grill of a 1957 Buick. This will make your eyes A company is even credited for making this can! <br /> <br /> Well, the powerful confrontation between Pocona and the Robot takes place in the new Crypt of the Mummy that has been left homeless previously. <br /> <br /> Approximately half of this film comes from "The Aztec Mummy," never released in the United States in its original form, but in a cut-off atrocity by Jerry Warren (see my review in "The Attack of the Mayan mummy ") and" Curse Of The Aztec Mom ". The robot is downright stupid, like most of the characters. If that and the plot do not make you howl with laughter, nothing will. <br /> <br /> My first impression was so bad I would have had one. But after watching "Mayan Mummy" (which is a movie that deserves to be burned) and seeing "Robot" again, he gets a 3. You must see this without any expectation. Then it can be naively nice.
