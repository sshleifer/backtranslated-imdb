An "independent" film that, from the bottom of the box, promises turns, adventures and an emotional adventure that we will never forget. This movie also deceives us when we see her flaunting Rachel Lee Cook with a leading role. After the first twenty minutes, you realize that this movie will not give you ANYTHING. The story continues without direction, without revealing anything new or important to keep us interested. The three "disturbed" characters only have small details of the background story to force us to worry. As it comes to an end, everything related to the story is altered and, instead of helping the audience to catch up, they have no idea and, what is more important, they are not interested in the "why". The director, who also thought it would be a good idea to co-star, seems to enter the film without previous experience or useful film knowledge. The whole piece resembles an "art" film from the university created by a first year film student who tries to hide the lack of true talent.
