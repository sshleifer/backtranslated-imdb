Garden State must be classified among the most sophisticated and pretentious films of all time. The plot is simple, involving a young man who returns home after the death of his mother and discovers love. But in reality, the plot is not important. What is important for Zach Braff: writer, director and star? is that you can hang all the necessary elements of an "indie" or "artistic" movie from the plot. Therefore, we are presented with cute and extravagant characters and scenes that do not exist for reasons of plot or character development, but simply to give the film some artistic credibility (Ã  la Wes Anderson, or so Braff expects). Unfortunately and somewhat surprisingly, Braff has not only cheated many in IMDb, but also some critics who really should have known better. bad movie What really makes Garden State a stinker is Braff's writing. He simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film, and the dialogue and characterization are abysmal. Braff often has to resort to blunt devices and symbolism to achieve what he can not achieve through writing. For example, the numbness of Braff's character is shown by his indifference to an impending plane crash (this can not be worked on in the plot, and therefore has to occur in a dream!), Later he is shown counterattacking against his circumstances, screaming in a bottomless pit (life = a bottomless pit, very smart Mr. Braff). Those two scenes must be among the most ridiculous and artificial scenes ever seen on a movie screen. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the acting is passable despite the lack of material for the cast to work (for what it means a script), and I admire Natalie Portman for her efforts as the love interest , a character so badly written and implausible that it is little more than a mindless doll that Braff turns into his fantasy woman. <br /> <br /> Apparently, it took Braff 3 years to write the script for Garden State (3 years to write a script so bad, it's really inept!). Hopefully it will be some time before I make another movie.
