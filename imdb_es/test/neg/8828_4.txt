It is quite possible that I simply did not give the film a fair chance because it was not so attractive to me (something similar happened with Triplets of Belleville), but I really should have caught when I put the film and my Roommate, an exchange student from Japan, he immediately started laughing at the movie, saying that it sounded silly. Now, I do not agree that it is silly, the animation is very simple but clearly very skillful. It's like a classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time. <br /> <br /> But the subject does not interest me at all. It has an interesting message about pettiness and greed, but it is wrapped up in such an unpleasant package that it is hardly worth learning, especially since I already knew it anyway. The sound effects while the man is gobbling up cherries and cherries, for example, are really repulsive. <br /> <br /> There was a clever animation scene as we continued to plunge incessantly into the hole that the man finds in his Head when he takes the shoot out of his scalp, but it continues for so long that it seems to eclipse everything else. There is so much material in that single sequence that it's almost as if the whole movie was about. <br /> <br /> As I said about Triplets of Belleville, this would have been a great thing for a nightly television program. Program like swimming for adults, or its Japanese counterpart, but a film nominated for the Academy Award? I get the impression that generally there is not a long list of animated short films for the Academy to choose.
