I have a friend who works in blockbuster, and he gets 5 free movie rentals per week, so one day, as we walked through the corridors in search of something interesting, I stumbled upon 18 Weapons of Kung Fu and, judging from the box alone, this movie It seemed quite weird, but nonetheless we surrendered to temptation and rented it, after all, it was free ... and thank God it was ... this is, by far, the worst movie I've seen ... the budget must have been a mess and a piece of string ... the plot was ridiculous, the only mention of the "18 weapons" is that there is a book that teaches the forms of the 18 weapons that a bad guy seeks. and that is! there are not even weapons that fight in this movie ... that and the action sequences are just BAD ... 9 times out of 10 the other guy's punches and kicks occur a foot away from the other guy's landing, and MANY times in which the film skips the frames (result of a ridiculously poor edition) ... the dubbing is also ridiculous, and it is almost not comprehensible ... and we do not even get into acting. ..the end will definitely leave you saying "wtf ??", however, to be fair, I must mention that the fighting techniques used by the actors were somewhat decent, and the old man is an idiot ... but that's all ... fortunately I did not have to pay for this movie, but I guess at least now I know exactly how bad a movie can be ...
