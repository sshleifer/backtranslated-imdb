Only one word can describe MR MAGOO - slapstick. Unfortunately this is not an airplane. Appearances can disappear, and that is exactly what MR MAGOO does. Based on the old caricature, Leslie Nielson plays Magoo, a clumsy blind man who stumbles upon a pair of jewel thieves. Now you must hunt them using basically ... blindness. And that's all this movie plays out. The blindness of MR MAGOO. Maybe if they had some fun jokes about this, but it's practically just one of those "silly, sticky smiles on your face because you're too embarrassed to admit that you paid to see these" movies. <br /> <br /> But MR MAGOO is not as bad as it seems. At least he has some funny jokes, and it's good fun for the whole family (Nielson tried to make a "NAKED POINT" for families in MAGOO, but it's not as good as that). So see it once, I may hate it, I love it, whatever. Personally I did not hate it, but I did not like it, I do not even call it "good". 2/5 stars for MR MAGOO- <br /> <br /> JOHN ULMER
