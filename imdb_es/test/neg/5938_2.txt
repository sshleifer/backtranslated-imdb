Maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way to make a living, but it's still a way to make a living. However, after watching this movie, one can leave believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy, bloated, cocky paper pusher who lives exclusively to participate in their next lunch break. It is not exactly a pretty picture, but this is the image that the public has to endure to see what is just another action movie tedious, noisy and exaggerated. Just what the doctor ordered ... right? How many more of these movies has Hollywood made? Thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making these films is so beaten in the dust that now it should be completely unrecognizable. The locations change, but the plots remain the same, and with the same development of shallow characters and acting as superficial as trained performers are asked to become pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. This movie seemed endless. "When will this movie end?" Repeatedly I thought to myself. Leonardo DiCaprio was totally amazing as an agent of the CIA, but what has to be one of the great farces of bad results, an overweight Russell Fate plays a CIA bureaucrat. Keep in mind that in this movie the operative on the site is "thin and petty", while your table supervisor is fat. This is called stereotypes. What was the casting director thinking? Why is not Jack Nicholson playing an overweight office worker? Or Nicole Kidman plays a frenetic saleswoman in a department store? And the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could give it credibility. An obviously non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) trying to pass himself off as an Arab ... he speaks Arabic fluently ... he makes all sorts of brain patterns of the hair that are doomed to failure ... trying to think and overcome it. Arabs who are completely helpless because of their Arab masked laughter ... trying to make a Palestinian woman fall in love while in the midst of a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. Now you understand the point. Next time try to choose a real Arab on paper. Not even the most naive movie viewer can believe all that. There must be an approximate balance between the protagonist and the antagonist. In this film, the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that he leaves history in disarray. Next stop for this movie - DVD land and forgetting. And another thing. Do not let this movie discourage you from working for the government. The pay may not be good, but the additional benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this film conveniently omits.
