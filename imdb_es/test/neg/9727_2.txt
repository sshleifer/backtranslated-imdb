I feel very generous to give this movie a 2 out of 10. Okay, I noticed that the special effects are 'good' and that Renny Harlin made me one of my favorite genetically modified shark attack films in a research station , that you may know as the deep blue sea. In addition, the opening credits are done quite well with a remix of WhiteZombie "more human than human" and goes quite well with what is in the context of this "movie". But enough praise, let's go to the reason why this movie sucks a lot. <br /> <br /> Not since Uwe Boll, Alone in the Dark, did I feel that the special effects of a movie had been completely wasted. Okay, our story begins with four types that are descendants of four different families. , each of which possesses a power never completely explained from a family background never fully explained that made an art never explained of the art of the witch. Oh, and for some reason, these descendants are all 17, they all go to the same school, they're all in the swim team and everyone, for some reason or another, sits on the bed shirtless, sweats and talks to each other phone. I do not have anything against gays, Goths or thirteen years old, but that's what this film is about. in ... goth of 13 years that question their sexuality. Yes, there are girls in it, who sit in their beds with their panties or whatever, but why do not they take off their shirts? Hey, it's just fair. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the characters in this movie are told that when they turn 18, they will ascend and be given new deep powers, almost like God's. But before moving on, I forgot to mention that when they use their powers, they age slowly and become more addicted to them. That explains why they made people over 20 years of age play at 17 years old. Oh, and if something needs an explanation, do not worry, someone will explain everything in a great dialogue. God, this movie sucks ... Where was it? Oh yes, the part of the ascension. <br /> <br /> Well, apparently there was a super-secret family-alpha-one from which the others forgot or some s #t like that, I do not know, I was dozing at this point. But they were written in some way and the new boy from the school who is making friends with the group is 'secretly' one of these descendants of the fifth family. And I say "secretly" because anyone who has seen any of the previews of this movie knows that this new guy is the bad guy. It has more power than the others because I think it is greater. Anyway, Bob Loblaw (say it out loud) things happen and we get to the final fight in the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it was all a game for a witch battle. Do you know how Saurmon vs. Gandalf or something like the magic battle, because you know, this is about witches and stuff. Now, when these two witches are down, it's more like ... how can I put it ... a very, very bad version of a Dragonball Z type battle. They throw things, talk, throw things, talk, throw things, talk, etc. . When I say 'throw things' I just say it because I have no idea what F #% k are throwing at each other. It looks like big drops of slimy water. God, this movie sucks, anyway, when our main witch "ascends", it does not become very powerful at all. He has just thrown large drops of viscous water. Things happen and end in a way that you, as a spectator, know will end. The good witch wins bad. The bad witch loses. <br /> <br /> You know how bad a movie is when the bad guy says something as incredibly stupid as: 'I'm going to make you my Wiotch' That's where I wanted to hit. I myself in the face to sit in all this ... thing. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit it, the idea of ​​witches fighting, using the powers in modern times sounds a bit great, but when the execution is wrong, I really wished they would not make this movie. Maybe if it were R-rated, it would have tit and it would throw more deaths with a pinch of blood, it could have worked ... it could have worked. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing this, do not do it. Buy it or even fix it. Wait for it to come out on TV or borrow it from the piglet of a friend who bought it. Just do not waste your time with this trick of a movie. If you spend money on it, it is very likely to make an effort for Uwe Boll to make a sequel called The Covenant 2: Alone in the dark with the house of the dead.
