I can only think of one reason why this movie was released. To capitalize on the upcoming fame of Guy Pearce. This film has no merit at all and unnecessarily destroys the memory of Errol Flynn. The homosexual encounter was pure speculation. The disdain shown for Flynn in this film is palpable. An easy way to slander an actor who died years ago. Horrible and shameful. Very disappointing. Do not waste your time on this absolute garbage. Watch My Wicked wicked way if you want to learn about this excellent actor or read his autobiography. This movie is not the way.
