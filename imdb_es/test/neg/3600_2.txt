This comes from an adult who came across the first waiting for a film directed at children and was surprised by the adult mood in Emperors New Groove. The character that I liked most was Kronk, so I was thrilled when I found out about the sequel (sp) that "Kronk" presented. <br /> <br /> I just saw the new rhythm of Kronk, it took me two days because I had to turn it off, I was so bored halfway. I finally saw the rest the next day and, unfortunately, the second half was as unconvincing as the first half. <br /> <br /> Being a Disney movie, I expected to have some musical scenes, however this was full of them and they were not fun. The great thing that I found about Emperors New Groove was that it could be appreciated by a wide audience, from small children to adults. In all honesty, Kronks New Groove did nothing for me or my girlfriend, and we both love the first one. It is really aimed at young children, the comedy is quite childish, the musical scenes are not very well done and the plot itself is extremely cheesy. <br /> <br /> Save yourself some money and rent this movie if possible because it is definitely not worth a second visit. I felt extremely disappointed and surprised at how far this movie was. They really managed to make a character (Kronk) not fun in this movie, that's amazing in itself. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the opinion of each differs, but I have a lot of fun, I generally enjoy the sequels (sp) even when others discredit them, mainly because I loved the first ones so much that I needed more of the characters and not No matter how bad the plot was, I would like to enjoy the movie. I can not say the same about this, I would never have thought that I would turn it off in half due to sheer boredom. <br /> <br /> Buy at your own risk.
