To begin with, the script is imitative and inane. The characters are superficial and formulated. The plot has arbitrary reversions and not sequencers. Baldwin's leadership is terrible: these actors could do better by themselves. The jokes and jokes fade away. The shooting scenes are awkward and incredible. Baldwin addresses himself as the wise and brave hero, but spends most of his time in power struggles with women, particularly with the repressed woman caricatured in her tunnel team who is always asking and denying calmness. The driver suffers from absurd incompetence, unable to effectively use a gun that he has achieved. Anomalies: a hooded man bristling with guns through a railway car, surprises people. The next time we see them, they deal with their affairs sitting in their seats, talking, eating, reading, knitting. In the New York subway, people sometimes come on the train to do some musical or dramatic number. I thought the "event" was.
