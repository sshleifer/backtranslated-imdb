When Las Vegas came out, one critic described this program as, quote "A little harmless fluff". It goes without saying that after watching a dozen episodes, I think this description is accurate. A variety of handsome boys and types of strutting models reproduce a variety of thin paper stories while trying to pretend that they are serious businessmen. One-dimensional characters, in a one-dimensional environment, chasing one-dimensional stories. That pretty much sums up Las Vegas. I still look from time to time to see if the program is trying to evolve and take it a little seriously, but unfortunately it does not help. Up to this point.
