I think the manuscript of this movie was written on toilet paper. It does not respect at all the many important details that intrinsically make the film. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (which I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are those? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic !!! What a name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an involvement in Karadzic and Mladic. Second, there has never been any case of terrorism carried out by the Serbs. A journalist as the main character should have known. Thirdly, the actors who interpret the Serbian terrorists are neither Serbian nor speak Serbo-Croatian. Leaving all this aside, this movie has a solid performance, but the story is very thin and full of holes. Sometimes it does not make any sense !!!
