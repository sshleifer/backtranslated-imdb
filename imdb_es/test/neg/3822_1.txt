Any horror film that plays Robert Englund (Freddie Kruger!) And then kills him in the opening 5 minutes before the opening credits are executed, should be seen instantly without further suspicion. <br /> <br /> Tony Todd (Candyman!) as tour guide of the swamp (his impression of the voice of James Earl Jones is hysterical, by the way, I do not know or care if he was trying to be funny, but I I was laughing at that). Unfortunately his role was 5 minutes too. More reasons to suspect and with enough reason. <br /> <br /> Mercedes McNab (AKA Harmony of Buffy & Angel, I had to look for her to see what I remembered about her, but she's half-naked!), Marcus The token black guy (Not Another Teen Movie) is fulfilling a role of comedy that is not really required in a horror movie unless it is a parody. <br /> <br /> Joel Murray (brother of Bill Murray and Pete of Dharma & Greg) plays Shapiro, the boy who records the gonzo video with the 2 beautiful girls. While performing a "Spooky Swap Ghost Tour", the two main male characters meet other people and get stuck on the rocks and have to leave the ship. So now they are all isolated in the swamp at night in the rain. <br /> <br /> Once the true story of Victor Crowley is told (his makeup resembled Sloth of The Goonies), we have established that he is dead. (Well, you will not be hit again in the skull by an ax!) Once the old man is attacked, despite taking out his weapon and having a very clear shot, Marybeth takes more than 30 seconds to start firing at a kind. who is hacking an old man apart with an ax. Is she stupid? That's 29 seconds too long! In terms of the plot there really is not one (I do not classify the undead psycho as a plot, I'm sorry) and the rhythm is also very bad. You have a murder, a little fleeing, a bit of light relief and then a slow dialogue before starting the cycle again. <br /> <br /> After an extremely long scene investigating a wobbly bush with a raccoon, Victor appears again (with some kind of electric tool) and kills the dark haired porn girl, also manages to cut the guide in half with a shovel? Once Misty is left alone to take care of Ben, I felt it was pretty obvious that I was going to be the next to die (I was right but you can not see it). <br /> <br /> Filmmakers? The rain will NOT extinguish the burned gasoline, okay? Idiots Obviously, after 2 almost missing in the cemetery, Marcus was next to die and Ben got hurt in the foot with the tip, but they managed to find a boat after impaling Victor on the tip. <br /> <br /> She stopped at the Water for something that is not seen, is trying to save her and then, suddenly, gets into the boat next to Victor, screams and the movie ends abruptly. <br /> <br /> Yes, just like that. There is no idea if Ben was dead (he seemed to lack an arm) and he did not know if Marybeth was going to survive and what happened with Victor. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible ending and, no doubt, my verbal attack on the filmmakers got the last deleted revision. Both for free speech, huh?
