There is no Esperanto in this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie specifically because IMDb lists Esperanto as one of the languages ​​used. But IMDb is wrong about the languages ​​used in this movie. There is absolutely nothing Esperanto. It's almost all English with a couple of Navajo words. Do not watch this movie if you are looking for films in Esperanto. Other options instead are "Idiot's Delight" (with Clark Gable) that has a bit of Esperanto, "Incubus" is all Esperanto (although it's completely mispronounced), and there are some Esperanto posters in Charlie Chaplin, "The Great Dictator" . It was assumed that there was also some Esperanto spoken in "Gattaca", but I never heard anything. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the other critic is right. This movie is a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> Spend your time somewhere else.
