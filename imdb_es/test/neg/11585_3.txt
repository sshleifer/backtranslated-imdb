Another ridiculously boring and meaningless presentation of low budget science fiction television? But is it really fun? more or less?? in a passively undemanding way. Am I being gentle? I do not know why these titles occur to them. Yes, there is a komodo. And yes there is a cobra. However, what is the deal with 'versus' between? Of course they do come to blows ?? in only two sequences (one that recapitulates one incident and the other is the unreliable climax) and the rather boring exchanges that I might add. The uprising is the same routine of a scientific experiment that gets out of hand on an isolated island (without dinosaurs), and some innocent bystanders (environmentalists who hope to expose the evidence on animals) get trapped in it. This causes a dragon and a komodo cobra to become huge statues, and the government will soon want to destroy any kind of evidence (including witnesses) of its existence by flying the island. So this leaves the survivors running against time to find a way out. The prominent staples existed: the horrible CGI videogame, the pirated script, some dirty sets (although the configuration of the tropical island was easy for the eyes), the disposable characters (but I found the presentations to be boastful), incredibly sticky emotions (that for Some reason they kept using the same repetitive shot of the victim that stayed there, terrified, which implied that I'm waiting, please, eat me now, I'm not going anywhere and they were finally swallowed completely, almost as it always seemed A second swallow to kill them or just save the hassle by stupidly crushing them) and a very hysterical edge with some kind of miserable message among the acts of survival. Director Jim Wynorski seems to be in cruise control at all times. Michael Par√© has fun with his brusque dialogues and Michelle Borth added much needed sparks. Renee Talbert is there to pout, also quite successfully.
