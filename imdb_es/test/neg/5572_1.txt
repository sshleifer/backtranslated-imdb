Rented (free rent, thank God) this was filmed in CT where I live ... it could have been filmed in a tunnel for everything that matters! Dark ninety percent of the time, and just a terrible attempt at a low budget movie, which can be good if done well. In short, a group of young adults who witness the fall of a meteorite and, subsequently, are victims of extraterrestrials on the island of a lighthouse, assisted by the porter and his wife. Analysis: <br /> <br /> - acting = terrible <br /> <br /> - writing = uninspired <br /> <br /> - story = done a million times before with different configurations <br / > <br /> - production values ​​= ok (lighting) for budget <br /> <br /> - effects (creature, digital, others) HORRIBLE, LOOKING VERY CHEAP <br /> <br /> Then, you get the essence of that. To add insult to the injury, the final credits have filming errors, really now ... who cares! Distributed under a Universal company, surprised even they would do it after seeing them. <br /> <br /> Finally, as an alternative, try "CREEP". Low budget, but well written, well acted, and quite, well, creepy!
