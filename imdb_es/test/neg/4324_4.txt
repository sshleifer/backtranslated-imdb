Perhaps the weakest film of the series "Kharis", despite the presence of John Carradine (miscast as an Egyptian high priest) and George Zucco (as his predecessor, hilariously afflicted by a bad case of Parkinson's disease) that supports to Lon Chaney Jr. as the titular Creature - if he was under the bandages, since his contribution is negligible at best! I suppose they are about 60 minutes observable in themselves, but the standards have dropped considerably compared to the previous two entries, and the end result is strictly routine and not at all memorable. Almost the only interesting feature here is the fact that the female protagonist is the reincarnation of Princess Ananka, mentioned a lot in previous films, but never really seen.
