(It contains really bad Spoilers) So, what can I say about this ... it's a really HORRIBLE and INCREDIBLE movie! Too much CGI and special effects ... you can tell how fake the ridiculous baby is! PLEASE at least go see "Dungeons and Dragons", which is another terrible TRASH stack. Sound of the mask makes Dungeons and Dragons much better !! Uggg !!!!!!!!!!!! Pure Crap !!!!!!!!!!!! I hate this garbage !! I would also like to say that "Superbabies: BabyGeniuses 2" was also a really stupid movie. Probably as stupid as "Son of the Mask." "BabyGeniuses 2 was as fake as" Son of the Mask "and it also contains a lot ... Too much CGI !! <br /> <br /> Anyway, yes ... this was a BAD BAD BAD MUCH movie ... just please, avoid it ... I do not recommend it to anyone ... please, it's too ridiculous ... it does not make sense and it really is a bad argument ... The baby that was making fun of his father was just stupid!
