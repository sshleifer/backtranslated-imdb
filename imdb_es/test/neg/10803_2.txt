The plot of this film is dangerously thin and is the only "star power" if we can call it that consists of Joe Estevez. I do not know what is more shocking. The fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people really made good comments about it. If you ever see the cover of the video you will be able to read them. Someone even went so far as to say that the actress / writer could be the protagonist of the 90s. Yes! And Joe Est√©vez could have more money than his brother Martin. If you want to check it, I highly recommend seeing the MTS version. At least you'll laugh a lot without going crazy.
