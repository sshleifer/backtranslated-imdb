This film examines the now infamous Wannsee Conference, where leading Nazis gathered to discuss the organization and implementation of the "Final Solution". First of all, I want to say that I was surprised to see Kenneth Branagh play a Nazi. With blond hair combed back, it certainly looked good but it really did not work well. There was nothing of threat and cruelty and, in the end, he came out as a smiling animator, keeping the meeting going. The real Heydrich would not have let the conference get out of control like he did in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth, who played Dr. William Stuckart, the man who wrote in 1935. The laws of the Nuremberg race and gave "legal respectability" to everything what the Nazis did Firth's performance was impressive, the main vocal opponent of what Heydrich was proposing. Best of all, he was verbally dressing one of the Nazi thugs. The bully muttered "I'll remind you" and Firth responds: "You should, I'm very well known!" The film is historically accurate, but let's summarize it in what it really is: 90 minutes of a group of men around a table arguing, shouting and showing off. There is no emotion, no real conflicts (except the brief argument). It's only 90 minutes of talking! The same room, the same table, the same people. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the DVD is worth it. For my part, I felt short of changes.
