Who filled this stupid idea to act and produce a movie in Himesh's head, which is always hidden under a cap, covering almost half of his face all the time? I just hope this is the first and last thing too, for God's sake! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried everything, to create an aura of his so-called talent for singing, which is nothing more than an atrocious pronunciation of words like Tanhaiyya, which completely kills the beauty of the terms, so commonly used for the love. songs Why does not Himesh smile? Simple, because you do not use toothpaste Close Up! Now there is this friend of his, following him everywhere, and this number one lawyer in the city, who has for himself that moves and tries to seduce Himesh, of all the handsome Germans he could have met before, maybe the lawyers males In this part of the world you could be cursing your destiny, destined to deal with the rigid and unattractive lot, every day! The action scenes are shot in a very funny way, like the event planner attacked by the thief, the cars that circulate on the cars, and so on. The father of the bride seems to be in a great hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her, who flies from one place to another. Most hypocrites praise HR for distributing love among the people of the world, as if they were sweets, and on his back, he coldly lectures his daughter about these businessmen. when it is shown that Himesh is innocent, he again leaves the other man unceremoniously, as if it were a musical chair game! I could not even see the poor man's face, right? Hansika in the role of Ria, it seems that she needs an ocular revision, by tension in her eyes! The guy in the role of a friend is good, he has acted quite naturally and should be in better films, such as Sharman Joshi, for example. Child artist in the brief appearance of Trishu is sweet, but wasted. It seems that the young generation of today has gone crazy, since they prefer this kind of ridicule of letters and musical scores, and associate gossip with it, for example, if you sing ek bar aaja, the ghost would come. This is a strange taste in music, and quite funny. I'm surprised, how classic lyrics like Gulzar, have opted for Himesh of all people, to give music. There is a story in Panchtantra, that a crow adds so many peacock feathers, to look beautiful and attract birds; But the feathers fall off in the end, and the real dark crow is revealed! Hope Himesh gives a clue, and refrains from making things so meaningless, and wasting precious money, which she has earned by taxing her short nose! Your friend tells you that if your nose is cut, how will you sing? Thank you for showing us Germany, Himesh, at a reasonable cost to rent the DVD. and correct those spelling mistakes, will you? An extra e in the movie, and not in love! There is also a famous number from the old movie Sholey, Mehbooba, in which Mallika Sherawat wiggles, once again, but this time with Himesh, winking at her, and conveniently, Ria, her supposed true love, and her new girlfriend is not around! That was very smart, Himesh! At least one thing in this movie that you have done with intelligence, to justify the presence of Sherawat. But does not it look a bit sunken?
