He was very concerned about this film, he was scheduled to play at a Jewish Film Festival and was said to be very hostile to Israel, while using witty humor and irony. <br /> <br /> I was relieved that the movie was not a diatribe, however, as a film work was deeply disappointing. The movie was full of random events, some of which eventually connected, most of which did not. Some of the events were very smart and fun, but some were simply random and pointless. <br /> <br /> There are repeated scenes between two lovers where they sit in a car, without words, and play some game of grabbing. Maybe in some cultures this is erotic, but it's like watching the thumbs fight. After the third time, it became really boring. <br /> <br /> I have always found David Lynch as strangely strange, using strange stories and images to make the public think he is so sophisticated that they do not understand. his work; In fact, there is nothing to grasp. The same is true here, the stories do not add up to anything, and there are not many political points (in one scene, a boisterous Israeli soldier humiliates Palestinian drivers at a checkpoint.) Is that new?) <br /> <Br /> I do not understand why this movie has generated controversy, or why it has attracted attention. It is an inferior job and seeing it was a waste of time.
