What we know about Caravaggio suggests a fighter who strutted with a healthy sense of right who lived among whores, thieves and swindlers and put them on canvas. The themes of his works were sex, death, redemption, above all, finding the sacred within the profane. He lived at a time when homosexuality carries a death sentence and political intrigue usually involves deaths in a society defined by the maxim "strangle the child by the purity of his cry". <br /> <br /> You can not blame Derek Jarman for his cinematography, his recreations of Caravaggio's paintings and he certainly can not accuse the man of shunning homosexuality. But, frankly, Jarman never moves beyond the caricature of the 80s. Italian patronage becomes the London art scene of the 80s with pretty waiters and calculators. Sean Bean is a little sexy Northern Northern greasing his bike. Tilda Swinton performs a transformation worthy of Mills and Boons ("Wow, Miss Lena, without that gypsy handkerchief, you're beautiful ..."). Jarman gives Caravaggio a particularly trite motive for the murder that left him in exile. <br /> <br /> This could have been a visually stunning treatment of a man whose life was dangerous, exciting, violent and decadent, but who, however, elevated the Lives of ordinary people to the status of the Renaissance masterpieces , contemplated by the emperors and the kings. On the other hand, what you get is Pierre et Gilles do Italy. The pretty bodies of young children are shown perfectly, but never the men who inhabit them. Jarman seems to satirize the London art scene, showing it superficial and pretentious. Using Caravaggio and the Renaissance of Italy to make the point is to use a silk bag to make a pig's ear. To be fair, this movie is still visually stunning, but ultimately as two-dimensional as the paintings it depicts.
