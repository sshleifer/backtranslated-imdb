So ... this is what happens as art for artists like SXSW Film Festival and Sundance, huh? Well, I guess I can relate whenever the story, the script, the dialogue, the acting (except for Mrs. Aselton), the cinematography and the editing are completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I remember telling other filmmaker friends some years. The biggest problem with digital video was that now we would have to wade through a future sea of ​​shit to find something worth seeing now that anyone and his brother (or brothers in the case of the Duplass) could run out. and make a movie. "The swollen chair". Do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> This long-lasting video is yet another chapter in the dark and growing world of "dudeology" movies; young weapons armed with a DVX100A, a few thousand dollars, a superficial script and hasty writing, and some friends whom they call actors who decide an afternoon to make a movie and voilà! Do not get me wrong, I like independent cinema (that is, Hollywierd sucks). But having said that, you can not discuss some of the realities of that system. <br /> <br /> If the Duplass Brothers had to leave and have raised a real budget and attract real producers, it is clear that a script like this would never have been green! And therein lies the problem. There is no longer a selection process for the movies (sorry ... the videos) to be ready for production. Just take a DV / P2 camera and you're done! And what makes it worse is that high-profile festivals like the ones mentioned actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense. And because? Precisely because it is without budget. <br /> <br /> I think it is important, especially in the current climate of independent films, to stop allowing video creators to take the common language by labeling themselves as "filmmakers". There is a big difference in my book. When you have to leave and really put your script on the line, asking friends and family or business people for real money to make a "movie", knowing the possible losses at stake, then you will know what it means to be a "filmmaker." But leaving a few hundred in Sam's Club for some DV tapes, some soda and chips do not cut it. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and, by the way ... I have to mention how annoying it was to listen to a woman who is named "friend" throughout the whole movie. Even Mark Borchardt reserves that intensely abused nickname for his male friends only when he is at least captivating as far as his friend Mike is concerned. <br /> <br /> I think it's time for the indie film community to start calling these cranky, budget-free videos for what they are and, at the same time, scolding prestigious festivals for their informal efforts, great praise . Or, ask these festivals to at least have the courtesy of adding a new category to their festival alignments ... "Dude Films."
