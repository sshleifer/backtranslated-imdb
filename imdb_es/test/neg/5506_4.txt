I can not help thinking that this is the "spell" of Franco for "The Thousand Days of Sodom" by the Marquis de Sade. People (in this case women) kidnapped to serve as slaves to a privileged elite? Check. Curly sex? Check. Torture including whipping? Check. Victims chosen at random to be killed? Check. <br /> <br /> Thanks to God, Franco has not jumped at all and introduced to the film audiences the delights of coprology (and indeed coprophagy), another perversion that repeatedly arises in the tedious and disgusting saga of Sade <br /> <br /> I expected this movie to fall into the category "so bad is good". But even the acres of naked flesh and the many sexual encounters did not compensate for the grim dialogue, the gruesome performance, the elusive plot and, just to put on the tin hat, the dubbing and the English subtitles (missing a belt and suspenders) ) of women's suits). However, the Alsation had a very professional performance. <br /> <br /> Of course, I could be wrong about Sade's angle. After all, I did not realize that the actor who plays the director of the "prison" was a transsexual. I must pay more attention to the size of people's hands in the future. <br /> <br /> According to another critic, the film was banned in the United Kingdom. Well, clearly it is not anymore, although I think that the nipple puncture scene was cut to satisfy the censors. In the DVD that I saw, it was only clearly visible in the trailer in Spanish (which, in case you asked, I saw it to compare it with English). <br /> <br /> The DVD also presents an interview with Jess Franco, although you will need a better Spanish than mine to understand it. Unless you are very wrong, it is neither bent nor subtitled. And he points out that the person who sodomizes the character played by Franco is Ajita Wilson disguised with a mustache. Something ironic, since he had surgically removed the required appendix.
