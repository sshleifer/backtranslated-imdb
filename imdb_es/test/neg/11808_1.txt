The video frame of 'Joyride' says "starred by the second generation superstars", and one can not help feeling sad. Granted, Melanie Griffith has gone to bigger and better things ... but who cares about the rest of the cast? So, since it's a pathetic attention agent in the box, I was foolish enough to buy the movie for a dollar thinking it would be in the land of Eh, not so much. While so many youthful movies of the 70s (or simply films of the 70s) tried to say something profound and meaningful, "Joyride" does not even try. It is simply aimless. It is devoid of any interest. Each character is so ill-conceived that it is not surprising that these actors look so indifferent. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is about three hundred and twenty-something that go to Alaska to start a business, but instead, they are stolen and then you have to find work. They are beaten, they eat dog food, they steal cars, they rob banks. Everything is very typical, but also runs in the most mundane way possible. There are no surprises and the flow is so bad, and the actions of the characters are so ambiguous that you can miss several scenes and do not mind at all. <br /> <br /> But if you're a fan of Melanie Griffith's breasts - then this is a must. It is still not enough to get this above the lowest rating I can give. <br /> <br /> Best line: "Jesus, everything is biology with you". * outside ****
