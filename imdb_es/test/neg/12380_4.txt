Personally, I do not have any problem with the performance, nor with the script. I have a problem with the giant bird. It was just horrible. Plain and simple. <br /> <br /> The first impulse of one is to roll and laugh when one sees it. What were you thinking !? Damn the budget. The monster bird was a monstrous joke. <br /> <br /> Of course, in my opinion, if the producers could get actors like Ankrum, Corday and Morrow, then they would have the special effect that people come up with. beast. Oh good. What done is done. This will be the case of the eternal joke about them that was not intentional.
