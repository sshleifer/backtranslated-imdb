It is beyond me how this script was sold and produced and distributed much less. The dialogue was so bad that it was disgusting. The scenes of trains and helicopters seemed to have been made on flash cards by high school students. Lou Diamond Phillips must have hidden under his seat when this --- this "movie"? It was exhibited at a private screening after what he probably left by the back door. The only emotion that aroused in me was the compassion for the cast, they had to "bite the bullet" to go through it. I could not bear to see everything, it was so predictable that it was fun. Who knows, maybe it's picked up by one of the networks as a sitcom.
