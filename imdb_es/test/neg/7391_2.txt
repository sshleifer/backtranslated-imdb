This is possibly the worst movie I've seen. Can someone please explain to me the plot of this movie? Yes, I know that the bus ran out of gas in the middle of the desert, after the driver never noticed that his compass was not working, but what happened then? And how did it end? Maybe it's stupid to understand this movie, but for me it was an absolute waste of time. <br /> <br /> My recommendation? Do not bother, there are much better movies to be seen. This movie is in line with my other always low-low (When going overboard - Adam Sandler and Fire on the Amazon - Sandra Bullock)
