Oh, my God, I do not even know where to start commenting on this thing they called a movie. Seriously, I do not know what the hell David Bradley started smoking after doing Hard Justice, which in my opinion was a good movie after the American Ninja movies. I had not seen any of the latest movies of this type after Cyborg Cop. Luckily, I saw them on Amazon for around 5 pounds each and I can safely say the following: if I had thrown down the 5 pounds I spent on Total Reality, Crisis and Wait to die, I would have ended up happier than having to sit down through the 90 minutes that each of them lasted. My God, how can the HECK label someone this as "movies"? And why do the action / martial arts actors fall to their knees in the most odorous horse manure when they have reached their peak? I mean, David Bradley is not worthy of the Oscars, but his early films were quite entertaining. A hard and great guy with quite a good martial experience who offered cheesy lines but at least entertained fans of action and martial arts to a certain extent. But I'd really love to know what went through this guy's head after doing Hard Justice. His last 3 movies have to be frankly the worst I've had to see. As I mentioned before, I would love to get my money back on the 3 DVDs I bought. The crisis was the epitome of drowsiness, the Total Reality was harsh, but this Wait to Die is a complete nonsense. I bet the director was mega-stoned when he did this or he was just taking the pee out of all the David Bradley fans who sat through this pile of trash. The plot revolves around a doctor (Bradley) who develops some kind of Virtual Reality game in which he is killing different people one by one. I'm sorry, but I could not take this guy seriously playing with that elegant hairdo, glasses and gray pants without doing any physical combat (frankly, his best resource). The film is even worse than any of those B movies on Saturday afternoons because the acting is ridiculous, the direction is horrible and the few fights in the movie, well, what can I say ... It seems that the actors are training with your gym partner. We have a silly, stupid cop who starts showing his fighting stuff like an hour in the movie and fails heavily ... a furry French version of Van Damme who simply can not fight, act or speak to save his life and Bradley, the supposed protagonist, playing the evil doctor for whom he was very happy when he stopped making this type of fungible garbage. I even admit that he did not kick in this movie, probably due to his heart condition that was already affecting him. For a B-actor, I must admit that I really liked this guy, his style, his physique, his fighting skills ... But I'm very, very happy that he stopped acting after this monstrosity because, honestly, he could not have sit down through another ninety minutes of material to urinate like this. Avoid at all costs, even if you are David Bradley's family, you will be glad you did it, word.
