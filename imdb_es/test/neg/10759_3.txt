Although this series and the mini movie in particular were very important at the time of the release, I think the series as a whole was quite poorly written with a weak cast. The problems in the heart are very well represented, but it is difficult to relate them and understand the problems within the film when the performance and the script are not convincing enough (especially when watching the mini movie). <br /> <br /> I Also, do not think that this mini movie or series has passed the test of time, since now many of the scenes are pretty ridiculous. The problems are still crucial, but Boys From The Blackstuff can not fully help the cause of understanding the problems in Britain in the 1980s.
