This movie was terrible. I thought it would be fine, but it got worse and worse. From the initial scenes it seems to be heading towards another safe and predictable roman comedy, but the moment it arrives at the house, it simply disintegrates. None of the characters have depth and the only person who was credible was Tom, although the way he got distracted so easily only bothered me a little later. The dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film almost completely non-existent. In an insulting attempt at comedy, the writer / director introduces a new character or event in virtually every scene, none of which is realistic, which makes it very confusing to keep track of what is happening. The plot is just an excuse for a movie: the boy likes the girl, the house sits at the parents' house to meet the girl, destroys the house, gets the girl. A complete waste of time.
