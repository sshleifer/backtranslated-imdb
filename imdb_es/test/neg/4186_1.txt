My friends and I have often joked about movies in real time. But this movie really is ... Literally they will show 4 minutes of narrowing of nothing more than a guy digging in the dirt with his hands. It has no argument, and an incredible amount of free cries. Honestly, I do not think he has won a prize for his supposed suspense. If you're like me and you saw the first movie and you loved it because of its horrible, accidentally hilarious performance, and the low budget ness, it will not matter; This is so bad that bad memories can even be erased and smear good memories of the original. You would be more entertaining if you were looking at a blank screen.
