After watching the previews a while ago, I expected to see Steve Martin in a comedy that I thought could be an archer. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The problem was that the previews were the only fun parts of the movie. The rest of the movie was a lot of garbage, scenes that have been killed and characters that we've all seen a thousand times. <br /> <br /> This movie was a positive proof that if you put enough money on the table, you can convince anyone of anything. Steve Martin is one of my favorites, but this was a big pileup. The only actor in the film that was worth seeing was Eugene Levy; He was the best of a powerful and lame group.
