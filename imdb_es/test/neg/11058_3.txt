In another misleading marketing case, this movie is included in a set of 10 DVD movies called "Women Who Kick Butt," but even on its original cover it seems to promise Shannon Tweed in an action role. Actually, for most of the movie, Tweed plays the typical complaining female character that has to be rescued by the male protagonist, and even when trained in the jungle war, she still has to be dragged by it! There is a rebellious woman who is a stronger character, but most of them stay out of the movie. The male protagonist is Reb Brown, and he has some funny moments (without thinking, I think) (like when he is electrocuted). The action scenes are misdirected and badly performed: some of the specialists needed some lessons on "how to shoot and die convincingly". I guess if you're in the right frame of mind, you can find some things in "Firing Line" to laugh at (at one point, we can hear Tweed talking but his lips do not move), but mostly I got bored. (*)
