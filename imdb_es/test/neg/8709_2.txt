I had high hopes in this movie. I even lost the night of watching Stargate for this movie. I discovered that I had a rushed feeling and many of the key biblical moments and events were missing. I may be a little tired and ruined for the 1956 version, since I have seen it every year for the past 20 years. I doubt that this one reaches the realm of the classics of the year, like the other one. If you have not seen version 19546, you may like this one, but I seriously doubt it and I urge you to omit it and buy or buy the classic one. This has some ingenious special effects, but that's not what I'm looking for when I tell a movie like the Ten Commandments. I was like to see how they told the story, and the writers did not do a good job with it.
