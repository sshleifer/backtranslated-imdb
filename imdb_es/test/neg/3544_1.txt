While watching this movie, immediately observe the corny elements of a standard TV movie ... although through the image, the plot changes (if it is bold enough to say that this movie has a plot) is next to the book and not original ... and with each of them, the movie KEPT GETTING WORSE! <br /> <br /> Candace Cameron Bure, famous for her role as DJ Tanner in the hit TV show Full House, is not very convincing as a Possessing Twenty Something ... trying to avenge the possessors of death. I think she's a good actress ... but not in the suspense range. <br /> <br /> The shooting was of poor quality, and as I said, the plot faded ... although I saw it, I knew it was in automatic mode. cheese, I had no idea how much this movie could make worse ... <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie ... unless what you are looking for is what you are looking for is filmaking and deficient writing.
