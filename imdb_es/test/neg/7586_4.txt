Normally I would not waste my time criticizing a useless movie like this one. However, I'm out of work this week, so I have a lot of time to wallow in nonsense trivia. For starters, let me say that I often enjoy non-commercial, unconventional, non-American cinema. (Feel free to click on my user profile to see a supporting filmography). Having said that, there are many bad movies that are released in countries outside the US. UU Trust me, I've been tortured by hundreds of them. "Lost In Beijing" is a particularly bad movie. <br /> <br /> The half hour of opening is an impressive, non-stop exhibition of moral degeneration. This film provides some classic morals that belong to the same level as "Bad Guy" by Kim Ki-duk (2001). <br /> <br /> 1. women really enjoy being raped; 2. the violation must be glorified, praised and respected; 3. Feel free to rape any woman you like, because while you "make" her she will eventually like it and reach orgasm; 4. If your wife is raped, make sure to blackmail her rapist for a lot of money, but if he does not pay, simply hit his fucking wife as compensation; 5. If your wife is raped, be sure to ruin and degrade her the next day while playing the role of the rapist, mocking her with phrases like "Do you like this?"; 6. If your husband is a rapist, just accept it. 7. After you are personally raped, make friends with your rapist and spend time with him whenever possible. <br /> <br /> How can anyone in their right mind worry about any of these characters? They are just a group of degenerates who not only live their lives carelessly, but also delight in their lack of meaning and support each other. Although do not get me wrong. I am very capable of enjoying movies that represent lifestyles and morals that are contradictory to mine. "Ichi the Killer" (2001) and "Moonlight Whispers" (1999) are very interesting portraits of sadomasochism. "Strange Circus" (2005) is an extremely perverted game about child sexual abuse. "Marriage is a crazy thing" (2002) is a scathing accusation against traditional marriage. Even religious-based films like "Running On Karma" (2003) and "Samsara" (2001) have entertained me on occasion. The difference is that these movies really have an interesting psychological content and character development, while "Lost In Beijing" has practically none. <br /> <br /> It is known that on this planet there are people with an unorthodox mentality, but without some type of development of the character or psychology behind the acts themselves, you end up with a superficial exposure of despicable behavior. Why, exactly, Bing Bing finally befriends and cares about his rapist? Why does a rapist's wife accept his behavior unconditionally? The filmmakers never bothered to tell us. Even the obvious juxtaposition of rich and poor classes was ineptly conceived and ultimately served as a mere situation strategy. Everything feels too insipid and forgettable after the dirty half hour of opening. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers here seem to have confused moral ambiguity with complex characterization. The reason why you can not choose which person to encourage is because they did not develop correctly. Do not think that this movie has complex characters just because they are not clearly defined. On the contrary, the reason why they are not clearly defined is because we do not know anything about them or what they think. This is not a positive attribute of this movie. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the work and the performance of the camera are pretty good, but everything else becomes increasingly opaque as the film progresses. You can place this next to trash as "Turning Gate" (2002), "What Time Is It There" (2001), "Irreversible" (2002), and the aforementioned "Bad Guy".
