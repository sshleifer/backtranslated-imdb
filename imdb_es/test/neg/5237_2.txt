Christophe Lambert once said that he was still making movies just to make money easily and easily. When I see your latest releases, I can believe that. <br /> <br /> Beowulf is, in short, in the "good" part of the crap movies: there are some good scenes of emotion, in fact. The actors themselves are not so bad. But the plot is silly, the music of "Mortal Kombat" has nothing to do here, the ending is really s **** and ... <br /> <br /> Really, the only good thing about this is that I and my friends could laugh at how uninteresting it was. I would even like to spend my money on something else. <br /> <br />
