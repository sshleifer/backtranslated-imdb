Wong's address is perhaps the worst of all time in the history of cinema I've seen. This movie makes my worst 2000 movie of all time, Dungeons and Dragons by Courtney Soloman look like an Oscar winner. The flaws in this movie are beyond explanation. The biggest one is the lack of depth. Each scene does not develop completely as if the editing room did not know how to do its job correctly. It is a pity that with such a stellar cast of talents and a popular popular folk tale it can be destroyed by this lack of vision. <br /> <br /> I'm so upset and I hope some great director like John Woo or Ang Lee decides to remake this film and do some justice. I'm not even sure if I can score 0/10?
