It is important that you check your expectations when you see HATCHET. The * buzz that has been generated in this site far exceeds the real impact of the movie. What can help someone about to watch the movie is to realize that it is, is not supposed to be scary. It's pure camping and an attempt at fun. It's not - funny - just campy. Do not expect something like SHAUN DE LOS MUERTOS; not something like Friday 13 (Part II to infinity). <br /> <br /> HATCHET has acceptable actors. The cinematography is directly from ed wood. The effects of creatures and makeup are foolish, probably on purpose. Gore and blood is something between rosemary and dead alive. HATCHET is an intermediation film. It's between SHAUN OF THE DEAD and LESLIE VERNON. It's between campy and comedy (there's a difference). It is between ultra violent and violent comics. <br /> <br /> Instead of "capturing the essence of American Horror", or any other silly jargon that has been used to describe the film, try to capture something between the seminal. -American-- Terror as Friday the 13th and the new horror as SHAUN. Fortunately, he stays away from Torture Horror. <br /> <br /> In the end, HATCHET is between a bad movie and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> * I think it's happening more and more that the people involved in the movies, they go to sites like IMDb to evaluate and comment on the movies they're involved in. At a minimum, a campaign is being carried out so that the people associated with the associates leave comments and positive qualifications. There is no other reason why this film has come out in the high 7 with 600 votes and fall quickly after the general release. This movie is just better than the HorrorFest releases and should not be so bloated.
