Dear Mr. Dante, <br /> <br /> Friend, seriously ... the title of the program is "Masters of Horror". And anyway, it's supposed to be an opportunity to show off your horror skills, to show the world why you deserve to be called a "master" of the genre. Apparently you misinterpreted the exercise. Apparently, you thought it was your chance (or worse, your duty) to educate the American public about your political beliefs. And his attempt becomes disgusting, arrogant and, above all, the sermon. <br /> <br /> The only reason that ANYONE marked his short as high is because his political opinions coincide with his and are the kind of people who do not. I do not mind having that kind of policy stuck in my throat. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I do not care what you believe, they believe, or I think ... I just want messages so obvious (not subtle) and without grace (no satire) out of my horror. And while there were certainly other "Masters of Horror" that were big disappointments or in which I was generally confused, why would that director (William Malone?) Be considered a gender "master" ... yours fails much more than the rest for only losing the whole point of the series. <br /> <br /> So next time ... can you keep your preaching policy?
