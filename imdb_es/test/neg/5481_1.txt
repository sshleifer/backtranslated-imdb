This is undoubtedly the most annoying and frustrating game I have found. Each time you turn, the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you can not go through. The cut scenes leave you in control of your character's movements, but only a little. Also, you have to play the game for about 2 hours to pass the introduction / tutorials. It's terrible! I'm afraid if I play more this game I'll end up breaking something. This game sucks. The graphics are good, but nothing special, the game, however, is horrible. To say that I hate this game would be a great underestimation. I have it for sale, but I want to recover my $ 20. What a waste!
