I often wonder how movies like this can be made, and the most surprising thing is that people really pay to see them. <br /> <br /> With Aksar it seems that the director invented the story as he went along, adding twists and turns when he liked it, no matter how ridiculous they were. The script did not exist with inane dialogues like "Jo Sheena Roy pehenti hai, wahee fashion hota hai" and "Yeh Versace hai Madam" (yes on the right). <br /> <br /> Each of the characters was superficial and underdeveloped. Acting was horrible. Constumes (lycra for Udita and horrible costumes for a stocky Emran), locals (the many houses that were used for interiors do not even look vaguely like a Victorian mansion), scripts, etc., just one word: garbage. <br /> <br /> For those people who love Hashmi and his films, look. As for me, I will never recover those two and a half hours. The only redemption factor was part of the music that was decent.
