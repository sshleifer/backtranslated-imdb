I have read and enjoyed many of the Robicheaux mysteries of James Lee Burke. When I read "In the electric fog with the Confederate dead" was filming and Tommy Lee Jones was the protagonist, I was thrilled. After seeing him last night, I finished turning it off when there were about twenty minutes left, not wanting to see more people shot or beaten. Do not get me wrong, I do not care about blood and blood; I love 'The Untouchables' and 'The trilogy of the godfather'. Maybe it was just that before I had seen 'Birth' and 'What just happened' before seeing this. I know that Burke's books are violent, lyrical, and especially in the case of 'In The Electric Mist', they can be like the Cajun marshes he writes about, full of things that are never fully explained. In a book, that's fine. In a movie, that's confusing. Many of the previous critics are also ardent admirers of Dave Robicheaux, which makes it more understandable that they really liked the movie. Or they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both. Even as a fan of all actors (and especially Vince), I felt that it was a waste of his talents in general; They gave good performances in a movie that did not stay together. Now, I say this, only having seen the EE DVD. UU And waiting for Tavernier's cut to make a big difference. On the positive side: the soundtrack was wonderful. The scenes in Robicheaux's place were perfect, just as I imagined the bait shop would look. Mary Steenburgen was excellent as Bootsie, as was Walter Breaux as Batist. If you read the books, you know why Robicheaux is a person of moderate character at the beginning of the film and then starts hitting people with various instruments. In general, I wish they had filmed more of 'Electric Mist and the Confederate Dead' and would have left out a lot of Robicheaux's interrogation methods, explaining the gifts of Elrod and his link with Dave, as well as Dave's to the general . Then I would not feel today like I did last night when I turned it off, "What just happened?"
