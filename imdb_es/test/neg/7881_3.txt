Well, how to make a film as provocative as possible? This shocking joke is that two women of Paris of low life (a prostitute, a former actress of pornography and recently raped, attack a national group of men and killings of men in particular). <br /> <br /> The very short execution time gives you an indication of the experimental nature of this violently violent "Thelma & Louise", but it is done completely without irony or contemplation for any possible feminist message ... And now No, do not get too close to the protagonists, the violence actually feels numb and numb, and maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> As a liberal defender of freedom of expression, I always welcome when the "serious" film industry dares to contain scenes of sex. But the question is: Does it work for the movie as a whole? Do you have something good? Here, not very, although a new meaning is given to the phrase "a shot in the ass"! <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 from Ozjeppe
