Isaac Florentine has made some of the best western martial arts action films ever produced. In particular, US Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics. It can be said that Isaac has a true passion for the genre and that his films are always exciting, creative and sharp, with some of the best fight sequences that an action fan could hope for. In particular, he has found a muse with Scott Adkins, an actor and action actor as talented as one might expect. This is confirmed with the Special Forces and Undisputed 2, but unfortunately the Pastor simply does not live up to his abilities. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that JCVD ​​looks better here in the fight than in what it has done in the fight. Years, especially in the fight he has (for almost no reason) in a prison cell, and in the final confrontation with Scott, but look in his eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There is nothing in his eyes at all. It's as if he did not care about anything in the whole movie. And this is the protagonist. <br /> <br /> There are other dubious aspects of the film, both in terms of scripts and visuals, but the main problem is that you can not empathize with the hero of the movie. A real shame, since I know we all wanted this movie to be as special as it really could have been. There are some good bits, especially the action scenes themselves. This film had an excellent director and action choreographer, and an incredible opponent for JCVD ​​to face. This could have been the one that caused the veteran action star to come back to the surface of the action movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly, it was a pity that this has not happened.
