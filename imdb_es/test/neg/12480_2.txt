Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splash films, mostly undead films such as Zombie or The Beyond. Here he directed a kind of black comedy, but there's only one problem: it's nauseating. I say this knowing that I like City of the Living Dead (which is also disgusting but not like that). A compulsive gambler gets money for his habit by romanticizing ugly and deformed rich women and then murdering them and stealing their money. The movie makes this plan look so easy. I guess women were too ugly to go to a bank, so they always had their cash in person. After the fourteenth murder I began to suspect what I have always heard about Fulci: he hated women. He must have. In any case, this movie sucks, it's not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies. Avoid this movie at all costs.
