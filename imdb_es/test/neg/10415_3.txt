The only time I seem to crawl through the comments of IMDb is when I've seen a duff movie. I guess I'm looking to find the assurance that it's not just me. For me, then, Lonesome Jim was a duff movie with incredible characters in incredible situations that moved in a clear and boring way towards a crazy conclusion. So I check what other people have to say and I feel a bit like Jim, in a strange situation, alienated, because page after page of multiple stars and applause leave me doubting my critical faculties. However, maybe I should check the configuration of the presentation of the comments, because after a while, the flow goes off and I feel relieved to see the appreciations that reflect mine. I feel vindicated. It is a garbage film, it does NOT hang and it IS a wasted afternoon. Praise to the kindred spirits.
