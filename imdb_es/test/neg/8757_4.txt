Well, I did not know what to expect from 555. In fact, I had never heard of that until a few months ago. But, being a collector of almost all types of horror, I thought I'd go ahead and take this dark 80's slasher. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story has to do with a killer who kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. What the third 5 means in the title ... nobody knows. Anyway, the murders begin when the murderer looks for young teenagers who have fun in dark places. Decapita the men and brutally stabs the woman. After this, he proceeds to rape the corpse. The police think they have an advantage over the killings, but they really have no idea what is happening. How will they find the killer? Does anyone care? <br /> <br /> This movie is full of some of the worst actors I've seen in my life. No wonder that none of these actors have done anything else, literally. The three main actors are formed by two detectives and a "sexy" reporter. I'm being sarcastic when I say sexy, she's as un-sexy as she seems. The two detectives are like watching Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. One of them underestimates his part and the other may have gone to the Shatner School of Acting. The acting is so bad that it almost forces you to lose interest in the movie, so it almost puts you to sleep. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps this terrible movie together is a few bloody scenes. For a movie with this budget, manufacturers must have put all their money into special effects, which are not as good yet. <br /> <br /> Unless you're like me and you have to own every horror movie. There, I would suggest moving away from this movie. 4/10
