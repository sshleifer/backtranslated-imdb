This could be the worst film ever made, in a league with films like "Howard the Duck", "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and "Ishtar". I do not understand why I decided to watch this movie, as it was a waste of my life. I also do not understand why he would like this movie, regardless of his sense of humor. The performance is one of the worst I've seen, as is writing. The characters are all stupid, and there is not a funny scene in the whole movie. Tom Arnold is possibly the worst actor of all time, this movie proves it. There is nothing worthy of this movie. Do not rent it, do not look at it, do not even say it looks interesting. It's bad enough that I've seen it.
