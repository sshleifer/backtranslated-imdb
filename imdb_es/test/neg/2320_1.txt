For some reason, my father-in-law gave me a copy of this tape. I think because my great-uncle, Buddy Baer, ​​was the giant in this movie and my father-in-law thought I'd like to see him. I had it, years before as a child, and I did not like it then either. <br /> <br /> My son, then two, saw it and got hooked. Every waking moment in front of the television, this horrible video is played. I went to work with the songs inane stuck in my head. The two "clues" were worse than a revision of the secondary stage. The dancers seemed rejected from a horror film by Ed Wood and Abbot and Costello telephoned their parts. Fortunately, I was able to distract my son long enough to lose this videotape. Frankly, I think it was the "The Ring" movie. <br /> <br /> To correct another critic, Buddy Baer is Jethro's UNCLE (Max Baer, ​​Jr) not his father. 0 out of 10
