The representation of Wakayama Tomisaburo of the fugitive ex-Kaishakunin Ogami Itto felt completely natural. His attitude, his voice, his appearance, all spoke to discouragement. When he entered a space, I, along with the characters on the screen, felt that he did not belong there and that his determination to be there caused spelling problems. The training of Kendo (Japanese fencing) and that would explain his comfort with the katana, which was shown magnificently in each festival. If you watch the movies, from the moment you draw until the moment you wrap the sword, you feel that you are witnessing something that is inevitably ugly. He even turned the katana quickly to remove the blood before wrapping it and it would happen in an instant without effort. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of Nakamura Kinnosuke appears as an interpretation. It feels like you're trying too hard to be someone else or to tell another person's story. As a result, every time he tried to compromise I lost control because he himself did not seem to have firm control over the paper. As if it was uncomfortable for him. <br /> <br /> The fencing in the television series was also Hollyweird of the old school. The camera cuts to disguise the discomfort of Mr. Nakamura with the katana, slow action, quiet targets, etc. Extremely bad, from the viewer's perspective. There was a moment in the episode The Castle Wall Attack in which Mr. Nakamura drew his sword like a child. It was embarrassing. He handled it like it was heavy! I nearly fell off my chair. <br /> <br /> And let's be frank: the story is about an excellent swordsman. Period. Fencing is a problem. <br /> <br /> However, realism is not: the game of swords in the movies was excellent and similar to a manga, as planned, I'm sure. (Was the baby cart equipped with a group of fast-fire automatic muskets operated by a 3-year-old boy? Yes ... manga-style). Captivating films (Read Musashi by Yoshikawa Eiji [% historical legend]%!) I really could not watch the episodes of the television series. They just felt cheap. Watch the movies first and you'll know what I'm talking about.
