I work in the video store that rents this video in Lexington and I must say that it should never have been done. I even know some of the people who worked on it and regret doing it. Bad effects, horrible acting, bad writing especially. I swear the dialogue would not have gone through the original PSX Resident Evil; It's so bad If you want to know how not to make a movie, watch this movie to learn a thing or two. If not, do not waste your time. And even the director knows what stinks because he keeps coming to try to sell the movie. No sir. I have seen two thirds of the terror section and this is even lower than Outer Space Plan 9. Even Ed Eood would have said: "No, that's too stupid even for me."
