This movie was rented for free, I had no misconception that it was a very bad movie. I rented it for Thanksgiving because we eat turkey and then the family watches a horrible movie. So, what makes this movie so bad that you only give it 2 stars? Dialogue. The lack of dialogue makes this a perfect movie for a deaf audience. In fact, if you rent this, simply lower the volume to zero and place any heavy metal CD of your favorite artist. I know you will enjoy it better. The plot of this festive turkey was so saturated with technology and geek that it needs a translator for the narrative. Now, for all of you, who enjoy good science fiction effects ... uh, they are not much better than video game trailers or court scenes in worse cases. The actors, both, do not have much to do either. They do not say much throughout the whole movie. Many of the technical aspects will make you laugh like the scene in which the hero is attached to a missile and shoots him into the city 70 km away (he never showed how he landed). The scene before that we see that a robotic sentinel shoots him with a cannon from 12 feet away and he misses several shots. We are also told that the political division between the antagonist and the protagonist is biotechnology (genetically enhanced humans) versus cybertechnology (humans improved with machines), but both appear to be cyborgs or improved humans. What told me that this was a bad movie in the rental store was the cover that looked like a video game cover and there was only one copy, good new publications have many copies available.
