There were so many classic films that were made where the featured characters were liars and yet they are made to look good. I have never bought into those things. The "inflated comedies" were full of things like many of Fred Astaire's movies. <br /> <br /> Here, Barbara Stanwyck plays a famous country magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years. , and feels that he has to keep lying to keep his person (and his job). He even lies to a man about his marriage, another subject that was always trivialized in classic movies. <br /> <br /> She is a New York City woman who pretends to be a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies, etc. Obviously, she does not know anything and the lies accumulate so fast that you lose track. I guess all that is supposed to be fun because the lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails, etc. Please, pass the bag to vomit. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie is NOT fun. Stanwyck was much better in the black film genre. As for Dennis Morgan, well, pass the bag again.
