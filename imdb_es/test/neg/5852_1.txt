I do not know if I'm wrong or if everyone else says that this movie is good, honestly I just want to do a favor to people who have doubts about seeing it, renting it or, worse yet, buying it (do not buy). Do it really!). <br /> <br /> Very early breakthroughs and previews may seem funny in one way or another, but it's not funny at all, it can fall into a series of what you owe - laughs - here scenes that tend to be jokes really bad, bad performance very bad, insipid scenes, cheesy effects; This movie has everything, everything is wrong. <br /> <br /> As a final comment, the film would have been fun due to the basic concept, but believe me it is very far from that.
