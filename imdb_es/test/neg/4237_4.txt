The premise of the film had much in its favor, however, despite the novelty of the models that sell the furniture of another person to live the good life, this movie has nothing in its favor. The characters are cardboard. The dialogue is written with a lot of pain, it is difficult to sit down and if there was any joke in the movie, I missed them. Marilyn Monroe is walking towards the walls because she does not want to wear glasses is completely amazing and is not funny. The stupidity of Grable is also too hard to believe. Bacall's gold dig is so forced that it bothers to listen to it. Why anyone would want to sit through this is beyond me.
