I like many films by Myrna Loy. This film was produced before the personality of its character actor was developed. It would be a good short film, but it seems to last forever in its full form. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy seems to be told what to do with her acting and does the work. That is all you can say about her. <br /> <br /> His gypsy character is of poor quality and the movie has many flaws, like the jewelry scene. <br /> <br /> This movie will probably be interesting for fans of Myrna Loy, but even as such it is somewhat disappointing.
