This was a decent movie for the first half. Too many cheap BOO! Moments but the tension increases, the bad ones are scary and everything seems to be setting up very well. Children are not particularly deep, but hey, that works for teenagers. <br /> <br /> Then, he becomes ridiculous and tries too hard: the "why the hell would he do that?" the moments exceed the capacity to suspend disbelief, the turn implies too many ridiculous coincidences and the title comes from a late attempt to philosophize some meaning in the film that is not going anywhere and is dropped quickly. There were laughs in the theater at times that should not be fun at all. <br /> <br /> Great premise but poorly written and not held together. Some pretty shots, but they're hard to enjoy while you're rolling your eyes.
