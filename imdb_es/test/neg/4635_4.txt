No bad performances. Whoopi plays the wise / warm role quite well. Even so, the plot and the situations can not be believed (forced stereotypes of PC). Sometimes they are good Jews and blacks against the evil white Christians (ho-hum). A typical Hollywood fantasy. The movie has its moments, but it is not one that I would recommend going out of your way to see.
