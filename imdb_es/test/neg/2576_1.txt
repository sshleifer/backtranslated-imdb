[POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT] <br /> <br /> It is unlikely that Seagal will again climb the heights of lousiness he did with * On Deadly Ground * (mainly because no one is going to let him re-direct him), but I'm sure try, is not it? <br /> <br /> This is a typically poorly designed and poorly written fantasy about how Indian folk remedies are much more effective than western medicine. Seagal seems to really believe this nonsense, though he never explains why life expectancy in the Americas and Europe is much higher than in 1492. <br /> <br /> Kind of like he never explains how his supposed "water power" the engines "work in * in deadly terrain *. <br /> <br /> Even the "action" in this stinks.
