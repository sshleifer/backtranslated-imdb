First, let me start by saying that I am a fan of Laurel and Hardy. I have read every printed book about them and have seen all the movies available more than once. I even took a chance once and called Stan over the phone. He was very kind and talked to me for more than ten minutes. I continued with a letter, and he wrote me a letter back. I still have that letter. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good comedy moments, but Stan and Ollie are not in their usual way. Stan was seriously ill during production and looked worse than ten years later. In my opinion, it's worth watching any Laurel and Hardy movie. <br /> <br /> But the definitive opinion of this film comes from the great Stan Laurel. To quote him, "This movie should never have been made."
