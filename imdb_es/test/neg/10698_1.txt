Norris plays a Chicago cop who trips with a devil's apprentice? Whoever wants to, well, create Armegeddon. Finally kill the creature, get this, throwing a 24-inch solid, not very sharp, gold beak about twenty feet strong enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? This is the rest of the movie. Much of it consists of CN and his partner driving cars and talking nonsense. The Israeli (or Arab) child is apparently there to humanize the CN. IN AGREEMENT. It does not work, it does not make sense, and the plot advances, called, not a bit. In addition, no police are invited to leave the country to be interviewed by other police officers. It's ridiculous as a premise. Everything is bad. Unfortunately, it's not bad enough to be entertainingly bad or campy. Just bad But, one can see how Norris was trying to find his way to the hit series Walker: Texas Ranger.
