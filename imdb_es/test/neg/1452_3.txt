It seems I remember a lot of enthusiasm about this movie when it came out, but I had avoided seeing it over the years. I wish I had waited longer. Maybe this movie was fun in 1988, I do not know. I was younger then, but it did not seem like the world was so different. Michelle Pfeiffer, as beautiful as she is, is never convincing. Mercedes Ruehl not only chews the landscape, but it is put in the cheeks like a gerbil to save it for later. Dean Stockwell is as convincing as a mafia boss, since James Gandolfini would be the main dancer of the Bolshoi. And Matthew Modine demonstrated the most pronounced case of late puberty I've seen. All in all, it's not bad enough to make you take your eyes off with a melon-baller, but it's not far away.
