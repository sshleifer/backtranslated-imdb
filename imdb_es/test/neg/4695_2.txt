This movie, which is a.k.a. "Life In The Fast Lane" is easily one of the less entertaining films I've seen in a long time. I think it was thinking of sick women, twisted and tired representing about .00000001 of the population in the United States. The characters are all one-dimensional, even the leader. After stabbing her boyfriend in the head with scissors, trying to laugh (and unsuccessful) sticking a cork in the skull groom to stop bleeding. Oh, ready! Patrick Dempsey (whose films are almost always a class act - sarcasm) interprets this "demon" who changes his life, but to start, his life was this series of vignettes. Without emotion, without laughter, without history. The only reason I give it a 2 to this is that Jeffrey Jones is fine as a priest and there is a bit of style (substance albiet zero) in the camera work. Otherwise, one of the 5 worst movies I've seen. Grade 2 of 10 AN F! I think the most addictive addict who would laugh when a toilet fell would dislike this movie. I can not emphasize enough that you should stay away. <br /> <br />
