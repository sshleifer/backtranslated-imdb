It's boring. <br /> <br /> It's slow. <br /> <br /> Where are the nasty and brutal murders? Where is the tension that is supposed to scare us? This is like watching Sesame Street without the funny characters of Ernie and Bert or Grover. <br /> <br /> It's really silly. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the writing ... maybe the direction ... Maybe the acting, the editing, the cinematography, the special effects, the composition. <br /> <br /> Maybe all of the above has taken this to something that can barely keep your eyes focused. <br /> <br /> I wanted to scare ... not bore me. <br /> <br /> This did not scare me ... it did not even interest me ... I had more fun watching the time in the microwave instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not bother buying it ... and if you see it on television by chance, it is not necessary for the children to sleep.
