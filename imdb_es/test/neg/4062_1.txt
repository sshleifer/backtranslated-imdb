The plane is a 747 jumbo. The cockpit is located on the upper deck in a 747. In the film, the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st class cabin to reach the cabin. They walk in front of the 1st class cabin and cross the doors of the cockpit. What a gaff! The front of the first class cabin has a wardrobe for jackets and a television screen. Beyond that is the radar dome. Before take-off, a 747 is shown to start the taxi to the runway. In the takeoff it is shown that the aircraft has only two engines. Areal 747 has four engines. Who was in charge of continuity in this movie? During the first part of the flight, the front part of the plane suddenly includes toilets, another improvised farce! After that, the front part of the plane becomes the back part and vice versa. At this point I stopped looking. Absolute garbage!
