This is quite possible the worst movie ever made. I know people talk about how horrible Ed Wood's films were (Plan 9), but this movie makes Plan 9 look amazing. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris makes a cameo, so I have no idea. Maybe ruin his film career. Apart from Chuck Norris, the cast of the film consists of extras in the daytime soap operas and Mike Norris ... that's right, Chuck's son. <br /> <br /> This director does not even have a resume and I have no idea where Parcela or script originated. This must have been enlightened by a horrible southern Baptist minister who, somehow, had a third cousin who owned a studio (which I'm sure has since been closed). <br /> <br /> I really do not know. What else to say about this movie? I'd like to give you a summary of the plot, but I'm lost. There is something about Jesus and Satan ... some eternal battle. Apart from that there are Indians. And a group of strange children who do not know how to act ... are clumsy and should not be on camera. I do not know what happened most of the time, but I know that the movie was a great laugh. Mike Norris pushes his daughter (on his bike) to the street in some way ... but in the shot he is in the middle of the park. So somehow he learns to ride a bicycle with a speed equivalent to The Flash and is hit by a car or a bus ... I do not know. But she is dead. This is actually the funniest scene in the movie. I know it sounds bad, but once you see Mike, raise your hands in victory and then hold his head and scream in terror ... you'll understand. It does not show that the daughter is hit or something ... you just have to assume that she was hit by some vehicle. But, the movie is not clear. So maybe he had no relationship and she died of cancer. Anyway ... after that, the movie becomes really confusing and I have no idea what really happens. I'm a Christian and I have no idea why this movie was made. I do not see any value for this film in a religious or non-religious sector. This is probably the first thing that students are shown in Film-making 101 ... this is what you DO NOT want to do. <br /> <br /> Just look at it ... you will hate it and me for suggesting that you see it
