Lance Henriksen has the ability to be the most important name in a B movie, even in this case starring Charles Napier, Master Control Program and Joe Don Baker. As always, he does a great job being the bad guy, but the plot is bad (I do not even mean the end). And the edition is so horrible that it could really be a thing of beauty. Is it me, or does it seem that Joe Don Baker joined the movie at the last minute? Also, when the glass is broken in this film, the editing is very antiphenomic. Finally, after seeing this, I imagine that David Warner is dying for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Felony, this will be the third film that awarded the 1/10 rating, join Iron Eagle IV and without mercy.
