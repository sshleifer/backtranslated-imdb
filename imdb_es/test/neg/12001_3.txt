Of all the children's movies I've seen over the years, this was probably the worst. I took four children from 7 to 11 years old and none of them liked it. <br /> <br /> The script seemed to be based on a story like Willy Wonka, but it just did not have anything. <Br /> <br /> If you are considering watching this movie, do not waste your time, it's bad. <br /> <br /> They are doing a sequel, so it may be worth watching to see if they can get worse. Movie, but I do not think it's possible.
