Ohhhh MAN, this movie is horrible! <br /> <br /> This type of guts is what gives Canadian cinema a bad name, or no name. Well, to be fair, I think most Canadian films give a bad name to Canadian cinema. <br /> <br /> Along with the characters (there is a couple that is the most important in the history of cinema), the most annoying thing is the editing and rhythm of the film. It's like a drunken snail that makes its way to death. <br /> <br /> Thank God, it's good to look at Melanie Doane. She is the only thing that kept me looking. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie continued to break up. <br /> <br /> Although it's good for laughter, if you're having a bad night of Canadian movies. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Melanie? Doane The only good point (it's a shame they did not have the sense to keep the camera on her for more than one blink at a time). <br /> <br /> Another addition in the Canadian Hall of Stinking Movies.
