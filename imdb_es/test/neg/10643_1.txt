Some type of recognition must be granted to 'Hellraiser: Bloodline'. Actually it is outside the full moon of a full moon. Carry all the marks of, say, your series of `Demonic Toys 'or` Puppet Master', without your dopey, uh, charm? The full moon can get away with a silly product because they know it is silly. These Hellraiser things, man, are you ever taken seriously? This increasingly stupid franchise (though not as stupid as the one I've seen for her) once compensated for her low budgets by being elegant. Now it's just ish.
