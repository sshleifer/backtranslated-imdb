This was just a horrible movie. I saw it once when I was about 12 years old, now I'm 19 and I think I'll never forget this movie. <br /> <br /> I still feel bad every time I think about it, it was just Everything horrible that could fit into a movie. I really do not understand what kind of person would enjoy this absolute crap. It is not enough to simply disconnect your mind to enjoy this movie, I can enjoy the dumbest Disney movies for television as much as the next person, but this is something completely different. <br /> <br /> Usually, I do not like to judge a movie until I see it, but believe me, I'm doing you a favor. Do not watch this movie.
