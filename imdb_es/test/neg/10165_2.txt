When I watch this movie today, I have the feeling that it was about 10 to 15 minutes away from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides in this trading post / lounge in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies. All he sees are the signs of a massacre, some corpses, signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. This is because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind found in the ancient mysteries of the English murders. <br /> <br /> The reason why you find those rooms hidden in these kinds of stories is that they were formerly goldsmiths. Catholic families who cling to the old faith in the sixteenth century in England built these things to hide those who flee from the royal authorities because of their faith. It's not something you see in westerns, but it's a good trick. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, due to a bad editing or writing, or both we never know exactly what took Wayne to this place exactly. But this was a B western and not even a good one at that. <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes is in this and is clean-shaven and quietly playing a part of the time. An unusual circumstance for the Gabby garrulous. <br /> <br /> If you want to get upset and find out what happens and see a Gabby Hayes without a mustache, watch this movie.
