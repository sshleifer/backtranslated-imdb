The perfect 6-step recipe for a boring half of the road movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Take a devious and burned former policeman with a bad attitude, but also with a sensitive touch (concert pianist with a cat); <br /> <br /> 2. Add some "cool" retro gadgets like a ramshackle Porsche 356, a roaring bicycle, a heavily patched leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles; <br /> <br /> 3. Mix in a couple of "free spirit" locations, for example, a modern apartment by the sea and an exclusive office space; <br /> <br /> 4. Condim√©ntelo with "deep" socio-romantic themes, such as a post-divorce-traumatized-but-finally-remarried ex-wife, a secretly admiring waitress and therefore Forgiving, a couple of ex-colleague-cops-just-one-of-who-is-really-a-complete-idiot and a best friend-who gets chilled-on-a-suitcase-full-of-illegal - $$ $; <br /> <br /> 5. Let it simmer for about 90 minutes in an "accelerated" sequence, though not necessarily logical or internally coherent, of mediocre action scenes, cheap tender moments and slow wise cracks; <br /> <br /> 6. Serve with a comfortable pillow to sleep directly or something a little more interesting (do not worry: even the yellow pages will do it!).
