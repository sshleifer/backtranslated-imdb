This movie is crap, I can not say it any other way. From the beginning you know it's going to be crap. <br /> <br /> The story, the dialogue, the acting, the special effects, the makeup, almost EVERYTHING stinks. I like vampire movies and I know that they will never be Oscar-winning movies, but this is not worth seeing, I can not believe how someone produced this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality experience. The development of the film is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is ... It does not exist, everything seems a great joke. Maybe that's what they tried to do, but I sincerely doubt it. I wish I knew what they tried to throw, but it was just counterproductive, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've seen in my life (and I've seen many bad movies, but nothing compared to this). please and do not look at this. <br /> <br /> P.S. It is also full of clich√©s! PD 2 Bad script, bad direction, bad cinematography. PD 3 I bothered to comment on this as a favor for everyone.
