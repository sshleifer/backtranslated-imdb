I had high hopes in this movie. After all, Ocean's 11 was a really great Hollywood product. His quick jokes, his incredible star power and his tight script made it one of the funniest caper movies I've ever seen. Of course, with all the money he earned, a sequel was on the way, and I, for one, was excited. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that this movie left me absolutely impressed. Surprised by how horribly bad things can go. This movie had everything in its favor; the return of the entire original cast, the same director, news stories of crazy antics on the scene. How could it have gone so wrong? <br /> <br /> It starts immediately with one of the most uncomfortable and unnecessary opening sequences and goes downhill from there. After reasonably ridiculous short scenes between Pitt / Zeta-Jones and Clooney / Roberts, the film spends several minutes watching Andy Garcia go from scene to scene, telling each individual member of the original Danny Ocean eleven that he wants his back to be restored. money. Believe me when I say that these scenes are only here to cover Andy Garcia's execution time, because without these ridiculously uncomfortable shots, your screen time would be OK in less than five minutes. <br /> <br /> This brings me to another big dispute. I had this movie. The rhythm is so unequal that the characters are completely removed from the story, and only sometimes they are brought back later. The character of Bernie Mac is removed from the script from the beginning and never returns, except in 2 short scenes without dialogue. Garcia appears during the first few minutes and returns for an exceptionally short scene at the end. Roberts appears for about 5 minutes at the beginning, and is not even mentioned again until about 20-25 minutes remain. Even Clooney himself spends a large part of the film in prison. <br /> <br /> All this would be excusable if the movie were fun. Absolutely. 90% of the jokes are completely flat and those that work are worth it at best. The "plot" is undeniably useless, and it left me feeling cheated. At one point in the film, the team takes a job worth $ 2.5 million out of the nearly $ 100 million they need to raise before Garcia's two-week deadline. Several characters even recognize how absurd it is to waste time to do this work, but they do it anyway! More than 30 minutes of the movie revolve around this work that they should not even be doing, and one has the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to complete the runtime. In addition, the equipment they use to carry out this work CLEARLY costs millions and millions of dollars to finance. Just wait until you see what they do to get this job and understand that it would cost more than $ 2.5 million. Obviously, because of this, they have to do several jobs to earn the money. The beauty of the first movie was the only big scam and how ingeniously and intricately it was achieved. Here, they take out so many jobs, in so many different ways, that they rush through all of them because they explain that they would make the film last several hours. <br /> <br /> We all know we're going into this movie there's a big turn at the end. This is the nature of the caper movie. The turn at the end of Ocean's Twelve made me laugh; Not because it was fun, but because I could not believe how deceived I felt. I will not reveal it, because I know that most of you will be foolish enough to throw away the money to see this movie anyway. <br /> <br /> What I am going to say is that it does most of the 2 hours. You already sat completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I was excited to see this movie, after absolutely loving Ocean's 11. I left the theater with the feeling of having been the victim of a big scam by the cast and the crew of this movie tricked me into believing me that it would really be worth watching this movie. I have never given a 1 to a movie on IMDb.com, but there is a first time for everything. They consider themselves warned .... 1/10
