This glorified discovery channel documentary, partly biblical study, part treasure hunt, all embezzled, could have sat well in its television origins, but it falls like a feature film. From the first glance of its corny-looking cover, doubts can be raised about the integrity behind this serious issue, which is shown in the previous case, relegating the search for Jesus' tomb to a generic source of action that looks more like to the National Treasury or Tomb Raider than to any informed debate. and the examination of the historical burial site must. Such is the unclear way in which the procedures revolve. <br /> <br /> More curious child than a worthy researcher, Simcha Jacobovici's explorations are self-indulgent, while his research is manipulative. Despite all the fascinating revelations that this filmmaker tries to convey to his viewers through supposed evidence, an avalanche of repetitive statements that reiterate the same investigation and the results again and again show that The Tomb of Jesus Lost has very little information for Endorse bulky, though fascinating, claims. What amounts to this is a very frustrating attempt to beat the audience in the head with the same objective evidence that supports the authenticity of this tomb, which ironically subtracts. While untiringly linking to many of these mini-coffins that are found together to support the Jesus of Nazareth theory, this research abandons a holistic approach to continually pursue the unique obsession of this romantic archaeologist. There may be some impressive factual data that helps shed some light on many traditional Christian dogmatic beliefs, but essentially the somber nature of this project made it look like just a piece of exploitation, funded at a time when the Da Vinci Code was all the rage. <br /> <br /> In the end, the corny cover was right. Despite my appreciation for the documentary form, The Lost Tomb of Jesus takes an always interesting theme and turns it into a geriatric adventure hunt that is too broad and unchanged, substituting any relevance and sanctity for the uninspired motivations behind this team. By the time these assailants have finished their explorations and, reluctantly, they have to stop investigating due to social demands, viewers have the feeling that the director insisted on forging this mystery, whether to start or not. There are some genuinely powerful moments in which the corridors of history go through this documentary in simple ways, but all the decoding, exploration and theorizing in the world still leaves this piece of wrong vanity in an uncomfortable void of apathetic response.
