First of all, I hate those moronic rappers, who could not act if they had a weapon pressed against their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other off and act like a clich√© version of gangsters. <br /> <br /> The movie does not take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we are in the store. There is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless man, who is also the only with half a brain. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both on the hill and the character of Sadler is both a villain and the mobsters. I did not like it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The film is full of senseless violence and the specialty of Walter Hills: people who fall through windows with glass flying everywhere. There is virtually no plot and it is a big problem when you are not looking for anyone. Everyone dies, except Paxton and the homeless, and everyone gets what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only blacks that can act are the homeless and the drug addict, but they are professional actors, not annoying. ugly brain dead rappers. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this shit and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead. At least they have characters that matter to you, sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast.
