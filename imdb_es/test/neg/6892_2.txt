I have to admit that of the many thrillers I've seen, this has to be one of the worst. I was surprised to discover that this work had a budget of 1.5 million. When it started, I thought the opening sequence was pretty good, pretty standard for this kind of movie, but pretty good anyway. But as the movie progressed, I began to feel distinctly uncomfortable with the lack of rhythm I was seeing, each sequence seemed to take hours. The reason for this could have been that by now the film had bored me to tears, nothing happened other than endless accusations punctuated by confusing flashbacks and the occasional attack of bad mood. Well ... after going through what seemed like a life of these scenes, we finally reached the grand finale ... all a song, a whole dance demonstration of how the lack of imagination can completely ruin what could have been a good movie. <Br /> <br /> In general, I found this film predictable and tedious, and I would not recommend this film to anyone other than those who personally dislike me, but if you have a couple of hours to lose and want to see a thriller that It's not even remotely scary, this is the movie for you.
