Do not get me wrong, the guy is a successful dynamo, but he reached the top selling expensive plastic toys to impulsive brats. So I get a little angry when he sees comic book fans as an extension of that same market. <br /> <br /> See, "The invincible iron man" would not be bad if it were a Saturday morning. and aimed exclusively at children who are not very interested. But it is not aimed exclusively at children. The peripheral characters are killed every five minutes and there are enough bodies of bloodshed and half-naked to make the censors of the network twist, so it is not completely cut for children's television. so? It is the audience that enjoys intelligible narrative lines about how to revive a tyrannical Chinese emperor with 5 arcane rings, that's who. And I think the audience is restrictively small. <br /> <br /> Many great writers have gone through the burly Marvel yoni for decades. So it's a shame that Marvel risks his expensive investments in animation with so many questionable writers and scribes who, like Mr. Arad, are more accustomed to selling action figures during the Saturday morning cartoons. How many warm receptions does Marvel have to endure before finding a better strategy? <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> Animation: only passable cels, some segments are better than others, a low budget is seen everywhere, this is not Bakshi (Ralph) and! It's not Bluth (Don)! The CG animation is fine, but far from impressive. <br /> <br /> History: a litany of clich√©s, everywhere, complicated, contrived and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Characters: why is Rhodes? Even here if all he does is increase Stark's sexual ambiguity? Hmmm ... your dad is in a wheelchair ... Tony misses his mother ... The Asian girls are good and, apparently, little else; The female guide is completely objectified by the end of the function. <br /> <br /> Performances: You can not blame the competent voice actors for a bad script. <br /> <br /> Art: very western musculature, very clean lines. The faces are very derived from the oriental art, you kill very boring, CG very anodyne. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: not very good, but it's worth it for fans and those who enjoy superhero myths. A 'must-buy' for collectors. A valuable course of "what not to do" for young animators.
