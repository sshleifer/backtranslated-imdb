A dark horror show filmed in the Everglades. Two couples spend the night in a cabin after feeling a little uncomfortable because of the hostility of the locals. Who or what are the blood stalkers? After a while they find out. Look at the character of the town idiot who paints like a chicken, it's certainly weird.
