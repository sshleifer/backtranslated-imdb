Cage plays a drunk and is praised critically. Elizabeth Shue, in fact, has to make a love seen with the most unattractive and overrated dung meat steak in Hollywood. I literally vomited while watching this movie. Of course I had the flu, but that does not mean that this film did not contribute to vomiting in the kamode. <br /> <br /> Why can not Nick Cage interpret something he can really achieve as a bad actor? Nick Cage, who will be brilliant in a bad actor role. Fuck, nobody could do better. <br /> <br /> The search begins with Nick's contract with Lucifer or was Lou Cipher's "Night Train to Terror".
