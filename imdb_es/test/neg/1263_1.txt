I wanted to like this movie, but there is very little that I like about it. It begins with Jean Stapleton and a song by Randy Newman in Iowa (Northwest Iowa, I suppose), reminiscent of Cold Turkey by Norman Lear, which was one of the best films ever made, according to people at IMDb. So far so good. And the idea of ​​the Archangel Michael who lives in the Pansy Milbank motel on earth? Well, give it a try, it's supposed to be a comedy. Ok, so far, all right. But Michael does things that a fallen angel would never do, and that completely confuses any credibility the movie has had. The other characters in the film do not have much appeal either. Michael gives life back to a dog, and that's supposed to surprise us. People make country songs. In the end, Stapleton dances with Travolta. What a thing. If she were smart, she would not even be in this movie. When it was over, I thought: "Wow, what a stupid, insipid, boring, cheesy and sacrilegious movie!" It is not worthy to be seen by children or by anyone else.
