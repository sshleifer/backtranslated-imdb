I've seen this movie and I did not care anyway. I would not think of going to Paris because I do not like this country and its national capital. I do not like to learn French anyway because I do not understand their language. Why would I go to France when I would prefer to go to Germany or the United Kingdom? Germany and the United Kingdom are the nations that I tolerate. Apparently, the Olsen Twins do not understand the French language like me. Therefore I will not disturb the trip to France no matter what happens. It is better that I stay in the UK and meet single women and play video games if there is a videogame room. That is all.
