So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie. I found this and rented it because it was a movie I had not seen or heard. <br /> <br /> Now I like Slasher movies in general, but this is simply abysmal, it is not even good to laugh. In addition to being ultra ultra-cheap and with all the film clich√©s and terrible performances, he has the most inept and incompetent address he has ever encountered. Now, sometimes, the mentioned traits may be present in a movie and you can still enjoy something, but not here. Painful example of home horror.
