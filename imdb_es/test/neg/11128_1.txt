When I drove home from work, I bought some movies for my four-year-old twins. I had bought this movie that my children would enjoy. I saw this with my children. My 10 and 17 years were about to vomit. In this film, dad acts like a belated one. My little ones saw it every day. One day, they shot all our movies. I SELL Omosis Jones movie on Ebay. My Degree: F ++++++++++++++++++ I prefer to be seen in the list of worst disguises. <br /> <br /> My children now hate this silly movie. If you give the idea that germs can talk to each other. I wonder how the silly movie sounds in Japenese. I broke the CD in half when I was irritated to see it again and again. No offense, but the performance of Brandy & Elena was the best.
