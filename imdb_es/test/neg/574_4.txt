"The Love Letter" is one of those movies that could have been really smart, but they squandered it. Focusing on a letter that wreaks havoc in a small city, the film has a cast of stars with nothing to do. Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond had recently co-starred in the super hilarious "In & Out" (also about an upset in a small town), in which both were great, but here it seems that they are receiving drugs. all over the place. I can not say what the people behind the camera are trying to do (if they do), but they sure did not achieve anything. How tragic, that a possible uproar for laughter is so sadly wasted
