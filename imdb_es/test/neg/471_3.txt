This could have been a great movie with great educational potential for teachers around the world on evolution, biology, creative work in science, research and Darwin's life, but it is not. <br /> <br /> The script is mostly historically inaccurate and transforms a true story into a Mexican melodrama of soup and opera. While it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs, this was due in large part to his discoveries during the voyage of the Beagle and not just to the loss of his daughter. He certainly felt disturbed by his loss, but that did not make him literally crazy, delirious and distant from his friends and family. The portrait of Darwin is an invention of the writer of scripts. Therefore, it can not be used in any way as a place to learn a little about Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians, Darwin had the theory ready for the end of the Beagle voyage, and prevented it from being made public because he wanted to further develop the consequences and verify more data. In the film, it is an imaginary conflict of Darwin with his religious beliefs and mental illness that developed after the death of his daughter which prevented him from making it public. <br /> <br /> The film brings a modern situation, the creationists. Scientists vs debate, in the life and times of Darwin, so it is anachronistic. It represents Thomas Huxley not as a man trying to develop a deeper understanding of biology, but as someone anxious to "kill God", in his own words from the film, and destroy the church, which would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of many disconnected data. Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and insensitive person, a combination that I interpreted was an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak out against religion. In real life, Huxley accepted Darwin's ideas after his publication little by little, and before Darwin's work, he thought there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first support for evolution was published a month after the Origin of the species became public. He was agnostic, but he did not think it was necessary to "kill God", he just thought there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. The creationists versus scientists debate appears throughout the film, and the creationists of phrases like "It's just a theory" are part of the discussion. Of course, there was no such dispute or catch phrases at that time. In fact, the Anglican Church published a positive critique of the Origen's statement that they saw God's work in evolution, in a sense, quite at odds with the way the clergy is represented in the script. <br /> <br /> Another terrible aspect of this film is that it gives the wrong impression to the general public that scientific research is in charge of a lonely madman who only writes a lot. Could not be farther from the truth. The conception of the theory of evolution was the result of Darwin's minute observations over five years in the HMS Beagle of living forms, and gradually developed as can be seen in Darwin's notes on travel. Although the voyage of Beagle was the most important part of Darwin's life for the conception of the "Origin of species", the trip is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning, and no attempt is made to show that the book was a Detailed analysis. of observations. To make matters worse, Darwin is shown performing a single experiment (raising pigeons) to test his theory and, in the end, he abandons it. And I'm not really sure if such an experiment really happened. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment. It is not in any way a tribute to Darwin and science.
