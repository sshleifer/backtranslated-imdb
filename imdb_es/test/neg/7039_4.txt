The faint story of an evil sorcerer who is looking for a centuries-old satanic Bible to be able to fulfill Lucifer's orders by undoing creation. In search of all the way there is a Centruy 17 bounty hunter named Redfern and his reluctant companion Kassandra. Sound like a load of bunkum? It is. <br /> <br /> This nonsense by the writer D.T. Twohy receives the superficial treatment that director Steve Miner (who directed that romantic nonsense "Forever Young") deserves. Doshy obviously does not know anything about true evil. <br /> <br /> Julian Sands just flies and laughs, trying to look evil, while Richard E. Grant only manages to waste his rich talent. Lori Singer's career also fell off with this one. <br /> <br /> The special effects team has a little fun, and Jerry Goldsmith provides a score higher than his subject.
