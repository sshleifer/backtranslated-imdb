I entered this movie with an open mind. I had been too lazy to go to the video store to choose a movie, and my friend came back with this. I promised him I would not laugh at his choice, but in the first five minutes I told him I would have to return my promise. We keep looking, just hoping it will get better, but no; This was followed by a mental violation. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was probably one of the worst committed to the movie, and surely deserves a place at the bottom of IMDb. I really do not know how it was achieved. distributed. The lighting was poor. I have seen better acting in works of primary school. There really is nothing positive to say about it.
