this show just sucks. I do not think I have to say it or why, because judging from the amount of comments I'm repeating everything. The vip keys are like turning on your TV and getting pooped. That's exactly what it is, I'm not even exaggerating a bit. These guys are so stupid, they're not funny and they're not so comfortable with the ladies that it's not even funny, it's stupid. I sat through four episodes and I want my two hours back. Where do you find the contestants because obviously they have mental deficiencies? If I were the man who came up with this idea for a show and put it on TV, I would do the world a favor and jump from the tallest building I could find. How does garbage get in this way on television? Especially the comedy network should not be a program on something called the comedy network, at least be a comedy show or maybe be fun so often?
