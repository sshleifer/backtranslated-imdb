Every time I watch this movie, blood comes out of my eyes. Yes, you read it correctly: I have seen this miserable and disgusting thing more than once. <br /> <br /> Caddyshack 2 went wrong for so many reasons: Harold Ramis scored a script and left the direction duties, Rodney Dangerfield (wisely) walked away from the project because he was not allowed to play with the script, Bill Murray showed a excellent judgment and was not part of it, and a puppet was pushed forward as the main actor in a cast that deserved much better. <br /> <br /> I can not help but think of Dyan Cannon in this and wonder why she always laughs and smiles. The only conclusion I can draw is that, in fact, she is the face of pure evil. Stay with me a moment. She must have been watching when the movie came together and reveled in the unspeakable agony she would inflict on countless moviegoers who would regret this movie. She may also have been extremely drunk. That's what I need to be in this moment to eliminate from my mind the unpleasant taste of this complete and absolute failure. If I am lucky, it will be erased forever. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times. I blame several of them for their childhood and for being a very stupid and foolish child who apparently had no aesthetic sensibility. Maybe puppets are funnier when you're a kid. No, the Muppet show is now more fun ... I guess I was bored. Caddyshack 2 is that kind of weird movie that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you convince yourself after the final credits that it could not have been as bad as that. Was. It is. It will only get worse over time. <br /> <br /> My reasons for returning to this movie, fortunately, are less and less. Randy Quaid is limited in his role as attorney for Jackie Mason. His opening scene is not bad and he got my only laugh. We see it a couple of times more, but it gets as tired as the rest of the movie and descends with unfortunate rapidity, from the incidental fun to the desolate wilderness. Randy Quaid does it well, and this movie owes him a lot because if there were reasons to see this movie as more than a torture tactic, it was. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's the trick of the movie. It has enough potentially attractive qualities for people to see, they are horrified by what they have done to themselves, but later, because the elections were so scarce, they can only remember what really amused them. Years later, without knowing it, they see it again and the cycle repeats itself. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason is to blame for this movie, but to be fair, I'm not sure she deserves it. He's really trying to get out, but it's impossible not to notice that the whole movie happens doing an imitation of Rodney Dangerfield. That's what the movie was written for, but I'm not sure he could have saved it. Ultimately, this fails miserably through a terrible direction, a bad editing (do we count continuity errors?) And a repetition of the same story with nothing of the ironic humor or the heart that made the first movie endearing. <br /> <br /> Kicking dragged and screaming up to three out of ten instead of two for the determination of Randy Quaid's bulldog. It's not even bad enough to laugh at. I have definitely seen worse things, but trust your memory, this is a dog. If you have never seen it, you have made excellent life choices and I welcome your excellent criteria.
