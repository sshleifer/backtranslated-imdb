If you have ever purchased at Wal-Mart, then you probably know about the $ 5 DVD container found in the electronics department. Well, that's where I found this movie. However, they cheated on me! You see, the cover of this particular DVD had a large image of Sandy Bullock and even included its name as "headliner". I took it thinking: "Wow, I did not know Sandra Bullock made this movie?!?!" So I was encouraged to go home and watch a great movie by Sandra Bullock. To my surprise, Mrs. Bullock had a small role ... very small. She plays the girlfriend of the CIA agent's son. Talk about supporting the actress. I may not have had more than 2 lines in the movie. Besides being tricked into making this a Bullock movie, I looked beyond and continued to watch an "action-packed" movie. Negative! At one point, for special effects, a gun was recorded in the camera. You have to see it to laugh at what is really horrible.
