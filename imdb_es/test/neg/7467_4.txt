It is not a terrible movie; my 10 year old son loved it, and he would be the demographic target, so I guess they guessed right. However, quite boring for an adult. <br /> <br /> It's difficult to relate it to animated lego characters, even high-tech ones. <br /> <br /> I thought about the choice of the three great virtues of the Bionicle. The world was a bit strange: unity, duty and destiny. Am I the only one who thinks that those sounds are a bit fascist? Especially the destination. What about freedom, equality, justice, etc.? <br /> <br /> Oh, well, it will sell Lego. A bit boring for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute ad. It could have been much worse.
