I find it difficult to understand what makes the viewer feel that this is a powerful movie. I guess the main intention of this film would be a study of the character and the effects of racism in a British community. Therefore, it is even more disappointing that all characters are two-dimensional and that the performance is at the level of a performing arts college course. I am always skeptical of "improvisation", another word to be too lazy to write a decent script. I felt embarrassed by the performances and I sat in an audience that laughed when, surely, they were supposed to be moved by the story. Racism is a serious problem, but I think that a subtle approach to cinema works much better than placing it with a palette.
