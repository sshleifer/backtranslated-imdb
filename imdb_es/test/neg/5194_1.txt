I can not claim any knowledge of cinematography or Mr. Angelopoulos. But I know Greece and I love its people. In July, my 14 year old son and I traveled to Cappadocia, Turkey, in search of some remains of the neighborhood where his great-grandfather Iordanis lived until the great exodus of the Anatolian Greeks in 1923. Reading the summary of the film (refugees from Odessa ) I thought maybe I could learn something more about the forced migrations of the modern Greeks. If I did not have a home in Rhodes, if I had not been to Greece 28 times in so many years, if I was not familiar with dozens of islands and cities in Greece and if I had never enjoyed the friendship of these exuberant and intoxicated people, I could have I thought that this lament had something to do with modern Greece. As a professor at a state university in New Jersey, let me assure you that I am familiar with the history of the period covered in the film. In fact, my wife's uncle was murdered by the communists during the communist assault for power. My mother-in-law experienced the Italian invasion and the German occupation ... barely. These characters on the screen speak Greek, they listen to Greek music, but who are they? No, they are not even vaguely Greek. Of course they are not people at all, but simply allegories. They are what the artist invents when life does not adjust completely or is inadequate for his perception of how it was or should have been. All represent some aspect of post-World War I Greece that the major external forces consigned to a fate they did not deserve. As we joked at the end of the 70s in America: "The revolution did not happen". For an ideologist / artist, this is not a joke. In fact, it is reason to submit to two and a half hours of torment. And everything is because the various Powers (Eleni's soliloquy of "guards" with uniforms of different colors) did not allow the generation after the "aristocrats" of 1919 (Spyros) to follow the call of peace and freedom ( the music of Nikos and his fellow musicians, that is, the Movement, the Cause). This dark and surreal revisionism taints the true and heroic efforts of the Greek people to maintain their lust for life through the tragedies of the twentieth century, to achieve more than any of its neighbors in the Balkans, for having developed politically and integrated globally.
