Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Monotonous, unimaginative, predictable, and with all the usual suspects. Exactly the kind of film that the Irish film industry should not be doing. And with the added benefit of a molasses-coated finish. A disgusting example of how talent and originality are overlooked in favor of an almost aggressive mediocrity. Yes, children are sweet. Yes, it almost seems that it is done professionally. But this is making movies by numbers, a direct hit and grabbing what the director obviously thinks is "success", a film that sponsors and despises the audience. It is quite surprising that Working Title will throw 3 million pounds on this garbage. But then, they paid for Love Actually. Do not waste your money.
