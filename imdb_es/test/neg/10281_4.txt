First of all, I'm a big fan of Robert Blake, I always have been. <br /> <br /> This movie appeared on Movieplex last night on 10/13, and the title interested me and, of course, the star. But after seeing it, I was more confused than before it started ... There are some good scenes, and I thought they were going to take somewhere, but they did not, it turned out to be an "anti-police" "anti-buddy" "anti-hippie", more or less "anti-everything movie", with an extremely confusing plot that did not go anywhere either. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake is excellent as a protagonist, and excellent as someone could be with this bad movie, I'm still a big fan of Mr. Blake and I love his acting, even in a shit like this ... But this drug caused the gut of the 70, well ... better stay away from this ... And, that end, what to piss.
