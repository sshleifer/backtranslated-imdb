I saw this on the show late, late, late, late when MST3K was just a glitter in Joel Hodgson's eye. I had the privilege of seeing him without knowing exactly how serious it would be. I did not know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could run "to the ends of the earth" in about an hour and a half (thank God her father had given her specific instructions) and then take days to return to The Castle with help. I did not know that a barbarian-type sword with a hilt could run into the forest and create a hang glider and dust bombs in less than 30 seconds. I had no idea how uncomfortable a movie could be. <br /> <br /> It's a bad thing, children, something very bad. If you like bad movies, do it.
