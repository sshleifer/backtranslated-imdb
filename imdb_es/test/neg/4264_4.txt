This movie did not do justice to Mr. Bachchan. He is a great actor and I was very disappointed in the film and did not have much plot. Actually, this is the first movie I've been disappointed with him in it. He starts with her coming to his house with his daughter and he is a photographer. He takes pictures in the garden and she is watering. He's a sixty-year-old man who has nothing more to do than take pictures of this girl. The movie does not make sense. The whole movie is about her chasing him and telling him how much she cares about him. Then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl to places so she does not get bored and her daughter finds out. I just did not think this movie lived up to Bachchan's standards. He is better than this movie. I always imagined him as an honest person and then I saw him in this movie and I could not see him in this movie. The movie did not interest me at all. I could not wait until the movie was over. And you neither.
