If you are a little masochistic and you like to waste your time, you should try this one. I lost enough time to look at it, so I will not lose anymore explaining why it is so horrible. Be warned !!! Oh, I see that I have to fill 10 lines or more. Here we go: every year, more or less, some people think it's fun to start filming a low-budget movie about the terrifying monsters of the underground movement, which will hopefully turn out to be a kind of success. The Cavern is one of those. I did not have much expectations about this, but the performance is so bad and the production is so bad that I am seriously thinking about asking for a refund. Phewww ... one more line about a useless movie ... Oh, I'm done.
