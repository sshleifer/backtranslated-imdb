Of all the favorable comments, we could not wait to see this show. We love crazy humor and creative material, especially from Australia and New Zealand. <br /> <br /> I admit that it may not be a fair review since we only saw the first 15 minutes. But we could not stand more misery: it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we have experienced watching a television program. It seemed like 15 hours. The songs can be (slightly) interesting by themselves, but inserted for 3 endless minutes each in the middle of the scene of a story simply does not work. <br /> <br /> We are making a great effort to erase the memory. If you want a bit of good humor in a charming and engaging movie, see "The Dish" instead.
