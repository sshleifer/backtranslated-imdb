I know that if I were a low budget filmmaker, I would probably be checking this page to find out what people are saying about it. So I really hope the creators of the movie really read this! I think you should find a way to pay me the hour and a half of life that I just lost seeing this garbage. Please STOP making movies about something you probably fantasize about. Just stop making movies all together ... you are one of the reasons why it is so difficult for indie filmmakers to succeed. Do the world a favor and get a job at a McDonalds or something so you can do something productive with your life! I want to call blockbuster to complain that they really brought this movie to their store.
