This movie is a big stereotype. The acting (except Philbin and Harrison) is horrible and the horrible script only makes things worse. I must agree with another review that the "local" characters sound ridiculous, in fact, so do the "Caucasian" characters. 3 stars for 10 for 1) Philbin 2) Harrison 3) Surf scenes. (1/2 * of ****) Look at "Aloha Summer" (**) and / or "Beyond Paradise" (***) for Hawaii well, especially BP that I found entertaining and brilliant.
