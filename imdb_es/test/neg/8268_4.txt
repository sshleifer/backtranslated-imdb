You just need to see this as a propaganda against miscarried abortion and you will realize how bad it really is. The main message of this film is that even the sickest people can not commit an abortion. If you ask, that is not far from flying abortion clinics. So this guy wants to kill a poor girl, but he has to convince her to have an abortion first. What a load of garbage. And the worst is that it has a convincing argument (to take a child to an environment without love), but that is supposed to be discarded because, anyway, it is a phenomenon. And the part with the bible pushers ... first they throw this girl because she explains that someone stole her money (that rule must be in the Bible somewhere) and then in the end they are a kind of angel like deus ex machina delivering the evil assassin by harassing him in his front yard. Come on. Other negative points include a very confusing scenario (and I do not mean it in a good way) ... so this guy is just a psychopath, why? Because his mother gave him some liver once? And I do not know about the rest of you, but he seemed to be the kindest person in the world during the whole movement! even though she wore girlish clothes, she stole money and recorded the girls in her car. If you forget the story of an idiot, this movie has a great picture and Bob Hoskins was really great, and he has one of those funny English cars. If he were really a psychopathic killer, I would give him at least 7.
