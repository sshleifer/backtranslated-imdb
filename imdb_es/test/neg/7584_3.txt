Expert professionals live in an exotic and dangerous place. They get drunk every night. They smuggle opium. They drop pigs in parachutes. They fly under incredibly dangerous conditions. They dress strangely and act rarer. They are iconoclastic, outrageous. They violate all the rules of command and despise their employers in the CIA. They are irreplaceable. <br /> <br /> No. It is not "only the angels have wings" and it is not "M * A * S * H". It's an uncomfortable mix of the two that, unfortunately, is considered more foolish than fun. <br /> <br /> It aims at shock, fun and education, but in reality it does not achieve its objectives. <br /> <br /> As far as its shock value is concerned, well, we're already insured, right? Does it really surprise someone that a group of hard-living pilots flew on secret missions in Laos in the 1970s? No, it's not shocking. It is not even educational now, in our current circumstances, when it would be interesting to know that some paramilitary excursion was NOT buried in a file called National Interest, Defense of Toucher. It's okay. So we have been a little quiet and we are not so shocking or so stupid. <br /> <br /> The problem in this case is that the film depends on those same qualities for its power to entertain. Without that, the film implodes. A group of shaggy drunken CIA pilots are sitting around a cat house, chasing the girls, firing the lights with a silenced gun, killing the lizards. He asks rookie driver Robert Downey, Jr .: "When you act like that, does it mean there's something to celebrate?" Another responds, laughing, "No, it means it's night." That could be fun if we expected the renegade pilots to be as straight as the rest of us. If we do not, the gag, like the film, is deflated. <br /> <br /> There are action scenes naturally. Everything that can happen in an airplane in flight or in an airplane in flight. People fall from them, luggage is thrown at random from their hatches, engines fail, they suffer AAA damage, they tear during landings, but we have seen most of this elsewhere, often it gets better. <br /> <br /> Some may find this more fun than me, and the acting is pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. is especially effective as the righteous man. Take a look at the other comments and if they describe a movie that you may find attractive, then, by all means, look at it. There could be some laughter in her that escaped me.
