I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a great time. Special effects are not worthy of a primary school production. A toy ship, representing a freighter, moves at the speed of a speedboat in flat water while the mist driven by the wind blows in the opposite direction. The red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch. Whatever the cache that Vincent Price was supposed to bring as a narrator, it is totally eclipsed by the appalling production work. Calling this a documentary is like calling a musician Britney Spears. About 20 minutes from this, something I found very funny. Perhaps it was Price's too dramatic intonation of the line so used "They vanished in the Devil's Triangle!" [Cut to black, next story] Once I started laughing, my friends joined in. Back shouted: "Good! "After that, he almost laughed as much as in a Marx Brothers movie, and no one was left with the second movie" Cars of the Gods. "
