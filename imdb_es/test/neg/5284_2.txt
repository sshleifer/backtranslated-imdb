I paid $ 2.00 for this piece of garbage, I want to get my money back. It's an ad-grade horror movie that is not so great <br /> <br /> There are many floors in this movie, including acting, lack of real horror, lack of nudity (which, in addition to the initial nurse (porn outfit) and naked body flash that still breathes, there is none. <br /> <br /> The sound track may be the best because it has some optimistic sorta rhythms / guitar tracks. <br / > <br /> There are your usual typical characters, the athlete, the athlete woman, the nerd man (who looks more like an athlete), the rookie policeman / ranger (who has the biggest gap between his teeth. of a dollar in that gap ... or go for a field goal) the mysterious friend and the Pure girl. <br /> <br /> The makeup was unfortunate with side views of the dr chopper showing a clear "line of makeup "and natural skin tones, the cover of the DVD is clearly photoshop / enhanced to make the portal It is more attractive, since Dr. Chopper looks like an old "plopper". The women with little clothes hanging around the Dr chopper are not explained, and ook convincing like the rest of this movie. <br /> <br /> The turn of the plot was VERY predictable and the abundance of FALSE members who looked bad was ridiculous, what did they think? fake blood and you have a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The same Dr. Chopper is the stupidest character I've created in a long time, although original I think the creator of this movie was forced by ideas and possibly I tried to use the Doctor rhyme and the helicopter ( bicycle) and I thought "bingo" would make a bad movie about it. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse things before ... but this is just bad. . everything is bad ... the lack of suspense ... the lack of real horror or the development of the character ... the lack of a decent story ... the only good thing about this movie was when it ended. This film does not fall into the category, it is so bad that it is good "for me either / <br /> <br /> In general 2/10 the director / writer / editor should know more.
