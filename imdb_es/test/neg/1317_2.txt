Oh, but this is unfortunate. A good actor after another becomes a half-hearted dialogue, under what must have been an incredibly pedestrian direction to consider it acceptable. I like Robert Carlyle and Joanne Whalley is one of my favorite actresses. Tom Courtney can act well when pressed and David Suchet is a professional of the highest integrity, but they all wallowed like fish in a barrel of watery gin. I swear Courtney was drunk, with painkillers, or both. <br /> <br /> Was there a good performance in the whole matter? Well, yes, David Hood, the minor junior engineer whose partner was dragged, it seemed that he was taking it seriously and gave him credit for that, it can not be easy when "everyone is losing his," so to speak, or such times their scenes came under the direction of the assistant director (if there was one) I just do not know what these people were doing in such a poor movie (apart from paying the bills, obviously) I can not begin to say that I'm disappointed in them. YOU MUST BE APPROVED FROM YOURSELF! <br /> <br /> Any positive other than David Hood the third ... yes The largely submerged London aerial shots were very well done and the responsible effects of the artists deserved more than having their excellent work dotted for such a superficial history, if you forgive the expression, since those few people who do see them will do so on a screen much smaller than it would be a better advantage. <br /> <br /> What is happening here? Why do British filmmakers try to imitate tabloid genres without characters, with spectacle shows, like the disaster film and then do it even worse than Americans? Emaciated realism, integrity of character, the capture of real emotion in a way that makes you feel and care ... The Family Way, Spring and Port Wine, Get Carter, The long Good Friday, Trainspotting ... Do not get me I'm wrong like a little escapist hokum. The real "Italian job", The Adventures of Tom Jones; but, oh, that should come to this, there was a more realistic drama in Carry On Camping.
