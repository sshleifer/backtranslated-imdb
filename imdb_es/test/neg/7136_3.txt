Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) travels to Tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and is caught in the same mysterious curse that has killed so many people. With a group of others, she tries to solve and end the curse forever. <br /> <br /> The Grudge 2 repeats everything from the first and produces only a couple of fears. The first Grudge was an average film at best. The premise was decent, but the performance was wooden and some of the scenes were really ridiculous. Grudge 2 is even more foolish and less terrifying than the original. In addition, Scary Movie 4 has made it almost impossible to take these films seriously and I had trouble keeping a straight face during the "scary scenes" that should encourage laughter rather than fear. How Takashi Shimizu ruined his own franchise is inexplicable, however, he managed to create a decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, he kept the movie at a slow pace with a lot of boring characters and scare tactics. Clearly, he made this film for money and I'm glad he failed. <br /> <br /> The script was pretty bad, mainly because it did not make sense and they did not develop the characters at all. In the film, there were three different stories and each of them was related in some way to "resentment". The connections were weak and a lot of people were killed without a real reason. They do not explain the rules of the curse very well and ended up being a bit of a bloodbath because they all died, although the PG-13 classification prevented things from getting interesting, so even some of the death scenes were quite boring The dialogue was weak and none of the characters was pleasant or developed well enough to really worry. <br /> <br /> The performance was on par with everything else and was much worse compared to the first one. Amber Tamblyn was annoying in wood. He moved on the screen very slowly and all his emotions seemed false. Sarah Michelle Gellar was fine, although she had just had a cameo. Jennifer Beals gave the best performance, had some good scenes and was quite effective. Arielle Kebbel was fine, a little bland. The rest was horrible or just too forgettable to mention. In general, The Grudge 2 was a disappointing sequel. It lacked many things and is not worth seeing. Rating 4/10
