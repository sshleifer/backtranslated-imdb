The first DH was not so good, but I really did not expect it to be. But this horrible movie was beyond criticism. I really try to see the good side and give movies like this a try, but I just could not find something really good about it. I appreciate what Bill Cowell was trying to do, but this movie was so boring. The story of the movie is really not that bad. In fact, it is something original. But the shape of the movie is really as bad as many people say. In my opinion, this is at the height of "The Off Season" and "Dracula 3000". I know a lot of people really tear up and put movies like this, but I really can not think of other good things to say about it.
