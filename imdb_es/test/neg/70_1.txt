Witchcraft / Witchcraft / The House 4 / and as you want to call it. How are you ...? Crud. <br /> <br /> A gathering of people at an island resort in Massachusetts is besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch who kills each individual using cruel and devious methods. Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff) is taking photos for Linda (Catherine Hickland, whose voice and behavior resemble EE-YOR from the cartoon of Winnie the Poo), a virgin studying witchcraft, on the island without permission. Rose Brooks (Annie Ross, who portrays an incredibly rude bitch) is interested in buying the resort and, along with her husband Freddie (Robert Champagne, who is always bothering with other women much younger than him), his pregnant daughter Jane ( Linda Blair) and her grandson Tommy (Michael Manchester, who looks bored, probably wanting to see Sesame Street instead of starring in this garbage), goes boating to the resort and is given a look at the property by Realtor's son Tony Giordano Jerry (Rick Farnsworth). Obviously a puppy in the business got his feet wet. Along with these people is the architect Leslie (Leslie Cumming, whose character is a nymphomaniac) who could help Rose to redesign the resort. The captain of the boat is killed by The Lady in Black (Hildegard Knef, with her makeup and extra thick lipstick) and a storm is coming. The ship moves away alone (... guided by the invisible power of The Lady in Black, I suppose) with everyone trapped in the decrepit complex, which needs repairs. Most victims, before knowing their grisly destinies, are led through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension (... maybe a type of hell or something) where they are tortured by these demons dressed in raggedy clothes with a horrible face. . A victim has his mouth planted before being hung upside down in a fireplace, roasted while others light the fireplace. A poor soul is tortured by harsh twists of rope wrapped around her flesh before being found hanging from the muzzle of a swordfish that penetrates her neck. A partner is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge (and bleed) and the blood vessels in his neck burst in Hasselhoff's face! A companion is crucified with nails driven into his hands before being hung upside down on an open flame. The pregnant victim of Blair is possessed with her hair stopped and speaking with the voice of another woman. One is raped by this demoniac man with a "sick" mouth while the infernal hobos are nearby cheerfully cheering. The film, despite its excesses, is mostly boring for those who really want to see the lowest point in the races of Hasselhoff and Blair, who deserve better than this. Almost unbearable at times, building little or no suspense. Clumsy execution of sequences of death that seem cheap and laughable. Of course some blood is fine, but most of the films show the victims after they ran through the doorbell. We have the opportunity to see pregnant women (... who look exactly like doubles disguised as bad wigs) by jumping through three-story windows. Oh, and the mirrored face of The Lady in Black often appears on inanimate objects for the characters to see. Tommy has a small Sesame Street recorder that records the giant songs of The Lady in Black, obviously used for later. For some reason, the Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy. He does not have any fear, because Tommy is too bored to show any expression on his face, let alone fear. Do I need to say more? This is a real bad smell. Ugh
