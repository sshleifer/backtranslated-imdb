(Spoilers ahead!) This same exact plot of this movie has been done before. It's been done on Ferris Bueller's day off! Marques "Bat Man" Houston plays sick. His gullible parents believe him. Her sister knows she's faking, but she still has to go to school! She is angry. He has a party with his friends while his parents are absent. When his parents arrive home, he is already sick and his parents never heard about the party. I like Immature better when they were in House Party 3 and still immature!
