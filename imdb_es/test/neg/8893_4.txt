This movie was very close to being a good movie. The direction must be a little softer to move from one piece to another to make it more plausible. In particular: the main character's need to escape is not explicit enough. Are you trying to commit suicide? Are you trying to escape? His life does not seem so bad, so it is harder to swallow that he wants to leave his life so much. In addition, it is not very clear how much "in love" has fallen in love with Jennifer Jason L. If the film had been revised paying more attention to these details, it would have been great. On the other hand, for an indy movie, it's pretty good! Maybe if you take a couple of drinks, to bore logical thinking, it would be more fun ... <br /> <br />
