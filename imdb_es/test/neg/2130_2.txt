This film of cheap exploitation is something really insipid, courtesy of the director of Spaghetti Land, Lamberto Bava, who wisely left his name out of this garbage. <br /> <br /> The basic point of this excursion is the discovery of some brutally mutilated individuals. washing on land in the Caribbean. Initially, authorities believe they are victims of shark attacks, but as the investigation unravels, it turns out to be something much more sinister. <br /> <br /> All this ultimately is very little, however, we have here: the poor dubbing complemented by a similarly weak script, which often consists of meaningless chatter, and is actually of little importance for the most part. Acting can only be described as subpar, which is par for the course in this instance. The really relaxed direction does not help things either. <br /> <br /> The special effect is mainly for numerous close-ups of various bloody bodies that are missing limbs, and so on. Of course, there is the obligatory creature that emerges periodically at mealtime, which resembles a large monster, where the animation only consists of its pointed teeth ascending and descending in rhythmic articulation. In general, the end result is not too convincing, of course, but you have to admit that it is almost entertaining in a corny way. <br /> <br /> It seems that what the filmmakers were looking for was a kind of low-income hybrid. Jaws and piranhas, but the final product is just bloody chaos, very similar to the corpses that are shown incessantly throughout this image. I find it difficult to think of any redeeming attribute that justifies seeing this, therefore, strictly for those addicted to the movies of incurable monsters.
