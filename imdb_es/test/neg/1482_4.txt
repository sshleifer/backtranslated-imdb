I was Stan in the movie "Dreams come true". Stan was the friend who worked in the factory with the main character and ended up breaking his arm in the machinery and was carried out screaming (where was the ambulance?) The performance in this movie was for the most part quite poor with actors mostly local Fox Valley, Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. He played 2 nights in 3 theaters and it was something special to see you on the big screen. It may be a bias, but in general, I enjoyed it. Also the soundtrack was the Spooner band, which later became Garbage. My brother, Steve Charlton was also in the movie. He played Swenson, the man who comes to the door with crutches to talk to the police.
