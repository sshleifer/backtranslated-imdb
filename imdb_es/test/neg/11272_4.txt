In this film, there is a loose plot of a man (Bardem) who wants to obtain financing for his construction business, and marries a woman he does not love (the wide Mar√≠a de Medieros) in the process. He maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love, and finally becomes entangled in his own romantic network. He never abandons his juggling until the three main characters meet face to face. The movie is boring, with lots of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the reactions in the movie are absurd, incoherent and, of course, too stupid. None of the characters is credible, which makes the movie a bit annoying. Anyway, the acting is surprisingly good for such a poorly directed film, which makes it a bit interesting, but if you can, watch another movie, please.
