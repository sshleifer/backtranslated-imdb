This movie must have worked well at the box office so Gator can get the budget it deserves. This movie had no budget, I needed a script rewrite and a better ending. There are flashes of brilliance in this movie. The scene of the boat trip, Burt driving the bad machine and his conversation with his parents. It can be said that Burt is a Southerner, and not an actor. This movie shows what Gator would look like, Burt's best movie. Too bad, this movie did not have the same funding and was made in the Rush. 4/10
