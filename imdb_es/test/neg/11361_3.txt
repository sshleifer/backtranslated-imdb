I do not understand why some of you (or many) have given this movie more than 8 stars out of 10. Do you understand that there are lower grades for a reason? Sure, this can be a zombie movie with some splashes, but that's it. I'm not a fan of zombie movies, but this was horrible. Actually, actually, I should call it more like zombie soap, because that's how it works. The production is ... well, it's fine. Just an attempt to develop the plot, a horrible performance, silly effects, clich√©s and an abrupt end. Go ahead, and like the zombie movies, but never give this to a 5.0. Honestly, the only reason you should want to see this movie is to laugh. Seriously.
