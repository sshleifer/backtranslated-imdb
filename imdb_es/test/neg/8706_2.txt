With a name like "10 Commandments," a film would be expected to be representative of the account in the Bible, specifically Exodus. It is not like that here. This is a standard procedure with any Hallmark Biblical film. Do you remember "Noah"? That was absolute fiction and one of the worst movies ever made. At least this movie had "something" really in the original story. However, Menerith, who was a main character in this film, half brother of Moses, is not in the original story. Other characters were absent, not to mention that important events were completely eliminated. So, what can you ask? Because this should be representative of the real story; otherwise, some might and believe that this is the way it really happened. In today's era, people get their religion from cinema instead of the Church and from reading the Bible. Also, it is a big mistake. See Revelation 22: 18-19. The script is already written. Why change it? In addition to the Exodus account (which should be the main focus), he has Cecil B. DeMille's movie to compare, which clearly is a much better presentation. <br /> <br /> The night it was broadcast for the first time, my wife was anxious to see it. I told him not to have any illusions because it was a Hallmark movie. She was puzzled and said, "Why, Hallmark makes good movies." That could be so, but they kill the Bible. I'm sorry to say that I was right. Not only history, but also acting. With today's technology, you should be able to make a wonderful biblical movie. I'm still waiting...
