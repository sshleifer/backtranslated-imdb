The Comebacks, a comedy that simulates sports-inspired films, tells the story of an unfortunate coach, Lambeau Fields, who takes a bunch of college misfits and takes them to the football championship. In the process, this lifelong loser discovers he is a winner after all, redeeming himself, saving his relationship with family and friends, and discovering that in fact, there is no "I" in the "team" ! <br /> <br /> I decided to see the unrated version for this movie. It was thirty minutes more and I thought it could be better than the theatrical premiere, to hear that people hated this movie. After all, thirty minutes of additional images can add a lot to a movie. Well, I was certainly wrong. It was as bad as the recent "Meet the Spartans", but it was thirty minutes more of torture! <br /> <br /> Seriously, who makes a fake movie of almost two hours ?! A fake movie is short because if it continues, it would be an exaggeration! Honestly, I love stupid comedies. Hell, I liked "Date Movie", "White Chicks", "Epic Movie" and "Little Man"! I guess when it comes to fake movies, it's a success or a failure, and this one definitely got lost. <br /> <br /> On the lighter side, of the many jokes in this movie, I'll say about six or seven made me laugh, even some that made me laugh out loud. But that does not say much. After those jokes there were more scenes of torture and lack of grace. <br /> <br /> I can not see how people would say that this is not a fake movie. In fact, there is as much product placement here as Meet the Spartans, there are so many dance sequences and jokes without grace. I will say that another thing that I like about this movie are the songs. They are some very good songs here. In general, see if you like fake films. Skip if you like funny movies.
