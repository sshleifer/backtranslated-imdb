As I write this, Norman Wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking hours laughing and screaming old phrases with his increasingly suicidal nurse. <br /> <br /> In fact, when you read this, you will probably have joined the hereafter and the obituaries will record a career of 80 years of hysterical fun from the adorable funerary with the crooked checkered cap. What most of these obituaries will not remember is how Norman Wisdom had already committed a form of suicide in the late 1960s with this surprisingly poor but oddly compelling final role for his film career. <br /> <br /> Are the signals ominous from the start? "Tony Tenser Presents" go the titles. Do you scratch your head? "Where have I seen that name before ...?" Well, in the titles of many of the cheapest and crappiest British films of the 1970s, so choose your option. <br /> <br /> So he says? "A production of Menahem Golan". Oh honey. <br /> <br /> From what I could see below is a combination of Confessions of a holiday camp and Last Tango in Paris. Sponsored by the Southport Tourism Board. <br /> <br /> Norman Wisdom is very versatile in being Norman Wisdom (or a variation thereof) here. Even in garbage like this, it's never out of place and somehow keeps you looking through your separate fingers while kicking and dribbling all over a Sally Geeson (clearly crazy). Tony Tenser and Menahem Golan were, among them, responsible for some true cinematic horrors, but the bedroom scene in the film atrocity was reborn. Sally plays very well the role of a lobotomized sex toy, by the way. <br /> <br /> I wonder if any of the crazy young cats that populate the scenes of the party in this movie maybe thought of a moment of silence "Umm?" Norman + sex + hippies. Get me out of this mess! "I guess it was a payday for them. <br /> <br /> However, I feel sorry for The Pretty Things, they probably thought" Yes! This will do for us what Blow Up did for the Yardbirds "<br /> <br /> And so Norman's men's race ended, freezing his balls in Southport. <br /> <br /> I went there once. It was a depressing place.
