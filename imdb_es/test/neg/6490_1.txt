Charlie (George "Norm" Wendt) and Rhonda ("Just Say" Julie Brown) are a pair of joyful aliens and murderers who are stranded on Earth and run into a small town in the west. They become sheriff's deputies and deliver a deadly form of justice to sprinters, assassins and others, while putting on the bad side of some of the locals (led by Wayne Grace). Meanwhile, her sexy alien daughter (Anastasia Sakelaris) arrives in a shiny / shiny suit with her black human husband (Christopher M. Brown) to find them, and television reporters and government agents come to fill the time. <br /> <br /> As far as I can tell, this is a deliberate attempt to cover all possible genres (comedy, science fiction, horror, western ...) in a movie, and how stupid and unfortunate is this disaster , despite the energetic performance of the two stars The script is downright atrocious.
