OK, I must admit that I quite enjoyed House of the Dead despite its well-documented failures. However, this was the worst movie I've seen since Demons at the Door. In comparison with DATD, the effects are much higher. However, the plot is weak, the performance reminds everyone's favorite, the porn movie and the decisions and actions of the "characters" consistently border on the moronic. I look forward to trying Uwe Boll's latest film outings just to get an idea of ​​the perspective of HOTD2. I am not suggesting that he is really the cure, more a case of a different disease, but when his senses have been insulted in such an abominable way, the only way to do it is to increase. OK there it is. I have handled the minimum of ten lines and will not waste any more time on the celluloid waste that is the House of the Dead 2.
