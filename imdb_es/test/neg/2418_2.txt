Where to start? This movie is very entertaining if you are new to the wonderful rugby game, however, if you live outside the US. UU And you continue the game, it's ridiculous. Several rugby traditions, such as the "Haka" performed by "All Blacks" of New Zealand and only by All Blacks. The leader of the Haka is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been misused and represented by the writer. The movie itself is pretty well targeted, however, it is the poor script and general execution that disappoints him, to a large extent. Considering that it is based on a true story, it has a lot of clich√©s in the story. I would strongly suggest that any American interested in rugby watch this movie and then see what rugby really is on YouTube because the rugby represented in this film has been distorted and skewed so far, compared to what it really is.
