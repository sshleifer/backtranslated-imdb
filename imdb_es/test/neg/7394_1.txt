A ragtag of Western tourists in Africa suffers the misfortune of their plane collapsing, so they are forced to take a bus to travel through the Namibian desert to reach the starting point closest to civilization. It is not surprising that the driver's compass ends up not working, and they are out of the course, stopping in an abandoned ghost town that had been a barracks during the fighting in World War II. They find a little kerosene (useless to refill the tank of their bus), a storage room full of half-poisoned carrots in cans and a native hermit who sees them with indifference. The only companion among them who seems to have something in the ball in terms of survival techniques goes off to get help. They should remove the tires from the bus and burn them if they do not return in five days: hopefully, someone will see the black smoke. <br /> <br /> Do you find it interesting? Well, of course, even if it sounds a lot like * The Flight of the Phoenix * or any number of movies in the "desert island" genre. That's why it's surprising that * The King Is Alive * is number 4 (if someone is still counting) in the series "Dogma 95", that if I remember the ridiculous "Dogma 95 Vow of Chastity" correctly, he proclaimed it "The genre films are strictly verboten ... Ups ... Well, anyway, you can say that you're going to try to be all artistic and so on to make up for the fact that it's a genre movie ... Yeah, it does not take long for a group member , an old theater actor, start scribbling, from memory! - the various roles of * King Lear * in, well, paper rolls.The idea is that the execution of the game helps while the time passes. which really goes against the advice of the survivor who ran away to stay optimistic (did not the old actor do a theatrical performance-dinner of * The Odd Couple * only once in his life?), Apart from that such activity is a colossal A waste of valuable time and energy. <br /> <br /> This movie It's so bad that I really do not know how to continue. It is so stupidly monumental, so full of absurd situations and characters that it engenders rational criticism. It may be an opportune time to offer full disclosure: I despise this so-called "movement" of the Danish film to an almost irrational degree. I think my face reddens slightly at the mere mention of Dogma 95. First, if the name of your movement has the word "dogma" in the title, you've already lost me; Second, in this particular case, the insistence of the movement on the renunciation of individual artistic achievements is a recipe for hypocrisy when one considers that the filmmakers here are looting one of the best works of the best INDIVIDUAL writer that ever existed. (But, no doubt, the Dogma crowd believes that Shakespeare's Works were actually written by a consortium of Elizabethan bigwigs such as the Earl of Oxford, Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, and the Queen herself). <br /> <br /> You may have forgiven the whole company if you had played the stage for ridiculous purposes (attacking the precious Dogma, now THAT would be subversive!). But the film takes itself very seriously, and soon becomes the clich√©s related to the genre to which it belongs unequivocally: people who face each other; the men who grow beards; The inevitable deaths of some of the main actors. All with a serious face. "Is this the promised end?" Well, not quite: we also have to endure the abysmal transfer of DV. Because this is another Rule in the Vote of Chastity of Dogma 95: only digital video of hand. A friendly advice for Danes: their "movement" is in trouble when their finished product has worse visual quality than an average home graduation video from high school. Professionalism belongs to an artist's bag of tricks, right next to his own individuality. "Artisan" and "artist" are related words, Mr. von Trier: not all imbeciles with a $ 100 hand can be filmmakers. Pass it on. And, by the way, allow your Dogma directors to be accredited for their movies, while you're at it. The fact that the writer of * The King Is Alive * receives credit, while the boy (or the girl) who actually filmed it is not, is just a little bit hypocritical. <br /> <br /> Contemptible. 1 star of 10.
