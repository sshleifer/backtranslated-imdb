As usual, leader Leo Gorcey (as Slip Mahoney) and "The Bowery Boys" are pressured for money. After trying unsuccessfully to sell their old jalopy, the boys seek help at the local bank. There, the unfortunate Huntz Hall (as Sach) has his photo taken by the beautiful photographer Teala Loring (as Cathy Smith). But, since the shot was taken during a robbery, it makes Mr. Hall look like the main suspect. With friends Bobby Jordan (as Bobby), William "Billy" Benedict (as Whitey), and David Gorcey (as Chuck); Mr. Gorcey wants to liquidate Hall and collect the $ 1,000 reward money. "Bowery Bombshell" goes through the motions, with Ms. Loring as a main force. <br /> <br /> **** Bowery Bombshell (7/20/46) Phil Karlson ~ Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Teala Loring, Bobby Jordan
