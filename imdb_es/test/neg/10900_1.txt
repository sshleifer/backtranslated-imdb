But is not. The plot is not so bad, the actors are not so terrible, so it should be decent. Instead, although despite a good starting point, the plot only prolongs and suffers many of those moments of "I can not believe that it is so silly," which are often used in horror movies to keep things in March. Sometimes I was frustrated to see some of the decisions made by the main character. It also took too long to get to the good part of the movie. The anticipation is excellent, but you can not spend more than half of the movie in building it. A pity too, since he had a decent exposure at the time of the launch and hit just before the great Halloween season. Even so, I have the feeling that this is going to have at least a sequel, if not more, maybe they can build on the strong general plot to finally throw something decent.
