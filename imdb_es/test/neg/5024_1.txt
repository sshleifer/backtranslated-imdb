It may or may not contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Inuyasha is not a good anime. Actually it is very overrated. Why? There is absolutely no story line, no plot, and the program simply goes on ... and continues ... and continues ... That's because there are more secondary stories and fillers than episodes that make the plot Advance. And the fillings are the same stories that are repeated over and over again. The same episodes seem to go with the same argument: Kagome feeling a fragment of jewel, a thing of demon worm / slime / tentacle appears, Inuyasha says "Wind-Scar", "Iron Reaver Soul Stealer", etc. and kill the devil. they get the jewel fragment, and then we simply repeat this scene 160 times or more. <br /> <br /> In addition to the repetition of episodes, there is repetition of comic devices, and they are no longer fun. Wait, they never were. Sexual harassment is NOT funny. Viz qualified Older Teens, 16+. I have no idea why they rated it. There's nothing wrong with that, except the so-called funny sexual harassment, which is somewhat suggestive and could get you arrested these days. <br /> <br /> Now, that's how we know Inuyasha is overrated. The videogames. Everyone stinked Especially the mask game. I played that at my friend's house. It was nothing interesting. The game was slow, boring, and had graphics similar to Nintendo 64. In a magazine, it got a rating of 4/10, saying "... this RPG is slower than a milk shake raising a cocktail". Then there are all these stupid Inuyasha toys, action figures, exchange cards, stickers and coloring books. COLORING BOOKS! We think Inuyasha was over 16 years old! Maybe not ... But after being a member of the Inuyasha groups on MSN, about half of the people there were between 10 and 13 years old. I guess, after all, Inuyasha is a little anime child. (I think that only a small part of the edition made in this program could be shown in Toonami). There are more than 40 manga volumes. I can only avoid asking myself how many kilometers of forest have been cut to make them. Sad ... <br /> <br /> Then there's the music. The music is so annoying. We listen to the same 5 songs in each episode. After 10 episodes, the music becomes really annoying. In other animes, they have music to adapt to the mood and we do not listen to some songs very often. There are about 15 different Inuyasha soundtracks. Do not waste your money on that garbage! <br /> <br /> And how do you think I know all this? Because he used to be a fan of Inuyasha. I feel ashamed of myself. I prefer to see Kim Possible or Pok√©mon in his place. Unfortunately, those two shows have more romance between the two main characters that Inuyasha will have ...
