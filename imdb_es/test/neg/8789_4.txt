In the mid-1990s, the career of director and animator Don Bluth seemed to have fallen to its lowest point. Before, Bluth had made a series of popular animated films, many of which are still loved today as "The Land Before Time" (1988), "The Secret of NIMH" (1982) and "An American Tail" (1986). ). But starting with "Thumbelina" in 1994, his films seemed to diminish more and more in quality and popularity and one of the many unfortunate entries is the 1995 box office bomb "The Pebble and the Penguin", a film that did not attract the audience. beyond parents and children under the age of seven. Frankly, these last ones are the only members of the audience that I can understand that they enjoy this rather insipid animated feature. <br /> <br /> The story is absurd. The movie stars a plump, stuttering penguin, poorly named Hubie (voiced by Martin Short) who falls in love with a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on her head (voiced by Annie Golden). Something like in real life, the penguins present their girlfriends with a pebble as a substitute for a ring. But when Hubie is swept away by the current, he joins a lone rockhopper (James Belushi) with the dream of flying and run against time to return to Antarctica before it's too late. The reasons why they might arrive too late is one of the many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would still be weak even if they were there. <br /> <br /> It becomes very clear very soon why this animated musical for children does. no and it will not work for anyone older than six or seven years. It just does not have any of the qualities that are required for a good animated feature. Number one, the movie looks bad because of a very poor drawing style. The animation in this film is very caricatural (even when it comes to animated films); It is dark, dark, there is no vibration in the colors, and besides that, the design of the film and the elements are universally funny and ridiculous. Take, for example, the penguins that star in the movie. With only a few basic exceptions, all penguins do not look anything like a bird. Hubie, for example, looks ridiculously ridiculous with wide cheeks, plump beaks, big eyes and the absurd hat he wears wherever he goes. Combined with his "fins" similar to the hands, he looks like Chris Farley in a penguin suit. Result: it is an ugly and badly drawn cartoon character. But the most absurd and absurd design character is the evil penguin, Drake, who frankly does not look anything like a penguin. He is a muscular man wearing a penguin mask. It has a chest wider than that of Arnold Schwarzenegger and teeth larger than those of leopard seals and killer whales that serve as predators of the film. Basically, he's a two-dimensional recycled villain. He lives in a skull-shaped cave, wears a cape, laughs a lot and gets angry when people laugh with him. Result: who cares? And what is also bad, and maybe worse, is that this is an animated musical and there is not a single song worth mentioning or memorable to find anywhere within its execution time. The opening hymn was harmless, not memorable, but inoffensive. But after that, the songs became increasingly boring and there was one in particular that made me wince all the way. It is the moment when the spectators press the fast forward button for each time it appears. <br /> <br /> I felt that "The Pebble and the Penguin" was exhausted, except for the few moments when Hubie and the rockhopper penguin The rockers are in danger in the jaws of leopard seals and killer whales , who fortunately did not receive dialogues and were treated like animals instead of cartoon characters. But in a way, for this reason, I can not wholeheartedly recommend this movie to children. This is the reason. The movie shows killer whales are the natural predator of penguins. My concern is that children who are familiar with "Free Willy" (1993) may be offended or discouraged to see their favorite sea inhabitants portrayed as a bloodthirsty carnivore. The leopard seal was a better antagonist and was funnier, as its jaws opened wider than those of a rattlesnake and how it seemed to grin as it growled. But the point is that these moments with predators and only a few are the only interesting moments. And they are not very interesting, look. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I can not recommend this to anyone under the age of seven. My advice: if you have children around that page, rent them for them. They could enjoy it.
