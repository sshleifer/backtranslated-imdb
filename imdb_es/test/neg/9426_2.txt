This is a low-grade cold war propaganda film crossed with a soapie. It may have some long-term significance as a snapshot of American thought from the 1950s, but there is little more to recommend in the mawkish plot, the woodwork and the grating style. There are some interesting pictures of planes lost a long time ago, but that was not enough for even this aircraft enthusiast to leave it on the screen in its entirety.
