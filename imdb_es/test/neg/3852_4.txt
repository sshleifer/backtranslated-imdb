The only reason someone wanted to see this movie would be by John Leguizamo. I remember the previews, and it seemed to be another second-rate comedy. But the fact that Mr. Leguizamo starred, tried to exchange it. His name, the known that was at that time or not, tried to sell it. <br /> <br /> I was quite disappointed with Leguizamo's performance. His days in "House of Buggin '" (a clone of "In Living Color"), were his best moment. There is a thin line between madness and idiocy, and we will only say that Leguizamo crossed it ten times. It seemed he was trying to be too scandalous and crazy for the camera. In fact, I will say that he tried too hard. The crazy humor was spilled in stupidity, and the movie was spoiled. I can not say that I blamed him, if you had this opportunity, you would do everything possible if you could, right? His enthusiasm cost him dearly, although Mr. Leguizamo ... <br /> <br /> The Pest follows the tradition of any comedy film, and plays the "career card", and more. No group is left out of being bothered. Blacks, Latinos, whites, Jews, Koreans, Germans, homosexuals and the blind are among those mentioned. Again here, things become too exaggerated and many attempts to be falsified in a very short time. The resolution of the film takes five minutes to clear and return to normal. <br /> <br /> When you have a movie and you're going to skip the plot and the reality for the sake of comedy, just make sure it's funny, or all you have is 90 minutes of meaningless movie. What would summarize the "plague" of Leguizamo quite well ...
