Yeesh, talk about Craptastic. This thing is brutal. Horrible voice dubbing, even more horrible acting and no perceptible plot. Apparently there are some chase scenes, but the problem is that you have to get to that point first, and I just could not. The 20 or more minutes that I endured felt more like a root canal than a movie. I suppose I could have moved quickly, and I recommend that you do the same, unless you have a very extreme pain tolerance or that you are a masochist. do not fall into any of the categories. I still have a migraine so I am about to perform dental surgery without anesthesia, I only relive the migraine. Bottom line, horrible. 0/10
