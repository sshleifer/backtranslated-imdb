I have waited a long time to see this movie. IFC finally ran it one night. I thought it would be something like "Barfly" by Barbet Schroeder. Incorrect. This movie does not recreate that underground world of bars full of characters, dirty, dirty, full of smoke, that you associate with their stories. Neither can capture the attitude of Bukowski that Mickey Rourke did so well in the movie mentioned. That natural and elegant attitude. The fans of Charles Bukowski will enjoy watching scenes of their books on the screen, but those who are not familiar with their books could have a wrong impression about their works. This movie looks like another "Movie of the week" about a drunk and their relationships. If you want to have a better idea about Charles Bukowski's world clock "Barfly".
