My God, this movie is amazing, it's the worst movie in history and I know what I'm talking about! I'm a fan of scary movies! <br /> <br /> The story is totally silly, a group of adults decides to have a party and a silly guy with a horrible mask comes and kills everyone ... the dialogues are a kind of spoof, the worst, only They are talking about sex with such a bad accent. The end is (oh !!!!!!) discover for yourself! You'll be really surprised ... (it's not possible! Yes, it is!) And it's surprising that the movie only has 58 minutes. (it's not possible (bis) it is!) Worse than House IV and Howling V. <br /> <br /> To put it in a few words, forget it forever!
