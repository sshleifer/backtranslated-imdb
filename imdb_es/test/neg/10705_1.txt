The plot, in the future when almost all men have been killed by a virus that goes to the Y chromosome, a genetic engineer (hot) "creates" a man in a chemistry lab, is intriguing. Despite the somewhat promising premise, the film falls flat in almost every respect. The dialogue is laughable. The characters are fine as paper. The exploration of a world of a single genre is superficial. The worst part of the whole movie is the Asian detective who offers such cheesy and ideal lines that you'll want to throw up. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how the hell this garbage was produced. Most of the movie is a male attack. "All men are violent." "All men rape women." "Men are only animals." All women, including "closed heterosexual cases," seem to show anger, fear and hatred toward men. If you want to see a science fiction movie in line with the premise of this movie, you would do better to look elsewhere.
