Until around 1970, Lucille Ball was a great comedian. He was such a perfect clown that he only wished that more people had seen her with Bob Hope in "The Facts of Life," because she could also do it dry. as well as slapstick .. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lucille Ball was wonderful. . . until "Mame" appears. <br /> <br /> Trying to see Lucille Ball in "Mame" is physically impossible because there is so much Vaseline in the leaked lenses that you would need Windex to see Lucille Ball in some scenes. So even if you see Lucille Ball in "Mame", you really can not see Lucille Ball in "Mame". What a blessing. <br /> <br /> That's the most beautiful thing I can say about "Mame", the musical movie of the play film (this could continue, but it started with a perfectly fun image). book called "aunt mame"). Giving a bad reputation to this is like hitting a sponge. So it does not matter if the music is sung instead of sung. Most of the songs were not much, anyway. There is no difference in the first three. "It's Today", "Open a New Window" and "We Need a Little Christmas" are all the same song. Celene Dion should make an album with them, they are so big and boring. The murderous ballad "If he came into my life today" needs a beautiful and safe voice (Edyie Gorme won a Grammy for doing it in 1967) that poor Lucille Ball did not possess when she made this movie. (It is true that Elaine Stritch can not carry a melody in a cube, but at least Stritch can put on a song). <br /> <br /> If you still feel that your life is not going to be complete unless you see the musical movie "Mame", notice how she is dancing in it, but every time Lucy / Mame starts doing something more than a mixture of paralysis, the camera retires, returns just as the number ends and the star poses with the dancers. Once again, it's just as good. Jane Connell had to repeat the role of the pathetic Agnes Gooch after Lucille Ball had Madeline Kahn sacked to make sure that no comic originality went up to the star's stage. Connell is a theatrical artist who, like Carol Channing and Ethyl Merman, can not reduce her performances for films, so she joins Lucille Ball to be shameful, though for different reasons. <br /> <br /> Luxurious dresses are by Theadora Van Runkle (Van Wrinkle?) and provide the missing color in all but one of the cast. <br /> <br /> Bea Arthur as actress Vera Charles, Mame's best friend, ignores everyone and makes her own fun. If only she was in more scenes. She is too old for her role, too, but at least she did not mutilate it.
