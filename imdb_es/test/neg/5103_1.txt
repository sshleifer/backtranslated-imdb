The film itself is just a compilation of scenes that do not have an inherent meaning for someone who lives outside of Russia. I will not deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at that time (filmed in 1928), but the problem with the film is that it does not interest the common or intellectual man. We are simply seeing a form of ready images, ranging from a man with one arm beating a horse to a soldier without teeth in the war. Everything in between is uncomfortable, random and quite unnecessary. It would have been possible to invent a forum that would keep the viewer interested but it would not be like that, although the director's method is quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> In general, one should see this if it is an art. student, on hallucinogenic drugs, or a pre-Tarkovskian film student.
