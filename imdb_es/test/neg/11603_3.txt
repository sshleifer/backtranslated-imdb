Perhaps the most daring of Alfred Hitchcock's career is this director's direct comedy vehicle, which unites Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discovers that an error has invalidated their marriage. Where are you really with each other? <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others say, here is an element of suspense: the idea that these two miserable people can escape among themselves, free to inflict their evil on some other partner who does not deserve it . <br /> <br /> It's fun to read here the comments about how badly Ann Smith Lombard feels in this movie, because the role of Montgomery is so important. He mistreats Ann, he answers the witnesses, the clients of little importance, exactly the kind of lawyer who gives a bad reputation to his profession. Of course, Ann is also dominant, the kind of wife who holds her husband hostage for six days for a small dispute, mentioning things like the ones he did in Paris when he was 20 years old and he had not even met her yet. "I forgave you that!" she says, as if it were great for her. <br /> <br /> For David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have some illicit pleasure with his "lover" before getting married. For Ann, it is an attempt to have premarital sex that must be repelled with a bottle of champagne on her head, followed by expulsion from her apartment and her life. <br /> <br /> The acorn does not seem to be very far from the tree, as Ann's mother is scandalized by apoplexy when she learns what David tried to throw away: "Oh, my poor baby! Thank God, your father is dead! " <br /> <br /> That's a rare and good line in this laugh, nasty comedy. <br /> <br /> This can be called an example of the "new marriage comedy", in which the bonds of marriage are challenged to reaffirm them. You can also call this an example of what Roger Ebert calls the "idiots argument", in which the story depends on the main characters acting like idiots. Hitchcock seems to laugh at tense American morality, but he really can not do much more than a joke-free scene in which an older couple is shocked by the sound of plumbing. <br /> <br /> Lombard died within a year of the premiere of the film; It was the last movie of her that she lived to see. What a pity it could not have been better! She was also dominant in "My Man Godfrey", but in such a nice way that not only did you have to go with her, but you also wanted to. Here he plays for laughs that are not there as he sadistically breaks David's slices over and over again. Montgomery rolls his eyes as Groucho, a study on falsehood. <br /> <br /> The only really decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is Gene Raymond as the legal partner of David Jeff Custer, who plays for Ann and acts with honor and decency. Raymond minimizes his many reaction shots, and even a scene of drunks, all with good results. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** Such a decent guy is Jeff that Ann ends up rejecting him for not fighting with David after she incites him to a confrontation, and calls Custer "a piece of jello". Jeff leaves the scene, leaving Ann and David together for their future murder-suicide. Here is a Custer who managed to escape a massacre! *** SPOILER END ***
