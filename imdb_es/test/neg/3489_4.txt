The "plot" of this film contains some holes through which you could drive a massive truck, but I think that is not always the top priority in the horror. Two older sisters in rural England have kept their brother in the cellar for more than 30 years. Now, he escaped and began a wave of assassinations, focusing on the armies that are in the vicinity. "We just thought it was the best thing for him", do they keep repeating and? strangely ?? all army officers love these women and do not doubt their sincerity, even though 5 of their men died. I do not know whether to find the revelation near the end with suspense? Or tedious! In a way, this movie reminded me about 'Arsenic and Old Lace'. In that classic of the black comedy, two half crazy brothers are also the mother of his younger brother and fool, but there they kill there. However, the old ladies of 'The Beast in the Cellar' are no less crazy. The "horror" in this movie of the early 70's is very amateur and cheap, but there are some attempts to increase the tension. However, there are too many 'old' talks about good times' and that is rarely something that is looked for in a horror movie with such an attractive title. Flora Robson, who can be recognized by classic moviegoers, plays one of the sisters. The image that gave the Queen of England is the legendary film by Errol Flynn Swashbuckler, the Sea Hawk.
