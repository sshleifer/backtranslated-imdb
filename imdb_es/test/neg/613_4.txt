I've become a big fan of the Carpenters, and I really did not enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel that he focused too much on his anorexia and I did not let his true personality shine. I did not like the portrait of Cynthia Gibb too much; especially knowing that he decided that Karen's anorexia was suicide, which clearly was not. Although her family did not like hugs and kisses, I thought that the film represented Agnes (her mother) as terrible. <br /> <br /> I found some scenes that tore at me in some way, like where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; I thought the metaphor (so to speak) was quite effective. When the family is playing pool and discussing their divorce, she collapses and Richard is surprised when he comforts her and feels that her fragile body was also quite moving (which is probably the wrong word). <br /> <br /> In general I feel that they needed to highlight their most cheerful and peculiar side, their true personality. Even as the focus of the film, there really was not a point that made one understand what would lead her to anorexia (although, of course, no one can know), and almost made her seem baseless. The movie was poorer, singer with anorexia than the story of Karen Carpenter, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I guess they changed the name / profession of their husband and all because they could not get their permission to do it. Include it really (there were some bad terms there), but all the aspect was wrong with the changes. On this note, I can not recall the film that made her longing for a family and her children stand out, which prevailed to a great extent in her life and explains her whirlwind of romance and her fast marriage to her husband. <br /> <br /> In general, it ends up as a low-budget movie made for television that is not of very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a fanatic who expects to see beyond Karen's disease. I feel that such a legend deserves / deserves a better movie as a tribute to an incredible person and an incredible voice.
