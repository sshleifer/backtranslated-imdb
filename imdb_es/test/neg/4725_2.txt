The next "revision" is one of the wrong side of the clues, which means two things: you will not hear anything other than compliments that come from me and do not be fooled by my rating. I could also tell you that this revision does not contain spoilers, but technically ... that's a lie. <br /> <br /> Well, ... Screw the revision. I'm just going to digress a bit. It's been a while since I had so much fun with such a bad movie. And if you can not enjoy this nonsense, you just do not have a sense of humor. In the first place, this movie should be taken seriously, and that is the main aspect where the fun comes from. The history? The son of a doctor has a terminal illness. Papi-doctor decides that a heart transplant should be the only way to save your child. Then, in a real mad doctor style, he decides that the heart of a gorilla will do the trick. Of course, the gorilla's heart is "too powerful for a human", so the little boy transforms himself into this horrible monkey that is immediately released and throws himself into a wave of murders and rapes (because that's what any horny beast, is not it?). The makeup of our Ape-Man is hilarious. There is simply no other way to say it: the boys' faces look like shit! I'm talking about human excrement here, solid brown type! Beautiful! The gore in this film is also wonderful: apart from the real images of an open heart surgery, we also have incredibly fake (but quite unpleasant) blood and gore effects: a decapitation, an eye uproar, a throat tear, scraping someone's skull, ... It's hilarious, and in fact it's quite incomprehensible why NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES came to the notorious list of Video-Nasties in the UK, because all the unpleasant things depicted in this movie are simply too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Oh, and there's only one damn monkey running around too, by the way. Therefore, it goes without saying that THE HUMAN BEAST HORRIFYING is a much more precise title for this terrifying and convincing science story that went terribly wrong. Representations of female nudes, this film manages to be highly entertaining with ingredients such as meaningless dialogues, cheap cardboard games, stupidity of the plot and an incredibly bad performance. Only a few random examples, maybe? About the sets: One can clearly see that the designers of the sets simply used the same walls, doors, windows (etc.) again and again to build different sets of different interiors (for example: one side of the hospital room - the side of the window) - where the unconscious fighter lies, looks suspiciously similar to the side of the basement-lab window from where Ape-Man escapes; the set designers also took one of the lab's side windows, made it a little larger and just placed it in the hospital's conference room; all the walls of any building are the same gray; ...) Then there is the park's stage. Clearly filmed in a studio, you can see (on several occasions) that the lawn is loose. Every time there is a little fight / fight / rape, the grass moves and crawls and you can see the gray concrete from the studio floor below. <br /> <br /> Only a few random lines that come out of the actors' mouth: <br /> <br /> - In the conference room where all the doctors are discussing the disappearance of Inconscience Wrestling Girl (a disappearance that would of course mean bad publicity for the hospital), Daddy-Doctor intelligently pronounces "We are in a situation that is difficult". <br /> <br /> - During that same debate, a colleague-doctor comments intelligently "A sleepwalker! Any sleepwalker gets up", which provides a solid excuse for the disappearance of the girl of unconscious struggle. <br /> <br /> - After our investigative detective, through the amazing process of his own logical deduction, concludes and tells his superior that the killer must be half man / half beast, his superior responds that he is absurd, adding the line "It is more likely that lately, more and more, you are seeing on your television many of those horror images" ... Truly one of the best lines of the film. <br /> <br /> Other sources of laughter: <br /> <br /> - The two scenes were: Daddy-Doctor and his assistant similar to Igor, kidnapped the zoo's gorilla and the Inconscience Wrestling Girl from the hospital. These well thought-out acts of kidnapping are like taking candy from a baby. <br /> <br /> - Daddy-doctor talks a lot to God, is not it? <br /> <br /> - Sonny-boy calls daddy-doctor "Daddy" on more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> - An old woman shouting "Aaargh !!! A dead man! A dead man! A dead man! A DEAD MAN!" <br /> <br /> - The plot stops periodically to wallow in scenes of women fighting, only to continue and do nothing with that concept. Sure, Papi-Doctor replaces Sonny- The boy's gorilla heart for the second time with that of the unconscious wrestling girl, but do you think anything spectacular happens after that? Like the growing breasts of Ape-Turd-Man or something, trying to rape men this time? Our leading beauty in wrestling (Norma Lazareno) does not even participate in a wrestling contest with Ape-Turd-Man near the end of the movie ... But Ape-Turd-Man begins to show some maternal love near the final ... almost (and I say "almost") in the true KING KONG style (that is, the top of a building and the people on the floor pointing and screaming). <br /> <br /> Well, I think that's enough. I entered more than my two cents here. . The rational classification of Vomitron for this sordid piece of the funny joke: 2/10. The rating of Vomitron from the wrong side of the tracks: 8/10. Go see this movie, people. Good worth it!
