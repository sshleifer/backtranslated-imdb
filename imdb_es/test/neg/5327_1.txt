I thought I had seen this movie before, since the summary of the plot sounded familiar. However, when I saw him one afternoon (he needed some senseless but fun entertainment), I did not recognize anything; If I had seen it before, I should have blocked the horror of my memory. <Br /> <br /> This movie is terrible, and it shows its age. In fact, it seems older than it is: more like a moronic comedy from the mid-80s. While I'm a fan of the bathroom humor and I can see the fun side of many things, this is the "comedy" in its form more puerile and homophobic. The plot is as thin as a supermodel, which would not bother me if the movie was fun. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film there is only one funny line, spoken by the character Louis: "It seems that someone threw a perfectly good white child! In fact, Louis is the only sympathetic character (and that's James and Carl are the kind of irritating and immature men that a sensible woman would run less than a kilometer from, their practical jokes are as comical as the war in Iraq, the character of Susan Wilkins is colorless (it looks Julia Roberts, but lacks charisma) and there is no chemistry between her and Carl, although it may be unfair to blame the actress, since I do not know what I could have done with her, a part so badly written, and the villain is not Funny neither scary nor memorable. <br /> <br /> There is good garbage and bad garbage.This is garbage that definitely should not be recycled.
