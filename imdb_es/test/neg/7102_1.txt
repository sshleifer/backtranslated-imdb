Why Lori Petty was chosen as a tank girl, I'll never know. Her acting as an actress is dull. His voice is grating. It's almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There are several references to "modern pop" in the film, which I found very strange, given that the film was supposed to take place far in the future. Nor would it have been difficult to make this premise interesting. Some better writing would have helped the charges. <br /> <br /> Naomi Watts makes an appearance in her as a tecneknek of good manners. I think they probably should have changed roles. <br /> <br /> I'll never know why someone would like this movie, unless it was a Petty fanatic. <br /> <br /> Try not to see this movie. Total loss of time.
