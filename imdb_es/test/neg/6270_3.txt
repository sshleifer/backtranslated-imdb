Why does C Thomas Howell make these films? Cruise (the only star of Howell) does a great overproduction of WOTW and Howell continues with this effort. <br /> <br /> Where do I start here? Production values ​​- I'll start with the good things. The appearance of some of the scenes in this movie is not so bad as to be honest. The settings are fine in some places and the address is not that bad. <br /> <br /> Script - Terrible. A series of clumsy scenes that could have been placed in the order you want to permeate throughout the film. The number of times the scene vanished in black and resurfaced a second later in the same room was uncountable. A very poor story (but so was the Cruise WOTW) has some guilt, but an abysmal script kills it. <br /> <br /> Special FX - Okay, I do not want to be too harsh here as I imagine the budget was smaller than Cruise's lunch account, but in the general context of the movie the effects are poorly made. Some shots are pretty impressive, mainly shots of destruction away from bridges, Washington, lining. But, in general, "extraterrestrial" machines and tentacles are terrible. In addition, the quality of the camera is blurred in some shots and cuts completely in others. <br /> <br /> Acting: I'm a fan of Howell, but since he's been reduced to acting in these low-budget films, he has succumbed to the "overacting" mistake a long time ago. Watch her performance in The Hitcher and compare her to this movie. There is no comparison. He exaggerates his facial expressions, his arms and legs shaking (where did he get that career style?) And for a final coup, look at the scene where he loses his family's picture. Hysterical. But after saying all that, he's still the best actor shown here. Busey is embarrassed to look and Peter Green (Zed is really dead, baby) mumbles incoherently through his only scene. Honestly, I could not understand a word of what he said, I even tried to enable subtitles in that scene, but the DVD did not have subtitles. This seems to be a real matter of keeping him in the family, since Howell's son, the director's wife and the line producer enter the film. None of them is good. <br /> <br /> Address: not bad, but it's not good either. <br /> <br /> Score - Dismal. <br /> <br /> In general, a lame duck effort that will do nothing for Howell in his attempt to return to the big time. I should take a look at Rourke and try to figure out how he came back to list A, but if he keeps doing things like this, he will not have a race soon enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
