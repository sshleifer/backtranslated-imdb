The name of the DEA agent, Anslinger, is a good in-house joke: this is the name of the former drug czar who almost single-handedly made marijuana illegal. <br /> <br /> Despite this knowledge of the book, the writers continue for farmers to harvest and sell fresh leaves without drying, instead of cured shoots. <br /> <br /> Besides, it's always fun for me that filmmakers can never find real marijuana plants to film. You would think there would be a business that would make fake ones look real to the movie business or maybe they could shoot a couple of scenes in Amsterdam or Switzerland. I guess that's asking too much for the budget. <br /> <br /> Probably the most interesting part of the film is the attempt to cover the notion of what is right and wrong in society and how the law establishes that. line and nevertheless tries to do justice in spite of it. <br /> <br />
