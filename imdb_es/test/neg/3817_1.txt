It's me or all the "horror" movies become nothing more than titties, slapstick and a villain who can not be killed. This movie did not make sense. what happened in the days when a person could escape from the murderer as in a shelter. And at least make the killer a little more realistic. Victor Crowley was the worst killer I've ever seen. It reminded me of a demon begotten between quasimodo and leatherface. It was exaggerated that while Victor was thrown into flames, no one thought about finishing the job. and the ending was the biggest disappointment of all the reminiscences of the end of the soprano. I had to agree with the guy behind me when he let go ... WHAT F ***! If I could give the film a negative score, I would have taken care of it.
