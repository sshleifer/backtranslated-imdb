The title does not make much sense to me. I'm not sure which movie door should not have opened. <br /> <br /> The film begins without incident, with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train carriage. , complete with the sound of the traveling train. In fact, the man's house is a train car, and it has a train sound cassette. The woman leaves, and calls a young woman. The young woman tells her boyfriend, a doctor, that she has been told that her grandmother is sick and that she needs to return to her hometown. She has not been there in thirteen years. <br /> <br /> He came back thirteen years ago. A figure in the shadow enters a house. He caresses a sleeping child, then enters another room and stabs the girl's mother. The girl wakes up, enters her mother's room and finds her dead with a knife in it. She screams, and an arm comes out of nowhere and puts a hand in her mouth. She looks up with fear. That early scene in the killer movie muffled her scream, and the girl's appearance is one of the few effective shots of the movie. <br /> <br /> It does not have much in your favor in the image department. Occasionally, there is a strange use of sound, and there is strange lighting in an attic scene where many of the glass panels are red and blue. <br /> <br /> Back to the present. The young woman arrives at her grandmother's house. An old doctor is there, whom she does not trust, along with the man from the opening scene "Judge" and Kearn, the operator of the city's museum. She does not trust any of them, and it is true that they do not inspire confidence. She is pretty moody throughout the whole movie. She wants to take her grandmother to the hospital. The men of the city want their house, and the operator of the museum wants the things that are in it (his museum is already full of many of the things of the grandmother). Inexplicably, the woman wants to stay in the house. <br /> <br /> The young woman begins to receive phone calls from a man who speaks in a sinister whisper. He makes several threats, and wants her to do things to wake him up. Such scenes are repeated often. Unfortunately, there are so few characters in the movie, that the possibilities of who they could be are limited. Worse, we see from the beginning who is making the phone calls. So, although the young woman does not know (although the caller occasionally falls into her normal voice), the audience always knows: there is no suspense. Each call makes her feel more and more. <br /> <br /> The ending was unexpected for me, so maybe I get points for not going with the obvious, but I'm not sure I did.
