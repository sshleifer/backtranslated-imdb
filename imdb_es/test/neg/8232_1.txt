This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther, who wears metal dentures, bites people in the neck and walks like a chicken without the flutter of his arms. He also thinks it's a chicken. <br /> <br /> It sounds strange, right? Well, for me, the stranger and stranger the person is, the better. The more I gore, the better and so on. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the council deciding if they want to free this maniac from their institution. They mention that he has created some dentures in the jail that he used to bite people in the neck. He also paints like a chicken and THINKS he is a chicken. <br /> <br /> If I had such a patient, there is no way to release it. <br /> <br /> First, Luther goes to the supermarket and attacks an old woman at a bank and walks away. Then, he sneaks into the backseat of a woman's car and she drives all the way home. <br /> <br /> While in the house, Luther ties the woman to the bed. When the daughter of the woman and her daughter's boyfriend arrive home, Luther hides. <br /> <br /> Later, through the film, a policeman approaches the front door and asks for the mother. It can be clearly seen that the daughter is scared and crying, but the officer keeps asking if everything is fine. She replies that everything is fine. The officer finally gets in his car and leaves. If I saw a woman crying constantly and looking scared, I would at least go into the house to do some research. <br /> <br /> The ending is also stupid. While the woman is in the barn, she starts to cackle and makes Luther excited, so he starts walking around waving his arms and cackling like a maniac. She finally shoots him and just sits there for a minute before finally cackling a little more. <br /> <br /> Then the rolls of credits. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most SUPER movies I've seen! NOTHING happens in the woman's house! NOTHING! <br /> <br /> Sometimes I like corny movies, but this really bored me. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Good idea, bad address!
