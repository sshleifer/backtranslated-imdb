This film is about a party organized by the "scary girl" high school. Because of the illogical nature of this kind of films, he gets permission to celebrate the party in a house that used to be a crematorium, a dubious place closed for a long time and locked up. Apparently, the history of this property is one of those secrets of the city that are not mentioned among the right people, although the legend is whispered among young people. <br /> <br /> Why was this crematorium really closed? What really happened there in the past? <br /> <br /> I like these kill-kill-kill movies of supernatural nature, as long as there is something in them that is not copied from another hundred movies. The highlights of this film are a minor stealing "7-11" by distracting the employee with a vivid vision, the changing scene of the "good girl" witnessed by his younger brother, the eventual disappearance of the ugly neighbor who hates the party, the spooky mirror scene and the concept of running water are a barrier against the supernatural; The best part of this film is when the patron of the possessed party dances to BAUHAUS in front of the fireplace; that scene rocks
