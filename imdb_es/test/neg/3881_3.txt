If you are a sensible person and you have seen movies before, you can not tolerate this idiocy for more than 20 minutes. And if you stay there longer, then it will not be because you would wait akshay or paresh (no govinda, please!) But because you value your money too much and want at least a little nap in the luxurious seats of the multiplex. In exchange for the money that was stolen! It's hard to believe that the director who gave us a cult movie like HeraPheri can fall to those levels ... it's fine, it's repetitive, but now it's coming out of all the third-level levels and he expects us to laugh because it has brought us to Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar. ... No, sir, this is not going to work now ... especially with this stupid script of yours! Even comedy films can have meaningful scripts (someone from Lage Raho Munnabhai?). <br /> <br /> Govinda I do not have much to do, so I can not comment ... To Kashar Kumar was boring, Paresh Rawal did some of the worst jokes possible. Lara Dutta had real possibilities to act in this case, but she failed miserably ... the only highlight of the film. (Possibly) is Tanushree's performance! But she is there alone for the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> I do not think this film is worth more space ... (probably not even that much!). So the final warning, do not look at it!
