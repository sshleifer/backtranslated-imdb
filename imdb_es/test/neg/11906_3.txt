There is a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre that became a clich√© chaos for filmmakers who had no idea what the purpose of the story was, or simply did not care. All the hallmarks of his average family film are the youngest and youngest brothers, a grumpy teenager who does not want to move, unfriendly parents who can not see the apparition and, of course, a romantic secondary argument. The film has very little in common with Wilde's original story, which was largely written to make fun of the gothic melodramatic novels that were in vogue at the time. If Wilde saw this version, he would probably laugh, and then, of course, he would write a parody. It can only be expected that the children who saw this soft, mass-produced little daddy discover the ingenuity and brilliance of the original version.
