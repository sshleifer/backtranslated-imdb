I mean, you just have to love the Italian film industry. Somebody came up with a post-doomsday action movie ("Road Warrior") and the Italians were busy for years making one scam after another. Then, another one came up with a successful barbaric movie ("Conan") and the Italians were busy ... eh, see above. <br /> <br /> In addition to many other variations of the theme (one of my favorites is "The barbarians" by Umberto Lenzi, starring the twins Paul) the series Ator was created. And this, the second, is probably the worst (or the best, depending on your point of view). <br /> <br /> Ator is called back into action by his former teacher, who has discovered some kind of nuclear energy. That, of course, has to be protected so that it does not fall into the wrong hands. The old man sends his daughter to Ator, and after some complications, Ator, his partner Tong and the girl return to the castle, which in the meantime has fallen into the hands of some malefactor (of course, an old "classmate" of Ator). ). At some point along the way, the heroic trio forgets the plot and eradicates a worship cult of giant snakes for fun (but not without sacrificing some virgins). Just in time, before the madman loses his temper and kills the wise master, our heroes remember their duties, invent the delta wing and the grenades and save the day. <br /> <br /> Included: terrible performance of all participants (especially O'Keeffe), incredibly hilarious "special effects" (you just have to love the scene of the snake fight, which should be a kind of tribute to the "Bride of the monster"), badly organized fighting scenes, numerous errors of continuity (Ator flies two different hanggliders during the climatic battle, note it, just one example) and a lack of general understanding of the concept of history (cavemen, barbarians "civilized", castle builders, all cast in a movie). <br /> <br /> If, like me, you dedicate yourself to bad movies, this is one of the series you'll see, you'll probably end up in ROTFL. For the records: the third part filmed in Malta is really quite visible. <br /> <br /> Considering the other efforts of Joe D'Amato, this is probably his most entertaining film, since he certainly has not been able to deliver visible horror or erotic movies. . But I have the firm opinion that this was completely by accident. <br /> <br />
