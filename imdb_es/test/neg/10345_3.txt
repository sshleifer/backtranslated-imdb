The idea behind Dead Silence is great: the zombie outbreak occurs during a paranoia talk show. There were many things for this movie. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies made their appearance, everything was lost. <br /> <br /> The movie is ridiculous and only those who have a passion for cheese, the horror of b-flick will enjoy it. The zombies were so stupid! They ran, waving their arms. They looked like a group of people who organized a haunted house for elementary students. <br /> <br /> I know this is a brief review, but I do not see the need to invest much in this. It is a silly movie. You have been warned
