What a waste. John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen deserved better than this. To start from the beginning, JT was terribly wrong in front here. The role required someone who could convince a deranged antihero, someone who could be haunted and defeated. Billy Bob Thornton would have met the requirements, or even Al Pacino, but JT is too alive and seems to be having too much fun. In addition, surely someone who has gone through the mill to the extent that the character of JT had suffered some physical effects. The character presented to the public looked as if it could start as a tight end for the Oakland Raiders. Scarlett felt a little better about her role. Where was the pain and conflict of what surely should have been a worrisome development? And as for the "plot" ... well, none of that makes sense. The characters jump from one mood to another seemingly without cause, and certainly without explanation. The pace of the movie also leaves something to be desired, namely the rhythm. This is a very slow movie, not that it has anything against slow movies, as long as they go somewhere. The pace only accelerates towards the end, when it goes from a slow race to a frantic race to accumulate as many tired clich√©s as possible. In this it is successful, the only thing that is missing is something that involves a small dog. 3 out of 10 for this, only for the performance of Gabriel Macht: he was the only member of the cast that was a) well cast and b) able to convince in his role. In short, a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a couple of hours.
