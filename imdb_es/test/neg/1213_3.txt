I was pleasantly surprised with this. Actually it is quite interesting and attractive. The cast is strong, including Dan Cortese. Brooke Shields has become an actress. Black and White must have really released her, because I've never seen her so skillfully playing a conventional character. If it is marketed well, it could be a medium-sized success.
