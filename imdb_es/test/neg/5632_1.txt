This movie was pure garbage. It is not the worst movie of all. If it broke, the performance was good enough to do the job, but the script was SO out there and so stupid that one kept thinking, "Where did my life go?" Even Vanessa Redgrave ~ whom I love (and that is the reason I saw this) was wasted. Completely wasted She did not even leave an impression. The address was so distant that none of the characters left me much, but seeing Redgrave left nothing. His part was nothing. She was good as an evil boss, but that was all. Do depth and she has given depth to small roles ~ see Venus and Atonement. I would not waste my time and it displeased me to have spent $ 5 on this film ... I wanted it back. There are no returns. Skip the movie. It will only bring you grief ... and boredom.
