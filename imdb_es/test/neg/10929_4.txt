This is a pretty simplistic romance. The girl finds the boy, the girl loves the boy, the girl loses the boy, the girl meets the boy Colleen Moore is the outstanding ingredient of this recipe, which offers a wonderfully varied dramatic / romantic performance that deserves a nominated Oscar. Equally good are the special air combat effects. <br /> <br /> Moore plays a French girl whose mother has handed over her field to a British air squad during the First World War. She is the "daughter of the regiment", loved as a little sister. In this mixture comes a fill for a knocked down steering wheel, Gary Cooper. At first they hate each other, then they love each other, then the entire squad is sent to a suicide mission. Cooper returns but crashes in town and a red cross unit removes him. Moore looks for him, tells him in a hospital that he is dead, then goes through the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they meet. <br /> <br /> It's a little romance, but no more than that. Recommended for fans of Mrs. Moore and Mr. Cooper.
