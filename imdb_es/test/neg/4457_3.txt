Test, if tests were ever needed, that Hammer should have left his vampires firmly in the Victorian era. After all, vampirism has to do with repressed sexuality, so the concept is irrelevant in the 1972 London, with its thirty-odd years that pretend to be rebellious teenagers. <br /> <br /> Remember that, at this time, Hammer was struggling badly. The public had grown tired of the horror of the living room of the 50s and 60s, so the studio was doing everything possible to recover them, including great nudity (LUST FOR A VAMPIRE, et al) and update their characters, none of which apparently worked like Hammer. I was quite resting in the grave just two years later. Shame ... <br /> <br /> But I still have a great fondness for the classic Hammer period of 1957-1965.
