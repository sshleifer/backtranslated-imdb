I wish I knew what to do with a movie like this. It seems to be divided into two parts: sequences of action and personal dramas on the ground. Follow Ashton Kutsher through the swimmer survival school, led by Master Chief Kevin Costner, then to Alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues are held, the last with death. <br /> <br /> I must say that the scenes at La Playa seemed so stereotyped in so many ways that they should be encrusted with barnacles. A typical bar fight between the men of the Navy and the coastguard ("pirates of puddle"). The experienced veteran Timer Costner, who, as a tender for a bar for the elderly says, is "married to the Coast Guard". The older boss who "keeps trying to prove to himself that he's still nineteen." The ex-wife neglected on land to whom Kostner makes a farewell visit. The seemingly sadistic demands put on the swimmers by the instructors, all in search of a higher goal. The talented young man has been affected by a problematic past. <br /> <br /> The problem is that we have seen everything before. If it's Kevin Costner here, it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro in other places. And the climate scene has elements blatantly taken from "The Perfect Storm" and "Dead Calm." None of this is new and none of the old characters and stereotyped situations are handled with originality. <br /> <br /> It works better as a kind of documentary of what happens in the swimmer's school and what might happen next and even that is a bit weak because we do not have much in the way of instruction. It is above all personal conflict, romance and tension by washing. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the US Coast Guard. UU It is rather a noble suit, its official mission is "the safety of life and property in the sea". In time of war, it is transferred to the Department of the Navy and serves in combat functions. In World War II, the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in their ranks. <br /> <br /> But, again, we do not learn much about that. We do not really learn much about anything. The film becomes a succession of visual screens and not much more. A disappointment.
