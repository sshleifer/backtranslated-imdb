A theft movie with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne ... does it sound good on paper? I suspect that it was because someone illuminated the production of this movie, but the final product is terrible! <br /> <br /> The story is boring, the action is boring and, for a movie of only 88 minutes, it seems that it only gets longer. I could feel that my life was fading and I was sure there was something better that I should have been doing ... any paint to look in some dry place? <br /> <br /> I sigh. I'm a big fan of Jean Reno, but what the hell was he thinking when he signed up? There are so many other great action movies around ... go see one of those and let this movie be better forgotten.
