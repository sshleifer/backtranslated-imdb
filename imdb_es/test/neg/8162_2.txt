There is somewhere here the foundations of a decent but routine science fiction story. He is frustrated by several factors. First, the actor is simply horrible. Even the competent actors are horrible. The dialogue is wooden and forced. The plot progresses predictably. This seems less a finished movie than the actors who go through a tour. Extremely disappointing
