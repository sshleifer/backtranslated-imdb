I just watched the movie tonight in a preview and it's a movie just for kids. It does not improve or add to the original Disney movie in any way. There is a Scottish style of Scottish pastiche style, not helped by the weak writing (where the motives are grouped by the palate) and the performance is uneven and, often, uncommitted (in spite of what is read as a decent cast) . I have no problem with the small dog, although there is a certain quality of "Skippy the Bush Kangaroo" (see below) in his shots. <br /> <br /> * For those who do not know, "Skippy" was an Australian children's television series from the 1960s in which the babysitter would be an essential part of all stories. It is said that to make poor Skippy "act", they put an elastic band around his snout, which then tried to remove his legs, it seems that he is communicating with the human actors! Bobby has a similar range and you just do not buy his series of heroic rescues. <br /> <br /> The advice would be to take children from 8 to 12 years old. Under that, they could be scared. On top of that, if they or you like it, good luck, but this is strictly a cardboard cutout movie for the picky. It's a missed opportunity, since there is a real pathos and tenderness in Bobby's story and this movie does not make it.
