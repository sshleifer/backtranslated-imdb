Bored as hell and a kind of movie for girls. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a neurotic woman struggling with the concept of marriage as a commercial agreement, the romantic nature of a one-night stand, the uncertainty and traps of true love. <br /> <br /> Many of the reasons for the story are reminiscent of other recent KST films (for example, the English patient), but they have much less appeal. <br /> <br /> After the first half -now I started checking my watch, wondering if I would get home in time to see Leno on TV. <br /> <br /> I missed "Gladiator" to see this.
