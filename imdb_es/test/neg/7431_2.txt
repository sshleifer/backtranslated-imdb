Robert Downey Jr. with a seventeenth-century wig and dress was enough to make me shudder, but I could not believe that a great actor like Sam Neill participated in this movie. Everything was amazing. I especially like Merivel's "cure" for the crazy. They dance ... and hello presto! Everyone is happy and everyone is better! I guess I just did not like Merivel's character too much. Therefore, watching a full movie about his supposed transition from a prostitution buffoon to a great doctor was exhausting. <br /> <br /> Also, I'm not completely sure, but I did not think the plague and the famous London fire occurred simultaneously.
