First, the title "DAILY" is a LIE. <br /> <br /> Each "Daily Show" program opens with a visual screen image of the date it was made, followed by a break and the opening announcement. On the many days when they are REMOVING a daily program, they slide the tape and OMITATE the date and start with the opening announcement giving the false impression that the program is new. That is a lie. There is no mention of it being a retransmission. And that kind of garbage is just a small indicator of how cunning and deceptive this show is. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is only 4 nights a week. That is not entirely "daily", that is, from Monday to Friday, another deficiency, but one for which I am grateful. <br /> <br /> It is sad to think that many clueless young people use this fake news program as their main, often single, source of news. This leaves them sadly ignorant and much worse, misinformed. <br /> <br /> Although leaning towards the liberal left, politically, this show can be fun at times. However, its veracity is low. Facts and information are often intelligently wrapped to fit the writers' agendas. It is often difficult to tell where the facts end and the fiction and comedy writings begin. The result is previously digested and reinterpreted information designed to persuade and influence. This is called "PROPAGANDA". <br /> <br /> Remote interviews are heavily loaded with editing. <br /> <br /> He really loses me when he hits God and Christians, which happens all too often. However, you will never hear anything vaguely anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> If Jon Stewart and his company attacked anyone other than Christians, it would be considered an offensive outrage. The names in the credits explain the source.
