A barely concealed attempt to push Hulkamania to the film that will become a fan of wrestling. What could be worse than Hogan in the movies? Bad actors in the wrestling ring, and this movie produced both, when Tiny Lester went to WWE that summer in the mother of all the promotional mistakes. See the dictionary in Oops. As a cardholder member of the stupid children of the world paid to see this in theaters, and when I left, I immediately registered at H.A. - Annoynimous Hulkamaniacs. I am proud to say that I have been away from the Hulk for 17 years and since then I have never had a wish. Since this was done to attract more fans to the monster that was the WWE in Hogans, the day one has to wonder if there were more fans like me who resorted to other past times that did not poison the mind like this offense to celluloid. He did it, like for example Russian gas or roulette.
