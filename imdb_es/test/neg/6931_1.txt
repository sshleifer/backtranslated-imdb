This is a piece of the Hollywood product that should never have left a movie. Dialogue without a plausible thought, plot without a point, staging without skill, direction without direction, and acting without the value of a first-year game in high school. The whole cast should have been arrested for acting excessively. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, it's fine!
