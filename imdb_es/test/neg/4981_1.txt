I remember seeing the first trailer of Underdog last March, I also remember at that moment smiling very slightly. Of course it was a corny idea, but I really thought that by the time the concept could work, hell, it could not be worse than disappointed cats and dogs, right? Then, in December and suddenly I remembered the movie, I realized how likely the film was, the fact that it was delayed in the UK made it seem inevitable that it would be terrible, but the horrendous criticism made me realize that It was almost impossible. so the movie is good. Still, I swallowed my feelings and went to see the movie with a friend today. When I entered my screen, I felt mortified. It was the first time I saw a movie with a friend and was the only one on the screen! Little did he know what he was about to endure. Losing to put it blunt is horrible, it really is. Imagine how bad you can think this movie is and then get ready for an even worse movie, that's how pathetic the movie is. Although its goal is to entertain children, it just seems like an embarrassing mess that seems to insult children instead of allowing them to enjoy the movie. The fact that the story is beyond mediocre, the acting is generally poor, and the film feels like a Saturday caricature too long, tired and boring. After a brief five minutes in which I thought that the film could be passable, the film seems to die suddenly and then hobble towards the end already announced. It just amazes me that the film has been released, it's a disgrace to Disney, that half of its direct sequels are better than this! What is even more terrifying is the fact that the ending leaves room for a sequel. <br /> <br /> Therefore, let's start acting (cracks knuckles). Well, let me be honest. Jason Lee is decent, his voice adapts to the canine, and if he had been given a decent script, he could have made the performance work. However, with a script so unreliable, it seems to falter. In many ways it reminded me of Bill Murray in Garfield, Murray did what he could with what he had, but what he had was not enough to make it passable. Then we get into the human actors, and thus most of the atrocious. Alex Neuberger plays Underdog's friend, Jack. My biggest worry is that anyone would take it seriously at an audition. The scene in which he flies with Underdog is perhaps the most critically dignified scene in recent years just because his performance is very poor. Not once did I think he was a real person, in fact, a part of me is still convinced that it was a robot created especially for the movie! James Belushi seems half dead in the film, has nothing to work with, no decent lines, just seems to wander around the set hoping to be relevant to the plot, which the writers try to do towards the end, but do it in such a way. In a bad way, it's laughable. Fortunately, Peter Dinklage is the redeeming factor of the film, he's great like Dr. Barsinister and he seems to be laughing at the role. He steals all the scenes he's in, though that's not hard when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying Patrick Warburton. The rest of the cast is even worse, especially Taylor Momsen, she just needs to end her acting career right now! <br /> <br /> Underdog also fails dramatically in terms of offering something like a funny scene. When the funniest scene involves Underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode anywhere, you know there is something drastically wrong. This could easily be ignored if the movie had a decent action or a good story, unfortunately, the movie is even worse in both terms. The effects are so simple that any scene in which Underdog flies seems absurd, and the dog uses his powers with such little effect that he often forgets that he has superpowers. What's the point of making a movie about a super dog if the damn dog never appears super? The final fight also borders the shame purely because its ten minutes of nothing, the dog flies, other things happen, some things are stirred, all this is irrelevant since this happens for the sake of the things that happen. The script is also unreliable and, at best, the pain is downright horrible. When someone says: "Look, it's a plane, no, it's a bird, it's not a frog ...", yes, you read it well, I just wanted to burst into tears from time to time. Actually, I wanted to leave and I felt compelled to see if it could be lower than that point, this happens near the end, so fortunately not. <br /> <br /> General Underdog becomes the worst movie of 2008 in this early period, and it's actually as bad as last year's epic movie. Fortunately for Underdog, Meet the Spartans arrives soon and I hope it's even worse. Therefore, in case you do not get the point of my criticism, avoid the film at all costs, if you want to see a movie with a dog, see dogs and cats, buy a real dog if necessary, do not see it !
