A couple separates during a vacation. The first scenes lead us to believe that Barney, the character of Jeff Bridges, has kidnapped the girl in an inexplicable but premeditated kidnapping. The film develops some years later, where, despite a new love interest, Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) is determined to resolve his disappearance. <br /> <br /> The story is definitely intriguing, but some really bad decisions have been made during the making of this film, culminating a poor quality work. <br /> <br /> OK, here we go. The scene of the kidnapping, apart from two important continuity errors, there is a point at which Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are forced to perform a small signed pet love ritual that drowns in an excess of sentimentality to the point of nausea . We know that they are in love; The speech "I solemnly swear that I will never leave you" just a few moments before was enough thanks. The Jeff Bridges robot accent is another example. What is that for? Starman is back and it seems that after a decade on the planet, it has become unpleasant. The whole plot can be solved by the introduction of an unnecessary character who, by a lucky twist of fate, has quite miraculous powers of observation. The climatic sequence itself has essentially become much, much better. It is plagued with more discomfort and another blinding continuity error. I could go on, but you have to say something positive. In a section, Kiefer Sutherland is the only one that was saved with a decent enough performance. <br /> <br /> The 1988 original of the same name was recommended (changed from the Dutch title 'Spoorloos' for English-speaking audiences) to me, only for an online rental company to send me this latest version of Hollywood by mistake. I was surprised to discover that both were directed by George Sluizer and I would be interested to know his motivation for the new version. I am reliably and gratefully informed that it is of a much higher quality in all areas, including the plot. Horah for that, but it really does not take much.
