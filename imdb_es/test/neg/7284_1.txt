The only reason why this program did not get a 0 is because one is not available. This show has gone from informative news to a sensationalized trap. I tried to support this show in its decline, because I like stories of human interest and Primetime used to have some very good ones. Unfortunately, on April 21, my opinion about this program and the unethical news programs that participate in it have changed forever. ABC actually recorded a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it until the statute of limitations expired and the parents could not be arrested for the charges they had to face. What made it worse was how ABC swept the whole incident under the carpet; Instead of taking charge and seeking real professional help for these disturbed individuals, they caused some pop psychologists to send severe warnings to the audience about how they should not judge these poor angels so harshly. I was really sick. I hope this revision prevents a person from seeing this research garbage in the future. If he does, I'll be happy. These days, all you can expect from Diane Sawyer and the good folks at Primetime Live are butt-kissing sessions with list A celebrities and covert and praised star acts to the stars. Do not waste the time of your life; You'd better watch an old comedy about Nick in Nite.
