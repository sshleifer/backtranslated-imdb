Larry Bishop, the writer / actor / director, focuses too much on camera, music and visual elements. The film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no other purpose than to bore and irritate the public. The actors experience a bumpy ride, from the beginning to the end of the film, and get trapped in a terrible smoke screen. To hell with the ride. The movie is a bomb. <br /> <br /> The victors present themselves as seasoned watchmen, who seek their own form of justice for what they consider iniquity. They are cyclists, anti-heroes and protagonists. Pistolero, played by Larry Bishop, is the vengeful leader of the pack. The Gent (Michael Madsen) is caught in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis. <br /> <br /> Comanche (Eric Balfour) is loyal, but mysterious. Deuce, made by David Carradine, should have passed the trip, and also the ticket buyers (if you decide to watch the movie, you will regret it, but you will find out why). Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) is a lascivious and poisonous character, completely full of disdain. <br /> <br /> What puzzles me is how this film, with all its continuous ramblings and vulgarities, made someone invest in a Walk that absolutely does not go anywhere. Buyers of tickets, follow my advice: do not pay for the trip. Please, do not make the same mistake as investors. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes, approximately, of the film are confusing and unintelligible. The dialogue, which quickly becomes monologues without meaning, does not make any sense. The whole movie is determined to go nowhere. Poor Dennis Hopper is caught in the middle of a real disaster. He, too, should have passed on the trip. There are decapitated heads, cut throats and naked females fighting. It is clear that Bishop does not know where he is going with the film. He is completely lost. But, at the end of the trip, you simply will not mind. Mama Mia! Stay at home. And, of course, do not take the ride. I rate this movie with 1 out of 10, but this movie is so horrible that it deserves a zero.
