Taylor Deemer Mrs. Drake in English 10 PIB B4 March 31, 2010 <br /> <br /> A shot in the dark <br /> <br /> It is difficult to overcome the movie Heart of Darkness because it is incredibly uninteresting. The book on which this film is based has little action to begin with. So the idea of ​​turning it into a movie seems a totally strange idea, basically guaranteeing a failure. <br /> <br /> Most of the book is about the mental journey of a young sailor named Marlow in a job through the many shadows of the Congo and people in general. I feel that the scriptwriter failed massively to capture the essence of Marlow's travels. The greatest problem of light against darkness was totally lost. That is the main point of the book and when that does not translate into the movie, all that remains are 100 minutes of boredom and monotony. <br /> <br /> This being the case, the question arises, why would someone do this in a movie? An even better question could be asked, who would want to see it? It is absolutely a task to see. If I had not contributed to a grade in my English class, I would never have considered watching the movie. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Heart of Darkness strips away all of its perception and meaning when taken from the pages of the book. The novel is a torture to read up to the last twenty pages or so, but the last thing is that it's a pretty decent book. The film is like a photo in the dark without possibility of reaching the objective. <br /> <br /> How can a book dealing with mental processes and realizations of darkness in a physical and visual sense be portrayed? I feel that it is impossible to show thoughts accurately. Also, I feel that the time difference between the book and the film creates important points that do not seem to accumulate. The novel Heart of Darkness was published in 1902, while the version of the film Heart of Darkness is from 1993. The 91 years between the two may be a reason behind the seemingly different terrains. The novel seems to have much harder conditions, and the film does not portray the prehistoric sensation of the Congo. The Congo, in the film, seems another place, not the dark and inhuman place in which the book paints this configuration. I feel that this eliminates another important element that really contributes to the novel. <br /> <br /> With two of the biggest aspects of the missing story in the movie, the little decency found in the book Heart of Darkness. It is gone. When the controversy of light against darkness is the most important issue, not including it in the film makes it seem like the whole movie will be incredibly useless and it is. It's boring, unattractive and a great waste of time. There is no reason to see it. The book is stripped of any meaning it has. If necessary, for some reason, read the book. Avoid the movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> Cast and credits Marlow: Tim Roth Kurtz: John Malkovich The Russian: Morten Skirts The planned: Phoebe Nicholls <br /> <br /> Directed by: Nicolas Roeg Written by Benedict Fitzgerald, based on the novel by Joseph Conrad Duration: 100 minutes Classification PG 13 (some sexuality and language)
