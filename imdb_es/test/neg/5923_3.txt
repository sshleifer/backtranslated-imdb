I really liked the idea of ​​traveling between dimensions, and I even liked the tension of Wade / Quinn in the first episodes. Some of the worlds they created gave the main characters very interesting backgrounds for their stories. However, as the show progressed there were more silly disputes among friends and less a true bond. There was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension. And each world had one of the characters falling in love. The writing became boring and everything was too exaggerated. Too bad it would have been nice to have a very close band of friends (to Star Wars) who traveled to different dimensions on television for several years, instead of a tired band of pickers.
