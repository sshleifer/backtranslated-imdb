The first movie was quite current and had fun times, this movie does not have exactly the same standard. Calvin Palmer (Ice Cube) is still trying to keep his barbershop running, but this is not only against the stylist Gina (Queen Latifah) with a beauty salon next door, but a chain of hairdressers called Nappy Cutz opens on the Street. Calvin, along with his co-workers and friends Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Terri (Eve) and Isaac Rosenberg (Troy Garity), are doing everything possible to keep regular customers arriving and, ultimately, for your business that runs against the competition. Also starring Michael Ealy as Ricky Nash, Leonard Earl Howze as Dinka, Harry Lennix as Quentin Leroux, Robert Wisdom as Alderman Brown, Jazsmin Lewis as Jennifer, Kenan Thompson as Kenard and Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon as Kenard as Loretta. I did not like this movie as much as the first because of the unnecessary flashbacks about Eddie, and it's not that clever, I just got bored. Good!
