There is a good story well hidden and never used! <br /> <br /> The film is short and depends too much on action and thematic photography; In some way, the character and development of history have been forgotten. What remains is confusing and superficial. <br /> <br /> Turn off your brain and note: you will probably find that time goes by quite quickly, but unless you are the type of person who finds the deep and meaningful soaps you will not get real satisfaction with this movie. <br /> <br /> Look only if you have nothing better to do and only if someone else pays for the rental of the video.
