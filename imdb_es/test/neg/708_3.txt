This movie was difficult for me to see it. Stan seemed very old and sick compared to what he remembered, and Ollie was heavier than he remembered in another movie. However, the most difficult were the gaps in the script / production where I found myself wondering: "How did you get here?" It took almost half of the movie before I could deal with the dubbing of non-American actors, that was also a distraction. <br /> <br /> Although I miss great actors like Laurel and Hardy, will there ever be Great actors like those from the time of the old studio. - This movie helps me understand why actors sometimes "retire" at their best.
