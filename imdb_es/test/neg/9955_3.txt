There are so many holes in the plot that it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and they just did it together. I do not know much about George Zucco, but I've seen him in two movies. Obviously, he has been chosen as the loving father, crazy scientist, vampire. He looks so ordinary. I'm surprised that it ends up in the genre. This is typical: "I will create monsters that can be used to fight like an army." By transferring wolf blood (or coyote) to his contracted hand, it turns him into a werewolf. Glen Strange, who was one of Karloff's successors as Frankenstein's monster, plays the kind and lovable hired man who is a victim because he trusts the mad doctor. At the beginning, the scientist can control when Petro (his name) can be transformed. But, like the invisible man, he suddenly begins to transform on his own and becomes a responsibility. There's a little love story about the daughter and a reporter with a kind of high-pitched voice (Golly Miss Brooks). She wants to leave but her father, the doctor, will not allow it. He is also driven by a group of his peers who made fun of his research before and now will have satisfaction. The way he plans to embarrass or kill them is quite implausible and depends a lot on Petro and the boys sitting waiting to be attacked. It is not a very good movie. The strong point is the atmosphere of the forests while people and monsters roam around the Spanish moss. Once again, the townspeople are a bunch of imbeciles, who seem to have escaped from a bad west. One thing that stayed with me was that a little girl is the first victim and that seems unusual for a movie of this era. There is also an old woman who smokes pipe and knows about werewolves, but nobody listens to her.
