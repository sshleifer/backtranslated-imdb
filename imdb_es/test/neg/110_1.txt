I just finished watching this movie and I'm disappointed to say that I did not enjoy it a bit. It is very slow, slow and uninteresting. This Harry Potter child plays a shy teenager with a rude mother, and then one day, the rude mother tells the girl to look for a job to accommodate an old man who apparently has no place to live, has begun to live with your family and that's why the child goes to work for an old woman. And this old woman who lives alone teaches her about girls, driving a car and life! I could not see how an 18-year-old enjoys spending time with a horrible woman in his 80s. I'm sorry if my comments about this movie have bothered people who might have enjoyed it, I could be wrong since I am not British and may not understand the social and their family structure and their lifestyle. Especially the film is made for the British public.
