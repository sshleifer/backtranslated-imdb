This movie was not very well directed. They almost completely ignored the book. I guess they were trying to save time. The only positive aspect of me was that the actor who played Finny was cute. Some of the dialogues between the main characters appeared as a small gay, which was not the case in the book. Once again important parts of the book were removed. You lost the general effect, it was not as disturbing as the book and you left me with a severe fault. Also the strong but brief language was very unnecessary. I was also surprised (not pleasantly) by a new character that was not in any part of the book. One of my favorite characters (leper) was misunderstood and portrayed. It seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper in the book. Especially disappointing.
