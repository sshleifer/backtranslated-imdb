The trailer is so deceptive ... I thought this would be a good movie ... What was the point of bringing the women of Hong Kong to be killed? They could have done it in Paris. And the first half hour: <br /> <br /> - You love me! <br /> <br /> -No, no! -You love Me! <br /> <br /> -No, no! -You love Me! <br /> <br /> -No, I do not. Repeat it 100 times ... then ... Well, I do not love you ... So I shoot you! : D So here's the reason why movie piracy is a good thing! Imagine if I had given money for this torture! Sorry for the time I lost seeing it ... the filmmakers should pay me <br /> <br /> for the inconvenience ... The worst movie I've seen ...
