I was so excited to see the cast in this movie that I was completely surprised at how wrong this movie was. I love John Voight but I have no idea what possessed him to be part of this parody. Biblical accuracy was completely non-existent and, honestly, I could not bear to watch the movie with my children. My children were amazed because even THEY know that Lot did not even think of it when Noah was building the ark. I think NBC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing producers to mock the Word and cause even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is ... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE !!! I have considered burning my copy but I have every intention of writing to the producers and sending them the references of the Scriptures that they SHOULD READ before making this film!
