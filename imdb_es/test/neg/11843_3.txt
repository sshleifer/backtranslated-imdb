I bought a DVD collection (9 movies for 10 euros) where this was included. It turned out to be the "uncut version" whatever that means. In addition to the low average quality and the short scenes, there was something that was really strange: the scene of soft sex. It started with a close-up of 2 larger breasts. After about 2 minutes, I had an expression on my face that fit the term "boooooooooooooring!" quite perfectly 7.5 minutes of not bouncing the concrete like the tits (at this point, the term breasts is a bad choice) is far from entertainment. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was more like "people are not / that". / Stupid, right? <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the DVD was scratched and I recovered my money.
