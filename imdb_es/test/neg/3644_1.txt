I have tried to like this program, I have really done it, but I can not find a reason why someone likes it. The story lines are weak, the acting is weak and incredible. Each member of the cast seems to have been picked up from the street at random. And I think the whole show is just a vehicle for Jamie Lynn Spears to go to the movies. Each episode shows Zoey as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every guy wants to leave. She is always perfect and nobody is like that in real life. How can people relate to a character that is just a Barbie doll? Jamie Lynn's performance is fair, but she is not an actress strong enough to have the lead role in a series. All the fans of the show are young girls who do not know anything better. I'm sorry if you think my comments are too hard, but if you can find a significant and deep moment in this series that does not go quickly to a beach party, accept my opinions and find something worth seeing.
