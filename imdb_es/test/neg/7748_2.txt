This film had a very complicated plot and a very artificial scenario, which, frankly, I could not follow, which is surprising, since the performance and dialogue could only have been the product of the writing of a kindergarten student. If you like Kathy Ireland, then maybe you want to see this. The movie was probably made as a vehicle to try to take her to Hollywood, but if that was her goal, she would have to say that I hope she has not invested too much money in her production.
