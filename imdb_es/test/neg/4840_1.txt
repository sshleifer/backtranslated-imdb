The only reason I rented this movie was that Val Kilmer rarely stars in a bad movie. Of course, there is a first time for everything. In many ways, this film shows that oats are not as easy to make as we think, especially by foreign directors. Probably, the only one who managed it was Sergio Leone, but even his films lacked something indefinitely innate for our psyche and American style. The American actors in Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda helped. Now I can see why they changed the original title of "Summer Love" to "Dead Man's Bounty". That in itself tells me that the producers and the director did not have any basic knowledge about a western other than those standard scenes of filming and violent themes. I suppose we can say the same thing about American directors trying to make a Polish film while failing miserably in the process.
