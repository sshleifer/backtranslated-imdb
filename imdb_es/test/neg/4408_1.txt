I lost my time? This is a very pretentious movie. At first, you will think that something is happening, but when about 30 minutes pass, you realize that nothing is happening. I waited another 20 minutes and, by then, I was so frustrated that I started reading reviews on IMDb and I realized that the director had lost precious time with so many people. <br /> <br /> Unbelievably boring movie without sense. Keep away. So many good soundtracks. I'll give a point for the joke of the police inspector because that worked for me. I laughed for a long time but otherwise a very bad movie. Stay away.1 out of 10.
