It was (foolishly) with some degree of enthusiasm that I sat down to see what a friend had promised would be the worst / best cinematic experience of my life, the mighty 'Roller blade 7'. 2 years later and I'm still in therapy. Oh yes, my dear friends, REALLY IS THE BAD. Obviously, they got about 40 minutes of images in the can and then decided to use that image in an interminable and repeated way to achieve a brain numb effect. My only fear of the kind of post-apocalyptic world presented in this turkey is that somehow, somehow, a trace of this abomination will survive. Truly, the living would envy the dead.
