If you have ever wanted to know more about taxi drivers, this is an excellent movie to watch, just for informational purposes. I can only hear it now, "Wait, just wait a second! Why do not we follow a taxi driver all day?" Taxi drivers are fun, and so are the people they meet, and they just talk to each other for just a couple of minutes, so the other actors should be cheap! Harry, you take care of the production, Joan, you have material, Brian, gather some actors and we'll all meet here tomorrow to start filming! " <br /> <br /> The first 90% of the movie could not have been worse if that had happened. At least without any planning, there is always the element of surprise. Some of Jim Carrey's movies have things added as they go and they always do well at the box office. The problem here is that the first 90% is pretty well programmed, and it stinks a lot. Paul Dillon plays the taxi driver in Chicago who is working all day. We almost see what he sees. People get in and out of their car and he drives around the city. He talks to these people for a few seconds and then we have more people. <br /> <br /> I admit, there were a couple of funny snippets here and there. A religious family tries to convince the taxi driver to go to church with him, takes a pregnant woman and her husband to the hospital, separates a rich businessman from his girlfriend, a poor girlfriend from her boyfriend and takes to the house to a rape victim. I suppose the moral of the film is that a taxi driver is more than a taxi driver and has a wider sphere of influence in the lives of his passengers than you might think originally. For some people, it is only a means to get from here to there, but for others, their very common words help to change the direction of their lives. <br /> <br /> The last passenger of the day is used to try to make sense of the rest of the movie, and to a certain extent it succeeds. I had a bit of that regret on the deathbed, where the good majority of the movie sucks and then, in the end, it tries to improve everything by one or two changes. I was not very impressed with the film in general, but there were some fragments and pieces that were worth seeing again. As for the actors, Paul Dillon is. John Cusack, Gillian Anderson and Julianne Moore are in this, for about 30 seconds each, but do not look at them for any of them or you will surely be disappointed. I will give the other people who have committed some credit that it is not their ordinary movie they have produced here, but it was not a very good one either. There simply was not enough material to keep you going for an hour and a half. It was a decent effort, but it did not fail the same.
