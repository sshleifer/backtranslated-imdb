If you feel like laughing at a really bad movie (bad in the way that it can only be Ken Russell at its worst), you should try this one. It makes you feel like you've just landed in a .25 porn booth, and you can smell the urine on the floor. Kathleen Turner strutting with a blonde wig and likes to "pretend" that she is a two-bit prostitute (she really does have a good solid job in the garment industry and has been hurt so much by men that this is the only way she can be connected), and Tony Perkins plays a hysterical "priest" who may be willing to kill her (another movie that ends with Tony Perkins in the drag). Annie Potts appears and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit, reason enough to hate this movie. Perverts will love sex scenes, so rent the unrated version in the RED box so you can watch Turner give Billy a sample of his club (I had to stop the VCR until we stopped laughing).
