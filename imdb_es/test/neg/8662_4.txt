I began to have a critical vision of this adaptation in the first few minutes, but as a dedicated fan of Jane Austen I persevered to the end ... However, this is not a program I would recommend to someone who is not familiar with their work. Do not think that it does justice to the book, nor does it make television particularly entertaining in its own right. There was something in this adaptation that lacked credibility: many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic appearance and it seemed to me that the performance was, at times, poor. There is no doubt that all the actors were very attractive, but this did not provide enough variety to create really diverse and memorable characters. It was too static to be completely located in the same place and miss the return to Fanny's house, which is one of the most interesting parts of the story. The best actor was Blake Ritson, who captured very well the health of Edmund, and the Crawfords were also chosen. I like Billie Piper as an actress, but this role was not adapted to her and was much better played by Frances O'Connor in the 1999 version, which generally gave a much more subtle and convincing performance. Jane Austen's adaptations will always provide a love story that will make you feel good, but unfortunately, this is one of the worst I've seen.
