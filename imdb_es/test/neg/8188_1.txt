The whole act of Joe Rogan is blasphemy. He is a marijuana smoker who entered Fear Factor, thinking it was a joke. He said he would encourage people because he did not know how stupid people were going to be. The producers of the show he explained explained that they were going to play jokes on the unsuspecting competitors to see how far they would go. The level of evil involved is a little twisted. Mr. Rogan's special is only filled with comments from someone who is too good for normal human beings. I discovered that he was offensive and his more talented comedians, like Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock, could hear him. Rogan even does a set of five minutes on the word N. In general, ignore this special.
