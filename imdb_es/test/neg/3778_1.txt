In the last 5 years I have rented some bad movies ... completely on purpose. Look, I aspire to be a film critic, and as we all know, there are horrible movies that are released every year. Anyway, about 3 months ago I rented this one. I watched him all the time ... and I cried profusely. This is one of those movies that is so bad that it makes you want to throw up. Actually it put a feeling of discomfort in my stomach. I've seen a lot of bad movies (Mystery Science Theater 3000, anyone?), But this one takes the cake. The plot was difficult to follow, the lighting horrible and the sounds almost inaudible. If there was a negative rating on the scale here, this movie would be at -11 for me. This may seem strange, but I highly recommend it. It's something you have to see for yourself ... but do not say I did not warn you. I do not think this revision could be more precise, so I'm done. <br /> <br />
