No movie I've seen before has come close to being as boring and stupid as this piece of garbage. And I've always been a big fan of the B movies. After seeing this total piece of junk, I can honestly say that this is not even close to being a B movie. <br /> <br /> Nobody in this movie could act if his life depended on it. The script is so stupid that I do not think I've heard anyone talk like that in my life. The writer should spend a few years studying real life people to see how they act and talk, even then they could not make a movie that can be seen because it is so obvious that no one involved in this film has a talent for driving. them at all <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie with a digital camera and some monstrous toys. Also, forget the sensual scenes, the women in the leather suits are so grotesque, that before you would vomit and you would not turn on!
