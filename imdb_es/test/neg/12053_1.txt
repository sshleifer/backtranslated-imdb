Yes, I bought camping blood and I wasted about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money in this crap, I mean I did not expect an incredible movie, judging from the cover, I really did not expect anything good, but at least no boobies in the first 3 seconds (I do not complain about the pikemen ...) I'm complaining about what the hell does that have to do? this movie should have been kept in the handheld camera at home as a joke ... suck ... why was the blood more brown and like that blood really? ... cheap, I tell you, I mean that not everyone was in color they were just dyed yellow, and another thing that made me die laughing at this sad excuse for a movie was the fact that they tried to pretend that the clown was a woman all the time, although she is clearly a short-haired, flat-chested black man. ... someone noticed that the only special effect in this movie was a slow jump ... it was also poor, and the dissolution effect you can find in many basic PC programs like ... powerpoint ... this movie hits
