This is a bit slow for a horror movie, but the quality is better than what one would expect from a director's only effort in IMDb. The camera work and the lighting were surprisingly good, and the acting? although variable ?? It is better than what is often found in Indie genre films. <br /> <br /> As a protagonist, Robert Field is quite rigid, which is especially unfortunate given that his character, Claude, is the narrator of the film, as well as the center of His action. However, was the entry of Christopher (Brandon deSpain) that I considered the turning point of this film? And not in a good way. A clumsy turn is introduced, and the slow movement becomes extensive and too verbose. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Pete Barker is always entertaining like Father William. It is the easy stand-out in what is a fairly common offer. While the first half hour caught my eye, I ended up feeling rather disappointed in the way things developed.
