The original review I had planned for this movie was maybe a bit too harsh, so I'm going to start with the good: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable pizzeria and pizza movie, the kind you see with a good group of people when the Mood is light and nobody really focuses on the movie. The visual elements are beautiful, and it's fun, in parts. But the horror, my friends, is not. I made the mistake of seeing him waiting for something to shake with all the lights off. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I will offer you a list of alternative recommendations. (That's a serious offer, by the way.) Real horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why bother making a movie "based" on a classic story if you do not even try? To stay true to the sensation, sensation, tone or theme of the original? Listen carefully between lines of poorly written dialogue and you will hear the slow rotation of Washington Irving rolling in his grave. I'll even accept the detective bit of the big city, but ... Ricci drawing spells around the bed? Come now. Not only is there nothing vaguely like this in "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," but it is also historical BUNK. I do not care what neopagan ax you have to grind, but in the eighteenth century, "witchcraft" meant selling your soul to the devil in exchange for diabolical powers; all this fluffy approach to the witchcraft of the white witch goddess "an'-it-none" for witchcraft goes back, historically, as far as the British invasion. (Interested parties in real old-school pagan practices refer to "The Golden Bough" by James Frazer, if you do not believe me). This creates such a discordant element in the context of the film that the very frame of the Sleepy The hollow legend is shattered. So we end up with a totally different story. If that was Burton's idea, I would like you to let us know in advance. Also, I wish I had a better story than I could see here. And he could have completely abandoned Irving's pretensions. And, in any case, the movie is not scary. Not even once. No way. The deformed tree approached, but was more than compensated for by the ridiculous effect of the Hessian farce. And finally, yes, I also wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God clearly never wanted her to be blonde.
