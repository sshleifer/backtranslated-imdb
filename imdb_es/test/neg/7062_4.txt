Some of the first talkies survived to become classics. "The Squall" of 1929 is a classic, but not the way it was intended. Of melodramatic history and performance, today it seems ridiculous, particularly the casting of Myrna Loy as Nubi, a seductive gypsy. Imagine Nora Charles breaking up a young couple and leading a young man to steal. Outrageous! However, as many people know, when Loy first came to Hollywood, he made some of these exotic seductive roles. <br /> <br /> Based on a work, "The Squall" refers to the aforementioned gypsy who in the movie Now is in Hungary (Spain in the play), fleeing from his cruel teacher and inviting himself to the house of the Lajos family (Richard Tucker and Alice Joyce), basically appearing at the door. One by one, Nubi seduces the men of the family and the farm by speaking in his pidgin in English ("Nubi is not bad! Nubi does not do anything wrong!") And drops clues about good gifts. The son of the family, Paul (Carroll Nye) is engaged to the beautiful Irma (Loretta Young) and can not wait to marry her. Loses interest when he meets Nubi. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the lovely Alice Joyce, Zasu Pitts as a woman living in the house and the incredibly beautiful Loretta Young, the acting is uniformly horrible. Loy keeps the characteristics of his character: bad English, whining and hysteria. With her dark makeup, her peasant dress and her curly hair, she is not only beautiful, but since the 1980s, she is quite modern, although Richard Tucker puts the back of his hand on her forehead and reminds us that we are coming out of the silences. Br /> <br /> Robert Osborne at TCM commented that this movie is one of his secret pleasures. While it's deliciously bad, it's not bad enough to sit down again. It's just bad, but it's a great example of how far we've come and, if someone had not realized Myrna Loy's sense of humor, how limited her wonderful career could have been.
