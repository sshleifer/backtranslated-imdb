Before starting to see if this movie is worth it or not, I must inform you that I have never seen another adaptation of Carmen, so if you are looking for a review of how it is classified among others, this might not be very useful. for you. <br /> <br /> The only time I met Carmen was on the car stereo when I was driving through Spain on a family vacation when I was a teenager. I did not pay much attention because I did not like opera at the time and I did not know any better. History has existed for about 150 years. Do I feel like I've lost myself after watching this movie? Yes, mainly due to the plot, but also because if all the actresses who played Carmen resembled Paz Vega, I would have all the adaptations happily in my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Directed by Vicente Aranda (who also co-rewrote the story with Joaquim Jordà), the story is told through the eyes of the original author, Prosper Mérimée, a French writer who made his way through of nineteenth-century Spain. He meets José (Leonardo Sbaraglia), a delinquent soldier and one of the many men who fall in love with Carmen (Paz Vega), a sensual, seductive and dazzling gypsy woman, who has the mouth of the devil, the temperament of a bull ' and that imprudently leads men to their doom. The moment she meets José, she is attracted by her distant behavior. But she hooks it, rolls it up and lets it go, many times. Until one day, Jose is wanted for murder. Carmen convinces him to join his gang of gypsy smugglers. It seems that they are accommodating, she has fallen in love with him, but she knows the charming Escamillo, the bullfighter. Can Joseph keep his jealousy under control, or does that destroy him? <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful and seductive story, something that resembles, almost, a plot of Shakespearian or Ovid, with representations of an immense passion and emotion that can make or break us and transform us to do things outside of place. . It is poetic, ardent, and above all, horny. I was hanging, I did not know in what way I was going to turn. I always hoped that José could change Carmen's dirty ways. I will not tell you if he succeeded or not. <br /> <br /> The previous synopsis is what I got out of the movie, but I was not impressed by the film itself. It was only after I saw him that I delved a little deeper into the story and I realized the great opportunity that Aranda had had when retelling the Mérimée classic. It was a shallow, horny drama mistake that saw Paz Vega spend most of the time partially or completely naked (not that I complain about this in particular!). <br /> <br /> First of all, the performance was poor. I was not impressed by Sbaraglia like José. I'm still not sure if he was a weak actor or if Joseph was supposed to be a weak character, I have not read the book. He is supposed to be a man with a burning desire for Carmen, but he spends most of his time looking confused, jealous and a little weak. Paz Vega was a little better than Carmen. I was convinced by her hardened and evil character, although I have seen more convincing performances of her in other films, such as Zapping and Lucia and El Sexo. It seems too pretty to play a gypsy woman (not that I have run into many Andalusian gypsies), so, in a way, the paper was not very suitable for her. The other actors in the movie were not great either. They seemed to do everything by halves. The story is passionate, emotional ?? They seemed half-arsed, as if they could not wait to take off the tight nineteenth-century suits they wore. <br /> <br /> However, I was impressed with the costumes, one of the redeeming factors of the film. I like the Spanish culture, I liked the uniforms of the soldiers, the top hats and the flamenco dresses of women. They adjusted the time well. That's all I can really say about that. Sorry, going back to the reviews. <br /> <br /> The script, as it was said before, was rewritten by Vicente Aranda and Joaquim Jordà, and it became so bad, that it would leave Mérimée in his grave. It was boring. He did not make better use of Jose's intense passion for Carmen (or maybe it was just the performance). There were lines of cheese stacked one on top of the other, connotations of Satan and devil everywhere, among the millions of bad words. I know Spaniards are partial to bad words, but the movie was full of whore, 'whore', literally on every line. Maybe it was realistic in nineteenth-century Seville, but history itself did not need it. <br /> <br /> The editing and the work of the camera were boring and ordinary. There was only one bit that I really liked, and that was when the camera follows a fly close-up in the air, which falls on Carmen's face. That was good. But the rest? Boring. <br /> <br /> To conclude, it is sad to see that a great story is wasted with an unconvincing performance and direction. If you are a literature teacher, let your class see this adaptation to get an idea of ​​the story. However, only half the male of the class will pay any interest for the film, thanks to Paz Vega. Otherwise, stick to the opera version (although I hate musicals). I give this movie 4, just for the fact that I love the story. And Peace Vega!
