Too bad Mike Meyers chose this for his dramatic debut. It seems that this film was made by a committee that could not decide if it was a comedy, drama, suspense or science fiction. It starts as playful, then darkens quickly, and then in the end, apparently shortly after one of the main characters has been killed, the whole family is standing in the backyard laughing at something. It is totally strange and impossible to put together. The acting is extremely unequal, since the older professionals attract their attention, and then the younger and less experienced actors seem to be in a high school work. This movie showed me that it is probably harder to make a good movie than it is from the truly professional food we see in the art and premiere houses. This would be a good movie for a film class to analyze. Argument, character, theme, consistency: all are defective or missing in this movie.
