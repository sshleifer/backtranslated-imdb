Look, do not get me wrong. I love independent films, but COME TO PUT! I could barely sit through that without wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent and turned something that could have been fine into a fucking nightmare. I'm a punk enthusiast and even music sucks. the acting was shit. <br /> <br /> I'm usually a bleeding heart for these low budget movies, but this one, this one did not even try. Please, do not waste your precious time and money. I'm sorry to be so hard but let's go! He crawled and went on and on and on. Remember when the kids got into that party with the weird cupcakes and the watermelon martinis? How did they mix? It made me frustrated how they could go anywhere they wanted and get in trouble and have sex and a "meaningful conversation" with whoever they wanted. I know I'm talking, but my mind is full of everything I hated about this movie.
