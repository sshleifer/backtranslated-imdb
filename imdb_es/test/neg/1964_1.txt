Jack Frost 2 was a horrible, terrible and sadly pathetic excuse for a sequel to a great movie. The original was a low-budget horror film and comedy about a murdered man who became a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste. And the snowman was killing people, and avoiding dryers like the plague. This, however, was far from the quality of the original. It seems that this even had a lower budget because, for some reason, after an hour in this movie, I still had not seen the snowman. Some revenge that he is receiving if he is always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voice and a bit of the coldness in which he rests to give animation to the character. Disappointing to any belief, even for a bad movie fan.
