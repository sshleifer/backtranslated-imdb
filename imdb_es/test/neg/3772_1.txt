This film is an incredibly self-indulgent piece of character that assumes that the mere impression of a story is as good as a true story. It was absolutely painful to watch and if I had not been dragged to buy the DVD due to John Travolta and the positive buzz, I would not have finished watching it. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks something that resembles an interesting premise and seems to depend on a heavy (and, frankly, heavy-handed) characterization. There is a scene of altercation between Purslane and Bobby Long in which a television is destroyed that, when reproduced, is incredibly flaccid and untimely. <br /> <br /> I took care less and less of the characters like me seen. It was probably very funny, from the point of view of the film school, to do it. But it's very boring to watch. An indulgent and pretentious film school project in which you should not spend money.
