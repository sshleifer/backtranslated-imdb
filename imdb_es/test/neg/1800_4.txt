Review of the film The Heart of Darkness The heart of the darkness of Joseph Conrad is quite dark, deep and very deep. I should say that reading the novel is much better than the movie. The character of Mr. Kurtz, played by John Malcovik, was totally the wrong actor to play the part. It fits in the character of "Of mice and men". The film left aside the key parts that I consider important to obtain the true message of the story. <br /> <br /> The movie is badly edited. It shows a lot of unimportant and annoying flashes. In the novel it has an atmosphere of suspense, but in the film it lacks that kind of feeling. In the book there is so much left to the imagination of the reader. For example, when Marlow spent hours and days without time waiting for rivets and the whole scene was left out of the movie. In the novel, Marlow waited a long time for the rivets to come and fix her boat. This was a great source of uselessness in the novel. The movie added more parts that were useless and that did not make sense. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz broke the monkey's neck and killed him. That guy just ruined everything, it did not make any sense to me at all. So my suggestion is that you do not see the movie, just read the book. You will understand more and you will have a better interpretation of the story. <br /> <br /> ~ Chris C.
