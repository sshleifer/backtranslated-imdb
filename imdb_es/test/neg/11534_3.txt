As a Henriksen fan (I liked the "Millennium" series) and, of course, from Lamas "Renegades" by Lorenzo, I expected at least SOMETHING from this movie. Unfortunately, the plot is predictable, the performance is bad and the computer graphics used for most of the stunts do not work. Sometimes it even seems that they have captured some shots of Microsoft Flight Simulator. <br /> <br /> The cinematography also stinks. The unnecessary work of the camera at first only subtracts value (from the cheesy dialogue) and gives the film an economic aspect, made for video. It works on hip-hop movies and Jet Li movies, but it seems out of place in this movie. <br /> <br /> I would have liked this movie 10 years ago. I was 11 years old then.
