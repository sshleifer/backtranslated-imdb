When a movie called Hell Ride is released, a certain amount of biker clich√©s is expected. With names of characters like "Pistolero", "Comanche" and "The Gent", I prepared for the worst and that gave me a punch in the face. The dialogue, the soundtrack and the recording style are standard for motorcyclist films. The dusty desert was tarnished by the heat as bicycles moved along the road while "CC Rider" plays and talks about sex and violence. Yawn! The three tracks were just ridiculous and incredible. Seeing old men like Bishop and Madsen (in a ruffled shirt) on a dusty strip of desert road reminded me of two men desperately trying to relive their youth. Poor Eric Balfour did his best but with so little material he got lost. Even an appearance of Dennis Hopper in full swing of Easy Rider, could not save it. And let's talk about the store we bought, okay? Many have compared this with Tarantino's work. It is not even close. What makes Tarantino's work so brilliant is that he knows he's on top, so he just pulls out the balls and takes it as far as possible. Bishop took this film so seriously that it became nothing more than a poor copy of the exploitation genre.
