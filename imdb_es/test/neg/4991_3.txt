When I became a father for the first time about 5.5 years ago, I was prepared for many of the sacrifices I had to make. I knew that I would have to change my diapers and take them to swimming lessons and attend many parades of Santa Claus, but I was not prepared for the kind of sacrifice I did the night before. This, in my humble opinion, is a cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> The loser is bad. Karate Dog is not all bad, but it makes The Shaggy Dog feel like Pulp Fiction. If Underdog was a television show, I would recommend you do it. Even the presence of Puddy and the voice of Banky Edwards can not save him. Arc. Wow <br /> <br /> They were also the best 80 minutes I've enjoyed. James was sitting to the right of me and Michelle to the left, and I spent more time watching his reaction as he spoke, muttering that looking at the screen. At 5 and 3 years old, they were the target audience, and this movie nailed it. There is a scene in which Underdog belches loudly in the face of another dog and Michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured in a movie. When Underdog was flying into outer space, James was literally on the edge of his seat, hypnotized. The children loved Underdog, and that's why I was there. That's what the previous night was about. <br /> <br /> Unless you are accompanying someone under the age of ten, you do not have to waste a second of your life watching this brutal movie. But if he wants to kill 80 minutes with his four-year-old son, I will not judge him. I had a great time.
