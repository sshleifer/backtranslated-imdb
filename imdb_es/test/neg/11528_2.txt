What a clunker! <br /> <br /> MUST have been made for TV or Cable. <br /> <br /> Look: forget the script, forget about the bunch of forgettable actors. Excuse me? Continuity? The NSA / NIA / whatever or whoever it is (an agent) takes off in an F16 - it shows up in an F18 and its guts is asserted and, later, the plane shown in the shoot is an F4 Phantom Oooh, I wish I could be so arrogant. <br /> <br /> Aside from the male actors (!?) the women are WASPS: blue eyes and long legs and, eventually, they cry for the heroes that save them. Even when a solid weld could save most of the cosmo-astro-nauts, the blond drops the welding tool. Duh! <br /> <br /> Like an SF movie one in ten. As a movie per se: 1/2 (that's half a point). They should have left the space station and headed for Mars. <br /> <br /> The main raspberries.
