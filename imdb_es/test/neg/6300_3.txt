The costumes are extravagant and it is fun to see the landscape of the interior of Australia, but there is an advantage in this story, a negative advantage, over the drag queens. I particularly noticed that in the character of Terrence Stamp, "Ralph Bernadette Bassenger". Maybe that was appropriate since there is nothing that looks like a "good boy" about Ralph-Bernadette and his group of "queens". <br /> <br /> Once again, we get a strong liberal bent that says anything goes and if you're not "with that" or, in this case, pro-homosexual, then you're a homophobe. (Panting!) <br /> <br /> What is really disturbing is the end when a child goes with his father to "alternative lifestyle" and embraces his gay lifestyle, not because it fits the history but to the agenda. Of the people who wrote the script. Regrettable.
