I guess only a select number of audience members were really interested in seeing how a male con man works in New York, but he would be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating patchwork technique and deliberately muted sound recording in showing here The fact that these inherent "flaws" were the direct result of the inexpensive experimental / clandestine / experimental nature of the film is, otherwise, not important. Anyway, for those who want it, the film presents a wide masculine nudity and Joe Dallesandro, understandably, became an underground. and gay ?? icon! <br /> <br /> The episodic structure that shows the daily routine of the swindling protagonist offers a couple of slightly interesting scenes: his encounter with (and eventually posing for) an eccentric elderly artist; In which Dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and delineates his particular mode of operation to a couple of possible "colleagues", including perhaps the most unlikely of swindlers? A nerd with glasses! Perhaps fortunately, the movie lasted only 89 minutes against IMDb's claim that its full length is 105 (but the latter may well be an error)! <br /> <br /> I had seen some of Warhol's other 'movies' and this is definitely not as satisfying as the most tolerable example I have found so far, BAD (1977), and only slightly better than Me. like MY HUSTLER (1965), which was mostly a tension to sit on. The fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy was not a good omen, but as the saying goes, you must do what you have to do and the other two 'chapters' must be followed in rapid succession ... <br /> <br /> Despite my generally negative reaction, FLESH remains valuable as a time capsule of the 60s and as a prototype of the Underground scene of that era, both cinematically and in real life. For the record, an image of Dallesandro from this film adorns the sleeve of the homonymous album of The Smiths 1984 and of the transsexual Candy Darling (that appears here in a very notorious way) was immortalized in "Candy Says", the first song of The Velvet Underground 1969 self-titled album. Although the last band is my favorite of all time, and one of the reasons for this is that, through their unique and innovative music, they described a lifestyle completely different from mine, this is really a case in which I would much rather experience something aurally rather than visually!
