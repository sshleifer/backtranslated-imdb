[possible spoilers] <br /> <br /> The sixth "Halloween" movie is a completely depressing affair, but unfortunately not in the way foreseen by the filmmakers. At this point, everyone knows the story of how it was massacred and thrown in such a careless and incoherent way. The second half, in particular, has little or no meaning, since the elements of the plot are introduced and eliminated, apparently randomly. The end left me scratching my head. What the hell happened. Is Dr. Loomis dead or what? This is what you get when you put a blatant hack in charge of a movie. It is not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> On a related note, this is the most graphically violent entry in the series. I have no problem with Gore if he is in the right place, but this movie takes him to absurd levels. The infamous explosive head must be a new minimum for the series. Michael himself seems to be enjoying the act of murdering another human being, inconsistent with his efficient and methodical approach to John Carpenter's original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure who was responsible; The director Joe Chappelle or the producers, probably a combination of both. I would be happy to grant a pardon to all those involved if they only launched the legendary "Producers' Cut", a more complete version of the film that is a great improvement of each account. From what I understand, it's like a completely different movie. I offer to pay the full price to buy the DVD if Miramax makes sense and frees it. <br /> <br /> However, there are a handful of good elements. The idea that Michael is being controlled by the druids is intriguing. Paul Rudd is solid like Tommy Doyle, whose appearance is a good combination with the original. The visual images help to make the procedures a bit more visible. But these few offers are overshadowed by the overload of nonsense that we have to endure. <br /> <br /> Finally, "The Curse of Michael Myers" is the latest Donald Pleasance movie. Many of his scenes were excluded from the final cut, and when he appears, he seems fragile and unhappy. The film is dedicated to his memory, a flagrant one (if it is an unintentional insult) if there ever was one. The fact that a talented artist must end his career in this way is too depressing to think about. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of ****) <br /> <br /> Released by Dimension Films
