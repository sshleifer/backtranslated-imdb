Certainly, it's not a bad low-budget small movie, this "Gorilla Girlfriend," but it's not anything special either, and it's not memorable enough to be ranked among the significant science fiction efforts of its time. The director Curt Siodmak was a prominent screenwriter during the 1930s and 1940s and presented stories for some classics of the genre ("I walked with a zombie", "The werewolf") but, as a director, obviously lacked the necessary skills. "Bride of the Gorilla" is similar to the aforementioned "The Wolf Man" in history and atmosphere, but the film looks much more amateurish and pitiful. Both take care of the cursed men who turn into big animals at night, but the titular gorilla does not seem as threatening as the werewolf, even though the movie premiered a decade later. During a cheesy opening speech, the actor Lon Chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is a sinister place and that it hides many mysteries, but in reality there is no real mystery in the plot. He only takes care of a plantation manager who is jealous of his older colleague for having such a beautiful young wife and he kills him. A native woman witnesses her crime and casts a spell on Barney that causes him to transform into a frighteningly large gorilla in the night ... Or maybe he just wants him to believe that he is becoming a frighteningly large gorilla. the commissioner in charge of the murder investigation, while Raymond Burr (who starred in around a thousand Perry Mason television movies) plays the greedy manager of the plantation / night gorilla. Does Siodmak try to make the movie look like a supernatural thriller? Is it or is not everything happening in Barney's head? ?? it fails miserably and causes too much talk and too little action in the jungle. Several of the jungle settings are well represented, but the rest of the "special" effects are sticky and badly made. Still the acting is pretty good, Barbara Payton looks beautiful and ?? although very predictable ?? The story is strangely convincing until the end. Strange movie, I probably cursed voodoo.
