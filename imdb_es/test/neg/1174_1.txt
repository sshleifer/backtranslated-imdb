I would not want someone to see this movie "inspired by a true story" and draw conclusions about the real event. Few things that were done well were overshadowed by things that simply were not true. Ed Gein never dragged anyone behind a car, never met anyone in the cemetery and killed them, without evidence that he returned body parts to the cemetery. The things he did were horrible enough, why try to make things worse? <br /> <br /> This movie is among my 10 worst wastes of visual fatigue. "In the light of the moon" is a much better film on the subject, it is more objective and the performance is superior in contrast to this.
