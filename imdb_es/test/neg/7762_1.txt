Week after week these women only sweep all the men off their feet. Be realistic None of these women are "Knockouts." Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) seems to be the type of woman the men faced!: 45 am before the bar closed after her vision and standards were affected by ten or eleven martinis. However, she is the queen bee, a super sexy killer of men. The other three do not fare much better. And his constant comments in a bad mood ... not to mention that they jump in and out of bed with strange men and never get sick with an illness. This show is pathetic and spooky. I do not think any man felt terribly attracted to any of these women, even if he took Viagra as Tic Tacs while on land.
