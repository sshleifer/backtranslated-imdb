The plot seemed to be fine, the actors seemed to be fine, the movie should have been fine. But surely it was not like that, it did not take us anywhere, the scenes <br /> <br /> are strange. Maybe it was destined to create something new, to make us <br /> <br /> think. That at least he did: Where is the rest of this movie? For me, <br /> <br /> it was a waste of money, time and talent. Someone might want to see this <br /> <br /> out of curiosity, to see if they can solve it. Others, personally, <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone.
