The film is a disgusting distortion of lifestyle and orthodox practice. NEVER a Jewish court will impose a divorce between couples without children. Although the concept exists in Jewish law, the conditions are too numerous for it to really take place. Couples without children find it difficult to cope with their lack of children in a community where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere are they "rejected" by their community as shown in the film. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, many great Rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and have never considered divorce. <br /> <br /> The representation of Yosef, a horrible human being, is intended to show, perhaps unconsciously, the behavior of a typical male orthodox. In reality, it is as typical as a violent drunk rapist is typical of secular society. Both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that so many people form their opinions on a society based on a MOVIE (by someone who is personally predisposed against a community). I have always thought that only the Orthodox, due to their mental narrowness and insular lifestyle, are the ones who judge all secular people according to the violence and immoral behavior they read in the newspapers or see in the movies.
