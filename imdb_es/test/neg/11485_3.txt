'The Shining' has ingenuity, visual style and an iconic interpretation of Jack Nicholson. 'Absent', however, does not have any of these things; although it borrows from its classic predecessor; namely, a man entering through a door and a woman running screaming while grabbing a huge kitchen knife. Unlike the great psychological horror film Stanley Kubrick, 'Absent' is a work that resonates with a singular lack of genius. It is magnificently, comically horrible; It makes the Spice Girls movie look like a vital work of art. 'Absent' is the story of a family moving to a closed community in the suburbs. Everything is to be good with the world. They will live in peace and tranquility; They will go calmly to their affairs away from those streets of the city. But no. The character of Ariadna Gill, Julia, begins to get scared by those things that insist on going to the street for the empty supermarkets and the doors that close; and her husband Samuel, played by Jordi Molla, changes in an instant from family man relaxed to crazy without shaving wild eyes, injecting Julia with a drug to keep her under his sudden cosh. Molla, very respected as an actor, is absolutely terrible at this. More comical than threatening, he simply can not achieve a threatening expression. He just appeared as a bar-shaped clay ball that he had drunk only once. So, is there anything to redeem this movie? No. The script is clumsy, the plot does not exist and the cast without merit. Completely tension-free and full of fear now, 'Absent' is an exercise in how not to make a psychological thriller. It's ridiculous and exaggerated, but as one of the funniest movies without any intention of recent years, it is well worth seeing.
