As much as I respect the firemen for what they do. I was impressed and bored with this movie. The performance was fine, but Joaquin Phoenix was a bad choice for the cast. <br /> <br /> What bothered me the most about this movie was Celtic music whining again and again at the worst possible moment in the movie. movie. The direction and continuity were also pretty bad! <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** For example, after the Phoenix character collapses several times and is seriously injured, he can barely move to talk to his captain on the radio. Then, miraculously, he manages to crawl through a huge space covered in debris and fire to pierce a man-sized opening in a double-thick brick wall using only a piece of re-bar from ???? And to top it off, it becomes ultra weak and ruined again. <br /> <br /> Did anyone also notice that throughout the film, every time you see pictures of Joaquin fighting fires and rescuing people, there is little or nothing? There is no smoke in the buildings. I think the smoke should be quite dense in a building engulfed in flames. <br /> <br /> I also got tired of listening to the search and rescue team shouting "I need a team here!". <Br /> <br /> I really thought that I would enjoy this movie, but I found that it was a weak attempt to represent the true life of a firefighter. The intention was there, but I sincerely believe that this movie could have been much better. I could not help thinking that the producer was trying to meet a deadline with this film and had to hurry to put it in theaters. He should have spent more time editing and making sure the movie had a good flow. <br /> <br /> The special effects were impressive in some scenes, but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others. Something like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. <br /> <br /> Call me a critic, but I can not see how great this movie is. At least it was not as bad as "The Whole Ten Yards", which is by far the worst movie I've seen in recent months. <br /> <br /> I really hope there is not a 50 Ladder in the making!
