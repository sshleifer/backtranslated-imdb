Although this has to be the nadir of the sixth season, this serious episode is not badly written or acted. It's just that most of us look for the X-Files in search of tense, grips of terror / thrillers that ended without easy answers and moving towards dark but unfathomable conspiracies. Season 6 gave us a series of ironic comedies that undermined the continuity of the show and, frankly, made the Halloween specials of the Simpsons look like a great television thriller. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Victoria Jackson of SNL touches the fame of the long-suffering girlfriend of a man who introduces himself as a rainmaker. However, her chief meteorologist is the one who really loves her and Mulder ends up having to give her advice about dating to get out of town. <br /> <br /> There is some playful fun with the chemistry between the agents and something fun. but the not too sophisticated characterization of the Midwest hicks. It's nothing you want to see more than once! <br /> <br /> It's difficult to decipher Season 6. X-Files creator Chris Carter seems bored by the whole arc of the history of 'Union Conspiracy' and abandons the responsibility of the Black Comedy Writers.
