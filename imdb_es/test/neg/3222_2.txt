A great gangster movie, with brilliant performances by well-known actors with big action scenes? Well, not this one. <br /> <br /> It is quite amazing to see such a wide cast of well-known actors, who have many good films in their films in a film of this type, without a doubt this can be one of the worst cases, they could appear. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is as you would expect from your average gangster biography, nothing new, nothing special. The way it is said makes the film look MUCH longer than it is (when I thought that the two hours should have ended, I was quite surprised that 45 minutes had passed). <br /> <br /> The action scenes are very similar to those of the television series of the 80s: team A, for example. It's just that in the 80s (especially with Team A) those scenes were much more sophisticated than those of "The Godfather". It is especially fun to see the boys pointing their guns in the air and still hitting something (not to mention people hiding behind the doors of the cars, which then seem to have been attacked). <br /> <br /> Act adapts very well to action. Either you have the same reaction to everything that happens (Dolph Lundgren style), or it is so exaggerated that you may think it is a parody (but unfortunately it is not). <br /> <br /> My advice is to stay away from this. Movie, any other gangster movie is better than this one.
