Say what you want about the "Gore Wizard" of the cinema, Herschell Gordon Lewis, must admit that from his first films ("The Feast of the Blood" of 1963 and the massacre "Two thousand maniacs" of 1964) to his "The Gore from 1972 "Gore Girls"), the man remained faithful to his muse, happily cutting the bodies of young men and women to the delight of the camera.In "Gore Gore", for example, someone has been mutilating the strippers with a pale face and pasty at the Tops & Bottoms club, and a former reporter Gentry is hired by a puppies reporter to help with the case.The film presents a remarkably annoying and repetitive background music, a terrible illumination, an abysmal performance , disgusting characters, a problematic sound And, of course, some of Lewis's patented scenes, so one of the strippers has her face in boiling oil, one has her head torn open, another has her face pressed and her cut nippies; and another has its butt paddled with a meat tenderizer until it covers its entire backside with what appears to be Buitoni tomato sauce. (I could be wrong here, it could have been Ragu.) The movie also throws a little boring humor, although some of the lines are quite funny. For example, we learn that the real name of the slain stripper Suzie Creampuff was ... Ethel Creampuff! A bottle of acid says "Made in Poland" (I do not know why, but I found it funny). And some of the lines of strip club owner Henny Youngman are, of course, fun. Still, this is NOT the movie to show Aunt Ethel or Sister Agatha. It is one of the sickest you've seen, with a single moment of safety, that will please the whole crowd: the title card at the conclusion of the movie that says "We announce with pride: this movie is over"!
