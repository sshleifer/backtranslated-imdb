Wow, where do you start with this one? Well, if you like to laugh at the filmmakers' failures, this is for you. I bought this movie for $ 5 because I never missed the opportunity to laugh at the mistakes made by God Casper Van Dien from film B, and this was one of them. It may have been enough that this film contains the scariest movie monster in history. This thing, which is supposed to be an Indian ghost, looks more like a plastic candy bowl skeleton that you put on your front porch on Halloween. He puts on a cloak that is clearly a garbage bag, complete with what appears to be a cube-shaped hat on his head. In some points, this is a man in disguise, in others it is clearly a plastic stand placed on a horse. This monster has the strange ability to see with the vision of "predator", a clear scam, and can appear miraculously after throwing his spear. Sometimes the spear cuts people, sometimes not. This thing also manages to lower a helicopter with a single arrow. Wow, this makes a lot of sense since when the boy explodes a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of "Critters". This creature is impervious to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the movie. At the end of his wave of murders, in which we never discovered why he is, he explodes. This is an incredible feat, because we had seen this explode 3 times in the movie. But, I guess this last time was the charm. <br /> <br /> And I do not even mean the lameness of the other characters. First, which Delta Force unit employs women? The last time I checked the army still does not allow women in combat situations. In addition, this unit is "disguised". Why? What possible reason should they be concealed? And they're not even good at that, I guess nobody would realize they were military if they did not have uniforms, BUT THEY WERE ALL THE MACHINE ARMS THAT THEY CARRIED (they accidentally changed the sound effects throughout the movie, in some points sounding like BB air guns, and in others, guns). There is a part when the Skeleton Man throws some construction workers from a walkway, and you can clearly see the pad on which they fall. In another point. Michael Rooker falls down a hill that is clearly a flat terrain. They tilted the camera slightly to give the appearance of a tilt, but clearly it is pushing itself into this autumn scene looooooonnnnnggggggg. Then, when he is helped up the hill, the rope is flat, and when the woman is shown at the "top" of the "hill", the rope is lifted from its grip, not as it would look if it were pulling. someone. on top of a hill Rooker actually has a line that says: "I will not follow it, I'll follow it". What? That's possibly the dumbest thing I've ever heard, and I see these bad movies as a hobby. The saddest thing about this quote is that you can say that everyone involved in the writing / production of this movie thought it was so bad. Believe it or not, compared to the rest of the dialogue, this is good. <br /> <br /> The acting, bad. The makeup, very bad. These characters had scars or wounds that they liked to change the side of their face. Maybe these are alien scars that like to run down your face. Yes, I think I'll make a movie about that, "Attack of the alien scars that move on your face." That villain would be more intimidating than the skeleton man, and the movie would probably be more terrifying.
