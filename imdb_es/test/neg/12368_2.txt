The movie was pretty bad. It's not so much a script problem. It's just that the movie is really boring in terms of rhythm. The film seems to be moving at a slow and agonizing pace. The story in San Franpsycho is that there is a loose serial killer who is killing morally corrupt individuals (maybe he has read too much, but hey, it's my nature apparently) after San Franpsycho kills a couple of people under the Golden Gate. In Bridge, we are introduced to one of the main characters in the film: Joe Estevez (brother of Martin Sheen) as a fighting policeman named Bill Culp. Currently, Bill is trying to hunt down the killer (seriously, he has no name, he's just The Killer), and he's trying to coerce a local news reporter named Rita to help him with his investigation. Bill is the most difficult stereotype. The policeman on the edge and he threaten Rita to be imprisoned for obstruction of justice. Anyway, some scenes happen and, suddenly, Rita finds a letter left by the psychopath (He is a cold-blooded psychopath!) And she has a change of attitude and tells Bill and her partner Joe about this and It helps them with the investigation. <Br /> <br /> The movie tries to be a tense thriller, but in a way it just fails. It's very similar to the movie The Black Dahlia: try to be tense, but it's amazing in terms of that. The film tries to be serious at all times, but it has scenes like where The Killer masturbates (obviously a pornography fan with lines like "ooh blood on her" or something similar) and Joe Est√©vez hitting the table: "It's a cold-blooded killer! I admit that I chuckled more than once in the movie, although I'm sure it was meant to be a very serious movie. <br /> <br /> One of the only positive points that has The movie is the fact that I did not pay money to watch it (huzzah netflix), and it's sad because I could see something good in his films after watching The Damned ... Of course the film had its fair share of flaws, but it was nice. Although San Franpsycho does not have anything in his favor, of course, he has a good script, it's not great, but it could have been interesting, but what you get is a murder thriller that does not get excited or even have vague deaths pleasant. the other critics affirm that the film has "a great end of turn that is shocking", apparently, I was watching a different movie because around the time I realized what was going to happen. The ending did not surprise me in the least. I would continue to insult this shattering of a movie, but I do not think I will. A long, short story, this movie is a boring and uninspired thriller (I use that term lightly) that fails to have the "Hitchcockian emotion" that another critic claims to have a predictable ending, dull deaths, acting with all the emotion of a wooden plank. , and a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will try to defend this with the usual: it was a low budget movie, they did the best they could with such a low budget, and all that other nonsense But when you came to the conclusion, there was very little in which they could really have spent that budget, there was very little special effects work, the soundtrack looks like it could have been recycled from Hood of the Living Dead or The Damned, and it's the same damn crew from those two movies . This movie really reminds me a lot of another low budget movie that was not good, and it was called Mr. Jingles, they are both of the same quality, they do not offer anything like enjoyment and they should disappear quickly in the dark.
