I love the old "monster movies" for the pure courage of the camp. This does not disappoint if you find that kind of fun stuff. <br /> <br /> The performance is pure shit from the fifties. You get used to it when you've seen enough of these ... the dialogue is very silly and, ultimately, forgettable. You're just there for the giant bird. <br /> <br /> The "science" in this movie is very funny. A monstrous aviation from another world that can manipulate antimatter ... try to wreak havoc and eat people ... an extraterrestrial that has come to Earth to nest. Some of the best scenes in the film (which do not have the bird in them) include the "scientists" who explain what is happening. <br /> <br /> Much has been said about the ridiculous bird puppet. It looks like a new bird ... bald and ugly with bristling feathers. It even stings like a hungry and angry newbie. However, the bird scared the shit out of my three-year-old son, who had terrible nightmares for the night. It is a bit creepy. <br /> <br /> I was very sad about the scene where they shoot the egg. (Somehow, the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield.) But I'm a bird lover, what can I say?
