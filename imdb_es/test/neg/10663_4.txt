As a nice anecdote from one of the previous comments: I was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this film, I was approached (being white) to copy some of the lines of this film in a recording studio. <br /> <br /> Although I also speak German, they kindly asked me to do all the dubbing scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience ... So, all the Germans in this film really they speak English! Funny enough to make several characters, so if you really want to waste your time watching the movie again, listen carefully; <br /> <br /> all the non-Indian characters are made only by 4 voices! . . . .
