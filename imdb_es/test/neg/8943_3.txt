OK, so this is horror? I'm horrified, but I'm not horrified. Black and white is artistic, but too black is an exaggeration ... enough has been said about enlightenment. The story - a serial killer ....... many of these around. It has been done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done ... but I hope not. My question is, when will the audience tire of reliving this maddening dilemma? I guess the director thought he would do something different: portray killing children. Well, that has been done before too. So I guess he had to go to a shock value ... make them kill them in the darkest way. Okay ... the audience was shocked ... sick ... disgusted ... numb. And getting up from my seat, I felt all these things. So, was the director successful? Yes! Absolutely! These are the things he wanted me to feel and I made them. Now what do I do with the feelings? And what is more important, what is the "message" here? With the incredible talent with which Francis Xavier was "gifted" ... could I ever consider applying it to make films that speak, I daresay, out of the darkness? I stayed in the dark after watching this movie, my soul was assaulted ... that's what this job is about? There are many movies of this type out there, they earn my money. So, what about people who want to see all these images they deplore? What is happening in this world that people will pay to be horrified? Would you see this again ... never.
