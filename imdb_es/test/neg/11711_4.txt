I was lucky enough to read the book in advance and I know a little about Tudor England. <br /> <br /> In general, the writing and editing of this film for television was really horrible. I felt like I was watching a really bad drama documentary about the period, then a movie. <br /> <br /> First there were too many cuts between important parts. And leaving aside the important events that happened at that time, one is the fall of Henry with Rome for his desire to divorce Katherine de Arag√≥n, which led England to separate from Rome and establish his own church. They just stuck to the book at all. I am in favor of creative freedom but to the limit, especially when it comes to a well-written book as a starting point. In the book, Mary gives birth to the young Catherine, and then the young Henry is born. Both his father is Henry's eight. In the film they show Harry first and then Catherine. And suggest that Catherine's father is William Carey. <br /> <br /> There are too many bad moments in the film to write them all. <br /> <br /> However, I will say that Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone interpret how the Boleyn sisters were probably the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the book and you do not know anything about Hennry's, court 8, I will recommend that you stay away from this movie. And for those who read the book, the movie will bother them because of the lack of details and important plot.
