The movie has a good story, the action is good in some parts, but not in all. Some of the parties, I felt as if the bad guys had not done a dose yet, because of my experience of taking martial arts. Some are long actions, as always mainly for the boss, but for the less important ones, they were killed or eliminated with some blows, but others were quite unrealistic or could have done a better job. <br /> <br /> The less important actors or people with double accents were the correct chosen ones for the movie, my girlfriend started to fall in love with them because she started watching the movie more than what she spends her time with me. <br /> <br /> The movie is good, that's all I can say.
