I saw the first episode and it seemed like a very wooden performance. <br /> <br /> I've seen the original from its beginnings in Big Girls Blouse until the last series on Channel Seven. Kath and Kim were a great Mocumentary and their humor is something that most people perceive. <br /> <br /> However, in this American version I found it boring, Molly Shannon is fashionable to be Kath Day, Kath's wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the '80s with her curly perm. While the figure of Selma Blair embracing the clothes is not as good as the one that the original Kimmy wore. I also found that Selma seemed to be swelling her belly a lot, obviously it's a size 12 (Australian) where Kim should be (Australian) a size 16/18. <br /> <br /> The exchanges between Molly and Selma obviously have a script and there are breaks where there should not be breaks or the breaks are a bit long, since someone suggested that there might be a trail of laughter there during those breaks. It's like Molly and Shannon are not used to each other, there's no mother / daughter chemistry. <br /> <br /> Phil was fine, he had the eccentric air around him like Kel. However, Craig was very handsome and not the sweet and humble Brett of the Australian version. <br /> <br /> I discovered that seeing this was like seeing a very bad theatrical performance. The performance was quite hard and the exaggeration of Selma's expressions faded after ten minutes. Especially his scenes of bad humor. <br /> <br /> In short, I find that this show is a waste of time, obviously the script has been overwhelmed for Americans, that most on the board say they prefer the original. If NBC wanted to show Kath and Kim why they do not pay the producers the money to show the original. <br /> <br /> All I can add is that Magda is a smart cookie for not allowing the producers to use their Sharon character.
