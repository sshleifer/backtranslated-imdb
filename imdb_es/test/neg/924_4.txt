When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. An "Enough" Travesty by Donald Westlake was one of my favorite stories of all time. After I saw him I was not so excited. Recently I had the opportunity to see her a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she did not like it very much either, and had never read the book). In this film they managed to eliminate all the charm of the book and turn it into a dull papilla. A big part of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him a lot in other movies, but he played (Terry / Carey) Thorpe as a stutter and incompetent. In the book, Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but he remains collected all the time on the outside, which is part of the fun. The SPOILERS continue: They also left out a big part of the story (apart from a 2-second vision in the embassy), where Thorpe resolves not 1, but 4 homicides for the police. This is important not only because it's fun, but because it helps establish the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the movie, Fred's betrayal at the end is not so emotional, because they do not seem to be that close. In the book, they become good friends, especially on Fred's side, which makes it more ironic that he is the one who arranges the fall of Thorpe. Fred also suffered a bit from the casting. I love Adam Arkin, but he was not a happy guy, happy to be a kind of optimistic and alive detective, that Fred's book possesses, which makes it more obvious that he does not play with the tests and therefore more shocking Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book, and James Cromwell was great despite not looking very much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring scene in the ship's house that was added to the movie was much less interesting than when the police found Edgarson's body after Thorpe sent him to Seattle and blamed the mafia for his death. Kit was fine, although most of the time it was rewritten, and it would have been nice to see her die, as she got a little annoyed. I do not care about changes in books to make movies, I know they are necessary due to length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been more fun or smart instead of more boring.
