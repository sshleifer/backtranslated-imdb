the plot of this film revolves around this submarine builder who is a real bastard and wants to launch his new submarine that can travel thousands of feet deep. unfortunately, he can not oh yes, and he is obsessed by the memories that his mom and dad were eaten by a megalodon as a child. the guy meets a scientist who is very good, and they and this team of about a hundred people throw themselves into the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents. Now, the shark in this movie is a CGI shark that looks really fake. . Basically this is something like Shark Attack 3, except more depressing. If you do not understand what I mean, listen. The initial credits of the film show "home movies" of the main character when he was a child with his parents before being killed, and there is very sad and depressing piano music in the background. You would expect to see a shark or something, and it does. A short shadow of the CGI shark floats every few seconds, but that's it. Also, I do not remember a happy facial expression throughout the film's execution time, most of the film takes place in the dark depths of the abyss, where the story becomes even more boring, and all the characters (the shark as well) die at the end. I was thinking that Sabato would manage to kill the shark and save himself and the girl, but no, everyone dies, and the film ends with the shark, all blown up, and the submarine (with the crushed and burned body of Sabato in it) sinking in the abyss. If you are a happy person and you do not enjoy being depressed, then avoid this movie. If you are the opposite, then congratulations, you have found your movie.
