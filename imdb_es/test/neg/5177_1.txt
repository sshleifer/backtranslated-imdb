Blame Guy Ritchie. The success of the late 90's Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Ritchie, triggered a series of regrettable gangster films of which the genre never recovered. Unfortunately, Rise of The Footsoldier, the true story of essex Carlton Leach Essex, is not likely to reverse that trend. Despite Hartnett's decent performance, the film is the victim of too-familiar East End stereotypes. Either they are busy blowing someone's brain or fucking a blonde with little clothes. <br /> <br /> From fearsome soccer hooligan in the eighties to a key figure in the underworld of crime during the 1990s, Footsoldier records Leach's rise through the ranks of thugs Leaving the terraces to go to the night clubs, Leach becomes a gorilla where they give carte blanche to fuck anyone. Here he enters with the notorious gang leaders Pat Tate (Fairbrass) and Tony Tucker (Stone), and begins to realize that gang war is not what was believed. <br /> <br /> It's fun to be deconstructed by the smiling writer and director Julian Gilbey, a member of Patots, as each phrase seems to start with a 'Am I going to fuck?' or 'You fackin'? or, sometimes, 'Then, I was just a' Fackin '??', typically concluded with a mandatory 'caaaant!' The direction also smells of sadism, especially the rejoicing that Gilbey gets when filming violent scenes in the foreground and, in the case of the bloody shot of the shotgun in the face, in triplicate. <br /> <br /> Director Gilbey's use of classic gangster storytelling of rise and fall is not what will condemn Footsoldier to the darkness of the big screen. Neither is the fact that halfway through, the film on the sidelines bothers Leach in favor of the events that culminated in the infamous filming of Tate and Tucker. It is Gilbey's sickly appetite for the violence of the shooting that ruins the film; Whether it's a brick in the face or an ax in the head during a vicious attack on a train, everything is unnecessarily long. Footsoldier is not so strong that you feel violated and, what is more important, steals two hours of your life that you will not recover ...
