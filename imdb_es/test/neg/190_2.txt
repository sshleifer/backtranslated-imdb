Let's not kid ourselves, okay? We all know that this movie was made due to the success of the "Grumpy Old Men" movies. However, unlike these, this farce has no humor and has very little heart. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven is the only bright light that can be seen. It breaks my heart that he was finally given the opportunity to show his skills to a new generation of viewers, only to end up on a piece of dreck like this. There was a touching scene that showed that she was standing next to someone she was in love with. His excellent performance was the only quality performance in "Out To Sea". Everyone else is simply going through the motions. 2/10
