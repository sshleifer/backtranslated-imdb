Scanning through the comments, there does not seem to be much love for this movie, and it's not very hard to see why, it's nonsense. <br /> <br /> Now, I'll start by saying that it's over. The product was damaged, in many ways, by the death of Donald Pleasance (Dr. Loomis) in postproduction. This required a new version of the film's ending with Loomis buying the farm and eliminating what was supposed to be a double twist at the end with Micheal swapping places with the mysterious "Man in Black" and I do not mean Johnny Cash. /> <br /> Now to the story. The fifth film ended quite unsatisfactorily with Micheal Myers escaping from prison with the mysterious man in black. It turns out that this man knows the origin of the evil of Micheal and is also a colleague of Dr. Loomis named Dr. Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in parts 4 and 5, but here played by JC Brandy). Jamie, pregnant, escapes from Dr. Wynn's lair, so Micheal follows her and kills her. But she had the child, so now he needs to track the baby so he can kill his great nephew. <br /> <br /> We hear a ridiculous explanation of Micheal's evil that involves Gaelic curses, bloodlines and mysterious symbols. A radio program is broadcast from Micheal's hometown for some reason, which gives Micheal more unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film, like this criticism, is vague, confusing and aimless, with a very anticlimactic ending. . <br /> <br /> Some scenes of sex and nudity. Weak plot, acceptable effects, with a good run of murders, but with a great lack of motivation. For what was supposed to explain everything, this only caused some new questions, made parts 4 and 5 not make sense and was a bad way for a great actor in Pleasance to end his life and career.
