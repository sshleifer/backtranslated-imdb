When you're used to Lana Turner in the Postman Always Rings Twice, and you compare her to this low-budget, low-talent, low-quality movie, well, I was ashamed of Ida Lupino's "singing" (more like talking) Piano playing scenes. When the first scene without singing started and everyone just stared at her, I was sure they were going to roll their eyes and start going away or at least talking to each other (sucks, come on, let's get out of here). The actors are flat, emotions are deflated. In addition, Ida is a real spoiled billada in the whole world, only a 100% discount. This was how Betty Boop in conscious sedation meets an employee of the service station in the USA ville from nowhere. The story was flat, the music was flat, the performance was flat, his chest was ... it does not matter. I felt sad for the rest of the actors. Maybe if the right actress had been given the lead role, and the male actors had more emotion, then the film could have had a chance. I'm sorry for offending those of you who thought I was out of this world. I would not have minded if he stayed out of this world.
