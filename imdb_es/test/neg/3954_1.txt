Bad, bad movie. When I saw the synopsis, I expected something like Ring just with a video game instead of a tape. Nothing of what happened. I admit that the idea is interesting and could become a good movie, but it is not. <br /> <br /> First of all, choosing the real life person, Countess Bathory, is a stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story. . Anyone who is vaguely familiar with his story would begin to wonder why and how this noble Hungarian ended up in this movie. Choosing a generic vengeful spirit would be much, much better. <br /> <br /> Then there is the whole concept of "dies in real life as it dies in the game". As I said before, an interesting story, like a ring. But instead of turning it into a good story, in a way it simply flows along with no explanation given why this game became what it is, why it was created and so on. A good idea. <br /> <br /> And, finally, this movie does not even have fragments of funny parts that can, if not saved, at least make it possible to watch horrible horror movies. The scenes of death are too fast and the acting is too hard to be funny. <br /> <br /> Avoid yourself if possible.
