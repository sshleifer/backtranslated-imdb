The series finally reaches the bottom with this dismal fourth installment, which was (thank God) the last. None of the three sequels did justice to the highly entertaining original, but this particular movie is nothing more than a blatant attempt to exploit the name "The Magnificent Seven" and Bernstein's musical theme. The production values ​​are similar to those of a movie made for television and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable: in the "II" and "III" parts you can not remember their names, here you can not even remember their faces. Lee Van Cleef was an inappropriate choice for the role of Chris, but no one could have replaced Yul Brynner in our minds anyway. Do not waste your time.
