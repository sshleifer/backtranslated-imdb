The opening of MORTE A VENEZIA resembles a Duran Duran music video with classical music and this is the highlight of the film <br /> <br /> "In terms of what Theo?" <br /> <br /> In terms of Everything, but above all the emotion. I doubt that there has ever been a slower and slower movie than this one. If it is okay. It's a movie from a European art house, so I did not expect Charles Bronson to slaughter hordes of bad guys, but he still expected some substance, if not a real plot. Aschenbach visiting Venice. Gustav visits Venice and goes in a gondola, Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant, Gustav looks out the window of his hotel and if it is exciting what he wants, Gustav has a flashback <br /> <br /> Bad enough as if he's It was the whole movie, but it gets worse because Gustav realizes a pretty teenage boy. So you have a middle-aged academic lust after some teenager you've seen, an old queen is obsessing over a stranger. Great idea for a movie? I do not think so, and thank God, it remained a yawning festival instead of a sleazy precursor of gay porn. <br /> <br /> I've noticed that many people who praise this movie have tried to intellectualize it. I can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious from my point of view and say that the only subtext I could relate to was the physical and emotional disintegration of Gustav, but it was not caused by the ephemeral beauty of the adolescent. bored and ostentatious movie
