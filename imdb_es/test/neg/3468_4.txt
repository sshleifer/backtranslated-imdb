'Leatherheads' tries hard. Try to be cheerful. Try to be a comedy. Try to be a love story. Let's see, try to be a "His Girl Friday" through "The Sting" through "It Happened One Night" through a dozen sports movies. Unfortunately, trying it does not work and the movie is as drenched as in the field of the last game. <br /> <br /> A movie fan would see the big fight scene in the madness between the Duluth Bulldogs and some soldiers and he would realize that The fights that John Ford organized with such style, enthusiasm and humor in movies like 'The Quiet Man' or 'Donovan's Reef', or 'The Searchers' may seem easy to do, but obviously they are not. I would bet that George Clooney thought that channeling John Ford would also be easy. How difficult it could be: masculinity goes crazy, blows, bottles broken in the head, an imperturbable pianist ... just put it on the screen with some music. Sorry. A master is needed to make the fight scenes flow. <br /> <br /> Films are not desired in stock. The humor is hard. Romance is hard. Slapstick, a lost art. <br /> <br /> I once read that you never wanted to sit too close to a ballet performance. Something about not wanting to puncture the fantastic bubble of the performance when listening to the noise of the dancers' feet or the grunts of the elevators. This movie is like that ... all the tensions and the good intentions, the handsome actors, the beautiful scenes, but they stir instead of galloping, like the original Galopante Fantasma, Red Grange, on whom the film is based.
