This may sound strange, but I could only watch the first movie (The Emperor's New Groove, yaddayadda) a week ago and only for one episode of the television show. I just love Kuzco's character, but Kronk is not that bad either. Anyway, in the end I decided to watch the second movie, just to be able to see it. I expected it to be as good as the first, but ... I'm sorry to say it, but the more humor became American, the more yawning. I agreed with Kuzco when he started crying seeing all the corny images. <br /> <br /> Even so, the younger children and probably the veterans will also love this movie in pieces (if they like the old-school Disney moralization), but Solo had the expectation that they were a bit more highs of what they should have been. Kronk is a charming character, good-hearted and stupid at the same time, but it was Pacha and Kuzco who woke me up at the end of the movie. (I'll ignore Rudy ... as much as possible.) <br /> <br /> Anyway, a great movie, it just is not my style and, as they say, you always have to be faithful to your rhythm.
