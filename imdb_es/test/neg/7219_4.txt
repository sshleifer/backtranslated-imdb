Let me start by saying that you know that a movie is wrong when the extras make the cover. With that said, anyone who says that this is the worst movie in history has been dramatic, and anyone who says that the movie is great is completely delirious. The movie "is what it is". And what is that? A modest budget ($ 4 million, I estimate) sequel to study. The movie is not terrible, but for Road House fans it will be a disappointment. And that brings me to problem one, just as Dirty Dancing would not have been what it was without Swayze, Road House is not the same without it. The leader lacks depth, character and sympathy to take the film. I feel that the leadership was misplaced and that the producers should have turned to make Patrick do it if they were going to make a sequel. The other cast was uneven, with prominent actors like Will Patton along with players who could not act out of a paper bag. Busey, whom I have seen making great characters, seems to have just sent it by mail. Ellen played well, except for not being believable at all like a swamp calf. Sherri, the DEA agent at the first bar was sexy and a good actress, however, her part was uncomfortably small and undeveloped. The writer totally lost all the opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and the characters. Instead of opting for a one-dimensional film base. Which brings me to the biggest problem, the script ... It gave me a bad feeling when the credits were accumulated and there were three scriptwriters separated by a "and" and an "&". He looked very amateurish. And that's what writing was. I heard that the original script was better and then a rewrite was done and the hard core suction started. Some important parts of the film to keep in mind are ... During the first secret meeting, the obvious drug business under the table. "Hey, let's meet in a nude and crowded bar, I'll take a block of cocaine out of my jacket and you'll take out the money and then we'll slip it under the cocktail table" WAIT! "Make sure you look good when you look to the left and to the right to make sure no one is looking!" Second, I love it when someone is shot in the chest and then you see him sitting happily as a lark 10 minutes later. There are some unpleasant editing cuts towards the end of the film, especially during the fight scenes and when the main character chases through the doors and encounters a pattern. What brings me to the realism of the DEA training, I will not be a technician ... But jumping through the doors is not a standard training ... Nor are the typical female agents, who break their butts to become A male. Field oriented, act like weak characters ... boring! Thank you for the macho vision Heir Director. There are other things that a course in a school could teach about it ... The accelerated struggle, the cheerful dialogue, the recycled history ... etc ... But apart from everything you simply can not like the former Mr. A Applegate, totally lacks the zen humility that made Mr. Patrick Swayze a bad ass. It just seems to me that he is one of those 5-foot actors who think they are bad, but like Van Damnit he finds a real bad (Chuck Zito in the case of Van Do not) and gives him a lesson on "badassdom" " Therefore, I think it is the main axis of the film: if you're a bad ass, you're a bad ass, you do not have to try. Example: Swayze! If you're a nice guy trying to prove you're a bad ass, among other things ... So, well ... You're the reason why your audience, Joe Average ... will not rent this movie, and if They will write comments like this.
