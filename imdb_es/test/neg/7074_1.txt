"Tamara" felt like another teens-oriented imitation of the "I know what you did last summer" trend and it's painfully boring. An outcast from high school, who devotes himself largely to witchcraft and black magic, is killed accidentally during a cruel joke carried out by a group of thugs who secretly bury her in the woods, promising not to tell anyone. The next day, Tamara, supposedly "dead", arrives at the school with a completely new image and seduces her possible murderers and takes revenge ... This is basically a combination of "Carrie", "The Craft", and All the other teeny bopper turkeys that come straight to the shelves these days. The actors are absolutely atrocious and they look like ten years too old to pass high school. There is some blood, which is not really interesting since the film is very boring and I could not wait for it to end. If you like modern garbage then I insist that you look for this, otherwise do not bother ...
