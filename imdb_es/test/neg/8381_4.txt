The cult began 20 years ago in the "Quinling Range, South China" when a man named Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) finds an ancient amulet that is said to have magical powers, which heads to California, where Quinlin has established a worship and the members are ready. sacrifice when one of them (Cazzy Golomb) frustrates his evil plan ... It advances to this day like five university students, Mindy (Rachel Miner), Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel Michaely) and Morgan (Victoria Venegas) are investigating the events of twenty years ago that are known as the "Quinling Massacre" for a school project. Unfortunately, Morgan decides to commit suicide, which unleashes the evil spirit of Owen Quinlin for reasons that are rather tenuous, he is committed to completing what he started so many years ago by reclaiming souls so that he can finally inherit the magical powers of the amulet for his own evil. use ... <br /> <br /> Edited, co-produced and directed by Joe Knee, this is not a good movie and he's kind to her. Benjamin Oren's script, which seems to be taken very seriously, is a supernatural tale about a cult leader who returns from death to finish what he started a few years earlier, as it is to be expected that the character involved now has links to what it happened It's been so many years and it's as boring as it seems. The characters are insipid and forgettable, the dialogue is so much, it does not contain the horror or the appropriate exploitation, sometimes it is slow, it is predictable, it is a clich√©, it gets completely out of the rails at the end and it does not make much sense when you think about it. History never grabs you or compromises you, it is never exciting or particularly interesting and it would be hard for me to say that it is normal. Here there is very little for what Cult could recommend, do not bother with this. <br /> <br /> Director Knee is fine, but the movie has that bland aspect of video made for TV. It is a completely forgettable and flat material. There is no fear, no atmosphere and no tension. There is also no gore, sure there is a good amount of blood spatter, but there are no gore scenes with special make-up effect itself. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 950,000, the cult seems cheap, although it's not as bad as some low-budget horror movies I've seen recently. The performance is not even worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> Cult is a bad movie that did nothing for me, it would cost me to call this average. There are much better horror movies out there.
