I overcame half of this, but I was not masochistic enough to see it all. The first half of the movie had almost no dialogue! Almost everything was voice over commentary to carry the story. The scriptwriter forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain several millennia of detailed history in the voiceover. At the same time he forgot to do any development of the character. Most science fiction fans do not require large amounts of character development, but it would be good to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the space fleet ended up fighting each other. <br /> <br /> There are some good things that are happening in the movie. The soundtrack was well done. Some of the computer generated graphics are very good, but others were simply mediocre.
