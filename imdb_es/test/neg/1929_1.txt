Dear Mr. Seitzman, or who may be responsible for Mr. Seitzman not fulfilling his legitimate destiny of being eaten alive by Rabid Wolverines; <br /> <br /> I do not know you, so I can not comment on your character; As far as I know, you donate to charities and help the ladies cross the street. However, I must insist, for the common good, that you never write another script while you live. Put down the pen, get away from the laptop! <br /> <br /> If you refuse to pay attention to the plea of ​​injured brains, I have seen one or two movies in my life and I think you will find my advice useful: <br /> <br /> 1. Do not include the scenes of love in which the too-forced teenagers name the body parts of their girlfriends after the states of the United States. If you must write such a scene, do not name the breasts "New York" and "New Jersey"; causes unnecessary speculation as to which cities occupy the nipples. Besides, it's almost incomprehensibly stupid and annoying. <br /> <br /> 2. Do not rely solely on John Hughes films to reinforce class distinctions. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not hit the audience in the head with exhausted clichés. Yes, yes, Kelley and Sam stand out in the rain, and that cleanses them of their worries. We understand. Yes, the roses continue to bloom in the greenhouse of Kelley's dead mother, even though all the other plants have begun to rot. It is a symbol of your love. It is also very painful when applied through a sudden force trauma to the back of our heads. For the love of God, Mr. Seitzman, we got it. We all achieve it, through all the earth. Amish, people with hearing problems, unborn babies, we all understand it. <br /> <br /> 4. It is not necessary for actors to perform mime sequences. Forever. Never. <br /> <br /> 5. Did I mention that you should relax in the well-worn symbolism? Because the audience can draw the parallel between rebuilding the restaurant and building the relationship between Kelley and Sam without any help. Truly. We did it. <br /> <br /> 6. Review your script and select the following lines, and any line that looks like them: "I do not know what we are anymore." "I do not want to lose you". "It's like the rest of them!" (And it's a corollary, "Daddy, you do not even know him!") <br /> <br /> 7. Yes, yes, she is in heaven, running through a field. We did it. <br /> <br /> 8. And in other news, we understand it. <br /> <br /> I've seen dozens of terrible movies in my life; I never expected to suffer for your art, and I would end up leaving the theater, but an elephant with the words "LOVE COUNTY" painted on its side fell from the sky and nailed me in my seat. <br /> <br /> To finish, your writing bites, you owe me ten dollars and I hate you.
