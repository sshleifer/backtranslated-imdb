I can not believe I really sat through this whole movie! It was absolutely horrible, and totally worthy of grief, and yet I sat thinking that I had to improve. It was not like that, and I've lost 2 hours of my life. Will Smith is much better in action movies: I loved him in I, Robot, Enemy of the State and on Independence Day, and I do not think we can really expect him to take a full movie as the romantic protagonist in the way Cary Grant could. On the other hand, the script was unbearably horrible, and the dialogue was so cheesy. <br /> <br /> I did not like everyone except Albert's character, and even what I found was done with a heavy hand. If you want to see a modern romantic comedy to feel good, look something like How to lose a boy in ten days or When Harry meets Sally. The 40-year-old Virgin left me with a smile on her face. I even preferred music and lyrics over and above this, and yes, I know it's corny, but at least it was not taken seriously and it was sweet. I also disliked the main female protagonist, and was not convinced of the chemistry between her and the character of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> In general, I think there were two scenes that I liked (and definitely not the ending, which was nauseating and unconvincing!) - Hitch called Sarah when she had not given her number. and - no, I'm sorry, that's the only thing I liked about the whole movie. Do not waste your time.
