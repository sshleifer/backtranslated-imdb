This film was highly recommended by a friend and, being a big fan of Brando, I asked Harrods for this film and I waited impatiently for it to arrive. Rarely has a movie disappointed me so much. Brando was good as a German officer, but the rest of the movie was simply unbearable. You will never like or care for any of the characters (except Brando, maybe). The performance was good. History, what story? Maybe that's the point. After all, it's war, but I've seen much better war movies. (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, even Star Wars) It was so boring that I kept checking my watch ... <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of the worst movies I've seen. Please, do not waste your time and money on this. I can also add that this is the first user comment I wrote, I just had to share my feelings about this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, my favorites of all times are: Casablanca, The Godfather 1 & 2, Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest, Pulp Fiction and Amadeus. If you have not seen them yet, take time to do it. And Amadeus MUST be in widescreen 2.35: 1
