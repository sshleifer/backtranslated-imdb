Not long ago I bought a cheap VHS tape called "Just Rambling Along", supposedly with Laurel and Hardy. Being somewhat familiar with its production and not recognizing this title, I took the agonizing decision to pay a whole dollar and buy it. When I played it, I identified the movie as HOP TO IT. Of course, Mr. Laurel was nowhere in the cast, making the packaging of this product criminally misleading. Worse still, the quality is terrible. It seems he was cheated out of an 8mm film source. I had a musical score that was appropriate. Actually, in all seriousness, the film is worth it if you just want to have an idea of ​​what the movie is like. In my opinion, it is a decent short but not exceptional. IMDb must add JUST RAMBLING ALONG as an alternative title for this film, which by the way was the name of a 1918 film Stan Laurel.
