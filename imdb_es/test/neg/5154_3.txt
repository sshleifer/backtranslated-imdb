My mother took me to this movie on the drive-in when I was about seven years old, thirty years ago. I had no idea that a family movie was so violent. My clearest memory was the pain in the child's father's face when they stabbed him in the stomach and killed him. This image chased me for weeks. I learned that I lived in a world in which a person could stab my father at any time. How could I stop them? How could my father protect himself? You must realize that this stabbing is not a fantasy for a seven-year-old child. It is as real as witnessing a real event, and it has no place in the innocent mind of a child. It is sad that we still do not understand the impact that violence has on the lives of our children, both in our children and in our society. If only parents protect their children from the images of violence with the same vigor that protects them from the images of nudes and sex.
