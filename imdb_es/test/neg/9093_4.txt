I really could not get into this movie. The plot is that an old woman has been torturing someone for so long that she is deformed. She dies and he stays in the basement to die of hunger. The months must pass and a family moves. The daughter is blind due to an accident caused by the father. Well, anyway, this guy in the basement, who by all rights should be dead a long time ago, still exists. He eats a cat and now he is superhuman. Now he wants to eat people and have sex. And when a prostitute dies, the father is to blame. I always dislike movies where you blame someone else for the murders because the typical lines are always here "I did not do it", "I could never do such a thing", blah blah blah And the family story could be a story from a movie for life.
