This movie was a shame. Ulma Thurman looked like he had some kind of illness and John Travolta looked like he was walking in his sleep. I expected this to be a continuation of Get Shorty, not a half remake of the same movie (except that some of the characters have different names and clothes) <br /> <br /> I would not recommend This to the film to my worst enemy . I feel like I got ripped off and Hollywood once again tricked me into seeing another horrible sequel (I also suffered for Alien Vs. Predator). <br /> <br /> The best I can say about this movie is that it has my vote for the worst movie of 2005!
