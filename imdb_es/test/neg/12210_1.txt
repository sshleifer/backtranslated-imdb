While he was killing time on a Saturday morning, "Buscando a Lola" came to HBO. I decided to give it a try even though the description of the movie looked pretty bad. It was even worse than I could imagine. The movie was incredibly amazing and there was absolutely no chemistry on the screen among the main actors, so I found my head almost every 10 minutes. Between Mike Greenbaum (main actor) in scenes where the bill is skipped in an elegant restaurant and where Lola (lead actress) allows her to use her boss's house to fool her parents into thinking he is rich, it was almost as bad like him. "daydreaming" with the people around him doing the macarena (it was HORRIBLE!) and the two actors finally fell in love. I kept wanting to change the channel, but I was trying to give him every opportunity to turn it into a beautiful love story with a few giggles. He never did it In fact, he got so bad that I decided to finish it just to be able to say that I saw one of the worst films ever made in its entirety, instead of being criticized for not "giving it a fair chance". The last scene in which Lola is tested for a dance part was the culmination of the film. She arrives late after getting married (even that scene in which Mike tells the priest to hurry and then snatches the papers saying it is done in tune with the credibility of this movie), and then somehow "convinces" the judges take a look The two male judges are already discouraged by how late she is. But after watching her go through the stage (well, she dances well, but not too impressive), they all come together to include the families of Lola and Mike, other dancers who were there, and * cough * even the judges. Bad, horrible, terrible. It was so bad that I had to write a review. Look at your own risk.
