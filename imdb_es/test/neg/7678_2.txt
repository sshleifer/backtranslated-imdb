This movie is sometimes scary, maybe no more so than when a naked George Kennedy tells his prostitute girlfriend that she wants a little more sugar. Fortunately, your nudity is covered by a blanket, but the image is even more terrifying than anything else you can find, for example, in Schindler's List. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film was inspiring; It inspired me to watch another movie. In one scene, when an air hostess comments on male pilots, Kennedy asks, "Why do you think it's called a 'cock' hole?" Charming. <br /> <br /> And yes, contrary to what some have written, this movie is very, very bad.
