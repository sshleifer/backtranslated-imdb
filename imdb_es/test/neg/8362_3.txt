Congratulations to Christina Ricci for making this film and putting her mojo behind this important theme and trying to make a great movie. Ricci is my favorite actress: she is so talented, so natural, her reactions are perfect and so is the energy that radiates constantly, which gives credence to the term "star", often badly applied. <br /> <br /> The film loses its mark for many different reasons, but perhaps most notably, the story does not adapt to the screen by making it a compelling narrative ... more on that later. The cast at first glance is excellent, but now that I think about it, Jessica Lang as the Jewish mother is too Protestant and not exactly correct, Ann Hetch does not come close to showing the compassion and dedication of the book's psychiatrist, and when you're making a movie, how can you justify saying no to Anne Heche and Jessica Lange? But the real problems are in the construction of the film: first in not getting any kind of lasting sympathy for the character of Elizabeth Wurtzle, and second in saying something significant about the situation so common and horrible in which this poor girl is. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Lizzy simply shows herself as a teenager more affected than most, but not as devastating as it appears in the book. This is a major problem. This story had to be told from beginning to end and from the couch of the therapist. She is only eight or nine years old when her depression begins due to devastating social factors, both in society and in the home, and this is a crucial point not only to provoke the appropriate sympathy for her but also for the gravity of her case. She is so talented, and such a vulnerable and discontented spirit so early, that one's heart can not avoid approaching her due to her victimization. This is not seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, one has to come to an agreement with what the film is trying to say: it is a biopic of a very affected girl, but it is also a film about a nation that can not act together ; that is very clear in the book but, interestingly, not in the film where the elect at Harvard are even more entangled than the average of university students. Finally, the film can not convey any of these messages convincingly, and that is very bad. Is Prozac something good or bad, or a mixed blessing or an apparent need in a country where so many people can not function without a chemical crutch? These are difficult and challenging concepts to work with, and writing does not attempt to address any of them in a more or less attractive way. The Challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional America, but it does not have the effect that it is supposed to have due to the transversal and insufficient development of control issues. <br /> <br /> Ricci's performance is tight and sincere, and one of the best of his acting career. <br /> <br /> Michele Williams is also excellent in her role.
