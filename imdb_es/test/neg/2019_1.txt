Being a big fan of horror movies, one of the most difficult things to consider is the lack of abundance of good films in the genre, and having seen hundreds of them in my life, I must say that Dracula 3000 is, by far, the most boring. , piece of garbage lame and badly done that I had the misfortune to see. Stay away from this movie! It's so bad that it's not even laughable. The special effects (did I say "special"?) Probably were achieved by spending a couple of large, the performance is terrible and the script should have ended up in the trash bin after the first reading of the study that decided to face this miserable project. The whole movie was filmed literally in a warehouse. Also, for you who like nudity in your movies, do not be fooled by the rating of R. If you're thinking that you have the opportunity to see Erika Eleniak even half naked, you're wrong. She is fully dressed throughout the film. And the cover is completely deceptive! There is no scene anywhere in the movie that marginally resembles the incredible cover they placed on the box to attract unsuspecting horror fans. <br /> <br /> Too bad the score is from 1 to 10. I would give this movie to -10. Be warned Do not waste your money or your time in this.
