My wife and I remember that this movie was much better than it is. When we rented it last weekend, we asked ourselves if we were watching the same movie we had seen 22 years ago. We both agreed that we were probably remembering the television series, which, in its one-hour segments, was forced to close story lines. This film leaves many loose threads, as others have mentioned here ... basically, the story line of each main character is left unresolved. <br /> <br /> However, I like the title song.
