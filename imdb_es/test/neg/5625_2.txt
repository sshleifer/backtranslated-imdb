What atrocity. I'm not someone who demands total credibility of a movie, but the plot and script of "Killing Zoe" are so naive that I found myself grinning through the full 90 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> Readers of these reviews will have already discovered the plot: Zoe, a prostitute who falls in love with the American hacker Zed, is also an employee of the bank that Zed will help steal in a Heist of the Day. Bastille br /> <br /> The film tense one's credibility from the first moment. Zed and Zoe's night of magic is highly prosaic, and Zoe's claims of having experienced the orgasm of a lifetime seem to mirror the teen fantasies of the screenwriter more than any real chemistry on screen. Zed's complete indifference when his friend Eric pulls Zoe out of the hotel room almost does not set the stage for his later and strong bond. <br /> <br /> In act two, Eric's bohemian gang: the losers addicted to drugs who lead a marginal life of petty crime: get ready for your big heist with a night in the city. Here Roger Avary's main goal seems to be to show that he knows something about drugs. A secondary thread implies convincing us (through an interminable repetition) that Eric is really, really happy to see his old friend Zed again. Very happy. Eric's excessive extravagance and affection for what Eric worries about Zed is not even remotely credible; Take a look, for example, at your fake fun when you discover a dead cat in your apartment building. The development of the characters that will accompany us throughout the rest of the film is a last minute idea. <br /> <br /> The robbery is a disaster, understandable, since the plan is ridiculous and the criminals are complete amateurs. This is where Avary continues to pay homage to his idol Quentin Tarantino by demonstrating that he can be more violent than violent. In reality, however, it is more boring than boring. To increase the excitement, there is an additional security guard hidden inside the main safe. This was boring in video games, and now it's boring. <br /> <br /> Zoe is taken hostage during the robbery, but despite our expectation that she will play a pivotal role, she simply feels pretty. Or more precisely, Avary does not do anything with it. In the last five minutes, literally, it comes alive, breaks the hostage situation and saves the grateful, but still stuns Zed for not suffering the consequences of his crime. It's impossible to say why he does not care if he gets involved in the crime, or why he does not give a fuck. After all, he did not have the opportunity to see that he is more decent than the rest of the gang. <br /> <br /> Throughout, the dialogue is forced and false. A lot of this is in French. As a native speaker, I can certify that it does not sound even remotely. Eric's sweet and sugary speech, which alternates rapidly with the boast of rude men, is bound to be charming and frightening, but instead it's just a trade. Meanwhile, his scared cat accomplices are more Scooby-Doo than Thomas Crown. When Eric is shot down in a ridiculous example of excessive force, we can all breathe a sigh of relief: like the bank hostages, we will soon be freed from this miserable trial.
