Despite the potentially fascinating premise, the Series 7 is a weak attempt to attack reality television. Apart from its production values ​​in the gangue basement, which have an appearance of more than 10 minutes, the overall tone of the film is wrong. Several critics have attacked the performance in the film, but I think the real problem is this scant attempt to turn the film into a farce. Apart from the fact that jokes are not funny (a pregnant woman swears a lot, a girl receives a lot of weapons), it does not fit with the overall tone of the movie. If the creators had made the 7 Series look surprisingly close to real reality, the editions in colorful but hollow colors, the boring sound effects, the radical movements of the camera, perhaps their point would have been more solid or at least more acceptable Instead, the Series 7 meanders through the already weary world of death and the game show. You can imagine the director slapped his back for saying the obvious.
