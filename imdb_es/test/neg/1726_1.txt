Like many others, I counted on the appearance of Dennis Hopper so that this would not be a complete waste of time. I was sadly wrong. All the negative that is said about this flic is more than true. However, what the cake takes is the horrible and horrible story of the main character. <br /> <br /> Here is explained why: the planet could be destroyed, the ONLY way to recover, to save ALL the human race through it, is to get so many intelligent, capable, pleasant and competent people Enter an underground hiding place. And Dennis Hopper is the only visionary / scientist with vision who prepared for the worst, and he has realized this. But what is the main motivation of Stevens (Sonny D'Angelo)? He is angry because Dennis has decided who will be saved or condemned! While clearly explained to Stevens that the character of Dennis has done everything possible to warn people of the danger, but that he laughed at him. Hopper's character was the boy with the finger on the dike, and now Stevens is blaming him for "pick and choose". And if that is not enough, he wants to prevent everyone from entering this hiding place, because "is not that fair?" And ... he is responsible for the death of the only man who is the savior of humanity! OH MY GOD, how stupid can you be? <br /> <br /> What is also maddening is that IMDb forces someone to write a minimum of ten lines about this garbage. I mean, TWO MILLION in budget, what could have been done with that? Think Clerks, Blair Witch and many other movies that have been made for less than $ 100,000 and were still better. AAAAARGH! I consider myself lucky to have not paid a penny to see this shit, and sitting down to this absolute, ugly-shit, is one of the most heroic things I've done this year. It's no wonder that the writers of this dung heap have had jobs as a camera operator and title designer before ...
