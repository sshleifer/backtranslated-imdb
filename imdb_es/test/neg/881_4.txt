Richard Gere and Diane Lane star in a romantic movie for girls with the type of ending that I really get angry with ... let's say it's not my cup of tea, just like the romances of the ten-cent store are not my cup of tea tea. <Br /> <br /> The plan has a doctor who stops at an inn and meets a woman with whom he has a deep but brief relationship. She goes to meet her separated son and she returns to his life. <br /> <br /> Well done and well done, the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot. This is the material of the romances of the ten-cent store that makes women faint and men shake their heads in disbelief. It would not be as bad for the movie as a meaningless romance, except that the film takes a turn in the final roll that is so out of left field to be completely unbelievable. Why do certain types of movies do stupid things like this? It really ruined it for me. <br /> <br /> If you like romance, give it a try, even if you wait for the cable.
