While there is much to recommend about Maetel Legend both in concept and in final product, ultimately it is a poor movie. In short, it is a recount of the early years of Maetel's life, which is generally not clear; At the same time, the writers take the opportunity to tell the story of Machine Empire. And as Leiji Matsumoto has trouble not including his other work, we have a starting point for Emeraldas, his sister, his mother: the queen of La Metalle and a bit of Galaxy Express 999 to develop the film. <br /> <br /> In short, Maetel is a princess on the planet La Metalle, a planet with an irregular orbit, which means that her cycle around the nearest sun is reaching a cold stage and that the artificial sun it's dying. The Planet becomes increasingly cold throughout history, thus increasing the sense of fatality. To protect her subjects and relatives, the Queen decides that mechanization is the only way to ensure the survival of the people of La Metalle. Enter Lord Hardgear, a robot / cyborg who provides the means to work. Through the film, the characters are left questioning mechanization, will they still be human? Can you trust Hardgear? Are there souls and hearts? So, for a fan of Matsumoto's work, there's a lot to enjoy, questions to answer, topics that continue, except that it's obvious that the movie should be an introduction, as well as a fan's curiosity. The negatives, mainly the animation, while Galaxy Express 999, a TV series from more than 20 years ago, has a poor quality animation and, sometimes, an incomplete character design, Maetel Legend has the worst features of the modern animation and, therefore, gives an air of respectability to the Galaxy. Express 999. The design is very detailed, but unfortunately the animation has suffered by leaving well-drawn characters that "slide", as in the movement of the backgrounds or the zoom of the camera, a quick way to animate. However, the few animated scenes are reused again and again in sequences of dreams, repetitions and extra scenes. Anyone who looks like the movie will wonder how many times Lord Hardgear can drink the same glass of wine. <br /> <br /> Next, the story. While everything seems very good, the final product is, in fact, a series of conversations of the plot that is repeated again and again with little effect, the number of times that the characters find the same problems and learn the same things is practically insulting to the audience and the characters, who apparently are much more articulate in previous incarnations. Add to all this a terrible character design, which seems lifeless, too exaggerated, and the public is left with a film so poorly managed that it could have been rewritten as a different film, at least the newcomers would not be left perplexed . . <br /> <br /> And yet, it really has its moments, the ending at least is amazing. The difficult situation of the citizens of La Metalle was quite emotional and rightly disturbing; I guess I find this whole man-machine issue disturbing. It is difficult to know who to recommend Maetel Legend, as it is not well animated, written or executed, as well as confusing once the obligatory cross-reference of Leiji Matsumoto is introduced. However, I can not help but be happy when the magnificent entrance of Three-Nine takes place, now that it is a good cinema. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars of 5, 2 if you're a fan.
