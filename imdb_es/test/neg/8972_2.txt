The star of the stage Grace Hayes stars in this little dark movie. After years of being on stage, she goes to visit a small university town to control her son who is being raised by his grandfather. The boy does not know who his mother is and when he sees him in a local malt shop, he is an imbecile. Part of the problem is that he is a college clown, the other part is that he is really spoiled. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that it turns out that mom is really quite rich and not only has she financed her son's life, but also a great contributor to college. So, she has the idea of ​​forcing the young person to mature. She talks to the man who is raising Peter and his assignment has been completely cut off, in the hope that he will rise to the occasion. It also turns out that she screws up the school because she thinks that all these children should stop playing and be more responsible. <br /> <br /> Now this is where it gets pretty silly. To show that they know the value of hard work, he hires them to sing and dance in the malt shop he has just bought. We talk about devised !! What happens next is like a long and not particularly good talent show or maybe a poor man's version of a musical by Judy Garland / Mickey Rooney! I suggest that children try to do something else to earn money ... or maybe sing and dance until people pay them to stop! I know I would pay them. <br /> <br /> Considering that talent is far from being talented, Peter is a bad actor and his change from lout to responsible adult is almost instantaneous, everything is a bit difficult to understand. . It's not a very good movie at all, this is a dark movie that should have gone dark. <br /> <br /> By the way, it's interesting that Mrs. Hayes' son in the movie, Peter, is actually his real-life son. The only problem with that is that Peter Lind Hayes is a truly horrible actor. He is not handsome enough to be an important man and he is boring and uninteresting or simply unpleasant. In particular, all the stupid impressions he makes are really bad and he has the charisma of gelatin that you eliminate from spam. Despite this terrible performance, she continued to have a successful acting career. Who would have believed it if you had seen it in ZIS BOOM BAH? Because here, it's as welcome as the Bubonic Plague!
