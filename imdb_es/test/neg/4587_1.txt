This movie enters my file "The worst movies ever made". I have a copy of this movie that I see when I want to laugh, and this is not even a comedy. I'm disappointed that such great actors have agreed to be on a piece of junk like that. This film is inaccurate (in its interpretation of hockey), offensive (to Canadians), and was not even so impressed with the performance. Even the story was a bit weak. If you've never seen this movie, you're lucky. If so, I'm sorry.
