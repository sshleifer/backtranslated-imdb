The stunning blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young widow who is not so distressed in the mansion on the hill and tells her story to a television reporter in Monroeville, Virginia. And among the well-endowed community, she is suspected of being involved in the death of her elder husband. That's James Brolin, trusting like a baby in arms. Teledrama flashback made in Canada, based on an article that appeared in the magazine Vanity Fair. It must be true! Whatever it is, it is much more romance than mystery, and a very familiar tale. Does Leggy Species star in Henstridge as a palliative care nurse looking for gold? It could happen, I suppose. And it's good to see Brolin in an important role after his titchy turn in Antwone Fisher, even if he does not get to the end of the picture. The end of the photo? It does not even reach the beginning of the image. That's why flashbacks were invented, of course.
