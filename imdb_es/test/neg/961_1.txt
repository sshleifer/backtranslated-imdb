Great story and great main actors (Quaid and Ryan), but the film suffers from bad direction, bad script and bad script. The main actors do their part but they could not save the movie at all. Too bad because this could have been a good 80's Hitchcock style suspense / mystery / thriller. Ryan looked very young and fresh in this case. A good look for Ryan's big fans ...
