The plot here is simple. The country boy, Lem (Farrell) goes to the city to sell the wheat crop, falls in love with a waitress, Kate (Duncan) and marries her, taking her to a hostile father and a group of reapers hungry for women. There are nuances of THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WANTED, and the MICE AND MEN here. The courtship, which takes place in two long sequences set in the restaurant, consumes the first half hour and develops lethargic. Lem is so weak that he allows his father to mistreat his wife, who is proposed by Mac (Richard Alexander), one of the reapers, to go with him. Duncan and Alexander are the only good things in this tedious potboiler, which lacks the cinematic ideas and beauty we expect from Murnau. Farrell's character does not have a spine, so we end up encouraging a "real man" (Mac) to get Kate away from everything. With the sympathy of the skewed audience, the film loses its narrative progression. The conversion of the father at the end of the film is unrealistic and incredible, which allows an artificial outcome. This movie is only for the fans of the stars and the director; the general public does not have to bother.
