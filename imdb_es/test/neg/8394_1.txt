When my girlfriend and I went to see this movie, we did not know what to expect, but she assured me that she had good reviews. So I continued with that. We enter the cinema, buy tickets and go to the screen. After a while of being there waiting for the movie to begin, no one else came through the door. I had a lot of suspicions, since there are usually at least a couple of other people in any movie projection. The movie eventually started and we sat there. After a while of very little dialogue and very "artistic" grumpy scenes, I was beginning to realize why we were the only people there. It was disjointed with random cuts from the main story to children in a skate park, the story does not make sense. The child was supposed to have committed a crime when he did not do it and, if he did, he does not respond to anyone and should not feel innocent just because he wrote that letter, he should have been punished. This movie did not make any sense at all. I have no idea why we did not go to recover our money in part through the movie. I tried to give it a try, I suppose. There was little concept in this movie, and the execution was shameful. The writer, the director and almost everyone else who made this film should have realized what they were doing and stopped. It's one more hour I'll never be back. I'm sorry to anyone who has liked this movie, but ... it's so horrible, really really bad. Oh, well, at least I'll never have to be subdued again.
