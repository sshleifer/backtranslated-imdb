You can only describe this with one word and that would be WOW! Wow, I really did not believe that shit like this could be thrown. If you see a movie called ninja, then you expect to see at least some great martial artists, right? However, none of these guys knows anything about martial arts and it seems that they went to China and chose the first people they saw on the street and trained them for a day in martial arts, that's the level of their martial arts skills ! The actors are overreacting, the special effects are ridiculous and there is no argument that makes sense. This is the worst martial arts movie I've seen and I've seen many!
