You may not believe it, but when the credits for this movie were published, I looked up the name of the director. When I saw it, I recorded it in my memory and I never forgot it. This movie is beyond terrible. It makes Ed Wood's films look like Orsen Welles. At least the B movies are entertaining, this was an experience that appeases the soul. The quality was so bad that I started to wonder who allowed this to happen. <br /> <br /> I heard that Uwe Boll runs fourteen miles per day. This is because wherever your movies are shown, people must expel them with flames and hairpin. The script was terrible, the lighting was like that of a high school football game, and the cinematography was just above the quality of Roger Patterson's Bigfoot video. The performance was executed by people too ashamed of the production to say their lines with credibility. In the end it was a movie that Alan Smithee would not have put his name on. That day I learned to avoid any film of this man despite the circumstances. From what I hear, this is not a bad thing to do.
