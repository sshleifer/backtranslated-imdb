I liked the sober character that Laura Linney played in 'Love Actually', and she is very good in 'Man of the Year'. <br /> <br /> But wow. Robin Williams does not give as much performance, with a couple of minor exceptions, this was weak. It is possible that Laura Linney was not evil, but the editing violated her character or was just a sad performance by director Barry Levinson. <br /> <br /> And I think it was Barry Levinson who got old. So many weak performances, so unequal results have to be the fault of the administration. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are excellent at supporting roles. Goldblum has a sinister side with gusto, and Walken's combination of animator manager and commentator for the film is wonderful. <br /> <br /> But the story is a clich√©, the presentation looks like it could have been (it should have been) good image, and too many actions are half-hearted. The rhythm, the history and the direction appear weak, in comparison with, for example, "Central Office" (parody of "Secret of My Success").
