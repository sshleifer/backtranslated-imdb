What a pity. What a terrible shame. The table was set, the candles were on, the guests had arrived ... and then ... <br /> <br /> ... well, really, nothing. Only pretentious fool. It could have been great, it's okay, maybe it's not great, but it could have been very good. All the elements were there, but at the end of the day, the bottle was empty: THERE IS NO SOMETHING OF LIGHT! How that happened is a mystery with everything available to the director ... <br /> <br /> ... the story was quite brave, although it certainly needed considerable work, possibly with several final rewrites to fix the story and reinforce the history. characters a lot (the only thing that was consistent and constant and unnecessarily tight was the cinematography, but I'll get to that). But the direction was terrible, the performance was just that: _a-CTin-G_ with a heavy side of cheese and a lot of ham, and then the cinematography ... <br /> <br /> ... well, that was something contemplate! But only if you are in "Cinematography 101 of the film school like never using a professional film camera under any circumstances". Obviously, the student had fallen asleep during part of the introduction of the conference and only heard "... use a professional film camera ..." and then return to earth when the sentence ended. <br /> <br /> What Can I say; Amateur and pretentious until the end! I can only see this film destined to appeal as Chick Flick because it is supposed to be sad, but then it deflates and ends up being "sad" (as an excuse for a movie) ... so even those "Chicks" Do not leave cheat for this schlockenspiel! <br /> <br /> PS. I felt bad for Miss Diaz. She is much better at her craft than this movie allowed her to be, even though she was totally Miscast. Actually, I'm sorry for everyone in this movie, except for the director and (you guessed it) the director of photography. I say 'First against them against the wall when the revolution comes!' Well, not really, after all, "it was just a movie," but maybe a good "tar and pen and stay out of town" could be more satisfying or at least much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> TTFN :-(
