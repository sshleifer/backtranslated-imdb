Ok, I thought it would be horrible. But when I saw it ... I was wrong. Emily Bergl did an excellent job as did Jason London. Sue Snell was underused and written. The evil ones were fine, Dylan Bruno and Rachel Blanchard are definitely the standouts. As for the things that teenagers do and how people claim that everything is wrong. Whatever is. My friends and I used the term "swank" a lot and I drove a car and asked someone to guide me while I was changing. It's almost everything there is. I've just never been to a post-game party in such a big house with its own light show ... Deaths are good. The best involves a pair of lenses, a spear gun and a pond ... all in that order. I must say that there will be people who hate him ... but I am not one of them.
