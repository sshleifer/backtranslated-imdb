I checked this at the Vancouver International Film Festival and it did not impress me. <br /> <br /> The only area of ​​the movie that I enjoyed was the comment about making movies. For the most part, this movie seemed random and somewhat fantastic (I do not say it in a complementary way, though) and just plain silly. It was as if he were mixing fantasy with everyday life, which may seem intriguing in some movies, but the fantasy simply seemed unnecessarily perverse. <br /> <br /> My criticism of this film is not about the actors, but about the story. itself. I found it boring and narcissistic. I wanted my money back, but considering it was a Film Festival, that was not going to happen.
