I became interested in this movie because someone had made a beautiful video for Bj√∂rks "Bachelorette" with clips of it. So I saw the movie. And in fact it is amazingly beautiful. A masterpiece of animation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story does not continue. It begins well, with interesting plots about people who surround the possession of the Bride Rose, but suddenly the elevators fill with water and lose their walls, people move away and, finally, without any reason, Utena transforms into a car, and a high-speed pursuit occurs. <br /> <br /> I really like the Anime for its ability to create alternative universes, but this universe is just stupid. If you're going to watch this movie, turn off the sound, it's better that way.
