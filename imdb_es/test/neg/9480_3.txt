Oh, yes, I admit that I have become guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of garbage. I can not say I was forced by the aliens who pointed a gun at me, tied me to a chair and prevented me from closing my eyes and then lit this horrible excuse for a movie. I did not do it with free will. I tortured myself deliberately. Let's see the fact here friends. - Acting is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous. - The development of the character is terrible - The characters that appear in the film are so clich√© that <br /> <br /> you would recognize them in your average comic book. - The edition is sloppy and unimaginative. - The camera work is low profile. - Dialogue is simply the worst in film history. - The address: well, let's say, I bet it was not Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> Then, to add to these facts, there was absolutely no talent involved with so many people. The director must be smoking crack now to forgive himself for inflicting this poison on the world. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: the passport to Paris is one of the worst movies that have been made. PERMANENT!
