I admit it now. This is one of the most false movies that have been made. But, in Mr. Sjogrens' defense, the "not really" scene was not all bad. <br /> <br /> And you should love the effort of going to Sweden only to find a sweet 15-year-old Swedish girl, let her speak Swedish by pretending to be Henry's Jewish mother (dennis hopper). <br /> <br /> What makes this scene so perfect is that Henry's father responds to the German-speaking Swedish girl (Jewish?) in German ... <br /> <br /> The The best actress / actress of all in the movie must be the nun who takes care of Henry's mother, this is a woman who has not had any experience in acting, but still presents the most convincing performance of all. <br /> <br /> In general, this flick is nostalgic for me personally, it is after all that a publication in the IMDb database gave me. : D <br /> <br /> // Feel like a movie star *
