If you read the summary of the plot of "Mad Max", you just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the movie. He also discovered that "Mad Max" takes place in post-apocalyptic Australia, which will be useful because otherwise he will have no idea what is going on. The film, made in 1979, really tries to be "A Clockwork Orange" (1971) by Stanley Kubrick, only that this film, in all its strangeness, really makes sense and leaves an impact. This film does not do either and ends up being a game full of car / bicycle tricks that crashes like all the vehicles in the movie do. <br /> <br /> The first thing that fails in "Mad Max" is that it tries to sell itself. like a tale of revenge when no vigilante seems to take revenge until the last 20 minutes. If the first hour was condensed to 20-30 minutes and then the final 20 were added and then another hour, "Mad Max would be a great action movie with a great vigilante protagonist." Instead, Mel Gibson has to wait and act like a ladybug for 2/3 of the movie and then have a sudden epiphany to seek revenge.I still have to see the sequel "Road Warrior" and I must admit that I'm excited about that just because I want to know what he does next. It was for the most part a waste of time. <br /> <br /> George Miller does a great job of action here, but his exaggerated symbolism is absurd and the unbearable reaction sequence every time a character discovers something horrible like a hand burned or what has completely ruined those moments.It's a terribly clich√©d B movie technique. <br /> <br /> There's absolutely no thematic value or subtle criticism of society in this movie no matter what. or what you think A great sci-fi action movie at least makes a point, but the free violence made by chance, the strange motorcyclists says nothing of value. Even the villain Toecutter feels Alex's modeling of "Mechanism" only that more ugly and completely unthinkable. The violence of the PG does not allow the violence of this gang to establish itself and obtain a reaction from the spectator, it only takes away everything. <br /> <br /> I'll give credit for the amount of things that the film crew exploded and crashed into things and Miller does a great job of making you feel the intensity of the collisions. Everything else is mediocre at best and after an hour of mediocrity, you get something good and the movie ends 20 minutes later. I'm just crossing my fingers "Road Warrior" will fulfill the expectations of where this film ends, otherwise, it's more time wasted. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
