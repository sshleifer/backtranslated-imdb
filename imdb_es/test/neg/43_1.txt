I was completely bored with this movie, melodramatic for no apparent reason. Everything becomes so serious and people are insulting with really silly expressions. Then there is a serial killer who can apparently kill a person to get the title of serial killer. Well, the serial killer likes butterflies and is illustrated by the sound effects you might hear in the dream sequence of most modern movies. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why? I have no idea. I really really want to be scary, but I think in this universe what is scary is talking a lot and adding dark noises. Just for the record, it's not a horror movie, it's definitely a suspense movie (barely). Filmmakers today need to do their homework before making "horror" movies or at least call a movie a "horror" movie. it makes me say (in many words, ironically) "acolytes, they take an eternity to say nothing".
