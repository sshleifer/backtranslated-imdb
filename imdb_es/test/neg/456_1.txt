The One is a very successful name program, especially because it is close to being the only prime-time network that hardly sees more than one person. <br /> <br /> When I first heard of The One, I thought to myself: "Weee! Another song show! We do not have enough of those!" and then proceeded to tie my helmet and run through my house hitting my head with blunt objects and sharp corners. Because in all honesty, the constant pain and suffering throughout the year inflicted by having only one or two reality shows based on "talent" is not enough. We needed another. And not just anyone - "EL" Uno. The one that has slightly less attractive competitors with a little less talent. The one that has a point a little less, although it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which that is possible. The one that has useless images of the participants when they are not acting included. Because I care what Johnny Sings-a-lot does in his free time! I really do it! Now, you may be thinking, "Hey! On the entire continent of North America, less than 4 million people watched the first episode, does not that mean that this show sucks?" Well, I tell you that less than 4 million people in North America have syphilis, so sometimes low numbers bring good news, do not they? Think about it. <br /> <br /> In the end, The One can be horribly unoriginal, a program that even the television network could not promote because they also realize how utterly useless it is, but it's still not syphilis ! Hurrah!
