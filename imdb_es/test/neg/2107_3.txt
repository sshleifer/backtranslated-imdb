For your credit, this is one of your most competent garbage pieces, and that is because there is a good amount of blood and an interesting version of "Snakes on an airplane". But, if there are more examples of the inconsistency behind the new Asylum scam, they are the two characters who are initially illegal immigrants and can not understand or speak in English to a Texas man who sneaks across the border. On a train and meet a friend, they begin to understand and speak perfect English. <br /> <br /> Besides being a pretty bad description of a Hollywood formula, "Snakes on a train" is absolutely boring. At least, with "Snakes on a Plane" we had the opportunity to see the comedian actors and try to be remotely interesting. The delivery of Mallachi Brothers presents some of the most boring characters I've seen, from an electrical engineer (of course, I wonder how it will be useful later on), to some fool surfers, to our two main characters who try to fight. The curse of snakes that lurks in the husband's wife. <br /> <br /> "Snakes" is never entertaining, and even when it is very bloody, it is never as good as it has the opportunity to be, because "Snakes" could have been a funny short film, and instead, he takes himself too seriously, and never puts him aside at any time. Instead of taking your small budget and making original movies that can set a precedent, instead, force your small budget to work against them in these fakes. While the Mallachi brothers seem to be trying, the train seems incredibly artificial. <br /> <br /> It seems almost a play with these inconsistent and very insubstantial pieces that try desperately to look like train carriages, while from time to time it trembles, the bottom of the windows looks blurred and the Sound effects are activated from time to time to let us know that they are actually on a train; Not to mention that in such an extensive train, there are only about ten passengers. And beyond the train fight, and a prolonged sex scene, we are forced to be subjected to a plot that makes no sense. And even managers can not avoid the fact that the "lethal" snakes that travel on this train are far from being poisonous or dangerous. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie wobbles in just a minute from the snake carnage and a bad secondary plot by a former drug agent trying to annoy a passenger. All this boring exposure ends with a really ridiculous climax in which a poorly computer-generated snake (I saw a better animation in the Super Nintendo) swallows the whole train completely, and then distributes it in a method that should have been practiced from the beginning. . The asylum is again a score. <br /> <br /> The asylum is once again, with a trick, lazy, horribly directed and bored with another better movie. "Snakes on a train" is taken too seriously, and that is why it is never entertaining or memorable.
