The real surprise of this light and effortless film is how a first class cast met for what is nothing more than an uninspiring affair. Presumably it was a proverbial snowball rolling down a hill, bringing together rhythm, size and shape. One can imagine that by the time Miranda Richardson was contacted by her agent, the conversation followed the following lines: 'Do you want to film a movie in Dublin with a script by Neil Jordan? Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are already inside! This is a boring "comedy" in which Michael Caine and Dylan Moran try to achieve a well-planned bustle in which Moran must imitate a gang boss in London (whose arrival is imminent) to collect a considerable amount of cash. from local leader Michael Gambon. The rest is simply a forgettable romp that, fortunately, has ended quite quickly. Moran is slightly funny in some places, but in this evidence he adapts better to life on the small screen in hit comedies such as Black Books. Caine is not challenged in his role and offers stable performance without being overburdened. One can only imagine what made him sign up for this film, it may not have even been a summer in Dublin since many of the scenes look positively in the background. Gambon really steals the program, and anyone who has captured some of his performances as Have I Got News For You will know he is a wonderfully funny man. But overall, the result is disappointing, and it seems that he makes a living that Neil Jordan was making quality films like Mona Lisa's.
