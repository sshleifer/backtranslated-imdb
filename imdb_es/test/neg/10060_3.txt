This movie is on my list of the worst movies ever made. The story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is happening or the reason for the actions of the characters. All films must have an internal logic, and this movie just does not have it, the story does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> Seeing Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime. Faye Dunaway is the lucky one, because she plays the victim and is killed at the beginning of the movie. On the other hand, Donald Sutherland must be an incredible actor because he manages to look good in spite of bad direction and bad writing; His performance is credible and manages to stay in character despite everything. <br /> <br /> If Dame Agatha Christie were alive, she would die laughing! The movie is so bad!
