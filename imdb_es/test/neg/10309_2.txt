Do not worry when looking at the cover of the DVD, Sandra Bullock only appears a maximum of 5 minutes in total in this cult classic. The entertainment value here is very high. <br /> <br /> To name just a few of the many highlights to which attention should be paid: <br /> <br /> - The evil voices duplicated by the main bad guys - The special weapons chamber - What rare masks and costumes of successful assassins - The striking ways to catch a bullet and hit the ground - The abundance of shots from the bottom up - The space scene in which Bullock falls unconscious on the street - The boy from the Italian Mafia of clich√© Moe (LaMotta) - The cheap background music of the synth - Hypnotizing hypnotized hypnotized and fascinating <br /> <br /> And last but not least: the scenes of fistfight of super-cumbersome fists. I wish there had been more of those ... <br /> <br /> Extra point for the successful attempt to make me laugh out loud.
