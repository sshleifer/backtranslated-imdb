This film should have been cataloged as three summaries of linked films to form a feature film (including many shots of people walking slowly through corridors and dark streets). BE WARNING! The first hour of this movie is simply a replay of the first two Aztec films told by the main character. The real movie does not start until the thing is almost finished. I must say that overacting on Bat's part is pretty hilarious. <br /> <br /> As for the robot, I thought that a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not look like a human. Bat's "robot" consists of a reanimated radioactive corpse enclosed in a leading robot body. As Tom Servo said, "He's not that impressive - he does not even have knees!" That, and the robot takes about an hour to pass the wood through the room. But once it catches you, BEWARE! He will disintegrate you with a touch (driven by the radio? How easy!). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie when accompanied by Joel and the Bots. Otherwise, you're just a glutton for abuse.
