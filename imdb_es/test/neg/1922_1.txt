*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** HERE ON THE EARTH / (2000) 1/2 * (out of every four) <br /> <br /> Mark "Piznarski" Here on Earth "holds the record of a film that contains the most recycled material in 96 minutes, literally, every gadget, cliché and element of family plot are somewhere here, there's nothing unique, original or fresh about it, God, what an agonizing moving image for sit down; I wish I would watch the movie during its theatrical release last year so I could have won on my year's worst list.This is the kind of movie where the story becomes instantly obvious, and it's going downhill since the first credits, and Worst of all, he takes it seriously. "Here on Earth" is clearly one of the most horrible and painful films that has ever been produced. <br /> <br /> "Here on Earth" is a film for teenagers, so it must contain some of the Hollywood movies. Those who are precious and inexperienced enough to accept a role in a film as bad as this one. Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett conform to that varied description, and assume the main roles by assault. Klein plays Kelley, an arrogant and insolent student with a rich father (cliché number one). He will graduate as the best student and will attend the Ivy League college following in the footsteps of his father (Stuart Wilson). This establishes the cliché of "I do not want your life", in which the father tries to control the life of his son, while the son refuses to rebel. Shoot Kelley's deceased mother who committed suicide a while ago. When his father brings another woman home, he brutally questions his intentions (the cliché of "nobody can replace mom" counts as number two). <br /> <br /> Josh Hartnett plays Jasper, a character on the opposite side of society to Kelley. His family owns a local restaurant. Enter your longtime love interest, Samantha Cavanaugh (Leelee Sobieski) a waitress at the restaurant that covers her sister (who has no purpose instead of controlling the next scene) when Jasper and Kelley act like childish idiots in competing with their cars and (oh no) crashing into the restaurant, causing them to burst into flames. (Conflicts between the rich and the poor will count as cliché number three). <br /> <br /> The malicious car chase prepares Kelley and Jasper for an artificial and plausible conflict. They get into trouble with the law, but because this film feels the need to exist, the local judge orders them an alternative when it comes to serving: they must work together to help rebuild the restaurant. <br /> <br /> The two children Work hard during the summer growing strong and getting a good tan. Samantha's gaze catches Kelley and romantic sparks fly. Jasper is jealous, but wants the best for his true love (cliché number four). His parents (Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood) disapprove of his little romantic triangle (cliché number five), but continue twice with Jasper without thinking twice. His father is also the local sheriff, what a surprise (we have that cliché number six of the melodramatic). <br /> <br /> The romantic feelings devised between Kelley and Samantha count as cliché number seven. But Samantha's relationship with Jasper is never defined, then, how can there be a romantic tension? If the movie is going to induce to get involved in Samantha's choice between the two youngsters, then we need to see the two characters on both sides. The film shows Jasper as a distraction to his "legitimate love", Kelley. It is clear that Jasper really loves her, but it is also clear that he does not love him. This will absolutely kill the romantic tension at the beginning of the story. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski does not hurt here; however, its charm and friendly performance do not fit a two-time character like Samantha. John Hartnett is also right for the role of Jasper, but the movie gives him nothing to do except argue with Kelley. Chris Klein manages to make a piece name for himself here; He spends much of the film shirtless, sweaty and overworked. Unfortunately, he does not show his ability to act, perhaps because he has very little. The cast is much more talented. Bruce Greenwood provides the best performance in the film, but does not have enough screen time to store anything, except for a few brief moments. I also enjoyed the performance of Stuart Wilson, who fits perfectly into the role of a rich and controlling father of high social status. <br /> <br /> Then we lean over the problem of Samantha's knee exactly one hour and ten minutes after the movie (another spoiler ahead). What is this? She has a serious incurable disease (another additional element in the image, approximately number eight). His terminal illness brings together the two young people who compete with each other as friends, well, at least I think that's what the film intended to show, that the loss of a loved one by two nemeses can unite both (cliché number nine). <Br /> <br /> Klein rehearses her valedictorian speech to show that her character is more than a superficial stereotype, but we have seen this many times before she preferred a rich character instead of a deep sentimental one that hides real feelings (cliché number, um, was it ten)? The conflicts between Kelley and Jasper are desperate and disorderly; A comment from "your mother" triggers a fist fight as they rebuild the establishment. There is a retread of "Armageddon", while Samantha and Kelley unfold in an open field, horny as hell, while slowly moving their fingers around their body, naming areas after US cities. UU The film uses alcohol as a means to increase romantic tension: an intoxicated Kelley plays the fool after quarreling with Samantha's date, Jasper, but the next day recites wishes just to dance (cliché number, oh no, I'm losing the account).
