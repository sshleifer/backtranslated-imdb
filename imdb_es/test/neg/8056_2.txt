I'm probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy "Frisk," the project that put Todd Verow on the map, if that's where it is. I appreciate that someone had the guts to face Dennis Cooper and not get away from the material; Verow quite rolls on it. Judging by what he has done since then, he is very suitable for that kind of material and should probably stick to it. "Vacationland," a "teen dating" movie, is so wrong that it becomes an involuntary comedy, and I'm disappointed that I have to report that. <br /> <br /> First of all, our hero, the high school senior "Joe" is too old to play 18 years. When we later meet a man who is supposed to be Joe's teacher, it is confusing, since the sweaty-faced boy looks much younger than the student who is teaching. Joe's mother looks younger than him and does not "act" at older ages either. Second, in Joe's early scenes, he seemed to be playing or experiencing mental challenges. To his credit, he improved as the movie progressed and I realized he was "playing young", but it just was not working, it was strange. <br /> <br /> It has been 15 minutes before there is anything. He revealed about who, what and where these people are, and why we should care. The second scene in the movie is a little more business in a men's room that, considering where the story is going, is absolutely superfluous; the secondary plot with the teacher is not going anywhere, even as a "rite of passage" for our "young" hero ... one minute, Joe is nervously trying to touch the bathroom (a scene so little erotic that makes you truly I ask what they will see in practice), the next minute is an expert in sexual blackmail and double violent crossover. This is followed by an extended scene with the character that we will later learn is "Andrew", and that is all we learn about him, apart from the fact that he is apparently gay, but he has not left yet. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of cramming at the 1:44 run time (which lasts about 20 minutes, I can not imagine how it was played with the insensibly long and senseless scenes of Joe walking away); a secondary plot drawn from "Gods And Monsters" with an elderly patron who utters rhetorical comments of nothing played by an actor who obviously can not remember his lines (he is conveniently sent in a way that Dickens could have found) slow week); an almost four-way n-match mix between boys and their girlfriends, a vagabond who hits homosexuals, a wise sage in the form of a queen nellie (and Queen Nellie has not suddenly taken over the role of the "whore with the heart of gold" as the most tired type of stereo?) that exists only to degrade; Blackmail, theft, murder, alcohol consumption and the abuse of music software in loop for the recording of the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> What you will NOT find in this movie is any interior part that establishes master shots; we are expected to imagine that we are in an airport, a grocery store and a classroom, since all the scenes in these places consist of close-ups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of ​​places that production should not have been able to afford . One thing they could get seems to have been a real gay bar; Either it's the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in Bangor, Maine, since the bar never has any customers. Another good laugh occurred when the actors were supposed to shout about the dance music that, obviously, did not come from the speakers, but was more than the music of the "score". <br /> <br /> The plots and characters come and go, the emotions are illegible and the dialogue, clearly inspired by Dennis Cooper, is "talking in the movies", which means that in reality humans do not talk about this way. Since we are not given any information about these characters, it is impossible to worry about what happens to them; it's as if Joe and his companions someday appeared outside the ether and simply ceased to exist once the credits come out (certainly, the character of Joe's sister, an aspiring Jennifer Gray who is crazy about Bohemia, seems to simply "stop ", we never know where she is in Los Angeles or what is her problem ... but again ... does it matter?). Visually, the movie looks very good at times, more than a testament to new developments in HD video than anything else, I suspect. However, the editing is quite clumsy (there was a great edition, Joe is posing naked and says: "I wanted to play sports, but ..." and we cut a shot that revealed his "ass ...", ha ha ). The composition is also rare at times (I thought I was watching SCTV's "Persona" parody when the boys talked together in bed and visually it seemed as if their noses were glued to the whole scene). <br /> <br /> One feels that Verow is really refraining from making a "naughty" movie or something rougher than he usually does, and maybe he should not have stayed behind (the foamy toothpaste / sexual fantasy) it worked fine, I thought, although the tone was out of touch with the rest of the movie) ... he produces and directs this "sensitive coming of age" story as Herschell Gordon Lewis directed films without gore ... porn movies without sex in them. I had some involuntary laughter from this and it was not boring, it was not very good either.
