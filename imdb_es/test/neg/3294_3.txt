I grew up watching comedies like Seinfeld, Roseanne, Simpsons, etc., in other words, conventional television. Over the years, many of the sitcoms have gone on the air and, of them, a very small percentage is really smart and fun. The War at Home is an excellent example of most modern American comedy. <br /> <br /> I give the program a 3 out of 10 because it is what it pretends to be, a comedy, but it does not. It seems that they go out of their way to be a good comedy. A good comedy should make you take off your feet with their great jokes, you should not be able to see them coming and in TWAH I see almost all the jokes that come. The characters are probably the most simplistic and horrible stereotypes I've seen on the screen, and the acting is not very good, except for the father who plays a stereotyped beer drinker, sports lover, perfect American idiot. <br /> <br /> Poor Assets, incredible characters and jokes that do not surprise you with this show off to a point where you can not see it. If you do not have cable and would like to see a comedy that is worth watching, try Boston Legal. It is more worth your time.
