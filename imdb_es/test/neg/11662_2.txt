Now I remember what the "indie" filmmakers were stealing before Pulp Fiction. It was David Lynch, right? <br /> <br /> Cazé this thing to see Kyle Secor. What a waste of a perfectly good Bayliss. It was so painful to see it, as when someone you love is terribly sick and there is nothing you can do. <br /> <br /> Almost all the clichés of the book: the desert, the psychopath, the peculiar boss of the mafia, the cyclist, Tracy Walker (who fortunately was only in one scene, but I kept waiting for him to reappear and say something strange and deep like "If a man wants to know where he's going, he has to look where he's been." or some artificial garbage like that.) I have a theory of why so many Indians have little location in the desert. I think it's because they can save money on lighting. <br /> <br /> If you like to feel pain, find this movie and take a look. If you're a Kyle Secor fan, check out the Homicide replays on Court TV. If you want a good and peculiar road thriller, check out Wild At Heart. <br /> <br /> There is a reason why no one has heard of Delusion! My God, what a waste of a good title.
