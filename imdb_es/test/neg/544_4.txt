The Comic Strip featured actors from 'The Young One', a comedy based on students of the 80's. The features of the comic strip included parodies of westerns, 'The famous 5' and The Professionals - all much more fun than this. Having said that, Alexei Sayle does a good job as a traffic cop with ambition and the soundtrack presents the best music of the time. 5/10
