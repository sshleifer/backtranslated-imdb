Interesing theme. Pathetic delivery - script and direction. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Miles, melts and has his first emergency life restoration surgery in the world. This is where the fun begins. The underlying problem is that Miles does not have SOUL! This is used to explain his almost erratic behavior of being indirectly responsible for two deaths (I think this is the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). <br /> <br /> On the livelier side, Miles prefers the strange brandy glasses, the burning fireplaces and his young, mature cousin. The ending actually does justice to this movie. <br /> <br /> Some thoughts: 1. The producer $$$ broke up to create this gut. J.D. Feigelson was the screenwriter and one (or only) producer. It seems that he did not learn a lesson on "how not to give life to an interesting idea" when one sees his other writing credits. This will support the credibility of this script. <br /> <br /> 2. Now available on DVD !!! This is really scary. It should always be in "Bottom of the shelf" in VHS format. <br /> <br /> 3. A reincarnated human without a soul will be the fault of an evil entity. <br /> <br /> 4. The score offers minimal support. Not even a fit Jerry Goldsmith could save it. <br /> <br /> 5. It deserved the 0230 time slot on television and a more entertaining touch than the infomercials + test patterns with which I was competing at the time of my viewing. <br /> <br /> 6. Fortunately, it did not generate any sequel to Wes Craven's "Nightmare" franchise. Chiller Too: The Return Return of Miles, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Despite my rating of 1, I still recommend this movie as a great example of how to kill a career as an actor or screenwriter. This should apply to the direction, however, Wes Craven will be eternally exempt due to his only good piece of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" 1984.
