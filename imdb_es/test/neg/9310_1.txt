I can not stress how bad this movie is. This director took all the unintelligent and unintelligent photos to make these people look so "distressed". Why are your clothes so dirty? Why the hell would you make the new Clark Kent play a head game? He should be expelled from the movies for the rest of his life, Buddy Giovinazzo. <br /> <br /> I take the offense to this fool who wants to train real actors as bullies and less life as a kind of intelligent joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent to play a crack addict? Why are they screaming so much? Why are everyone so bad? Why are these children so dirty? Would anyone want to be so dirty? Not even a nutcase. <br /> <br /> You need to grow up and not make movies again.
