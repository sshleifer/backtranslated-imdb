I really wanted to like this movie, but it barely reached 3. It is surprising that the same number of votes were 10, the other half 1. All the characters were entertaining and even talented, but in general the film did not bear fruit . . Sebastián Hernández is attractive; Charismatic and sympathetic (he even physically resembles Marc Anthony in a more accessible but, ultimately, conscious way ...) but even he could not save the mess of a movie. The scenes were prolonged too long and the points were finally beaten to death. The banana scene bordered on self-absorption, apparently showing how much movement there was in their boxers. But in his defense it was his first film as a director (to my knowledge) and I appreciate his labor of love. It simply left me empty despite what I was trying to say. Ultimately, I think the story would have been better handled by a more experienced director. From what I have seen of the 'extras', there is a real story behind this and, perhaps when I finish watching them, I will appreciate this attempt more.
