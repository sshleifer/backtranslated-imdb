The parallels between this film and "Captain Walrus" (an independent film shown at the Film Screening Festival of the Team in 1994) are so obvious that any praise for "Sally Marshall is not a foreigner" must be seen with the knowledge that he is riding on the success of another job. <br /> <br /> In Captain Walrus, two young children (Geoff and Roger, played by Dean Turner and Brett Allen respectively) examine the strange behavior of their new neighbor Britney (played by Louise Farley)). While the two children look through their telescope, they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform whom they call Captain Morsa (played by Peter Sargent). However, the emphasis on Captain Walrus is on the nonsensical and somewhat hungry actions of neighbor Britney, and less on the friendship between the two boys. <br /> <br /> A critical success in the film festival, the plot. Captain Walrus, obviously, has appropriated and reloaded to give the Australian Film Community another notch in the belt regarding the product for children. While Sally Marshall is not a foreigner, it is a good movie, and a credit to its producers, its lack of authenticity leaves something to deserve.
