None of this movie is good. It is a predictable "romantic comedy" formulated to make females force their other important people to watch. In other words, it is a predictable elegant film that is neither comical nor romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable. If you like to see the same thing over and over again, this movie will fit perfectly. I was also forced to see this with my g / f at that time and it is not surprising that we are no longer together. I enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch, while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again with different actors. Nothing good to say about this movie. The title says it all. 1/10 (a b / c I can not give you a zero.
