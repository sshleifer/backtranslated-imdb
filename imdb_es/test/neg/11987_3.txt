Uwe Boll falls back on his cinematic abilities to deliver a sci-fi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters facing super soldiers on a remote island. A cast well headed by the excellent Udo Keir is thrown adrift by Boll, who makes the worst of the scripts that should have worked. The crazed scientist being investigated by a reporter has been killed, but this script is funny enough for the plot to work, in addition, the effects and super soldier design with his dead and lifeless eyes have some degree of chill, however Boll somehow manages to film Everything in a strange way. It is as if he could not bother to find out what would work and, instead, he removed the camera locations and walked away. Also, the set of scenes has no spark or life, I guess Boll only shot one or two shots and used what he had. It really sucks. Clearly, Boll is in one of his retrograde periodical films where everything he learned about the film gets redder. The last movie he did that was so bad was Seed, a serial killer movie that is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. This is not so bad, but it is close simply because it should have been better. Then, again, Udo Keir is good enough to make it worthwhile to watch his scenes and make this a film as bad as good. I'd take a pass unless it's late at night and you're catching it on the wire.
