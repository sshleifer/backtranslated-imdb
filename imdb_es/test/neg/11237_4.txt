I just watched this movie at TCM, and I can understand why George Murphy entered politics if this was the best that MGM could offer him. It is so slow that the attempt to turn it into a true black film effort does not occur. He introduced two of my favorite players <br /> <br /> to Eve Arden (completely wasted) and Dean Stockwell (the best actor in the movie), but what really struck me was that the protagonist Frances Gifford had about 90 Minutes (It seemed longer!) Without changing the expression on his face - his fainting scene was comical. John Hodiak played his role well, but the script left him and the rest of the cast very badly. I give it 4 stars mainly for photography. It would have been in the first half of the Program when the double features were the march.
