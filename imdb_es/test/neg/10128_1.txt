If you asked yourself if Disney could broadcast a program with a more pampered character than Paris, more superficial than Britney, more insipid than Jessica and more narcissistic than THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR, do not ask anymore. The surprising thing is that Selena Gomez is, apparently, supposed to be the heroine. She is also supposed to be an outcast of spoiled, superficial, bland, spoiled "popular" girls, which is no more credible here than it was for Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. The plots go from BEWITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE recycled to "parodies" of HARRY POTTER. The older child alternates between being a magical genius and being unable to master the complexities of their own cords. The youngest boy is just another of the "little" brats that have multiplied on television like cockroaches in New York (and with the same appeal). Dad is the stereotyped daddy of silly television, and mom ... well, she's not all that horrible. But everything pales next to the frightful, disgusting and, at the same time, horribly fascinating (like a bad car accident) the presumptuous, satisfied and snotty spectacle of Mrs. Lopez. And, again, she is the heroine.
