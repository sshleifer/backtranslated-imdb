It's hard to imagine how Dan Brown's appealing novel "Angels and Demons" could fail as much as this film version. Here are ten reasons why the movie was a failure. Because of the spoilers, do not keep reading unless you've already seen the movie. <br /> <br /> (1) In the movie, there was not a love relationship between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Worse still, there was not even chemistry between the two main actors. <br /> <br /> (2) The impressive places in Rome, as described in the novel, were not visually performed in the film. I am aware that director Ron Howard had difficulty filming in the place. But there are superior photographic representations of Rome in The History Channel that in this film where the Eternal City was presented in archival footage of eternal archive. The great works of art described in the novel were briefly represented in the film. The magnificent Bernini sculpture of the "Ecstasy of Saint Teresa" was only glimpsed momentarily, and the Western Speaker's relief on the Vatican Square was not visible at all. <br /> <br /> (3) The most insipid choice made by the filmmaker was in the representation of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved John Paul II. In the novel, the Pope is clearly fictitious and does not look like any real pope. <br /> <br /> (4) One of the most colorful (and important) characters in the novel, Maximilian Kohler, Director of CERN, cut the script. <br /> <br /> (5) There were numerous cases in which the dialogue lines were inaudible due to a strange background noise. <br /> <br /> (6) There were times when the faces of the characters were not visible due to the shadows and lighting of the chiaroscuro movie. This technique worked in the films of "The Godfather", but Ron Howard is not Gordon Willis. <br /> <br /> (7) The College of Cardinals was a rather heterogeneous team with one of the electors speaking in a Southern accent. This guy would have been more at home on a Texas ranch than in the Sistine Chapel. <br /> <br /> (8) The crucial relationship of Camerlengo and the deceased Pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was fundamental to the issue of science versus religion and the relevance of the Illuminati to the plot against the church. <br /> <br /> (9) In the novel, the Hassassin character was an unforgettable villain. In the movie, the role of that murderous character was a villain cut out of cardboard. <br /> <br /> (10) In general, the filmmakers did not trust the operation of the successful novel. <br /> <br /> In the novel, Langdon makes an impossible fall from the sky and into The River Tiber. In Ron Howard's film, it was the movie itself that landed on the Tiber.
