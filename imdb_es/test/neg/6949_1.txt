Horrible, waste of time. There is no camp value or trash in this. Seen in best amateur movies made by children from 10 to 12 years old in film clubs. <br /> <br /> How the hell can someone spoil a movie about vampires and lesbians? <br /> <br /> It's not a movie that brings together some vampire / sadomasochism enthusiasts in the same room and just films it. <br /> <br /> Could not find anything good about the movie. There was no plot, no real actors, no real special effects, no humor. A few overweight goths that touch each other can not be called sexual scenes. Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Well, the cemetery was fine, but one should film a vampire movie in the dark. <br /> <br /> The purpose was probably good: make a garbage movie in a spirit of Ed Wood. The problem is that one can not make a bad movie intentionally. It takes talent and an effort to make a "real" movie. Ed Wood may have lacked money, but he sure had an effort. These guys lacked everything. Ed Wood was a genius compared to these guys.
