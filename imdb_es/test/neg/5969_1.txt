I think the film was unilateral, I saw it recently and I found the documentary typical of western filmmakers that was skewed without substance. The fact is that prostitution exists everywhere in the world, not only in Tanzania and not because of this fishing business, there were prostitutes there before the Russians and other business people came to Mwanza. In fact, poverty is endemic in Africa, not to mention Tanzania, and this is not due to the fish fillet business; in fact, the fishing industry has helped millions of people to support their families in their daily lives. This film has just tarnished the good image of this peace-loving country. As for the arms trade, the film could not prove if there is any truth in the fact that, when looking at the films critically, the filmmaker's authenticity is being doubted, it seems that they try to demonstrate their point of view using a few characters that can be done for nothing really. Yes, Tanzania is a poor country, yes, there are prostitutes and street children, but they are not the product of this business, it is only a common scenario in most poor countries, even in the western world ... What a burden of garbage. <br /> <br /> The pilots themselves speak of sending arms to Angola, which is more than 2000 km south of Tanzania and the war was carried out in the DRC, also miles away from Mwanza, the director He was able to demonstrate how these weapons were transported. Mwanza to the DRC! <br /> <br /> In short, the films lack focus and respectability, it is quite easy to find the character anywhere in Africa and it has nothing to do with Darwin's nightmare or fish fillet ... What trash! ! <br /> <br /> The truth is that the Nile perch has not decimated all the other species in the lake, unlike what the film portrays and also less than 25% of all the catches of Lake Victoria are export, the rest is consumed locally, so we will have that right.
