Aaran is one of the movies where the loop holes are found in Indian cinema. Here is a good example to show how excellent writers, directors and actors succumb to producers. Here is one of the most wonderful actors, Mohanlal, acting in a film about a true story in Kashmir. The seriousness of the film is sacrificed with scenes and comical songs of inferior quality. There's this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who is actually the son of the film's producer. Therefore, you do not have a haircut even though your officer asks you to do it. This child does not know what is acting and he is the "hero" of the movie. God helps the Indian cinema with such producers. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pathetic exhibition of what happens in Kashmir. A sensible viewer can intuitively understand the limitations of wonderful writers, actors and directors who wish to share their real-life experiences. But the unfortunate part is that a film about the highest ranks in the Indian Militia turns out to be a pathetic display that only suggests that the movie was stupid. <br /> <br /> We should drive out such producers in the film industry and pave the way for a good cinema.
