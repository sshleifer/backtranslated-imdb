My Caddy Limo was destroyed! Well, I had one like it: he led the hoi polloi and many of the Chosen for Manhattan for a few years. <br /> <br /> That was much more entertaining than this movie that I can tell you about. Lordy, what a bomb, like in RPG, go boom. I also handled many more stars in my white Caddy than they appeared in this fake paper. <br /> <br /> Robert Patrick is a very serious actor and he did a credible job with the nonsense he had to work with. Unfortunately, Rutger Hauer did his part as a red-nosed circus clown. If he could not take it seriously, why should his audience do it? The director must have taken off his ass to the set in the first hour of filming. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was written for 10 years for children of 8 years. Surprised, there was not much more crumbling in the sets. Oh, well, I'm a movie fan, ergo, you must take the bad to get to the good.
