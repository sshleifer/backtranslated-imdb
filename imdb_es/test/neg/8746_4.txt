When I was a kid, this movie scared me a lot. As an adult, I could not stop laughing. <br /> <br /> I have not had the pleasure of watching this movie through MST3K. Instead, I discovered it on a Saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters, and there was nothing left to do outside, but to rake some autumn leaves. I thought, this had to be better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The movie has some very good elements; a mystic who divines the water, a beatnik painter, a pair of ranchera idiots, a fan of the history of the third age and an "evil wind". Um ... I mean ... evil head. An evil head that, as soon as the systematic hypnotism of each and every one of those present is complete, will be looking for his evil body. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place in an evil "ranch" that apparently does not either. cultivate, nor breed evil cattle. <br /> <br /> As your resident mystic declares that everything is "evil", either roll your eyes horribly, or laugh until your sides are divided, depending on your mood. I? I laughed until tears came. <br /> <br /> I remembered this movie with love as one of the ones that really scared me as a child. But some children also fear Santa Claus ... right? Anyway ... if you like the terror camp of the 50s, then this is definitely a movie that you should not miss. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good story, this movie has that. It is the exaggerated drama and the absolute innocence of the moment that makes it so horrible. The performance was BAD, but I still had some good elements. Maybe it qualifies a remake ...? <br /> <br /> Rate a 4.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
