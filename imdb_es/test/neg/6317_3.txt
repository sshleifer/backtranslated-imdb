Not being a fan of the Westerns in particular, I saw it mainly because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in a different role from "I Love Lucy" or "Lucy Show". Here she plays Christine Larson, owner of a salon in the Arizona territory in 1868 that is about to marry the unscrupulous local Indian agent (Dean Jagger). Ball's performance was fine, nothing more than that; She did not give me away She was successful because the role was very different from what I'm used to seeing in her: there was very little scandalous physical comedy for which she later became famous, although the film tried to maintain a nice and fun feeling. (A typical funny phrase: "There are two ways to deal with women, and nobody knows any of them!") I did not find the story so convincing, although I appreciated that the Indians were shown as the victims of the Indian Agent. typical shooting action and many horses, in other words, your typical western. As for Christine, we can almost guess from the beginning how her planned marriage will end; It's just a matter of how you're going to get there. If you like westerns, this would be a fairly typical one with a bit of humor. If you are not big in the genre, it will be missing. I'm not big in the genre. 3/10
