The bad smell of the bottom of the barrel is so bad that it is more than fun. The "plot" is about an American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in the movie he is called "military adviser", but it is not clear if he is in the US military or not), helping the army of a Latin American country to fight Guerrillas who end up joining the guerrillas when the government turns against him, imprisons him and tortures him. Shannon Tweed is a "sports equipment salesperson" who picks up at a bar and gets caught up in all the intrigue. That description makes the movie sound better than it is, because it really stinks of almost biblical proportions. How bad is it? Well, Shannon Tweed delivers the most professional acting work of the film. If that's not an indication of what a 12th grade piece of scrap is, this turkey, nothing is of sound effects that do not match a musical score that sounds like it's from a "Z" grade horror movie of the decade of 1940 (and may very well be) to the same archival material (that is, armored personnel carriers that cross the same path of the jungle) constantly reused for some of the most inept scenes of "action" in recent memory scene , this one minute laugh fight should look like incredulous. Tweed looks bored, Brown seems hung up, and by the time this is over, if you can last that long; I could not - you'll know how they feel. <br /> <br /> Although there are many explosions and shootings, this can not be considered an "action" image by any stretch of the imagination. It's boring (there's a scene in the back of a truck where everyone stares for three or four minutes), repetitive (the same "rebels" and "soldiers" are killed again and again), illogical (when a group of the rebels are trapped in an open field by a government combat helicopter, instead of seeking refuge, they stay there staring at it), inept (soldiers and rebels fall "dead" when no shots are heard, an armed battle within a house where the fighters who are standing against the walls are machine-gunned, but miraculously the walls escape without damage) predictable (when the "Governor" says offer a reward for Brown's capture because "someone" could deliver it, you know exactly who it will be that "someone", and it turns out to be exactly what you thought it was) and simply stupid (almost everything else in the picture). Inept, brainless and stupid beyond belief. Do not waste your time.
