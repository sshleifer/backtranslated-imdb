All right, we started in a psychiatrist's office, and apparently it's not very good. The main hero of the first Jack Frost is in the office of the shrunken throwing random rhymes on Jack Frost. Wow, it's okay, my brother is screaming "Turn it off!" Anyway, going back to the fucking movie. <br /> <br /> The shrinker has his speaker and lets his secretary and his friends listen to this heroic insane. I guess he's supposed to be the hero of the first movie, but he does not look like him at all! Yadda yadda yadda, they laugh at the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. Now, some people are unearthing the anti-frozen snowman, Yadda Yadda, now we are in a laboratory with some kind of doctor. I do not see how this has to do anything, but they are poking antifreeze. / Killer evil mutant snowman with needles, heating it, shaking it, adding strange and strange chemical products, the full nine meters. Nothing. Very well, they give up and leave it in a fish tank. One of the doctors leaves his coffee on top of the tank. The doorman comes in, cleans things up, hits the fish tank and coffee spills the tank that makes Jack alive. <br /> <br /> Here is the power of the mocha! Now, somehow, he's ... well ... I think the Bahamas ... but he looked more like Hawaii ... But it could not be Hawaii! Unless you have spent all your budget on dang air plane tickets. Bah ... I will not ruin the rest of this rotten movie, so you'll have to rent it and see it for yourself ... Er ... I would not suggest doing it ... Sheesh ...
