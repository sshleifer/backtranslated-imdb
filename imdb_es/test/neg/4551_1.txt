Proud as I am to be a Dutchman, I am really surprised by films like these. Why? Why this cheap performance? Why this story that just sucks? Why a dozen sequels? why or why do they add a lot of Dutch girls in an effort to save this film from redemption, and guess what? All minor breezergirlies are going to see him in Holland. I was forced to see him at a party. all the girls were going crazy when Daan Schuurmans came on the screen, all the guys took another beer and complained ... But what really bothers me, is the fact that this kind of movies are the only kind of movies that Dutch filmmakers can Produce ... (apart from "Van God Los" and "Lek") This does not prove our superiority over other countries. It does not add anything to our imagination ... Just F ** ks to the brain of 13-year-old girls ... Johan Nijenhuis, I hope you burn forever!
