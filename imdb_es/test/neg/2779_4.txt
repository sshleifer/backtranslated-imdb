First of all I'm in my mid-40s. I've been watching horror movies since I was a kid, so I've seen a lot of variety. In my opinion, this is not as bad as the crowds that gave a 1 or 2. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a low budget horror movie. The dialogue is bland and acting tolerable, sometimes. The basis of this movie is pretty good. For those of you old enough to remember or fortunate enough to have seen them on DVD. This is very similar to a movie of the week of 1970. Just add less blood and blood, lesser T & A and oath, without big names. That's all for a T. I'd rather see this before Jason vs. Godzilla or any other continuous shit is out there. Although not so good, EVIL DEAD was a low budget movie. At least give these guys credit for trying. With a sufficient MIL budget, this could have been a good movie. My score is a visible 4.
