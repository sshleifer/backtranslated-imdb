This film is about a girl who goes to live with her rich cousins ​​and falls in love with one of her cousins, and rejects the advance of an amoral suitor who brings problems to the family. After seeing the 1999 version and reading the book, I decided to see the previous version. I discovered that he remained faithful to Fanny's character in the book, but he was also a boring character. The character of Fanny played by Sylvestra Le Touzel was mediocre; He often seemed on the verge of fainting. I also did not like Robert Bourbage who played Henry Crawford. I could not imagine that he was interested in Fanny or his cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood, who played Mary Crawford, was fine, but the wig she wore was very ugly. I lost interest in his performance and kept looking at his wig. I kept waiting for it to fall out of his head. I could also see a glide of his real hair under the wig.
