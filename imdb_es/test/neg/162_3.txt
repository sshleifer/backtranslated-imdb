I just watched The Edge of Love (by the way, this is one of the worst titles so far this year) and I found it a difficult task. Seeing the unpleasant character of Keira Knightly, looking skeletal, made me feel more shudder throughout the rudeness of the movie. <br /> <br /> It took me four nights to see what was so boring. The only good thing about this was Cillian Murphy. It is always good / credible and is very little seen in many movies. However, this was not good enough for him. <br /> <br /> Apart from the unpleasant characters, the boring plot, the plot was also emotionally unsatisfactory. I felt that I spent my time watching this for nothing (what I did). I should have done the smart thing and turned it off, but I kept it out of respect for Cillian Murphy and the great cinematography.
