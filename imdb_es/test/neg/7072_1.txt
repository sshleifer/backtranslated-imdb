Well, fans, it's on DVD. But the only reason to see this is 1) to say you did it (due to its notoriety), or 2) if you're a Bill Paxton fanatic. I'm not a BP fan, but it was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from turning this off for sheer boredom. It's a shame, because it could have been a good movie with some script work and if someone had done it with some intelligence (and with a cast directed by someone other than the totally inadequate and without talent, Judd Nelson). Of course it's disgusting, but it's BAD, and not in a good way. If after reading all the comments about how extravagantly disgusting and distally filthy this movie is, you're still interested, do yourself a favor and see some GOOD strange disgusting nasty dopies instead. The films of John Waters, David Lynch, "Braindead" by Peter Jackson, "Basket Case" by Henenlotter, etc., come to mind. There is much better out there.
