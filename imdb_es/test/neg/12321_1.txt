The energetic and degrading adaptation to the classic tale for children not only lacks the charm of their ancestor but also lacks talent. Mike Myers should not only feel ashamed of himself for his horrible performance, which is a clear scam of what Jim Carrey did, but should also give up acting together. He is so upset that you would want to beat him up if you could jump straight into the movie. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. I have seen many bad movies this year, but this not only takes the cake, but it is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever made.
