This is an entertaining movie. I suggest you rent it, buy a couple of quarts of rum and invite the entire crew for it. My favorite parts were.1. the shootings so well choreographed that John Woo himself was jealous, .2. The wonderful special effects .3. the Academy Award winning performance and .4. The fact that every gangsta in the movie seemed to be doing a bad personification of "Scarface". I mean, Master P as a Cuban godfather! This is an innovative territory. And with a well-written dialogue that includes lines like "the only difference between you and me, Rico, I'm alive and dead", this film is truly a masterpiece. Yeah sure.
