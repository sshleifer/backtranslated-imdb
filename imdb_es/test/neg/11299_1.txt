Synopsis: the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a big budget production that is not fulfilled; Not only is it not as smart as its predecessor, it is not even a splash movie, suspense or terror, but a totally boring waste of time. Do not be fooled by the exaggeration of the media and, in particular, the stories of people who throw themselves into the cinema and have mental scars for the rest of their lives due to the scene that eats the brain: in the movie it just appears like a ridiculously bad SFX. Why so many people in this forum say that H "is not so bad" and that "it's worth seeing on the big screen", etc., surpasses me; and it's not "so bad that it's good", it's just boring. I normally respect the opinion of other people, but in this case I have to say that clearly they can not say anything to Shine - Ola. Maybe they've been hit by the media hype, maybe they've never seen a Ridley Scott movie before and they were impressed by their excessive use of the backlight, the smoke and the ubiquitous AC fans. H is totally devoid of suspense; instead, we have endless scenes of Lecter going through an English-speaking Firenze, an unconvincing and unattractive plot with more holes than a fishing net (after seeing H, I actually stayed awake for half the night trying to find all the holes in the plot, and when I wrote them quickly I filled 6 pages in small print before forcing myself to stop). Instead of spending your time and money watching it on the big screen, I advise you to wait until it shows on TV in a couple of years; and then go to bed early. <br /> <br /> 1 / 10. <br /> <br /> Below are a couple of additional bones that I must pick up with Hannibal: <br /> <br /> - H_is_ the sequel to SOTL, despite what some people say in this forum. And although SOTL was a very difficult act to follow, there are sequels that are on par with its predecessors (SOTL was the sequel to "Manhunter" by Michael Mann, based on "Red Dragon" by Thomas Harris, and although the first The episode was a very nice movie, SOTL was even better, another example would be the Alien series initiated by the director of H, Ridley Scott, both for the theory of the decline of the sequels.In any case, being a sequel is not an excuse for a movie to be a shit. <br /> <br /> - This film has a recognized director, is based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, the cast is strictly A list, great cinematography, big budget, writers of first level scripts, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the end result is just a fart in the church, so what went wrong? I think a lot of the blame has to go to the producer of the film, Dino DeLaurentiis Here is my interpretation: DDL produced "Manhu nter ", which, despite all its qualities, was a commercial failure. Disappointed, he gave the rights to the character of Hannibal Lecter to Orion, for free, which allowed Jonathan Demme to do SOTL, and the rest is film history. DDL then had to wait ten more years (now he has 81) until Thomas Harris finally proposed the sequel novel. I think at this point, DDL had lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his share of the cake before he took out his cork. <br /> <br /> - Another aspect that seems completely annoying to me is that there is a lot of undeserved publicity in the media; I mean, it's boring, but it's one of the highest grossing productions in history, so it's not necessary to give it free publicity. And while most critics argue about how Dantesque's scenes are at Firenze and why Jodie Foster did not participate, the simple fact that this film is a total and absolute failure is not mentioned. But there is more: not only is Hannibal being promoted through the roof, but it is also being used as an organizer of the media agenda for a large number of "documentaries" (usually the remains of similar productions following SOTL ) about serial killers. , cannibalism and profiling. However, not only H does not even pretend to be realistic; Lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer (now only killed by necessity or to help Clarice Starling), the profile is not even mentioned (because we already know HL, so there is no need to create a profile) and there is also there is cannibalism: Lecter feeds his own drugged Paul Krendler with his own brain, so that makes him (erm) unconscious, self-cannibalism. Try to make a documentary based on that. <br /> <br /> There has been a lot of talk about acting: mainly if Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (who plays Hannibal Lecter) usually gets a lot of praise. I think all these discussions are debatable. There are several of my favorite actors in this movie (namely, Liotta, Oldman and Moore) but the script just does not give them anything to work with. The same for Hopkins: there is no development in his character, and he is not being challenged in any way. And, by the way, he plays almost identical characters in all his films, only that in H he has to commit some murder and he is being paid the ordered sum of $ 11 million to do it.
