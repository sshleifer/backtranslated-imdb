Yes, I really found this movie unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I did not like Sandra's character Oh, she really bothered me. It is unlikely that it will be accepted in Italian rural life because it is not white. This was a bit of nonsense for PC. <br /> <br /> The movie is also offensive to Italian men. For example, the only man she (Diane Lane) has an affair is a caddish trick. But guess what: at the end your typical American brick head appears, a whole tanned white smile, and finally finds everything you want: a true American man, and now has colonized another part of the world. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is quite racist in its representation of the Italians and in the way it subjugates them as lotharios smarmy or backward peasants. <br /> <br /> The photography was good, but the film and its attitude were garbage.
