A much awaited new version of a precious musical classic and a pill so bitter that it had to be taken. Very, very difficult to swallow ... everything. I did not have an ounce of credibility anywhere. And when you do not have a Rose, you do not have a show. <br /> <br /> Bette Midler seemed to be born to interpret this part. However, all he could produce was a cute, funny, ostentatious trademark of Bette Midler ... loaded with all the familiar Midlerisms. Roz Russell has nothing to worry about. She can rest in her grave knowing that she is still the definitive Mama Rose (from the movie, anyway). <br /> <br /> I thought Midler was really going to put it into practice right now ... to throw himself into what he is. One of the best musical roles of all time ... as he did in "The Rose". But, no, she played it safe. She played herself. She made Rose a total dinner-theater caricature. Even his songs were not inspired. It was maddening to see him, knowing that Midler has the talent to rise above his moneymaking strategy. She showed her promise only once in this "Gypsy" and that was with "Rose's turn". But by then it was too little, too late. <br /> <br /> A sincere Cynthia Gibb as a titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when Gypsy's role overshadows Rose's, you know there are problems in River City. <br /> <br /> A huge, huge disappointment.
