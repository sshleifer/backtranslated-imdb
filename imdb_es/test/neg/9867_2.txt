This is really horrible, the weakest attempt of a comic book adaptation committed to the cinema. Everything possible about this movie that could be bad, is. The music, the acting, the lighting, the sets, the "special" effects ... the only positive aspects I can find are that Sue looks pretty with her blue stockings and that the Thing makeup is almost passable (only for the face ). That's. Zipper. Do not bother tracing that pirate copy; It really is not worth your time. Even the aborted "Captain America" ​​movie of the early 1990s is far less unbearable than writhing in your seat as you try to cope with this mess.
