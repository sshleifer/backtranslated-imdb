This is a very strange Hollywood product. Apparently it did not work well because the actors that have footage in the credits have been completely edited out of the movie, which means that they did a quick cut job. It feels as if it has been ripped out of Demme's hands, that they are normally competent, and that they simply throw themselves away. On the other hand, it is so lacking in substance that perhaps nothing can save it. It does not have a real center, neither narratively nor in time. Although he says that the execution time is 92 minutes, he seems to remember that it ended abruptly, around the 80 minute mark. It is finished before it starts. It's pretty free of laughter. <br /> <br /> The merits of the "Matthew Modine image" were as difficult to achieve as the image of Luke Wilson now.
