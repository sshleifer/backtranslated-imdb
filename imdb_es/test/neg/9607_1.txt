As a mother of two girls (14 and 11 years old) I have serious doubts about this program and all the programs aimed at teenagers. First, I am always surprised that the living conditions of Drake / Josh, Zac / Cody, Hanna, Carly, Derek, Sunny, etc. always make most houses look small and narrow. Most people work hard all day to pay for homes less than half the size, but in these programs nobody goes to or comes from work, pays utility bills, mortgages or insurance, mops, cleans, changes light bulbs, fix toilets, etc. Just going in and out (and going down the wide ubiquitous stairs that only exist on TVs) joking (most of which involve lying and hilarious results) and the work of eluding. I think children who watch this will have unrealistic expectations about how much they will work and how luxurious their lives will be. Second, there is never an intact family, always a mom or dad, but never both, who will always have sexless dating but never seem to have any of the disadvantages of divorce (alimony, support, arguments). Again, children may have the impression that if the mom / dad gets divorced, there will be fun, fun, fun (in fact, mom or dad are often not present if that helps the plot). It goes without saying that spirituality is not mentioned (forget about the specific religion). Finally there is a topic that worries me. There are "nerds" who are good at school, good "jocks" in sports, "goody two shoes" too. The protagonists are not good at school, sports or charity, but they make jokes about those who are. The message is that you are not good at anything, just be one of the "nothing" who mix in jokes. It goes without saying that I give a zero to all these shows, I turn them off all the time and I do not get to ban them in my house.
