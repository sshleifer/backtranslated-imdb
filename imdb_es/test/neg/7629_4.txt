This derivative erotic thriller can be seen most of the way, mainly because the viewer is curious to know how it will develop, and because the director, Peter Hall, manages to present a scene of pretty hot (and quite bold) sex. But the end, although unexpected, is absurd, and the complete plot (complete with childhood traumas and multiple personality disorders) is revealed as an unbearable clich√©, especially in regard to motivation.
