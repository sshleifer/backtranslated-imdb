Like almost everyone else, I noticed this turkey in Mystery Science Theater 3000. It's easily one of my favorite MST3K episodes of all time. I really could not imagine trying to see this movie on its own, although ......... it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really bad. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe plays Ator, an aspiring muscle-bound Fabio who lives during the time of cavemen. The viewer is asked to suspend our disbelief that he knows alchemy and chemistry, and we can build a full delta wing in about 5 minutes. Yeah sure! There is also a very attractive actress (I can not remember her name) who uses a cube lid as a breast shield. Oh, and I can not forget that strange Asian side kick, Thong. He had the easiest role in the film, since he does not utter a word of dialogue throughout the entire film. He had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking ... and failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The movie can not be seen in any way and should only be viewed in its proper MST3K format. . If you see that version, you will laugh at yourself! <br /> <br /> "I AM HUGE !!!!" <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
