I agree with most of the previous reviewers. Moreover, I was surprised by the presentation of the love scenes with the homosexual couple. Why? because while they, the director, the producers? they had no obligation to present the different heterosexual couples in the most passionate hugs, including nudes and super close-ups of French kisses and all kinds of naked contortions in bed, Completely unnecessary in their length and in history, when the time to show the same experiences with the homosexual couple, they only dared to reach an extremely painful hug, almost between academic giggles, with two very nervous actors. So, in reality, the creators of this film discovered that homosexuality is DENATURAL, as one of the characters in one scene says. What a difference with Spanish cinema! I remember that he was at the screening of an Almodóvar film in an Italian cinema in Rome, and that he was completely amazed by the total lack of reaction of the Italian audience, they feared to have a reaction! when in Spain people fell from their seats laughing at all the situations of laughter and the fabulous wit and style of Almodóvar. Obviously, in Italy there are dark forces in its history that prevent the free manifestation of some very normal and natural emotions. Pity. I should add that I was quite surprised to find that this same comment was censored by another correspondent. It is very bad and dangerous when the narrowness of others does not allow us to express our opinions on certain issues. Where is freedom of expression? I do not know if that censor will approve the changes that forced me to make in this comment, and I hope he does not receive the same treatment from another narrow-minded judge. Pity again.
