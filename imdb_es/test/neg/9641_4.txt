My mistake in thinking that this was a serious movie about the war is hell before I saw it. Everything ended in seconds in the movie when the "MTV" logo appeared. It could well have been called "National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose." And it touched the public "MTV"; The movie that followed those comical first seconds was heard like the music videos that they used to play more than 40 years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to send his Rated R material to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. It's okay, I'm being hard; It was not so bad of a movie. However, it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely skewed / unilateral. It's true that I'm not a fan of war movies. I can not see 'Platoon', 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Saving Private Ryan' more than once. Of course they were good movies, but they are not my forte and they all seem to mix after a while, where I could not distinguish one from the next. After a tour in Iraq, Phillippe plans life after the war, but is removed due to a clause in his contract. Or, at least, that's the army's plan until he absents himself without permission and the characters accelerate cross-country with incredibly never trapped dollars. No, I have not been to any war, nor in Iraq, nor do I agree with that. Nor do I have all the knowledge when it comes to recruiting or signing contracts. I can say this: although I regret that you have returned to this conflict, I can not feel too much for someone so foolish that he does not read the fine print. It is as if someone on his deathbed would lean over to finally read the Surgeon General's warning on his cigarette box and say, "Oh, what are they? Mortals? I will sue them!"
