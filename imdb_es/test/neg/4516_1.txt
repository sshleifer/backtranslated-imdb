This is truly abysmal. I just received a copy of "Disco Beaver From Outer Space" after hearing good things about it, and I must say that this was unbelievably graceless and bad, it will leave you dazed and bewildered how it has been accomplished. <Br /> <br /> I mean, what was it? Is this the typical mood of the late 70s? I do not think so. This is so bad, and believe me, I do not mean "so bad that it's good" either. This is a collection of extremely humorless parodies as if you were watching cable TV. Sure enough, this was an HBO program, and to think that this may have been considered as innovative is scary. <br /> <br /> There's a pretty pretty girl on it, and there are some old images from the hockey NHL of the NY Islanders team, which is fun to watch even though I'm a fan of the NY Rangers of a lifetime . But they even spoil it, while trying to get some humor out of two hockey players who fight on the ice as if they were "dancing" and, what is worse, reverse the videotape of two hockey players struggling to make it look like who are having sex Oh, how funny! In a bit of cunning, there is an interview with a hockey player called "Chico" who looks like the Chico Resch goalkeeper of the New York Islanders, but they even ruin him by wearing a Rangers jersey! Well, maybe it was intentional, who knows. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that "Disco Beaver" is so blatantly horrible, incredibly bad, you'll definitely feel cheated after seeing this and losing almost an hour. of your life. You may wonder what possibly made the creators of this garbage think they had something funny here, and you will also wonder why these scenes can not even approach the worst defeat of Saturday Night Night. Amazing. Simply incredible.
