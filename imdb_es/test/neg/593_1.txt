I am completely interested in this kind of story, but once the movie started, I honestly said out loud: "I just rented a two-dollar budget Christian POS." The only thing I liked about this movie was that it has a story of descent, but it was terribly executed. Horrible actors, horrible direction and production. <br /> <br /> The director and producer should go to see the cube before trying to make a movie in one room. There was absolutely nothing that kept you intrigued to the point of not having noticed that you were in the same room the whole movie. Horrible! The two main actresses were very easy to see and you could say that the director counted on keeping his attention. But these two and their biographies can talk about this, they're horrible in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this. Unless you're blind, because I could raise some stars if you just listen to it.
