I waited a long time until I could see this movie by Lone Ranger. Finally I was able to see him today on the Lone Star channel and I was very disappointed with the whole movie. Clayton Moore and John Hart acted better as Lonto Rangers and Jay Silverheels as Fool, than the two stars in this movie. Everyone did very badly in this movie. Even the plot was bad and very attractive. I think the horse, who plays Silver was the best actor in this movie. I'm glad I did not go out and buy a copy of this movie when it came out, since I think it's a waste of money. I really regret that the characters who played Clayton Moore, John Hart and Jay Silverheels, and who came to life on the silver screen, have been so fogged. Unless in the future, find actors worthy of representing the characters in the same way that Clayton, John and Jay did so well in the past, I will not spend the money to buy the movie. I will not see this movie again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Davies
