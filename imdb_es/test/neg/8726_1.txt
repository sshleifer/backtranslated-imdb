I really wanted to see this movie because I loved the David Lynch version. In my first attempt to see it I fell asleep. Nothing was happening. The next night I tried to see the rest, and again I was sleeping! Nothing happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive. The only time it got a little more exciting was when I tried it on Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disc that contained extra material. Needless to say, I had no difficulty in going through the torture of seeing more of Dune (2000). Here are the low points: the acting was bad, the plot moved in slow motion, the sets were and seemed cheap, the direction was pathetic and the CGI visual effects were childish. Dune, save money or rent the 1984 version.
