How painful! Pain in the way he promised in his central idea, but he never recognized it completely and continues to blow a lot of sand in his face. I would not say that this South African / Canadian / British terror film, direct to the video, is horrible, but it is too insipid, predictable and very unmemorable. It is a guarantee that you will forget it, not long after seeing it. I tried to see it last night, but I had to finish it in the morning, since I could not keep my eyes open. Even then I could not remember where I got up, which left me looking at it from the beginning again. The only thing that played a chord was the clear cinematography of Andreas Poulsson of the vast, rough and creepy places of the desert. A good bright shine creates a surprising visual sense, which can not save the film from that general sense of emptiness. Everything else is below average and almost comes out of the grid. Like the revelation of the beast that scratches its head. Huh The computer-generated special effects of the ominous monster are tolerable, and there are some spooky flashes of stripped flesh and bones. But there is very little, since you can not hide the fact that the clich√© script wants to reflect on the generic character conflict to generate tension and uncertainty. That would be fine if the withered script was more than simple, superficial, superficial, because it never generated a strong and lasting suspense, but made it work without interest. The main characters are superficial and the chip holder falls into the dispensable basket. It's your stereotyped group. The performances of Scott Bairstow and Warrick Grier are colorless, and the beautiful Rachel Shelley tries but seems quite tired.
