Unlike most critics here, I hated this movie, simply because the writer / director's bloated ego was in the way of a potentially interesting topic. Too many movie fans equate 'EXTREME self-indulgence' to 'film GENIUS!', But I do not buy that personality cult. A film should be about its subject, not about its director (unless it's a Woody Allen movie, of course). * SPOILER * (which is also good, saves time ...) There's nothing brilliant about showing you the porn star that you know everything you have in the last frame, which is actually called a bad taste maneuver that SCREAMS Hacking of the film school. <br /> <br /> Poseur's film has reached the status of "great movie" based on its indulgence and satisfaction for the audience. that, first of all, is the writer / director. But the rest of the audience should also view with contempt the cruel and brutal nature of the porn business. The film had a distant angle to the porn industry, looking at each and every one of the players it could hit. It does not matter, just love your writer / director. Love those four-minute segments of steadicam, which are supposed to show the energy of the moment, but somehow they had all the momentum of a switch off. Love the story, no matter how boring, about the sudden and sordid rise of a porn star. But look down, too, of course. While the subject has the potential to be fascinating? innocence, money, degradation, beauty, your worshiper writer / director somehow managed to make everything look, again, DULL. Partly because of its execution time. Here is something that your author hero has NOT tried: Give dimension to the characters. Or soul Of course, anything in particular to fire, apart from Genius That Paul Is. But I'm not buying. I do not buy indulgent hacks with amazing hype. <br /> <br /> Another piece of long-running automatic piracy, with fifty times more exaggeration than quality. I know some of you agree. The rest will probably see this indulgent movie again. Not my problem.
