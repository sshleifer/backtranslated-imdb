This was a pretty boring movie, actually. I think the problem with a French horror movie is that the French must be easy to scare or something like that, because this movie was not so scary. The special effects with the mummy's ghost seemed like they did not even belong to the movie, as if someone had put them in post-production to cheer them up, because the actors barely react to them. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a kind of meander, which is the opposite of the real narrative. I guess this was based on a French television series, where they had to distill it into a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a mummy is taken out of the warehouse in the Louvre, which apparently has such a weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can enter it several times. (This is how people keep stealing the Mona Lisa!) The boyfriend and the police officer of this movie's version in the 1960s get together and try to exorcise the demon. <br /> <br /> So I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a bad guy or not. Kill two guards during the course of the movie, but only want to reach the afterlife.
