I bought this movie for a couple of dollars in a "liquidation store sale" one day when I just looked around. The cover looked pretty good (in color), but the film is black and white (I wish they would not try to catch us with color covers in the black and white films, but it's a common thing to be careful!). <Br /> <br /> When I saw it I was pleasantly surprised. It turned out to be better than I expected. I was disappointed that it was a B / N, but the effects are pretty good, certainly better than, say, "Invaders from Mars" that has fucking effects, and it's great to see John Banner in something other than Hogan's Heroes. <Br /> <br /> In general, this movie is not that bad for a B grade, and it's certainly worth two dollars from a nostalgic point of view. It's not my favorite science fiction, but it's not my worst either. It's okay.
