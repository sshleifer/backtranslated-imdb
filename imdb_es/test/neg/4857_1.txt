I have to say that this movie was really horrible. The performance was normal. The pace of the film was terrible, as well as the soundtrack and the cinematography. I found out that I was bored in most of the movie and that the clich√© lines did nothing for me. the two boys who played the lead roles seemed terrible at times and did not achieve the emotion that was needed in the film. the girl was sometimes chilling and looked like a doll that was scary. The ending was not satisfactory, although the movie about the end did not make me feel anything for the characters. This movie was boring and did nothing for me. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
