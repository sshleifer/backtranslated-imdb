This was another of those programs that I saw to eliminate the positive elements, and because I've been a Nick fan for years. Some of them would be the scenarios, the B frames, the guest stars and some of the main actors that were good. I got into the program through high school while growing up quickly to despise Jamie Spears, along with the other girls in the program who can not act. The only characters that seemed to like me were Dustin, Quinn, Stacey, Michael and Logan. Quinn is a perfect pariah who eventually began to fit; Stacey is a weirdo; Dustin gets through a lot of strange and random situations; and Michael is a kind of comic hand on Logan's right hand. There is a notable difference between the performance and the acting quality of the B frames that involve them, and the A frames that show a group of garish girls and an iconic "Miss Perfect", which repeats bad lines and becomes obsessed with the boys . This show would have been excellent if the main parcels contained the quality of the lateral plots, but the main plots simply do not deliver anything. When I recently went back on reruns, and tried to watch it again, I felt more insensitive to the abysmal performance of the girls and had to change the channel. However, I will give credit to the characters listed in the previous list because they made the show more or less worth my time.
