I expected much more than I received when watching this movie. It is not that I am opposed to literary license, (if that is how it should be called), especially when there is no overt attempt to say "based on a true story". But this film is about Beethoven, a true historical person who is so widely known and deeply embedded in our musical experiences and hoped that the film would be true to the story, at least in the main elements. This film had such a great exception of the historical record that it could only disappoint. <br /> <br /> My guess (because I had not investigated the movie at all) was that it was true. Halfway, I stopped the movie to look for it in IMDb. The rest of the movie was a very different experience. I was relieved that this was not accurate with the story because it was so hard to believe a large part of the story. To enjoy this movie, I was required to recognize it as a fantasy, a story of "what would happen if it were like that". The film lacked this honest disclaimer. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me the most was the fictional driving of the Ninth Symphony. The same concept represented in the film extended my imagination to the point of disbelief. I ended up doubting that something was true to the story, apart from Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Karl van Beethoven. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the performance of Ed Harris, an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and stay on the sidelines and that was it and that's why I give him 3/10. <br /> <br /> Those who say that this movie is as good or better than Amadeus have no idea of ​​either. The life of the composers and we only look for what this film really is, since in the end it was a cheap novel of a story: the fiction of the pulp.
