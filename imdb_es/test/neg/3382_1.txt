Okay, when a friend of mine told me that he was supposed to direct MM2 and MM3, I thought, heck, I had to check Monster Man and see what it is like, maybe I can participate, but when I exploded I put it in my DVD player and I tried to stifle the first 45 minutes of nothing but bad, bad. I mean a very bad and bad comedy of that fat ass that thinks it's funny, not to mention how well the director spent in the useless journey through the desert. I came to the conclusion that these guys had no idea what they were doing and lost the boat by a long shot. The story had the potential to be something different from the usual BS that can be seen on the Blockbuster / Hollywood video platform released by the Gate Lions these days, but they surely spoiled it. Why dedicate so much time and effort to shooting annoying bad acts and bad jokes, why not shorten the road trip and put more plot in the movie? Myabe's writing was so bad that they had to cut a large part of the film or maybe the director did not shoot enough of the horror and blood, that they had to find stuffing to do the usual 84 minutes. In general, and I'm being easy here, maybe because a friend of mine is the bald jerk in the bar scene that crushes his skull when he chases the three drivers on the street, I'll give him at least 1 star for trying, and the gore / kill scenes were not so bad, again, they tried. Pity, Lions Gate could have created a great franchise with this idea, but it failed. I do not recommend paying to rent it, maybe you can find a reduced version in which the film starts from the scene of the hiker. SHIT!
