This is a standard action movie as we have seen it many times before. Although there is not much action in this. Again it's the kind that protects the president. He is macho, as always, and at the same time soft and melancholy, as always. Do you have the guts to receive a bullet for the president? And then there's the girl and the usual conservative flirting. Stereotyped and predictable until the last minute of collapse.
