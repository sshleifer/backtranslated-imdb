Seriously, if you want to see a clich√© horror movie you have to see this one, I suppose. It contains all the "parts of fear where nothing happens", "the kind of nerd who is not really killed", "the boy and the girl come together and survive", "face the fear of an old child", etc. . I can follow . I wanted to see this movie because I thought the combination of a video game and a movie would work. I guess I was wrong. What makes the film more bearable? It's only 1 hour and 17 minutes, so if you're bored, it might be a good idea, but I'd rather get bored. Why not see it absolutely? Frankie Munitz, aka Malcolm, is just as irritating as the nerd guy. I could hit the boy and it's so sad that he did not die before and in the end he even comes back. Look something else!
