This was supposed to be located in the "Belt of the Bible" of Northern Ireland. Well, as someone who grew up there, and was a child in the era that is shown in the movie, it just does not sound like the truth! The accents were all over the place, everything except County Antrim / Derry. The church was unlike any I have ever seen. "The Church of God" is a Pentecostal denomination, but the one in the film was certainly not Pentecostal! At first, the old minister was dressed in the robes of the Church of Ireland (Anglican), and no C. de I. would call himself "The Church of God." The minister was often called "Reverend"; They can do it in some parts of the world, but I never heard it when I lived in that area. The ministers were addressed as "Mr ......" <br /> <br /> This movie was very poorly researched and chosen - quite typical of Irish cinema - annoying! A movie can have a great plot, but if it does not seem authentic, it's garbage.
