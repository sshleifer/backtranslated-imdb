First, this movie works on the fact that it is disturbing. I really did not like to see all these scenes in which people cut themselves alive, etc. The strangely erotic introduction gives one a sense of necrophylactic wonder. It's something ... unpleasant for me personally. But the movie really works in that respect, and it's supposed to be scary, so I give it credit for that. Yes, there are some points for those scalpels and ... well, damn disturbing idea of ​​being disinfected alive. <br /> <br /> But what this film lacks is an interesting plot, a characterization or real surprises. The whole horror movie genre for teenagers is usually presented in a very simple and predictable way. Many "tense" moments, creepy types who are crazy, and the big question of everyone: is the groom the murderer? This movie fits into the "Scream" category and countless others that have been generated in the 90s. Well, I will not spoil it for you, but it's not exactly interesting who the killer is. We discover who is halfway there ... and from then on, the movie continues, trying to complete some time ... rather boringly, to say the least. I was looking at the clock a bit in this movie. <br /> <br /> The main actress is great, as usual, but the cardboard action picture in which she is placed makes one moan in pain ... the university girl who is a detective who all think that It's crazy, but she's the one who really knows what's going on. And the cops? Ahhh, they just laugh and eat donuts. Very predictable, flat, disturbing at times, and above all, boring and boring ... It's as if a US film company took a flight to Germany to shoot a film to make it foreign ... hmmm ... or did they? <br /> <br />
