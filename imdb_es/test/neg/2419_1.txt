If the directors / producers / publicists wish to promote a film as "based on real events" and make a film that serves to inspire and have meaning, then, to begin, maintain any kind of credibility and integrity, you will want to keep a movie as close as possible. Honest as you can. <br /> <br /> A team that uses "all black" jumpers and makes haka in the United States is simply stupid. Anyone half smart would know that the "All Blacks" are the team of the National Rugby Union of New Zealand and their jumpers are all black and the Haka is performed by them as part of a traditional Maori dance. <br /> <br /> Having such stupidity in a movie, without explanation, simply reduces the film's credibility to zero and denies the message and inspiration that the film is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> The question is "Why?" Why would he do such a stupid thing and what could he get for it? <br /> <br /> I can only come to the conclusion that the writers or the director or the producers have seen it on television before an international Rugby match and thought "wow, that would be great in our movie, nobody You'll know it never happened, everyone is too stupid to know about New Zealand and all the blacks, this will be great. " <br /> <br /> What would a US audience be like? react to a movie made in New Zealand about America on the iron grid, with a team dressed in suits of American Indians and war paint, doing a Native American Indian war dance, running in circles shouting "oh woo woo woo, oh woo woo woo woo ", react? They would laugh like crazy! <br /> <br /> The people who made this film and the industry that generated it should read their heads. For some reason, the industry thinks they can "cheat all people all the time." <br /> <br /> It's just silly!
