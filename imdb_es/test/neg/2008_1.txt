Well, we have about 1,000 years in the future and we have finally traveled the vast distance between the galaxies! But, unfortunately, we still use guns that shoot bullets, black men are still calling themselves brothers, and they are drugging themselves, stoning, fighting, etc. The common stereotypical urban black men still have the shorter end of the stick. The girls in tight black rubber pants who appear to be from Baywatch share a close relationship with the captive and the crew. Disabled people still need wheelchairs to move, without smart cures, implants or robotic legs. Dracula still looks and acts gay. I have to continue ... In summary, this movement was filmed in a typical science fiction prop set, actors, and there are no real special effects to talk about. The beginning, the middle and the end were pathetic. I have to go and shoot me now that there is nothing left to live for.
