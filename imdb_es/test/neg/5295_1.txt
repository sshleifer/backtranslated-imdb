This movie is a waste of Hollywood talent and budget. It made me think that everyone in the movie was paying a favor for being in it because they were all out of place and were wasting talent in this horrible garbage of a movie. It is a contrived plot that is pathetic, unrealistic and that is neither fun nor interesting. The only thing that kept my interest were the numerous big names in the movie that appeared for no apparent reason and who had no good intentions to contribute to the mess of a movie. I kept hoping that I had some good things since all these people had been great in other movies. But it never came true. This movie should be shown in prison as punishment, but that would be cruel and unusual. You will be surprised to see so many recognizable faces parading around such a horrible pathetic writing with flat lines and a horribly bad performance. This movie reminded me of another complete time loss with many recognizable BIG TROUBLE faces (2002), which also came off the readable scale in the suck-o-meter.
