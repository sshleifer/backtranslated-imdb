This movie seems to have been made with the sole purpose of bothering me. Everything I hate about movies is present: false sentimentality, extremities, bad child actors and more abundant characteristics. That's ignoring the fact that it represents the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, and many of the cast members profess that a soccer ball has the shape of a lemon. What?! That's a rugby ball. The story follows a group of non-hopers who get a new teacher they like (who, at the same time, teaches the class with a short skirt) and are interested in soccer. Naturally, they are all trash (do not forget, they are not hopeful) except for a child who has moved from El Paso. Blah Blah, etc., etc., and the children still do not become good footballers, but good heart ensues and non-hopers become a group of well-behaved children. Hell, even adults start coming; Drunks become loving parents, illegal immigrants are liberated ... moan. <br /> <br /> This movie stars Steve Guttenberg. Now, before running to your local video store to get a copy, wait a minute. Guttenberg is garbage. No no; Let's be honest, how did this guy get to be in a movie? I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie that gives me an idea. Olivia d'Abo stars with Steve and does not impress either. She simply seems to be going through the motions and looking good while doing it. Although I have no problems with the last part; His performance does not give credit to the movie. The children's actors that make up the rest of the cast are as bad as you would expect from a movie like this one. Most of them are disgusting and / or annoying and can not be seen pleasantly. There is a goat in the movie that plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you would not see a movie for a goat, so do not bother watching this movie.
