I'm discovering that I get less and less excited about the sequels of Disney to movies. Yes, I understand that the budget for direct films is not the same, but these films do not even try. Some examples are Hunchback II and Tarzan and Jane. If someone has seen the previews of Stitch-The Movie, you will see my point. But I digress, this movie reaffirms my point. The animation is careless, the lines of the story are similar to the Saturday morning cartoons, and not all the original voices are there. I was very disappointed not to hear the voice of Michael J. Fox. It was so obvious that the person doing the voice of Milo was trying to sound like Fox, but it was not close to being successful. <br /> <br /> If he says anything, my 10 and 6 year old children did not even sit down for the whole movie.
