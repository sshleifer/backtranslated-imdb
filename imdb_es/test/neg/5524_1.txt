As other reviews have said, another one of the countless alien clones, this time with a big fight from The Terminator, adds a bit of SF's classic story "Who's going?" And an incredibly stupid plot device removed from Andromeda's tension (apparently, blinking red lights make murderous droids unable to detect frightened people three inches away). <br /> <br /> Okay, the story: after a sequence of people running in a spaceship and killing each other we get a legend. <br /> <br /> "25 years later". <br /> <br /> The crew of a relay station that orbits around Mars, which will be released within 48 hours, detects a large spacecraft on a collision course. It's La Siberia, the ship we saw in the opening sequence. It is not a good time to have disconnected everything useful from the relay station to do some repairs. The approaching ship does not deviate from its course and is issuing a message of "NO IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Enter this ship!" warning. After many shouts at each other, the crew of the relay station patches something and pulls out the station just in time. But the ship changes course and the embestes in any way, impaling one of the crew on a pointed impaler of pointed crew. The satellite begins to "lose integrity". Bits depressurize. Much more screams and turns in which only two people of the crew are expelled to space backwards. (Why are they ALWAYS sucked back?) <br /> <br /> After a few keystrokes, the wheelchair technician (who is called 'Wheeler', the only detectable joke in the whole movie) deduces that Siberia is running out of power and must leave. . On board it and turn off its engines. They all go aboard and take off their helmets. "DO NOT enter this ship!" It obviously means getting on board the ship and exposing yourself to possibly fatal infectious diseases. A team heads to the main computer room where they find a frozen dead guy who grabs what looks like an American Express card but turns out to be a minidisk. The other team finds some switches. Surprisingly, the decedent turned out to be the father of the attractive member of the voted crew most likely to survive an encounter with a crazed alien. The engines turn off, but this means that the ships' reactor will explode. A spooky point of view shot starts killing people. There are some suspicions that Siberia discovered a new mineral, a potential energy source worth millions, which means that the most venal members of the crew are thrown into danger immediately to control it. The POV shot returns with whoosh! whoosh! Noises on foot in the soundtrack. Unfortunately, these give you the idea that the killer is wearing corduroy pants and the effect is wasted. <br /> <br /> After that, everything is just running and being killed in order of ugliness and acting ability, until only the obvious survivors survive. - along with the cute dog that had managed to bring to death at least two members of the crew. The reason why veterans hardened by space enter the jaws of certain death in search of their pets, cats and dogs, has long been a mystery of this type of film. Other stupid aspects include that everyone forgets to act the levels of oxygen descending until the voice of the on-board computer reminds you (not that the low levels of oxygen somehow reduce the impressive fires that this load of idiots begins). If the ID of the Assassin Droid is so smart that he can steer the ship in a tight corner and have another chance to ram the relay station, why did not he turn off the "NO IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE? Enter this ship!" warning sign .. I'm sure if I was looking for more people to kill, then I was screaming GO AWAY! It was not a good way to do it. <br /> <br /> Musetta Vander is the only person who can act; everyone else simply opens their nostrils all the time while they bared their teeth and shout and point their weapons at each other. It's that kind of script; Filled with exclamation marks: the only thing that kept me looking until the end was the hope that the script would require him to take off all his clothes or get wet without using much. Unfortunately, it was not like that. One of the things wrong with this movie (apart from having more cyan on screen than in any other movie) is that there were no nudes free.
