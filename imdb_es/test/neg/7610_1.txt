I rarely give one or ten stars to a movie, but it was so horrible that I had to make an exception. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of SciFi and I've seen some comedies about SciFi that genuinely like there was simply nothing to please. <br /> <br /> I realize that this was started with an extremely small budget by a film student. But even considering that, the sets and the effect are bad. The cinematography is mediocre, but it can be the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad. A sad state when the female voice of the computer is the best actor. The dialogue is bad. The script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> Humor is not only subtle and sublime; It is not found anywhere. As an example, you spend 20 full minutes of the 80-minute movie in a 2-hit combo joke with the alien pet and the elevator. <br /> <br /> This was supposed to be a parody of everything from SciFi from 50 to 2001. What we did end up with is a slightly updated version of an old SciFi C movie from the 50s. At least those movies They were fun because they were taken seriously.
