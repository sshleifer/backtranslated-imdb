The stupidity that the cartoon "Bullwinkle" mocked a quarter of a century ago, NO MEN ARE DEAD proves you can steal a good movie (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) without copying a quality chip from the object of your plunder. The performance is barely recorded on the cable television scale, the plot has less nuances than an old comic "Sgt. Rock", and only the "bad boy" whiskers of the Boris J. Badanov style are missing from the Commies. This film achieves the unusual feat of being too bad, too stupid for anyone with opposable thumbs to enjoy.
