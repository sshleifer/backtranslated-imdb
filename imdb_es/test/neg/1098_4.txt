This movie is very similar to any other modern horror movie. It is predictable in the way it accumulates and progresses, and never manages to bring anything original or shocking to the screen. That is really the biggest disappointment of the film, since in general it still had a promising main concept for a movie of this type. <br /> <br /> You can call this movie a cliché of a great modern horror movie. It has all the elements that make modern horror movies often not so great to watch. One of these aspects is a child moaning and very naive. Why do you keep putting these kinds of things in the movies? The same goes for the kind of dramatic aspects that involve the family. It just does not work for the movie and is far from interesting or effective. Instead, it often causes the film to drag on parts and become annoying to watch. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it has all the clichés present, but it also fails to bring any of these clichés to the screen well. Like a horror movie, this is just very poor. He does not handle his horror or tension very well. For fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy. The film's story is not very well connected and accumulates within the film. Too often, the film sleeps in places and never lets its horror shoot out completely. <br /> <br /> Often, the film is also too dark (no doubt, as an attempt to hide your pretty low budget)) and shows too little blood too, mainly due to the fact that you simply can not always see things very well. <br /> <br /> You can see simply by watching this movie that director JS Cardone does not have much talent for the genre and does not know how to properly handle his current ingredients. He made some attempts in the past, but all his films have failed so far. Keep trying unfortunately. Who knows, maybe with the right people behind the camera (like Tobe Hooper, who was initially linked to directing), this movie could still have been something decent. <br /> <br /> It's a movie with a poor cast, mostly with big questions. in that. The biggest name in the film is Ben Cross, but its role is too small and, in a way, it is not relevant enough for the film and its history. He did not even seem to have much fun playing. <br /> <br /> Just omit it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
