At the lower end of the scale of the apocalypse film is this fish fragment called "The Final Executioner" ... at least where I come from. A former officer trains a guy to seek revenge against those who killed his wife and friends in cold blood ... and that's it. Many false explosions and repetitive shootings occur. He has one of the weirdest outfits I've seen in a movie for a while, and a huge fort that apparently is only directed by 7 people. GREAT work in the dub, also guys (!) Best moment: when our hero loses a sword fight and is about to be pierced by the neck, just take out your weapon and BANG! Why not do it before? It's a mystery. As is the reason why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place. I'm still puzzled about that myself now .. 2/10
