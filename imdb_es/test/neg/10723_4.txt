I thought the movie was below average. The performance was good but not great, the story was fun but it did not come out that way. The director dropped the ball in this movie. It was not James (jim) or tea. In my humble opinion it was the music that killed him. There is a scene in which things are going downhill and Jonny Cash's music is playing: the man was that depressing (not fun) that killed my mood. After that the movie could not recover. The scene of the deportation had a possible funny situation, a good performance and a good configuration. I even smiled, but the music again was not suitable for the scene. The music prevented me from being dragged into the movie. <br /> <br /> I say that it had potential but that it was badly done, I would even say that it was rushed to the final production. A kind of reminiscence of the prequel of the exorcist: the beginning. The premiere at the cinema was good, I thought after watching it, but the premiere exorcist of the movie: the domain was much better. The same story of a different director. The same should be done here.
