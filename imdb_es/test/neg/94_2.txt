The most positive points in this film were the credits (text style) and some moments in the performance of Ice-T. The history; Two rival gangs that have to fight, with the sub-plots of betrayal, power and change are well-worn plots but in this case it is painful (very) to go through. The decrepit landscape, which added a slight credibility in some places, and a questionable illumination, constantly distracted from any interest / identification with the characters (the brightness of the actress' forehead / nose was blinding, not to mention other scenes with the same problem). Not even in the middle of the movie I wanted to know more about how and why it happened, rather than what was happening on the screen. A disappointment if you've seen Ice-T in other roles. Congratulations to other actors / actresses who seemed to assume their roles despite the weak direction; The side kick of the corrupt and the other restaurant worker.
