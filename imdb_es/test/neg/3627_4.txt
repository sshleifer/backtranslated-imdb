Actually, I belong to the demographic group that Zoey 101 is trying to target, so I can see that as much as I can relate to people my age, the premise is just too ridiculous for an average person to relate to. The show revolves around the richest boarding school that exists, and the charming, incredibly tanned and attractive gang of unilateral characters that inhabit it. As is traditional among children's networks, the cast is a variety of thin white children, with the token black guy, of course. <br /> <br /> The story lines revolve around Zoey and her gang of friends who stumble upon or create some kind of minor dilemma, such as not wanting to attend a gym class, which prompted Zoey to design a plan to save the day to all your friends. In general, there is a B line that revolves around a single-sided guest character, or that places secondary characters in completely unreal situations, such as having a wasp hive in a bedroom and no one notices. These plots often play with stereotypes, such as that any character who scores well in mathematics should, by default, be completely lacking in social skills. Most episodes have a continuous and overused will, they will not, they are dynamic Chase-Zoey. <br /> <br /> The characters, unfortunately, are incredibly unilateral; is Zoey, the perfect girl with a solution for everything, literally, Chase, the still more in love but rather attractive, Michael, the symbolic black man (congratulations to Christopher Massey for managing some simple and funny sentences), Lola, the Logan, the narcissistic woman, Dustin, the little brother, and Quinn, the geek of science. The few words I dedicated to each of these characters summarize each character completely. <br /> <br /> Zoey 101 manages to entertain sometimes, but the serious flaws in the value system that it promotes are a big detour. Zoey, who is configured as the obvious and crossed quasi-feminist role model and who is on the surface portrayed as impeccable, still manages the main defects of the characters. For example, when she introduced herself to Lola for the first time, she was believed to be a Gothic girl. Zoey tried to use this as an excuse to throw her out of her shared bedroom for being "strange". <br /> <br /> As for the acting, it's pretty clear that Jamie Lynn Spears got this role because of her Name, not talent. Although it has definitely improved as time passes, it is clear that she is not a born actress, which greatly affects the quality of the show, since most of the plot lines revolve around her character. The cast of support is surprisingly good, especially considering the material they have to work with. They offer quite a few good comments from a single line for comic relief, if the plot has not yet ventured into the dark. <br /> <br /> In general, Zoey 101 is a defective vision in high school life, and all of her past limited years should also not expect much from it.
