Before I actually release this movie, I just want to say that I loved it. <br /> <br /> Firstly, how many times in the movie did the characters use the phrase "Are you right"? I'm sure I counted hundreds of people before I gave up and started watching the movie again. <br /> <br /> Secondly, what the hell is going on with those blue monkey things? Well, then the Dansen family led very private lives and had a brown eye and a blue eye, but since when does that transform people into underground carnivorous blue zombie creatures? protect me 'hahaha :)
