See Dick's work. <br /> <br /> See Jane's work. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane are married. <br /> <br /> They are successful. <br /> <br /> They have a son. <br /> <br /> They have a nice house. <br /> <br /> They have a Latina housekeeper. <br /> <br /> The housekeeper teaches her son Spanish. <br /> <br /> The son speaks Spanish. <br /> <br /> Ha-ha. <br /> <br /> See how Dick is promoted. <br /> <br /> The pompous CEO is a con man. <Br /> <br /> See Dick in the pompous CEO. <br /> <br /> Jane quits her job. <br /> <br /> Oops. <br /> <br /> See Dick and Jane Outside of work. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane turn to crime. <br /> <br /> As a plot, they decide to steal from the CEO. <br /> <br /> See theft fall. <br /> <br /> See Dick and Jane fund the company's pension plan with the money from the theft. <br /> <br /> Yay. See the final credits. <br /> <br /> Well, then you have the plot. Beyond that, Dick and Jane worry about one scene to another. One that just connects with the last or the next. The whole thing is terribly episodic in nature. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey did not bother bringing his "A" material, he just seems bored and a little embarrassed about the whole thing. But heck, when they pay you $ 20 million more, why bother? Tea Leoni is frantic. I suppose he would be desperate not to be blamed for this failure. <br /> <br /> There's something wrong with Dick & Jane. Carrey and Leoni are not funny and have little chemistry. The script is not funny. And it is not well drawn. <br /> <br /> But it can be bigger than that. The reality of Dick and Jane is, perhaps, too real. It may not be fun for people to lose their jobs in a situation like Enron, when real life still lacks a happy ending.
