This is really one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It's not funny at all. It simply portrays a British environment of the lower class north. It seems to me a very sad movie in other parts, while in other cuts it is where they should not be. One thing that really bothered me were the close-ups of nonsense objects that really slowed down the movie. I only made it through the film because I advanced some sequences quickly towards the end. <br /> <br /> This movie completely loses the attention of the audience. The main problem is that it generates multiple reasons for an action, which in turn tends to weaken that action. However, if there is a reason for an action, it makes it more passionate. In general, this movie is everywhere. I did not learn enough about the characters to care about them because of the changing plot lines and stories in which, as I would have liked, I explored the life of a character. <br /> <br /> For example, at the beginning, when the boy meets God at the bar, God seems like a great guy. The film could have developed at that time and I think it would have been much more fun. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough if it is. Look at it if you want, but I warn you that this movie is crap. I respect the creators for trying to achieve it with such a low budget, but they could have done a much better job. I guess everything is based on the movement and editing of the camera, the performance was decent. But, again, that's just my opinion.
