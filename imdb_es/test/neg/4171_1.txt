Apparently I'm swimming against the tide of the brilliant comments in this movie. I have not seen it since I was 4 or 5 years old, but there is one thing that I clearly remember ... <br /> <br /> The Bunyip was TERRIFICING! Frightening inducing nightmare With the spooky music and the girl and the kangaroo running / jumping for their lives ... <br /> <br /> As a child I also remember the animated Hobbit ... do not worry. Sunken ship? He did not blink. Point and the kangaroo? Still chasing my dreams. And I have several friends of the same age who also think I was massively spooky. Maybe we can get a group rate in therapy. <br /> <br /> In summary: a freaky movie for your time.
