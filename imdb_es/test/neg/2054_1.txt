I rented this movie today ... the worst movie of all. It was a total waste of time and a horrible story. The acting was horrible, especially by the "Sai" actress. She was so bad that it was ridiculous. I can not tell if it was his bad performance or because the character was so stupid in the first place. I can not even stop thinking about how horrible and meaningless this whole movie was. I'm surprised that someone thought it was a good idea to film this movie and bother to release it. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good vampire / horror movie ... this is not the movie for you. Move to the right! It is a waste of time and money. Hell, I would not even DOWNLOAD this movie if someone pays me. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it does not even deserve a "1". I wish I could give it a "0"!
