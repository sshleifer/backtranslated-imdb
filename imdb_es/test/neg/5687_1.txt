I knew it would be a bad movie when I rented it, but I expected a good bad movie. Oh, well, I had fun mocking the endless sand walk, eating camel dung (well, actually eggplant) and making strange faces acting, I think there were about five actors. The DVD needs a comment from the director so he can know what he thought ... or if he was doing it. I can not believe they really went to England, Austria and anywhere to film this ... they could have been done ANYWHERE. It would have been better if they had managed to strip her naked. The best line of the movie? "He is waiting for his improvements." "Yes, I'm still waiting." Now that was fun! If someone has more than 3 pages of dialogue (beyond the narrator ... CERTAIN NOW), I will see it again.
