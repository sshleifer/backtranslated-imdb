I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just for the cover of the movie case. The judge and the jury started a good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bicycle with a great gun, but this movie became increasingly stupid as it went. David Keith is an incredible actor, especially when he plays a role like this. Too bad the movie was a piece of shit that really squandered his talent. The judge and the jury were completely stupid. I gave him a 3, I should have given him a 2, I gave him an extra star just because David Keith's gun was great.
