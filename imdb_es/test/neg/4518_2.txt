Why this film has so many favorable reviews? <br /> <br /> This is amateur, not funny and annoying. <br /> <br /> The only memorable thing here is the cheesy title song. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are low and the "funny" ideas (if you want to call them that) are weak, they look like remnants of SNL leftovers that even they would not dare to put on the screen. <br /> <br /> I am starting to completely distrust the IMDb ratings. <br /> <br /> This is light years away from Kentucky Fried Movie, not even in the same galaxy. <br /> <br /> It is not even possible to write 10 lines about it. <br /> <br /> Well, another good thing: ugly street scenes and ugly people, something one can not see much on television and movies today.
