The Hollywood film industry is the laziest in the world. It only takes a single hit to flood the theaters with the same old shit that reinvents itself again and again. Take the superheroes, for example, for each X-Man and Spiderman, there are Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worse. He just took The Ring, which was perfect for the tone (mostly due to Mr. Gore Verbinsky), to bring a ton of horrors based on creepy women, for example. The Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was fine, but meaningless), and grudges. <br /> <br /> The first Grudge was not all bad. It scared most of the way, which is what one would expect from him. In addition, the plot had some brains mixing stories. Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous one; This could be a good thing, but hey, what boy, Men in Black II? Was the entire script good for xerox and simply change the villain? For the Grudge 2, the critic follows the same path. <br /> <br /> Afraid fear, bad acting (except for Amber Tamblyn), and clich√©s all over the place. Three stories take place, in different places and times. There is Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigating what led her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to death; Allison (Arielle Kebbel), who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident described in the first film occurred; and finally, an American family that witnesses strange things that happen in the apartment next door. I am happy to say (and I mean it) that everything is tied up at the end, but one should not rely on the end to make a good image, when everything else is simply boring and boring. <br /> <br /> There are chills everywhere, a single girl in the lockers, someone who should not enter a house, others who dig too deep. Meanwhile, ghosts continue to kill and kill and kill, which seems even more deadly than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey, does not that look like another bad Japanese version, something called Pulse? Yes, day after day it is easier to hold a grudge against Hollywood nonsense.
