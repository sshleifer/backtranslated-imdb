I can not believe he let me rent that piece of garbage! The acting was so poor, my grandmother could have done better. The blows thrown in the movies were not close to the character that the Scarecrow was throwing to the ground. The movie became a chore to watch! <br /> <br /> So this group of baseball players decide to go to hazing, even after they were not supposed to do it on the orders of the coach under consequences. So, naturally, they go anyway. They decide to tie a loser to a post with the so-called "Scarecrow". When the loser's best friend finds out about this, he and his girlfriend will rescue him. <br /> <br /> It is discovered that the child has diabetes and is hospitalized, while the athletes go to the beach the next. day. The scarecrow finds them there and kills them all. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you really do not care. Anyway, the Scarecrow ends up having a connection with "Diabetes Boy" and the boy begins to finish the scarecrow job once the scarecrow is killed. Yes, it's really very corny. <br /> <br /> He thought that this movie was full of bull sh * t. Sooner or later, the only ones who live (naturally) are the boyfriend and girlfriend who are the main characters :) Evil is transferred to the groom, and he kills himself to break the curse so that no one else gets hurt. Touching hey? No, do not waste your hard earned money on this, I give it a score of one, since that is the lowest, otherwise, it does not even deserve that.
