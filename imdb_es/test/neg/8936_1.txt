One of the worst movies that have been made ... If you can go through these movies without falling asleep, then you're doing quite well, considering that no matter how much you increase the volume, you can not hear what the "actors" are (?) saying and if you can really see what is happening from the terrible movie (I mean hell if you can not find something that works better ... use a homemade camera ... AT LEAST YOU CAN REALLY SAY WHAT HAPPENS!) <br / > <br /> It's beyond my imagination how people get a movie like this to slip through the cracks and escape in the video ... and even more ... how the people who do this do not know how terrible it is it's ... my God ... (!) <br /> <br /> After what I just told you ... If you're waiting for a summary of this garbage movie, there's nothing to tell . .. a group of campers on motorcycles get lost in the forest and a group of people terrorize them ... or something like that ... what is more an action movie than a horror movie ... this "movie" ( ?) is of NO interest ... I If someone really likes this, I literally feel sorry for you ... <br /> <br /> Absolute Trash ... not even one of those cheap and fun movies to watch go to rent ... 'Plan 9 From Outerspace' and I have a ball
