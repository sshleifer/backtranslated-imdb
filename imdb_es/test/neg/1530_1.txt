Not for the first time, I am out of place with the opinion of the majority. Oz is a fearsome, pretentious, voyeuristic series. The manufacturers have their cake and eat it. Oz, Em City, etc. they are used as ultra-crude signals that the apparent evil is a complete fantasy. This allows the spectators the weakest intellectual excuses to see nonsense in the soap opera seasoned with all that is bad about human beings. <br /> <br /> When you watch an episode, remember that while it is badly spoken, it is violent, absurdly complicated. An imaginary drama, unconvincing, ill, develops before its approving eyes, several hundred babies in the poorest parts of the world have died from bad food or water. <br /> <br /> Oz is the exploitative drama at its worst. Appeals to the most basic instincts, but pretends to be serious and meaningful. It blows heat and cold and changes from fortissimo to pianissimo more often than a Mahler symphony. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is relentlessly ugly and utilitarian. The freedoms taken with realities are stupid. Here is a nightclub with a dandy, who arrives in Oz in his elegant attire, complete with a ridiculously cloudy contact lens in one eye, brandishing a cache of drugs that no one detected. Here is a murderous scoundrel who talks about the heat of the universe, begging to be killed, but, of course, the brute is denied and it becomes a little improbable by cutting his throat. <br /> <br /> The action continues. at a rate fast enough for the voyeuristic and foolish spectator to always think about what happens next, instead of the trash that has just been shown. Do not worry, a betrayal, a murder, a sex scene will develop in a minute or two. <br /> <br /> Finally, Oz is obviously pretentious. You do not have to feel ashamed to be carried by your flow. You can see it and tell yourself that the producers, writers and actors are doing everything possible with a great wink (or the same word but for a vowel change) to the audience. <br /> <br /> Yes, you can be an unpleasant spectator and apologize for intelligence, postmodernist skills, etc. of the Oz production team. They appeal to the lowest common denominator while pretending to operate on a higher plane. <br /> <br /> In truth, a despicable series. And every hour is shown, rewarding its creators and actors, and generating advertising revenue for the channels that show it to people who have nothing better to do than see something so ugly and unnecessary, hundreds of other children whose lives they could have been saved. The dollars spent for this horrible, successful and widely praised series.
