** SPOILERS ** The killer in the movie does not wait for a second when we see him sneaking into a girls shower and forcibly killing her, taking his injured and bloodied arm as he escapes. Then we received this official prologue, as if we were looking at a real story, which claimed that a number of horrific murders were committed in the late fall of 1985 in a small collage of the Midwest. <br /> <br /> Grandfather looking and hearing impaired, Sheriff Ron Delboys is baffled by this murder and later, when the murders of local collage students, all women, continues, his candidacy for the state senator is in danger with him, making the investigation difficult at all times. There are at least two times when Delboys says they will never be another murder while he is in the case and in a few minutes another murder happens. <br /> <br /> Finding a golden amulet at the scene of each murder, the daughter sheriff, the collage librarian, Tina finds this reference book on Withcraft that indicates that the amulet is a symbol of a cult of witches which originated in the early 1700s, just after the Salem witch trials. This cult was to avenge the 19 accused witches hung by the people of the local town in 1692 and went out at night killing men and women of authority and taking off with a part of the body. When the parts of the body formed a complete person, they would be burned in a hidden ritual of the midnight bonfire. <br /> <br /> You never understand exactly what is happening in the movie "Blood Cult", not just because it is totally disconnected. History, but it is increasingly scandalous and of graduation, especially by Charles Ellis playing Sheriff Ron Delboys. Getting into more trouble, even the loose assassin could have gotten him. The clumsy Sheriff Delboys ends up with his coffee busted with spikes and almost burned alive, after being dismembered. The only reason he was not is because he seemed to have imagined everything under the influence of a strong and nameless drug. <br /> <br /> There is a sequence of strange dreams in the film that suggests that many respected members of the community are members of the Witch Cult that is responsible for the murders of the sororities of women. The film does not bother to explain at all if the dream, that had the drugged Sheriff Delboys, was a dream or, really, a true experience on his part to leave everything as if it had been eliminated from the movie! <Br /> <br /> Leaving the hospital and betting on the collage brotherhood house, while chewing on a bag full of McDonald's cheeseburgers, Sheriff Delboys finally comes face to face with the killer. Shefiff Delboys realizes his surprise and amazement that not only does he know who he or she is, but he is also willing to let the killer escape. <br /> <br /> The first video straight to the video and shows Not only anyone in their right mind would be crazy enough to pay for admission, at least with the video that can be recorded. Thank God for seeing this disaster, but no owner of a movie theater would dare to play it on your screen without the danger of The outraged customers, in a justifiable display of righteous indignation, destroy the place!
