This is my opinion of this film, expressed in its dialogues. <br /> <br /> To be more serious, I can not say that this movie is a bad moment, but I did not enjoy it either. <br /> <br /> First, I was simply indifferent and could not get into the world of the apes. Even though the makeup is very realistic, the constant screaming was irritating. Maybe the movie has changed monkeys for cats and it is a cult movie for me in relation to my love for the latter. <br /> <br /> The second part is more interesting, with the talent and freshness of the newcomers (Macdowell and Lambert), but I felt alienated: the whole story is set in a large British mansion: no matter how Luxurious, it was like a prison for me. <br /> <br /> Finally, it could be a good idea. Adaptation of the Burroughs story of Tarzan? I do not know, I've never read the book (or seen the Disney) :. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I have no good time to remember, so one view would be enough for me. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called "Overture" at the beginning ... What is the meaning? Only the director knows.
