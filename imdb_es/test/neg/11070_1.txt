If I could give this excuse for a movie a rating of 0 or negative, I would. I was stupid enough to pick up this DVD in the store, read the propaganda and think, that sounds pretty good, I'll spend £ 10 and buy it. all I got in the end was a rollercoaster of £ 10. Absolutely horrible, I do not even know where to start. I have no idea why someone has given more than 2 stars because I can not think of anything good to say about it. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically, 7 people enter an unexplored cave, one of them is a reporter. no one else knows they are there. When they enter the cave, they can not leave and a monster kills them one by one. There is no reason for the reporter. One of the characters has some demons from the past where his ex-girlfriend drowns in a cave 2 years ago ... there does not seem to be any relevance or reason for that either, just an attempt at garbage in the construction of the character, I suppose. Anyway, the monster turns out to be a guy who wandered in the cave like a normal child and has lived there his whole life. This, for no reason, makes him superhuman, able to shine, see in the dark, take bullets, breathe under water, be in 2 places at once and have an insane strength (being able to move rocks, carry adult men as weight dead, etc.). <br /> <br /> In the final scene there are 2 women alive, they wake up naked, covered only with a little carpet or something. Then they find a picture of a child. The Monster then bursts into the door, wrapped in a carpet with a kind of animal skull on its head (it says in the commentary of the directors that it was a crow's skull, if so, it would be the biggest crow I've seen in my life). life) and literally says "Raaahhh" as a child on Halloween. I was watching it with my boyfriend and at that moment he literally laughed. Then, the boy sees an image of himself as a child and has a memory of him sitting under a tree with his face burned and then getting up and wandering in the cave. That is the extension of the background story of why he mutilates people and leaves you a little deceived by a story. The monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other, cutting to end the credits. I know that the rape scene was designed to be shocking, but as a woman it just made me feel pretty bad and it was what affected me the most in the whole movie. He could have killed her, cut her to pieces and eaten her, and it would have been less horrible than the scene of rape. <br /> <br /> There are many things that remain unanswered at the end. Apart from all this, the scenes in which there were minutes at the same time of black and nothing else were annoying, and the angles of the camera with constant nausea where everything is upside down and you can not see what is happening, they harass me so much at one point. I almost turned it off. An absolutely terrible movie. It is better that you get the money that you would spend on it and set fire to it, it would be better spent money, as one intelligent person who published above me said, once you have seen it, you can not see it. that.
