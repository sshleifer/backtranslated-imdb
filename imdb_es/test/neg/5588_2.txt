Wow, what is this on the shelf of the video rental store in front of me? Nothing more than a questionable "sequel" to 8MM. It was not a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive ending and an abundance of emotional depth much greater than this film. <br /> <br /> Basically, from the plot's plot literally, an American diplomat, David. Huxley and her fiancee, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underground world of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary, to find out who is blackmailing them with a porn video of them with a prostitute, Risa. The full story is based on the different characters that make up these various sex clubs and striptease throughout the city. The mystery is resolved when, in the end, Tish discovers that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later in the story) her fiancee who left her trust fund money basically returns to her future husband as the story. it develops to the bitter end. <br /> <br /> I did not like that this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all. The only thing close to the original is the kind of thriller it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage gadget on him to keep him in prison, it seems like the perverted world of the first movie, and the fact that everything movie has the recorded sex in almost all the key scenes. Otherwise, it's a totally different movie. It was a bad love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending a bigger possibility because I did not believe the words that came out of David's mouth all the time. But they warned us that he was a liar about most things that could get in trouble. <br /> <br /> There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the "shocking" moments of the film, which tried to provoke emotions. in the audience to encourage Tish to discover the plot so she can leave this "infernal" sexual debauchery. I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed footage when there was nothing but sex to show. Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing more than a movie with nude women to make the DVD look totally provocative. <br /> <br /> David was not a heroic person in the whole movie. You could guess that he was the main problem long before the end. The actors who played each role were all new to me, which could explain how they managed to get many of them undressed to gain "respect" when acting. There were holes in the plot (how did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so involved in this damn investigation to try to find a prostitute?) There were moments of cheesy technology (like the talking email program dressed as a bondage queen), and a gay brother character who did nothing more than show how the director tried to get an imitation of Joaquin Phoenix to play this character. The tag line that appears on this profile for this video is also full BS, because it was not even a last sigh. Nobody really dies. But they did have a good sequence of car crashes that came out of nowhere ... but that lasted 10 seconds in an hour and 3/4 in a movie. <br /> <br /> Go rent (and maybe buy) the original. It is one of the best and most original films of Joel Schumacher. It has everything better of this movie. I would not recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples with oranges.
