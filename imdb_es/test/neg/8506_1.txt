I remember this movie with feelings of pure. . . agony. More than half of the film is commercial (no, seriously!). The little excuse for a story could easily have been told in 25 minutes (and it almost is!) The end result is a prefabricated love story of predictable brambles, all obviously launched in a commercially rude attempt to squeeze a few dollars more than contemporary. Debbie Boone hit. Yes, that's how fast it happened ... the song that "inspired" was still big on the charts when the movie premiered! <br /> <br /> Despite decades of watching bad films, this still impresses me with its extravagant, unimpeded, jumps precipitously towards the most tedious, absurd and indelible cinematographic evil. He really deserves to be on the IMDb list of the worst 100 of all time, and he has never left the top 3 on my "worst" personal list. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it for pure masochistic emotion!
