This finely crafted film commits the unforgivable (which is ironic, given the theme of the film). No one who comes to this film knows what it is. Worse than that, 3/4 of the way to the movie, no one has a clue what it is, because everything up to that "moment" is a different movie. <br /> <br /> As a fan of the first row of Dutcher's first two films, easily competing for the Best 2 Mormon films to date (competing with Saints and Soldiers and, now, New York Doll, which in a screening), Dutcher made me want to see his movie for a long time. I was there. I wanted to believe, I think I would see the next great Mormon movie, one that would hold the place of Number One for a long time. But no. Three-quarters of the film took the most left turns and dragged me through something I never wanted to go through. He takes in the bush. There are always moral problems, yes, both with little time or emotional capacity to deal with them properly, but instead it moves them away with a nod to Jesus, as if that made everything right, instantly. (It's true that Jesus saves, do not accuse me of not believing that, that's not Dutcher's problem). <br /> <br /> Is the movie well filmed? Indeed. Are the actors acting? They took off their pants. Was the music appropriate? All except what it was about the final credits. Everything about this movie was excellent, except the story, which was so wet and wrong, that everything else does not matter. (By the way, I learned "dank" from New York Doll, a very decent show.) The third act of the film was neither desirable nor enjoyable nor was it an affirmation of faith. I know Dutcher was leaning back to do it like that, but at that moment I was so far away from the movie that nothing, nothing, could have brought me back. The ridiculous disbelief of dozens of details in the final minutes did not help. Anyone who has been on a mission knows what I'm talking about, especially from someone who "Spoiler Alert" is familiar with the events surrounding someone who was sent home after a mission for moral and / or psychological reasons. It is as if suddenly a parallel universe arose where suddenly rules or normal behaviors do not apply. <br /> <br /> There are a million good things in this movie, but they were created and embellished only to be trampled and thrown into an instinctive attack of "ooh, this will really get" elitism. Therefore, unforgivable. I can only hope that when Dutcher puts the finishing touches on his next film ("Falling", apparently), remember that film critics can only buy so many tickets and that it is the fans who pay the bills. That is why the first Army of God was so unconditionally successful. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's surprise and amazement approach shows that, when it comes to the Great Issues, he is in a very difficult situation, he has no spiritual or creative maturity. Business sense necessary to assume them. I pray! He learns his lesson and, from here on, he and we all look back, with disgust, and we are glad to have taken our head out of where the Light does not shine and really, successfully, take on those and other issues and change the world forever for that.
