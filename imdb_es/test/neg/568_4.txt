A really funny idea of ​​history with good actors but it is lost in some way. The actors are older, but none of them looked particularly good. They needed better makeup, photography or something like that. It's supposed to be a love story, and yet the movie had the rough look of a street movie. I liked the cast but I think the performances were quite smooth. This is where the director's weakness manifests itself. Maybe if Mrs. Spielberg had Mr. Spielberg directing it, it would have been a much better movie.
