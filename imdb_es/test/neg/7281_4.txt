I really do not see how anyone could enjoy this movie. I do not think I've seen a movie as boring as this self-indulgent scrap. It would probably have been better if the director had not spent most of the film showing his own work of art, which is not really that remarkable. Another thing that I really did not like is that when a character was punched in the face, a gallon of blood would sprout soon after. I do not know how people bleed in Japan, but I hope they have a lot of blood donors.
