"Death Wish 3" is the equivalent of a movie from a shooting gallery. All the characters (apart from Paul Kersey of Bronson, of course) exist simply to be killed, either as "provocation" (the good ones) or as "retribution" (the villains). The director simply engages in pointless violence (even people are burned alive and explodes), turning this into an urban version of "Commando" (and Charlie, like Arnold, seldom bothers to protect himself from enemy fire) . Fans of this short of things (and, apparently, there are many) will enjoy it, others ... beware. (* 1/2)
