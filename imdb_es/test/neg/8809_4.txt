Hey, this is a popcorn movie, nothing more. I saw him with a group of friends (and although that is NOT the best way to see a horror movie ...) and most of the dialogues and actions were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> He left me really looking forward to A real movie. :) <br /> <br /> The main problem is the lack of tension in the film. It keeps flashing until the "explanation" scenes, which dissipate any noticeable tension. <br /> <br /> And the character relationship "twists"? Yes, they stink. I will not say what they are, but they just do not add anything to the movie / story. <br /> <br /> (By relation, I mean the two main characters). <br /> <br /> Eek. My recommendation is this: watch this movie if you can not think of something better. Mediocre at best ... Maybe not even that.
