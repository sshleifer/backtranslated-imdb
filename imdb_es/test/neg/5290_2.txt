Twenty years ago, Dr. Chopper (yes, he is driving a helicopter and cutting people) disappeared when police found bodies in his clinic. Since then, people have been disappearing around Lake Tanoka (or something like that) and corpses / body parts have been found everywhere. It turns out that Dr. Chopper needs body parts to stay alive and has been taking them away from strangers, like a couple of lesbians and 5 girls of the sisterhood of women in their initiation (you get an idea) traveling around Lake Tanoka . When a group of teenagers decide to go camping, they are forced to collide with the doctor ... <br /> <br /> Well, if you want to waste your time, this is the right choice. Acting varies from very bad to mediocre with the girls stumbling and falling all the time without any apparent reason. They take all the possibilities of showing skin but without showing anything. The same goes for special effects that are quite pathetic with each bar recorded at an angle, so you can not see them, but there are many body parts in the movie, all soaked in blood (probably to cover how sad they look) . The plot is quite defective and the dialogue quite sad. The only time I laughed was when Dr. Chopper said, "Good!" when you try to be scary Do not look at this if you're not a hack'n'slash fan. Even then I would recommend that you see something better.
