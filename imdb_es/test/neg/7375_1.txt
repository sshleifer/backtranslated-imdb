I absolutely could not believe the levels of ineptitude on display in this production. I honestly thought that gay men had better taste than this. I know so. <br /> <br /> Most of the blame is not in the cast, but first we're going to eliminate them ... the only one with real talent was Joe Souza (besides him he had the best body in the cast). He had a nice, clear voice in the theater style. Okay, and Jaymes Hodges' voice was regular, but he had an empty expression in each number. The rest could not hold a note in a cube, although obviously the music was folded after the fact. It must have been really terrible to hear them live. They were also all girls' boys, except maybe three. If I wanted to see naked women on the stage I could go to the tits bars. I'm not sure why someone would choose to shoot L.A. instead of New York. I imagine that NY has more talent to sing easily available, although one would think that in L.A. they would be able to find guys with better looks. Apparently not. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... the real fault lies in the creators and producers. This score was the most insipid and banal gut I've heard. It sounded like some queens in the theater took all their music records, threw them in a blender and poured the goo on a page. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many who can not tell the difference between good theatrical writing and whatever that is. I mean seriously, I was laughing about the whole thing, but not about the jokes. I think the morbid 'song of my lover who died of AIDS' entitled "Kris, look what you've lost" was the most hysterical thing in the whole show. Genius writing ... Kris / Lost ... wow ... almost rhyme ... it must be a good handwriting. And Jesus ... the END of that song ... "Oh Kris, Ohhh Kris, OHHHH Kris ..." Â¡DE VAN YA !!! My other favorite was "You have to be a Pumpy Junkie Boy to be a Humpy Hunkie Boy" ... WTF ??? The whole show was full of the most arbitrary lyrics, JUST BECAUSE they rhymed. Where did these people learn to write songs? Apparently they listened to Sondheim and said: "He's not so good, I can do that" ... as evidenced by the delay "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby" reference of the COMPANY in a song. Another irritation: why do 20-year-olds sing about Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter? Obviously, from the mouth of the lyricists and not the actors ... again, poorly written. <br /> <br /> If you love torture and pain, and I know that many of you, strange fetishists, do it, move forward and observe. But you have been warned.
