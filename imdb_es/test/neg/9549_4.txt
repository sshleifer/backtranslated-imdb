The plot has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile. Jolie's performance is quite flat and poor, Washington's is fine, the rest of the cast are cardboard cutouts. Somehow, almost everything about this movie oozes mediocrity. The plot is lame. The only thing I liked more or less about this movie are the quite original methods the author uses to kill his victims. The technical details are worse than the "knowledge" and the more extended gadgets of CSI, and in the middle of the movie one wonders if the director cared about the credibility of the details. (Some Spoilers from now on!) I mean, an electrocardiogram machine (EKG) with a pure sinus wave that reflects the heartbeat of a man, a quadriplegic with full-body muscle spasms and a working index finger, safe. An assassin that destroys the entrails of a man while keeping him alive to allow the rats to feed on him followed by a rat that points to the type's FACE. What's up with all that stupidity? Then there are quite a few continuity errors, but you can find them elsewhere in IMDb here. Honestly, I found it a little insulting even for my limited intelligence. <br /> <br /> A waste of time. Still 4 out of 10 to prevent my girlfriend from kicking me.
