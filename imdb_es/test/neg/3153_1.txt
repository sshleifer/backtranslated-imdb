Barney is simply horrible. As many of the other comments in this program say. I do not agree with them (I will not). Because I hate this show as much as they do. They use children who seem to be in sixth grade, cheesy frames, horrible dialogues and really horrible special effects. Not to mention that big purple dinosaur. It makes all children's shows look like prize winners (Sesame Street has won awards, to my knowledge). <br /> <br /> Please, just watch Sesame Street, Thomas the Tank Engine or even the Teletubbies. Avoid so much, this and your movie (which I've also reviewed). Both are extremely bad and are not suitable for anyone (even small babies).
