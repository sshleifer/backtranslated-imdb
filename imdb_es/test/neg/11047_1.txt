It seems that some viewers assume that the only thing that can make the viewer not like this movie is graphic violence. In fact, the violence, both disturbing and caricatured, is the last of the deep faults of "Oldboy". The characters are one-dimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. The "intensity", an obsession and a goal in itself with this director, is served with the most economical means. Let's not confuse a senseless shot of adrenaline with artistic value. At the end of the film, it seems that all the letters ran out, so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of "horror", to continue "impacting" an audience that is already numbed by the plethora of silent "revelations" of telenovelas already served in large bundles. It would be hard to imagine anyone who is vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of Asian cinema who are captivated by this pompous piece of garbage. Imagine Homer Simpson hesitating in front of the cinema: "Should I enter or should I buy five ice cream cones for the same money?" Be smart, Homer, go for the ice cream.
