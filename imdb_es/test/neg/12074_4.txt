This film follows the life of a great guitarist, who wants to succeed big but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self-destruction. <br /> <br /> I expected the usual dialogues, sarcasm and humor of Woody Allen. but "Sweet and Lowdown" did not provide any. The main character, Emmet Ray, is a self-centered, rude, irresponsible and hurtful man. He is so unpleasant, that I do not want him now, or I care about him. I wonder why a movie about him has to be made. The pace of the story is slow, which makes the movie a terrible hole. Even Sean Penn's great performance fails to revive the film at a visible level. <br /> <br /> I really like Woody Allen movies, but "Sweet and Lowdown" is a big disappointment.
