Both Killjoy 1 and Killjoy 2 stank, but the first one was better. The special effects in this movie were not special at all. Even though the murders were better in this installment, they were nothing to brag about. One thing that was worse in part 2 were the characters. Suddenly the emotions changed, and some of their lines were simply silent. For example, a character quoted: "You better have something from R.E.S.P.E.C.T.o you will discover what it means to me". Once I heard that phrase, I thought it was the worst I had ever heard. Another thing that I hated about this movie was the fact that it was too short. A successful movie has to last more than an hour and twenty minutes, like Killjoy 2. If Full Moon does part 3 of Killjoy, that would be to crouch at the lowest possible level. In general, 1 out of 10. <br /> <br />
