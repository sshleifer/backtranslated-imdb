Do not kill me fanatics, but I have something to say about it. <br /> <br /> Pros: Well, the most interesting season I've seen outside of all the seasons that are outside Inuyasha is the only one. To be the shichinintai arch. Unlike the rest of the stations, I personally think that it has more than one real plot and those mercenaries; My God, they are such nice characters. Too bad they were killed. Of course, I would write a 15 page essay that I like so much the Shichinintai, but that would be boring for some of you. So this series really has some nice characters. I will miss Bankotsu ... poor, poor psycho child. <br /> <br /> Cons: Outside the Shichinintai arch, the series was boring, repetitive and some of the characters are extremely irritating. Kagome, for example: She reacts too much to my taste; she acts as Yuka of Elfen Lied. Inuyasha: He is a noisy demon mouth dog with a huge sword. What is so unique about him? He has adorable dog ears! Tch. Sesshomaru is all talk, without action and very cocky. Naraku has just become the weakest villain that ever existed in the anime world. Miroku and Sango ... they have some color, but they seem to be too much on the sidelines. But what bothers me the most is the fact that they have no common sense. Rumiko Takahashi has done MUCH better than this. I have seen it before. <br /> <br /> If you like the series with a lot of action, without an annoying love triangle, without more repetitiveness, this is not for you.
