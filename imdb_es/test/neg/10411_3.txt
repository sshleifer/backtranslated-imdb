A family (a teenager, his mother and stepfather), fed up with the life of the city, decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and start over. However, his idyll is destroyed by three brothers and his dominant father, who do not take into consideration the newcomers in his patch. While the objects thrown out the window and being threatened on the street is just the beginning, the young decide to make things worse by having a relationship with the terrible sister of the trio. Since the law is not willing to do anything about it and the violence increases rapidly, the boy decides to take the matter into his own hands ... <br /> <br /> Wandering wildly between hilarity and the unpleasant, this It is one of the strangest exploitation films ever made. At first, you can laugh at some of the hammy performances and the ridiculous dialogue that is given to the characters, especially the bad guys. But then, there are completely unnecessary scenes like a mother raped while her son is forced to watch, or the sister of the thug is beaten by her brothers for daring to sleep with our young hero. In fact, the whole vision of the women in the film, who seem to be pathetic creatures who scream a lot and can not defend themselves, is pretty despicable. But, of course, there is the compulsory nudity scene, which this time involves a young woman who dives into a bra in the pool without a very thin shirt. Who cares about the consistency of the plot when you have some young stars ready to throw their togs? True ?! <br /> <br /> The climax is focused on the teenager, who until now has not been able to sneeze without jumping, suddenly transforms into a clone of Rambo and expels his assailants left, right and center to save. His stepfather, who is being kidnapped by the gang. It's completely unlikely, but hey, so is everything in this movie ... so at least you can not accuse him of not being consistent. So, instead of trying to find logic in a place where the word does not exist, check out the IMDb pages of Janet Laine Green, Dehl Berti, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Crombie, etc. Observe a pattern emerging here? All their careers came to an impasse. Why? Sit through this, and everything will be clarified. Remember the children, if you want to get ahead in this business, hire a decent agent and ALWAYS read the scripts they offer. Please .. 3/10
