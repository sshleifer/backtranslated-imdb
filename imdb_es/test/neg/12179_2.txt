Secret Service agent Jay Killion (Charles Bronson) has been assigned to protect the wife of the President-elect, the new First Lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman and Killion has her hands full. He is the victim of numerous assassination attempts, all directed by the Chief of Staff of the President, who wants the First Lady to be dead. This movie insults your intelligence not only with the storyline, but also with the lack of realistic locations. For example, in the scene that represents the Inaugural Parade, the First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with agent Killion and without the President. In addition, we know what Washington, DC, is about the weather in January, and not only are all "unpalatable", but you can also see some palm trees in the 70 degrees and sunny weather. (Obviously filmed in Hollywood, not in Washington, DC). This movie is a joke. It's not worth your time.
