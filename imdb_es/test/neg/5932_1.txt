In the third installment of "Left Behind", the manufacturers did not care to put ANY TYPE OF CONTINUITY in the plot. Although all the weapons on the planet have been confiscated by the United Nations, the Third World War suddenly begins with the snap of a finger. In a few seconds, the former lover of one of the main characters goes from seducing him passionately to absolute hatred to a melancholy confession of love without any trace of direction. <br /> <br /> But mainly this movie is really an irony-free zone. After the president of the United States accepts Jesus as his savior, he immediately becomes a suicide bomber and blows up a skyscraper in the center of the city. Osama Bin Laden will be very jealous when he sees this movie!
