First of all, I think the casting and acting were excellent. The problem is the story. Basically there is not a story here that is worth telling and, therefore, basically, there is no movie here. Larry McMurtry has done Lonesome Dove and I can not criticize the original, although it probably did not need sequels. He made Hud with Paul Newman, which is one of my favorite movies. Mellencamp is supposed to be a country singer, but the only song I hear him singing is an old song by Buck Owens. The movie does a lot with raising chickens. The character of Mellencamp has a good wife, and it is completely stupid to get away from her. The incident with riding in the sliding cage is absolutely stupid. Maybe people do that for fun in some parts of the country, but I've never heard of that.
