Little did I know that when I enrolled in the "All Pay Channel" package with Direct TV, I would face a movie like this. It came right after another movie we had been watching ... and I was a teenager in 1981, so I'm not sure where I was at that moment ... but I missed this movie. <br /> <br /> I also can not believe we leave it on. It's kind of funny, since it takes you back to the time machine in the early 80's ... but I think even then this would have been a painful movie. It was just ... well ... "too cute"! ET was "cute" in a way ... but not terribly cute ... and stupid. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie like this ... I come to IMDb to see what others are saying. I'm impressed that this thing was nominated! Wow ... the film industry has come a long way since the 80s! Oh, well ... it showed some old actors ... by the way, that's the other thing that surprised me ... the lineup ... not a bunch of non-names ... but some real actors / actresses. He must have been on his drug days! Anyway ... strange, interesting, bizarre, and makes one who grew up happy.
