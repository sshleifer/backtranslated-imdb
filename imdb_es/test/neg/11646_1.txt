Get away from this movie! It is terrible in every way. Bad performance, a thin recycled plot and the worst ending in the history of cinema. I rarely see a movie that makes my adrenaline go irritated, in fact, the only other movie that comes to my mind is another movie about "people in a plane in trouble" (Airspeed). Please, do not look at this because it is completely pathetic from start to finish. Helge Iversen
