For what it's worth, this is a pretty decent cartoon of Road Runner, albeit a little short (just under 6 minutes). In the best of cases, the gags are adequate, the animation is competent and the new restored DVD master looks good. However, that's where the qualities end. Let me provide you with some background story: in 1958, thanks to a labor dispute, WB got a lot of canned music that would be used in 6 of the cartoons of the year. <br /> <br /> There is only one sentence to describe the music of this short film, and that is "it has the sound of 4Kids". I use that phrase to describe music that has absolutely no correspondence to the action on screen, and I feel that it was recorded by an orchestra formed by members of a Sonic Youth cover band. The music in this short film adheres irremediably and is incredibly detestable, especially considering that there are scenes in this short (namely, the piano trap) that would have worked better with little or no music. <br /> <br /> I did not do it. I think a cartoon of WB would be ruined by horrible music (even Lava's scores are not that unpleasant), but considering that the cartoon is not that noticeable anyway, it's almost painful to see it with music. It's kind of like the Doctor Who episodes of the late '80s could be bad anyway, and you can still do them without being seen thanks to Keff McCulloch's unbelievably horrible music (which sounded like you hit the demo button on your 5 Casio keyboards at the same time). <br /> <br /> I'm going to make people call me crazy about this, but I would easily see one of the Larriva RR's cartoons about this. At least the canned music was generally synchronized with their action.
