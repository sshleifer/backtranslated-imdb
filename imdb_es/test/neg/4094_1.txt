I hated this movie. In short, this movie is so bad that I almost want to ignore it ever seeing it and never mention it again. But on the other hand, I can not resist a good blow. And if there is one thing that Evan Almighty does for the public, it is that he presents the best critics. <br /> <br /> The movie (a sequel to the much more fun Bruce Almighty) begins by reintroducing the audience into Evan. Baxter, a simple character at best in the original movie. It's okay. This movie does not show Jim Carrey or Jennifer Anisten. Not even a small appearance of cameo. You know that your movie is bad when the guy who agreed to do Ace Venture: When Nature Calls will not even have a short role. But somehow they manage to keep Morgan Freeman as God. While I was sitting in the almost empty theater, bored with my mind by the lack of comedy, I could not help wondering how much money it cost to assure Freeman this movie. Then he hit me an hour ago. It's just a disposable paper that takes up all 20 minutes in the 100-minute movie. God simply appears between scenes to tell Evan to build the ark. Of course I know that Morgan Freeman will not see this movie in a year and thinks he's as good as his roles in The Shawshank Redemption and Million Dollar Baby, but it's easy money. <br /> <br /> Where was I? Oh yes, the plot. Sometimes it is so difficult to stay focused on the plot when you realize that you thought more about the plot than the screenwriter. Anyway, Evan (Steve Carell) has apparently left his job as a news anchor for a job as a congressman. Yes ... without transition in between. He never turns to his wife and says: "I think I want to be a congressman." It just happens in the first five minutes and he is forced to deal with the great transition. Well, as a congressman, he is a member of a bill proposed by the character of John Goodman when, suddenly, God seems to tell Evan to build an ark. No "Hey, how are you, how's the weather?" little bit. Only "I want you to build an ark". Evidence of bad writing: Evan determines that God is giving him clues to build an ark after noticing that a fan holds a sign that says Genesis 6:14 when he passes by his son, who is watching a televised baseball game. <br /> <br /> That's basically the plot of Evan Almighty. There are some members of the cast of random support who do everything possible to create comedy, but they do not do it very well because they are given almost no screen time. It's just his basic career in the mill family building an ark movie. Oh, and there is also that obligatory scene in which a father has to cancel his walking plans with his children and his wife because he is busy with work. They are disappointed, but they understand, like all the other times in the movie, this has happened. Only once would I love to see the youngest child address his father, kick him in the chin and say, "You're a real bastard for canceling your plans with us, now I'll become an emo." There is also that drama that you expect from the father with his family when they realize (the wife, actually ... the three children do not have problems to help dad build an ark) that has gone crazy and says that God wants He builds a big boat. But do not worry. His family decides to stay with him. Wow, I just ruined the drama. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that there is almost no good comedy going on. I know that the decision was made to classify this film as a PG movie to get a greater reaction from the crowd, but I do not think it is in the minority when I think that family humor is more than just men being kicked in the nuts and the animals. shitting Maybe I'm wrong and that's what has reduced the quality family humor. And if so, please bring me more comedies for adults so that I do not have to stay with this shit anymore (word game not intended). <br /> <br /> The ending is extra corny. Suddenly, the film takes a dramatic turn full of CGI that makes me tremble at the thought that it is a terrible waste of CGI. I bet it was expensive too. Finally, after all that waiting, we are told why God wanted Evan to build an ark. And boy oh boy I hated the reason. I'll save the details, but it was like watching or reading a murder mystery and having the killer become the person who walked behind the main character for a second and had no lines. <br /> <br /> Oh, and then there's a nice touch at the end. The song "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" plays the credits and then we submit to the "dance" of the cast. I do not understand. They spend 100 minutes without success doing a comedy and then end with a thriller. I swear I have not been so scared watching Steve Carell dance since ... well, never. There you have it guys. Evan Almighty is the most terrifying movie of all time. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought it was a wasted experience. I'm confused with all the talented actors (Carell, Freeman and Goodman) who appear in this boredom festival with Lauren Graham, the Gilmore Girls woman who has not yet shown me that she can get out of a paper bag. But, above all, I am surprised by the strength of my will to sit in the whole movie without leaving. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of ****
