<br /> <br /> I still can not believe that Louis Gossett Jr. agreed to appear in this movie. Everything about this movement feels artificial, forced and artificial. The air sequences are flat. The enemy characters look like puppets. This is just a poor excuse for a movie. At least Top Gun had air sequences that looked good (external shots anyway). However, Queen's songs are great. Rent Midway instead.
