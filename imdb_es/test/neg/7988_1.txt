This vicious little movie is horrible. My low rating comes for two main reasons. The first is that it is an animal film and it seems to me that the whole concept is so vile that it stirs my stomach. Filmed more than a hundred years ago, I can only hope that we have evolved into something a little more human and compassionate. This film is a complete and total exploitation, made to take advantage of the sensational aspects of the film and the theme. Leaving historical interest aside, this is something that should be observed only if one is in a situation of morbid fascination. <br /> <br /> Reason number two? Look at how the camera is set up. It is placed in the best possible place to capture the full effect: long march forward of the elephant, perfect view of the electrocution platform and a cold and clinically dispassionate view of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before it finally collapses. Disease. <br /> <br /> Thomas Edison did many good things for civilization and his talents and intelligence are not in doubt. No one is perfect, but when you realize that this film gave you A) the opportunity to beat the first film competitors with a sensationalist elephant film electrocuted and B) filmed the performance to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of DC instead of AC, you can not help but wonder if the scientist in him was too frivolous and too dispassionate. Any number of mad scientists of Peter Cushing would be proud. The rest of us should be ashamed and rebellious.
