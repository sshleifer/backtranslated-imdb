I love exotic science fiction / fantasy movies, but this one was very unpleasant to watch. Suggestions and images of child maltreatment, mutilated bodies (alive or dead), other frightening scenes, plots, boring performances made this a regrettable experience. Limit the episode was better exploring this idea). I gave it 4/10 since some special effects were nice.
