Why was this movie made? They have stained the original Caddyshack with this shit. I could only see half and I did not laugh once. At least I did not pay to see her because I was on TV. but I will not return to that hour of my life that I spent seeing this terrible disaster. There was not an original star of the first, except Chevy Chase, and he probably regrets having made this movie. It was assumed that Jackie Mason was the outrageous, the fun jester as Rodney Dangerfield was in the first, but Jackie Mason was not funny at all. Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield. If you want to laugh, look at the first Caddyshack. If you like terrible movies, then this is the movie. This movie sucks like a corral in July. Avoid it at all costs.
