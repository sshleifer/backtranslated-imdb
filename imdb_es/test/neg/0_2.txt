Once again, Mr. Costner has extended a film for much longer than necessary. Apart from the terrible rescue sequences at sea, of which there are very few, I simply did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character is made from the beginning, and then forgotten until much later, at which point I did not care. The character that really should worry us is an Ashton Kutcher very arrogant and confident. The problem is that he comes out as a child who thinks he is better than anyone around him and shows no signs of a messy closet. His only obstacle seems to be to beat Costner. Finally, when we are beyond the midpoint of this stinker, Costner tells us all about the ghosts of Kutcher. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best without any previous indications. There was no magic here, it was all I could do to avoid turning it off an hour later.
