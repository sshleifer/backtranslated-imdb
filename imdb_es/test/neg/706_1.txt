"Atoll K" also known as "Utopia" is one of the saddest songs of the swans in Hollywood. Filmed in France, "The Land That Loves Lewis (Jerry)" in 1950 and released the following year after a five-year layoff, the boys are in a really terrible physical form. However, they are not in such bad shape as the script. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the funniest "comedies" ever filmed. <br /> <br /> It's painful to see this legendary team, the funniest duo in the history of the movies, the couple who made "The Devil's Brother" (1933), "The Music Box" (1932), " Pack Up Your Troubles "(also 1932)," Babes In Toyland "(1934)," Bonnie Scotland "(1935)," Flying Deuces "(1939) and many more heartbreaking classic comedies, in a movie like this one. <Br /> <br /> But fighters and ball players do it all the time. They stay in the game for a season or a fight too. In this case, while it is morbidly fascinating to see Laurel & Hardy in this late stage of their legendary careers, they also stayed with one too much.
