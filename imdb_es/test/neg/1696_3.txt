Pat O'Brien plays Knute Rockne, the football coach of Notre Dame. Undoubtedly, this movie will be much more appealing to those interested in some aspect of Knute Rockne All-American's "Notre Dame Football": probably more interesting for serious soccer and / or Notre Dame fans. You will see some good images of documentary style movies. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is difficult to recommend this as a MOVIE. It is not much more than a historical document. "You will know" that the end is near when Gale Page feels a chill and, do not blink or miss Ronald Reagan doing all things, "Camille"! <br /> <br /> *** Knute Rockne - All-American (1940) Lloyd Bacon ~ Pat O'Brien, Gale Page, Ronald Reagan
