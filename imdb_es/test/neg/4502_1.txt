Having been a Godzilla fan for many years, Gamera was for me a cheap imitation to capitalize on the success of the No. 1 star of Toho's kaiju. ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS was for me at that moment (1975) an almost painful visual experience. <br /> <br /> Last weekend, I attended the annual Godzilla festival, known as G-FEST, where Carl Craig, one of the stars of GAMERA vs. VIRAS, they made their appearance. Of course, they presented this movie. It was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made. Of course, you have to be in the right frame of mind to see it. In one scene, for example, boy scouts held prisoner aboard the alien spaceship manage to escape by distracting the not-too-bright aliens. When they realize they have been deceived, one of them says: "That's funny ... I think those kids lied to us." Not even PLAN NINE OF OUTER SPACE can boast that kind of dialogue. <br /> <br /> This may not be GODZILLA or even GAMERA 3, but this is a decent enough waste of time, if you see it in the right mood. <br /> <br /> However, if you want high-quality entertainment at the kaiju, take a look at the recently published GAMERA 3. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 1/2 of *** **
