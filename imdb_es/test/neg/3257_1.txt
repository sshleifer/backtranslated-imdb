I have vague memories that this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> When I saw her again, I changed or I was thinking of another movie completely. <br /> <br /> It seems that we are supposed to sympathize with the character of Jackie Mason, however, nothing in the film generates that emotion. It is remarkable that he is really the only person who receives a tender dialogue with his loved ones. No one else's character is allowed to achieve the status of even vaguely human. <br /> <br /> I do not even like golf, but as the film progressed I found myself really supporting Robart Stack and the guys at the club, really hoping that they repel Mason and Chevy Chase.
