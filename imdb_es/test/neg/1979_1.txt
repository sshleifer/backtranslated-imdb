Final Fantasy: Advent Children is and will remain a classic example of substance style that went wrong. Instead of drawing on memorable characters and the captivating mythology of the original game, Square Enix has produced a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes. Yes, I said "incomprehensible". Did you know that Tifa knows incredibly fast Kung Fu techniques that magically make the angle of the camera change every second? Can that Cloud be suspended effortlessly in the air for a full minute as it moves away with its 2-ton sword? The dubbing in English is mediocre. While it is not very bad, it is far from being well produced. The quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub. <br /> <br /> This is what I would like to say to FFVII fans who can not stop crying for this movie: Advent Children is the best fan service you could have expected from Square Enix, but even one CG movie wrongly made as Galerians: Rion had a better story. You will feel embarrassed by this movie and its lack of thought in due time. The days of its novelty are numbered. <br /> <br /> Movies like Advent Children make me question whether Square Enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. After all (and without offending), it is a Japanese company. Japanese developers can offer fun games, but most of their offers are disappointingly superficial. However, they are psychopaths, when it comes to production quality. Advent Children presents some of the most impressive renders in CG history, but that does not save it from its complicated plot and cardboard characters. <br /> <br /> Any fan who has followed this movie knows that Sephiroth returns. Doubling the story to accommodate his resurrection was a big mistake. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The only point I give to this "movie" is in honor of the 10,000 enslaved Japanese animators who gave their lives to perform every bleached blond hair. in the head of the Caucasian effeminate Cloud.
