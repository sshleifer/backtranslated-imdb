Schieder delivers a semi-credible part as President of the United States with the politically correct Maria Conchita Alonzo as Vice President. The movie just sucks. With so many holes in the plot, it is a wonder that they have stuck it to the film in which it was filmed. Relegated to the hours of the night of HBO, it is not worth watching this movie. 10 minutes later, you wonder why it was written. 40 minutes later, you're wondering why you're seeing it. Save yourself the effort and see a repeat of Hee Haw or something like that. Anything is better than this pileup.
