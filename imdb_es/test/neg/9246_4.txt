Too fractured to be nice, too loose to be interesting and awkwardly photographed to be tolerable. MR LONELY is an interesting idea ruined by a bad movie. Like a Ken Russell movie at its worst, or DAY OF THE LOCUST remade by fans, MR LONELY might have seemed like a good idea on a few pieces of paper (no script, see) and a free vacation somewhere , but in the end, we have a wide-screen movie that looks like it was made by film students whose parents told them that EVERYTHING they did was a brilliant creation. Or did I get the filmmaker well? MR LONELY is a waste of resources, trying to be (gawd!) Quirky and deliberately out of place. It ends up being annoying and indulgent ... and pointless. What is the point of going to a commune in Scotland? What a stupid idea in this movie about the illusion of Hollywood. Maybe Korine wanted to redo GODSPELL ... well, the result is GOD-AWFUL. Oh, and there is a secondary plot like the images of FITZCARRALDO, including Werner Herzog, nuns and an airplane. Add music to drift and violin at full speed, melancholy and melancholy, add to James Fox, who seems to hope he can be seen as daring (as in PERFORMANCE) and the result is a fantasy alphabet soup of amphetamine in panoramic screen. It could have been fun to shoot, but the result on the screen is a disaster. Imagine the US FOOT BAND CAMP with food poisoning.
