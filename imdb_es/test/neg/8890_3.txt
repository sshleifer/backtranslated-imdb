"The Quickie" talks about a decadent Russian mafia family that lives in Malibu and ... well, frankly, this horrible drama attempt is not worthy of comment. <br /> <br /> Jason Leigh introduces Mr. Mob-guy as "Pacific Exterminators" with huge letters on his back saying "West Coast Exterminators". Finally, the mafia types suspect because she was exterminating in a bedroom. (Duh). <br /> <br /> In another scene, Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette and gives a prostitute $ 4,000 to bet if he will live or die. You have 5 chances of 6 to keep the money if you bet "live". Well, she bets "die". (double duh) Later, she complains that he was not fair and wants to play again. (Triple duh). <br /> <br /> The list of defects goes on and on, while this insulting film of intelligence sucks and sinks into a quagmire of bad music, mediocre camera work, bad direction, boring story, etc. Pass on this loser (D) <br /> <br /> Note: the barebones DVD that I rented did not have subtitles in the same language in English or subtitles.
