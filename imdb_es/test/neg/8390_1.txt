Unless you want to get bored to death. I have never been a fan of Gus Van Sant and, as part of what previous posters described as the new generation of youth, I felt very disappointed and slightly angered by the stereotyped description of the characters in the film, especially because they were used to accompanying them. The ridiculous story of the film, which applies to the masses of spectators that the skaters are social rejections and should be blamed for the crimes. As a skateboarder I myself see many skate movies and filming during the skate scenes, which is obviously an important part of the plot, since the main character is a skater, it was horrible and Bourne's shaky camera technique was used with slow motion. To give a horrible effect. This film is full of ridiculous stereotypes, as shown by the soundtrack 'emo', which adds to the media myth that all skaters are white rockers. Just a really bad movie.
