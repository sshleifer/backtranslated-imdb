It's funny ... one day before watching this movie, I had been watching a documentary about Leni Riefenstahl, so the comparison came automatically ... of course there is not any :) <br /> <br /> This movie is weak in all aspects ... the performance is not convincing (especially the one that plays Simona ...) and it's not natural ..., editing in confusing mode and always leaves a flavor of unfinished shot, the music does not fit, the story does not flow, it gets boring and the movie comes out much longer as it is ... ah, and the characters do not show up very well, you can not really say much about the girls (except what you see). .. The film also tries to impact with an explicit curse (which is very ridiculous :) <br /> <br /> Then ... 2/10
