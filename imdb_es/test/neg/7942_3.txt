The opening scene prevents me from classifying in absolute zero. I wish the whole movie was as gritty and real as the introduction. <br /> <br /> To enjoy some movies, you can forgive many things (hand guns with 60 shots, heroes with super human powers, all women are beautiful and half naked) but Puuuuleeese this "Assault On My Intelligence 13 "It's so preposterous that I'm surprised that the cast showed up for a second day of filming. <br /> <br /> First of all, how these guys get to be cops Based on stupidity, I suppose. How do the female main characters justify being half naked in the middle of winter in Detroit or wherever they are? In fact, no character reacts to the elements of this movie. No windows, no electricity (which by miracle returns without explanation) during the storm of the century and all are comfortable as insects on a carpet. What technology exists that deactivates all cell phones, radios and brain functions. This must be the same power that makes Maria Bella walk from her disabled car to her knees in the snow, without a coat and barely dressed.
