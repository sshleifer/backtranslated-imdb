I wanted to like this: the situation was rich and the environment unusual and interesting. But history is awash in gothic romantic childish elements that are hard to swallow. The director has an unfair prejudice against the "goy" characters, who are content to let them be grotesque cardboard caricatures, and inexplicably indulgent with the behavior of the heroine in the home. The potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really about. <br /> <br /> Feminist filmmakers will gain more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to express all sympathy to the heroine, and begin to deal honestly with problems. This movie is more like 'The 7 Pieces of Gold', another serious failure, more than 'The Piano', a true story of passion.
