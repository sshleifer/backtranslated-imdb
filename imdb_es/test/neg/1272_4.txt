And again, I am in the minority. <br /> <br /> I did not like this one. This is the ONLY work of Varney that I have not accepted, including Knowhutimean. Slam Dunk Ernest qualifies the credit for being the worst of the line, but this is a clear competitor for that dubious title. <br /> <br /> This work is too rough and too basic to be worthy of being loved. Kindness was one of the key components of Ernest, and this element was completely lost here. Unfortunately, most think that this is the best of the line, but if you loved the essence of what Ernest did, Ernest, you will realize what I mean in about fifteen minutes of this work. It was too shamelessly to be fun. <br /> <br /> It has a rating of 3.5 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
