I can not believe that this movie is getting the rating that it is here in IMDb. Of course, I have come to the conclusion that IMDb is a bit useless to discover if a movie is good or not, since 99% of the movies have a rating of 6 to 7. It is the conclusion and the failure of the crowd of providers on the Internet. For this purpose, an average of most people is taken, and unfortunately, most people have a simple mindset and are easily entertained with fast-food lifestyle idiots. But I digress. The movie. I really do not want to waste my time writing about that. Let's say I discovered that it's made-to-measure for apparently two groups of people, young teenagers, at a time when violent action movies of any kind are just coming to the scene, and Gothic types who love to stifle any Gothic vampire fantasies they can put Your hands on If you're not in one of those categories, you'll find this absurd movie. I enjoyed the first underworld. It was fresh at that time and had a kind of avant-garde quality. The second one was a bit difficult in the plot, but sometimes I liked the direction and the cinematography. But this whole movie seemed like a production of a science fiction channel or even a television series. I found the actors about directed. His body language became rigid in idealistic, unnatural postures that seemed to be devised. The lines spit out as the young actors would spit Shakespeare's lines, reveling in their own selfish glory for being in that role, but in doing so, they blatantly reproached the role. The plot was dry and predictable from the beginning. I found myself wanting things to simply "move on," since it was so easy to know what was going to happen. I tried to worry at first, but my brain was forced to shut down. At the end of the climax, I actually surprised myself by falling asleep. There were so many parts that were inconsistent and it made no sense that it was not even worth listing them all. If you're a teenager with pimples or a chronic gothic, of course, keep that in mind. For the rest of us, forget it, like I'm going to do right now.
