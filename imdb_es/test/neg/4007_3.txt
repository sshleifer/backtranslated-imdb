In the end. Here is a film that does as much for the reputations of the men of Greece and Russia as "Gigli" for those of Mr. Affleck and Mrs. Lo. FROM THE EDGE OF THE CITY details the sad and sordid lives of some young Russian emigres who live in Athens and its surroundings and spend their time stealing cars, harassing pilgrims and prostituting themselves ("But we are not homosexual because we do not). do, you know ... And if we do, it's only once or twice, with the same guy. ") There's almost nothing here that you have not seen before and better; only the local of Athens adds a small novelty, even then there are only one or two scenes that are scenic. The writer / director Constantine Giannaris ("3 Steps to Heaven") offers 95 relatively generic minutes, in which the highlights involve how stupid, sexist and (by the look of things) are quite irredeemable for most of these guys. (Interestingly, the happier the boy is, the more redeeming he appears.) What really irritates is the treatment of women. Greek and Russian men seem to give the Italians a run for their money with respect to that famous madonna / whore complex. Has life in Greece been much improved for women since the time of Plato and Socrates? One has to wonder. <br /> <br /> If I seem to be comparing the Russians with the Greeks in this review, I apologize, but even those who do not appear in the image (the taxi driver, for example) are chilling. According to another review on this site, the film (a hit in its territory) was actually sent by Greece for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. What this says about the state of Greek cinematography, I hesitate to reflect.
