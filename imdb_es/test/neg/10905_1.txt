I do not write comments here often, but I can not stand by and let other people suffer through this movie without even trying to warn them. This movie is horrible and it's not because "I do not know what the director was trying to convey" or "I'm too stupid to understand the plot"; This movie is horrible because of bad direction, screen writing and acting. This is the "trifecta" of the bad play and the reason why the movie went straight to the video. Try to be something like "High Tension", "Hostel" and "TCSM" with the lifting of some of those ideas, but it just does not work. I did not have many expectations, not even the medians, for the film, but I was still very disappointed. I had the potential to be very good with a nice stage and a good idea for a movie, but it was wasted.
