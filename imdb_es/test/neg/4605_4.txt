Perry Mason: The Crystal Coffin Case finds Raymond Burr defending David Copperfield / Rick Blaine as magician Peter Scolari from a murder charge involving one of his assistants. A trick involving a glass coffin suspended in the air goes badly and the body of Nancy Grahn falls down. <br /> <br /> Nancy was one of the six assistants who work on the spot and we learn two things about her. First, in a moment of drunken weakness, Scolari was seduced by her and said that she was impregnated. Second, she lives under a false name and had a secret from her past. <br /> <br /> Billy Moses, who probably never thought he would be doing such tough things in law school, gets tangled up with a couple of good ones. Old boys when they go looking for the truth in Grahn's hometown. A little more action than usual for Ken Malansky, he almost kills himself. <br /> <br /> A big flaw in this mystery is the simple forensic analysis. The coroner's report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was murdered in such a way that Scolari could not have done so. The police should have been looking in a different direction for the killer. <br /> <br /> When you see who the killer is, you will not blame the individual, but you will also see how the investigating officer James McEachin was wrong from the beginning. This particular Mason movie is spoiled.
