This movie is visible, but nothing special. Four girls on a road trip to Las Vegas foolishly decide to pick up a hitchhiker (because it's cute). All end up spending the night in a motel in the middle of nowhere, and the psychotic problems of the hitchhiker with the women become evident. <br /> <br /> The characters are cliches: there is a married and responsible woman; a horny party girl a future insecure girlfriend; and a hatred of men that has just been abandoned. The hitchhiker is really nice until he goes crazy. <br /> <br /> There is not enough blood, and too much rape. I enjoy the terror / thriller slasher a lot, and he did not do anything for me. The ending was as bad as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the actors did a great job with which they had to work. The dialogue is not horrible, and in general I was impressed by the cast, as I had never seen or heard of any of them. And the plot was not out of reach (although I really doubt that any woman in this day and age would go looking for a hitchhiker, no matter how attractive), I was not moaning that things did not. makes sense. <br /> <br /> In general, "The Hitchhiker" was good and it made sense, but it was not very interesting. There are many better movies in the same genre that I would recommend about this one ("Rest Stop", "The Devil's Rejects", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", even the remake of "The Hitcher"). Do yourself a favor and skip unless you have no other option.
