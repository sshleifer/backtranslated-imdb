At first I thought that 'Nasaan Ka Man' could be one of those new progressive Filipino films. As someone pointed out earlier, the movie does not seem to be wrong. it is clear that the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot, better angles, better sound equipment, attractive actors and better locations. <br /> <br /> However, the improvements are purely superficial. if it were not for all the polished and expensive filters, 'nasaan ka man' would feel like a typical second-rate local movie: hyperactive drama, predictable twists of the plot, "yes, of course!" Moments, tears, screams and characters that could not interest you, all pushed by your throat. <br /> <br /> A couple of things bothered me about this movie. First, since when is it okay to have sex with an adoptive family? that argument not related to blood does not make an ounce of difference. Secondly, would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped, simply because the father told her to keep it a secret? and, where the hell were the lights in this movie? I know the director tried to make things look super dramatic, but I just had to turn up the brightness function on my TV.
