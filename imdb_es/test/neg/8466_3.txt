- Contains 1 spoiler, market with: ***** - <br /> <br /> By not showing up as another remake of "The Interview", Five Fingers really is. Unfortunately, in addition to the difficulties of physical torture, he never adds anything to the achievements of his predecessor in terms of suspense, plot or actions. In fact, Five Fingers never get close to their level. <br /> <br /> What I found particularly painful to see was not the torture itself, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) acted in his ordeal. For me, it seemed that Philippe was trying too hard to make his accent right and made his performance incredibly amateur, which in turn even delayed the performance of a great Colm Meaney. By the way, the accent of Phillipe, being far from being something close to the Dutch, was more like Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> In addition to Philippi's performance (which to my surprise went from being poor to really decent toward the end) there is the subject of flashbacks with the trite Dutch landscape. (If these scenes were developed in Switzerland, they would have made the cast eat cheese on the mountaintops with endless pastures with grazing cows that use expensive watches). Leaving aside the landscape, the way these flashbacks pushed the plot did not work for me at all. He had it served as potato chips on a drive-in and caused a buildup of suspense on a flat line. <br /> <br /> It's true that the movie became more enjoyable as Phillipe's performance improved, but I could not help but be. Annoyed from time to time with scenes that were too far-fetched. Eg: <br /> <br /> ************ Start spoiler <br /> <br /> At some point (after days) Philippe washes himself almost tenderly for the woman terrorist. This should only be followed by the gross separation of another finger. Why wash the boy if he is tortured? And the cut of that last finger seemed like it was only for the title of this movie anyway, I mean, I was practically begging for it to be taken away. It did not make sense? <br /> <br /> ************ End spoiler <br /> <br /> What finally kept me watching was the performance of Fishburn, who once again proved to be an actor brilliant but he also had the best part of the script to work with. <br /> <br /> In general, it is much better to see "The interview" with that other Matrix icon: Hugo Tejedur√≠a. And when I do, I'm sure this review will not be so unpleasant. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> "The interview", 1998 www.imdb.com/ title / tt0120714 /
