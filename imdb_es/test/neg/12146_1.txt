This is a joke, right? This can not be a real movie? Is not it even a real video? Give any child at Harvey Milk High School a video camera so they can make a better movie than this one. The filmmaker can not be serious ... right? Is this satire? Comedy? Did the drama go terribly wrong? The script is as simple and boring as possible. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could have a better script. The dialogue is not cliché. Cliché dialogues can elevate this holiday mess to something akin to camping fun, but it does not and is not. The worst of the worst: a patron enters a dramatic scene in a private apartment with a bathrobe that takes a frying pan as something out of an episode of "Just Married." Qaaa ??? I have seen a better performance of the high school theater clubs. One of the cables is an attractive lunk, the other is not. Both can not even achieve a convincing kiss. So much for romance. The support players are amazingly exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Everything is underlined by a nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to have been recorded in a bathroom in the back room. Most of the dialogue is (thankfully) unintelligible. <br /> <br /> This cinematic fruit cake is not even worthy of being the next ROCKY HORROR or a gay vacation delivery of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000. It's just plain bad. In every sense. VISIONS OF SUGARPLUMS will not dance in your head, it will trample all your expectations. Have an eggnog and stare at your neighbor's Christmas lights: it will be a better time spent.
