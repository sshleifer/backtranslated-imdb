What can I say about a movie as bad as this one? The people who made this movie, did not even try to make the monster in it look realistic. You never see more than his head, and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement, except when he opens his mouth to roar. And the sound they used for the roar is the best part. At many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a TIE fighter flying overhead! I could not believe that when I heard it for the first time and had to rewind several times to sink. Apart from the terrible looking monster and the noises it produces, there is not much else in this movie except for some cheesy attacks. Scenes and the crazy Scottish attacking children trying to have an intimate moment in their castle. Still, you can see if you like this kind of garbage. I know what I do....
