This filmmaker wanted to make a film without having a story to tell, and he did so. A really terrible pile of improbable / inexplicable coincidences and an unidentifiable plot, all without character or clear motivation. <br /> <br /> We received clich√© snapshots instead of characters. One in particular is the tiny and beautiful crime boss, who projects an exaggerated "tough guy" personality and projects a caricature of intimidation about the real tough guys who have been brought in to work for her. There is nothing surprising in sight in the film, except a shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase (like the smallest of a full set of American Tourists) in a bright blue sky, unexplained No apology. Otherwise, it is visually standard: another exception is a compelling photo of a beautiful bridge in CT.
