Okay, Number One: This "movie" is a "90" version of a 70s show that nobody remembers. Number two: as soon as the movie started, I was confused, it was as if I had walked in the middle of the movie! There was no plot! It was very annoying! Horrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but it does not seem credible to me that the small and thin Omar Epps can chase a great adult man, without a weapon, and scare him to talk! It is a ridiculous "plot". I'm sorry, but for me, children these days can not even put their pants on one leg at a time, let alone catch some "evil, underground, murderers." I left the theater and demanded and they gave me back my money! I do not recommend this movie to anyone older than 12 years!
