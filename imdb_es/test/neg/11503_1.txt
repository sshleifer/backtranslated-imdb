I think it was like Lizzie McGuire, except it was much worse than the original. The only thing that is different is that she likes animals, science and all those geek things. Everything else is the same. She likes a guy who is too nervous to go out. and then he finds a boy who likes him and has no idea. I think people need to stop doing the same kind of shows. And another thing that is the same is that it is always thawing, friends are two girls and a boy. People do not think that these things become old and tired and that these ideas are still used again and again and, nevertheless, they continue to use these ideas. But I do know people who see this program and I know they like it.
