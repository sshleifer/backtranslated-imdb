Yes, silly is the word for this actress. I know that many have mentioned her beauty, but this viewer found her with an empty head and bored of looking with her bleached hair, lip gloss and a body not so perfect. Watch her get away in those jeans, showing a pretty big butt. His butt extends beyond his shoulders. What does that tell you? As for the protagonist, played by the magnificent Mark Humphrey, he was the perfect cast. A charming However, he and Lancaster simply did not agree. She was out of place in front of this handsome boy. Good performance of Susan Glover as the sister. Angela Galuppo had a small role and it was fine. But the director of the film, Philippe Gagnon, wasted too many images in Lancaster. After a while you got tired of looking at her and seeing her boring acting ability. And what a whore of a wife she was. Looking at her husband, being hateful to him and just a simple brat brat. I was happy to see her hit with the dart gun. I thought it could be the end of it. But, unfortunately, the script tells us otherwise. After torturing myself and seeing this loser again, I still came up with the same criticisms. Lancaster is boring to see. This time around your hair, friends. His hair constantly on his face, constantly throwing him back, became annoying. I question the writer, the reason Alexandra Komisaruk, for which a rich and handsome man like Philippe would even bother with people as stupid as Allison. When there were so many attractive intelligent women, with class, to choose. He chooses this nothing. Is this the Rochester / Jane Eyre thing? Oh, well, it's all a matter of taste, I suppose. This Sarah Lancaster is not my cup of tea, friends.
