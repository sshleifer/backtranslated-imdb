This piece of stun gut is all over the place. The script is bad, the plot is bad, the acting is bad. There are a couple of decent actors (Charles Durning, for example), but the director did not get anything out of them. The plot line has Santa, feeling dejected and thinking that nobody needs it anymore, taking a girl across the country to try to get her father back with his mother. Includes a scammer in a Santa suit with a parrot stuffed on his shoulder (played by "Isaac" from The Love Boat), the world's greatest elf (played by Bruce Vilnach, a very funny man, but no actor), a hardened factory owner who works extra hours on his employees on Christmas Eve, and a sled race in which someone cuts one of Santa's skis to try to win. If the plot sounds bad, it is worse on the small screen. If you see the next movie coming, run, do not walk to your TV and unplug it. You may want to boil your TV to eliminate any remaining infection. If you accidentally see more than 10 minutes of this, you may have to record your television and the cable company install completely new lines.
