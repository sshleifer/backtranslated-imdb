AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHEN IS INHERITANCE STOPPED? That's what I said somewhere between the beginning and that other part of the movie that really sucked. This movie almost sold me out all my life and I've sat in some really bad movies. Coming from a true Puppet Master fan, I would expect to hear myself say this, but it's true. The plot is inane, the special effects are horrible, the soundtrack is the most horrible and infernal sound I've heard. Oh! I almost forgot the performance, it was so bad that I forgot I was there, said Nuff. The only redeeming factor in the movie is that the puppets themselves are truly the stars and could outperform everyone, except Guy Rolfe himself (he is the puppet) and, although you can see his wires and strings, they carry me along of the painful beginning. End of the Retro-Puppet Master. To finish, PM7 is recommended for real fans who are masochists. <br /> <br /> Roach <br /> <br />
