Usually, I like these films of silly mental activity / not, but this was too stupid. There were too many clich√©s and the plot did not make much sense. There were many loose ends and the end was extremely poor and abrupt. We can not even see if the great master plan worked. We could only see the main character sobbing for his dead, the teacher (who died of stupidity (see below)). <br /> <br /> A scene bothered me in particular. Why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he manually cleared the dam? And if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes of oxygen, why did not they bring two or three? Then would he have survived? That was stupid. The movie is pretty full of such stupid things. I can not recommend it at all.
