Bad plot, bad performance, bad direction. <br /> <br /> He had possibilities, but he did not achieve anything. <br /> <br /> This movie seems like someone started with an idea, he searched Google a bit. Information and then I tried to do an hour and a half with many night shots and suspenseful music. <br /> <br /> Others had to stop looking because they were afraid of 2/3 of the way, I had to take a break simply because I did not care anymore. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of an episode of Days of our lives with a little more suspense. <br /> <br /> Simply bad.
