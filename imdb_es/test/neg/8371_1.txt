While I was watching it, I was preparing to compose a critique of this "film", which is a fierce and lasting critique, but actually I saw someone already did it. I quite agree with him. But again, it seems like a lot of effort and millions of lire went into it, so I guess you should give them some credit for trying. However, having said that, anyone who does not know the Lovecraftian world and that this is what they tried to convey will probably think ... well, I suppose, that not only is it really bad, but it is absolutely wrong. without sense. Thank God, I read part of the other review (did I have a little noise, perhaps?) That revealed that this guy also did "The Shunned House" (which looked pretty bad, judging by the DVD case), as well that I can now avoid and keep my mind from any subsequent exposure to such desecration of the brilliance of HP Lovecraft.
