This is a great premise for a movie. The general plot is very original, interesting and something to think about. However, the poor production, an obviously small budget, the performance of the main character, and several secondary actors that detract from this would be classic. A promising producer should try to resurrect this story and give this attempt, basically half-understood, an appropriate release.
