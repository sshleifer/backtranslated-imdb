Bela lugosi as god? The transvestites discussed in a movie in the 1950s? Of course, this must be an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing this movie, I felt a combination of guilt, pleasure and nausea at the same time. The story is about Glen (the same Ed Wood) and his selfish alter ego, Glenda. Somehow, if this movie were made now, I could see Kevin Kline playing Glen / Glenda. Notice how all the alter egos of transvestites are versions of their masculine name (Glen / Glenda, Robert / Roberta, etc.). Try to represent it with sympathy as the mental disorder that is, rather than as a graphic perversion. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Wood manages to sneak into the bondage and S & M sequences in his initial Glen / Glenda story. Along with these spicy scenes, Satan himself appears, obviously having a bad day. Dialogue and rhythm are non-existent, but the film is pleasant in its context: the strange world of Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Sterno says to wear your favorite lace panties for this one.
