In a future in which a travel industry uses time-travel technology to send wealthy clients into the past to explore the age of dinosaurs, the future inexplicably changes when one of its customers breaks the fundamental rule to avoid deviate from the path. In an attempt to repair the damage caused, an expert in time (Edward Burns) is associated with the inventor of technology (Catherine McCormack). <br /> <br /> The premise is pretty good and attractive. It may have some flaws, but it could still be an interesting movie. Unfortunately, A Sound of Thunder fails to engage the audience. He has several problems and takes himself too seriously, so it's hard to have fun while watching the movie. Personally, I thought the script was the biggest problem in the movie. There were more gaps in the plot than expected and the movie was a bit lazy in explaining things. I expected a deeper vision of the "butterfly effect", but the movie was more fun than anything else. That's fine with me, since 90 minutes of mindless fun is still a good way to spend the night. However, all the fun that this movie offered was involuntary and unconvincing. There were some scenes that entertained me, but I was pretty bored. <br /> <br /> The performance is not much better, since most of them seem more interested in a paycheck than in anything else. The only person who performed well was Ben Kingsley. He kept the first half of the movie nice and it seemed that he was also having a lot of fun. Edwards Burns was quite pale and soft. I do not think he has what it takes to be an important man. However, he could do for a decent supporting actor. Catherine McCormack was really annoying and not very credible. I have not really seen her in anything else, but she could have potential. The rest of the actors also give bad results, although most of them are relatively unknown, so they should not affect their careers too much. <br /> <br /> When looking at the forums, most people complain about special effects. There is no way to sweeten them and they are terrible. All dinosaurs look very bad. The Gibbon lizards (part monkey, part dino), although they are a creative idea, become obsolete after a while and are more likely to encourage laughter instead of fear. The work on the green screen looks horrible and unprofessional. I was really wondering what director Peter Hyams was trying to achieve here. He fails to deliver suspense, action and emotion, and makes this film a long session. However, for the most part, the film is quite harmless and is far from being the worst film of 2005. Hopefully they will remake this film in the future. There is potential in this project, but for now this is the best we have. In the end, unless curiosity overtakes you, there's no reason to see A Sound of Thunder. Rating 4/10
