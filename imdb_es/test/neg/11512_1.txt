For those of us who are part of the real world of ballet, this movie is completely ridiculous. Ivan Kirov was basically a gymnast, not a ballet dancer. Viola Essen at that time was at the Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, and a pretty good dancer, but except for Dame Judith Anderson, the acting is amateur and Checkov is completely exaggerated ... shamefully! I saw this movie at age 14 and at that time, never having seen a ballet, I was very impressed. However, later in life, long after I completed my own career as a dancer, I bought the video tape of it, curious to know what it was like after so many years. I could not believe how naive Hollywood could be about the world of ballet. But it was made in the mid-40s, before The Red Shoes or The Turning Point, and the latter offers a real image of the world of ballet. All the cast of Specter has already passed away ... Ivan Kirov (not his real name) died at the age of 79 years. It was his only and only film, which was later preserved by a businessman from Chicago ... and the rumor continues.
