This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. There is a lot of nonsense about the Internet (that is, if you install a program on the computer, you see dead people, as if playing a videotape, you will die in RINGU). Frankly, most of this seemed pretty silly and I lost it. What I found interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence, being totally alone for all eternity. This was sobering and fascinating. <br /> <br /> I love Japanese movies and I have seen a large number compared to most Americans. However, a genre that has become popular in recent years with which I can not relate very well are these horror movies. I know they are super popular, especially because they seem to be remade so often in the United States. I have seen both RINGU and THE RING, JU-ON and THE GRUDGE and was quite ambivalent despite its popularity. About the only recent horror movie that I really liked about Japan was SEANCE, a reworking of the great British film, SEANCE ON A WET THE AFTERNOON. And what, I think, made SEANCE different? Well, unlike the other movies, as well as KAIRO, the drinks and leftovers were not spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience; instead, the emphasis was on history. The conclusion is that these other films are very similar to American movies like HALLOWEEN or Friday the 13th, with terrifying things jumping just to scare the audience and the plot is purely secondary (at best). For me, I want a story, not emotions or cheap ghosts as the main focus of the film. <br /> <br /> With a relatively high rating, I know I'm in the minority, but I just can not find it. This is a very satisfying movie. All too often, minor things happen that can scare someone a bit, but the characters start screaming and crying and acting as if they were saying, "This is the most terrifying movie ever made, so you'd better start shaking." Well, I think he tries too hard and I wish he had focused more on the future life that is seen at the end of the film and the progression of the plot, not the fear tactics.
