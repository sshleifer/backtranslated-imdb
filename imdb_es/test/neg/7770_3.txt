To be honest, I used to like this program and see it regularly, but now (thank God!) I do not understand why I saw it. Sex and the city is one of the most useless and insulting television shows I've seen. I really do not understand the point of this show, despite trying. People say, that sex and the city is fun. Which way? Cursing all the time, talking about the vibrators and the size of the penis? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the plot: we have four girls who are trying to find a perfect man sleeping with every idiot that comes. And this show is about four spoiled chicks, who are sleeping with all the men in the city, but in the end admit that the best pleasure comes from penis vibrators. And yes ... the program tries to tell us that sex is the most important thing in all relationships. If you can have a good sex, you are a good husband (or wife). It does not matter if you want to be loyal and have a good heart ... size does matter. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is also the bad performance. The four main actresses (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis) are so bad and unconvincing, that I get sick just watching this show. Parker is just screaming and complaining all the time, Cattral is showing her old tits and saying "the word f" all the time, Davis smiles (and nothing more) and Nixon acts as if she's bored all the time. And yes ... men are hogs hungry for sex in this show. But, judging by this show, women are not much better. This show is insulting to men and women. Women are so primitive and emotionless, as if they had no heart, only hunger for sex. It is an insult to all. <br /> <br /> Sex and the city is one of the worst TV shows and I am glad that the program is over, because it offers bad performances and useless stories. The whole world has nothing to do with sex and vibrators.
