Once a month, I invite some friends to a "delayed movie night". We expect movies that are so bad that they are fun or those that know they do not have an argument and only show many chests. Last night, we had the bad luck of having Zombie Planet as one of our movies. The cinematography is on par with what we are used to, but the performance was a different story. The main role is played by an aspiring Johnny Depp / Rob Zombie who could not get a role in a high school play, not to mention a horror movie LOW-BUDGET. Our indecisive hero, who could not say whether or not he wanted to be an imbecile to this scene or a plaintive coward, was one of the reasons why this was the first movie of the 30 that I had to stop early during a Delay. Movie night. He had the possibility of greatness with a BIG turn in the standard zombie infection, but they took a completely different direction according to Johnny Zombie. I personally would not recommend this to any of my friends. However, it is unfortunate that I have already invited some of the previous night to suffer 80% of this movie with me.
