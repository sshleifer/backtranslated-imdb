Calling this a "Sunday School" movie can be generous, because, even as a Christian, I found the religious message so one-dimensional that I would not want to see it in my church. The message is: "Read your Bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance, so you do not get left behind in the rapture." There was no love. I guess when you get to that, I do not believe in the god represented in this movie. The guy who supposedly had all the spiritual answers was introduced as Count Dracula. <br /> <br /> Aside from the spiritual / religious element, the script was tedious, saying the same thing over and over again. That could have been to compensate part of the performance, which could not offer a convincing line the first time, so they just said the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the final scenes. I thought it made sense without hitting someone in the head or leaning toward a Sunday School formula. The movie was not all bad, just the majority. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of cleaner films that are well done and that present the truth in a non-predicative way. This was not one of those, I'm sorry to say. I took my family to this movie, wanting to support that kind of movie. Now I would like to recover my money.
