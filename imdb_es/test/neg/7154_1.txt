I really wanted to see this movie. I like road trip thrillers. I like sex, drugs, youth, action and a great soundtrack. And I was especially interested in making the film trip around Europe to see if I recognized any of my travel places. <br /> <br /> From the first scene, however, this movie could not be seen. What was Guy doing driving on the wrong side of the road? What could have blown the van that rolled gracefully on a shallow grassy slope? If they are such bad drivers, why accept a delivery job? And that's just the first scene! Not even bad enough to be campy or stupid. Simply horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Waste of time. Move on to something ... anything else!
