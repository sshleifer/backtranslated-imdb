Seriously, I do not understand why people say "My God, Step Up is the best movie of all!" It's a lot of garbage! The performance, in the first place, is ridiculous, and we did not even begin to talk about the dialogue because it was terrible ... The movies are supposed to be entertaining, and this, let me be the first to say it, was not entertainment. I was actually laughing because I was so embarrassed to see him. Music and dancing did nothing for me either. And what about the "heat" of Channing Tatum that all the girls talk about? Whatever is. The movie was pathetic. Do not waste your time or your money. Unless you're a fan of dance movies, but movies like that are not movies ... they're jokes.
