I saw this only because my 10 year old son was bored. He and his friend hated him, but of course he liked being in the movies. This is the first time that I totally disagree with Ebert in many years. There is not one thing to recommend this movie. Willis is fine, as always. But the story sucks, it's amazing, there's no real story, there's no action, no interesting film sequences, no surprises, and worst of all, the child star is a completely repulsive slug that guarantees the extinction of any parent who do not have a problem Slob fat for a child. By all means, stay away and save your child, unless you want to punish him. There is no excuse for such a poor address or writing and one expects these filmmakers to suffer accordingly.
