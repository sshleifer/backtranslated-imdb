I just saw this at an independent local station in the New York City area. The cast was promising, but when I saw the director, George Cosmotos, I suspected. And of course, it was as bad, as useless and stupid as all the George Cosmotos movies I saw. It's like the stupid Michael Bey, with everything the praise promises. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy makes no sense, there are no burning problems that incite the conspirators. We leave ourselves to connect the points of some graffiti on several walls of the film to the next. Therefore, the current budget crisis, the war in Iraq, Islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million Americans without medical care, stagnant wages and the death of the middle class are subsumed by the absolute terror of the graffiti /> <br /> A truly, incredibly idiotic movie.
