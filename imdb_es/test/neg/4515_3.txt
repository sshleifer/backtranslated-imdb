The only good part of this movie was the ending. You know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you go to go home. No, no, that can be a bit hard: the dance in the movie was sensational, but unfortunately that's where the plot ended. While the cast was dancing and not talking, the film was going well. As for Chayanne's debut, it's not bad, but I hope that his next film has a little more depth. As for going to see the movie wait for rent or television. Do not make the same mistake I made and pay 8.50.
