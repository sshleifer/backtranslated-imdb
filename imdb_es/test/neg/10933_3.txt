My husband wanted to see this movie because the review in the newspaper said it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, not liking Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I would have to agree. However, not for conventional reasons. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that should be seen late at night when you do not want to see something that really needs to be thought about but you do not want to go to bed yet. <br /> <br /> Yancy Butler is a really nice bad guy. She is not the best actress, in fact, she is not even good, but she is perfect for this role in this film. All others vary from pine to oak, including the slightly disturbing child who appears as a deformed Pinocchio. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: The ending is a step or two too far, complete with the clich√© not quite dead, up with a roar, it will still give you a moment and then there is a picture of Pinocchio with his smile Frozen wood that makes you wonder if they were going to get cold or they just forgot that there was botox in the makeup. <br /> br /> In any case, they are a hilarious eighty minutes and, despite being a bad movie, you would have to lack the gene of humor to not enjoy it a little. Do not pay for it, but if you are in that mood of apathetic tele, then this is the right thing to do.
