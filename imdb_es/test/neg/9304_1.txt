This is the worst movie of all time, without a doubt, and Schindler's List, actually had more laughs. This, not only, tells you how little fun this movie is and how cool it is SL, considering it is heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh. I wish I could meet "Yahoo Serious" to be able to strangle him personally, for this and all the other very, very, very bad movies he has been in. There are also very few things to say about Australia, as they like this. stupid fruit Do not get me wrong, people (Mel Gibson) from Australia are great, they brought us Mad Max. It makes me very nauseous that people like this garbage, (a review I just read said it was "very funny", disgusting, right?). I, personally, will be boycotting this movie and will initiate an online petition to ban and burn all Yahoo Serious movies for being so, and I emphasize this, so DELAYED. <br /> <br /> These are just my personal thoughts, without hesitation, they are shared by all who have seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Note: If you are forced to watch this movie, in the style of Clockwork Orange, call me to euthanize you for free.
