I saw a screening of this movie last night. I had many expectations about it, but I was definitely disappointed. Within 5 minutes of the opening, Williams is already campaigning for his presidency. And he becomes president in the first 40 minutes. So there goes all that aspect of the movie. The first half hour is hilarious. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments. But after the first half hour, it takes a turn for the worst. It becomes less a comedy, and more a story of suspense / drama / love ... that makes no sense. The movie does not get anywhere and stops for about 30 minutes. There are laughter intermingled here and there, but the always fun part is at the beginning and only at the beginning. At one point, the greatest joy I heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd shouted "boooo" during a very confusingly emotional scene. Williams gives a great performance, just on par with his comedic style. Walken also plays a strong supporting role as only he can. I think the only character that is underestimated is Lewis Black. Consistently vulgar and political, it's funny to see it dim for a PG-13 rating. In general, I would not pay to see the movie. After all, I saw it for free and I was even disappointed. The first half hour is solid, and everything is downhill from there. Not really fitting into a category, the film realizes halfway that it should not have been more than a special one-hour comedy. 4.5 / 10
