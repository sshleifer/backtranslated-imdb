There is a difference between a "movie" and a "movie." A film, regardless of its quality, is ready for public consumption. A film is what a group of friends meets to do over the course of a weekend with a camcorder. In my time as a spectator, I have seen many examples of both. <br /> <br /> On September 19, I attended a screening of "Donnybrook" by writer / director Jon Satejowski. Now that I've read the script and seen two different cuts (a first cut and the "finished" product) of this piece, I can safely say it's a movie. And a student movie, to that. It is, for lack of a better word, competent, that is, the director knew how to press record in a camera and capture moving images. The images are, for the most part, static and not impressive, and the dialogue scenes are reduced to shots mostly to long shots, with little or no close shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters. I understand that this is a modestly budgeted movie, but it would have appreciated a bit of visual style, and it would have come a long way to keep the audience interested. <br /> <br /> Of course, there have been independent photos that have shown that the limited work of the camera can be overcome with a well written, absorbing story and a sharp dialogue. Immediately the "sex, the lies and the videotape of Steven Soderbergh come to mind". This movie, however, has neither one nor the other. The main story is weak and unfocused. If the main plot is that Davie is trying to improve her relationship with her father, then I feel that this movie loses its meaning. What I got out of this is that Davie's main aspiration is "to change the face of rock 'n' roll". However, we see very little activity on your part to show this. While there is a sequence of dreams at the beginning and an impromptu interpretation of his at the end, all we look like are scenes of Davie listening to music or playing a guitar casually. They just tell us that Davie has played in many concerts, but we never see him in full rock mode. Next time, SHOW does not tell the audience. Anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows it. In addition, Davie does not look like someone who would have been great in the era of glam rock of the 70s; it seems that he would be more comfortable in the early days of rock 'n' roll, posing as the less talented brother of James Dean. Meanwhile, the rest of the events in the movies seem to happen at random to rather clich√©d characters, and the threads of the story, which have little or nothing to do with the thin main story, are mentioned and abandoned with alarming frequency ( that is, the secondary plot that implies Terry's father). If I want to see a movie with this kind of whimsical construction, I'll consider going back to see "Napolean Dynamite", a movie I could barely see the first time. <br /> <br /> Regarding the dialogue mentioned above Scenes, I suppose I should mention that they are few and extremely far away. Is it too much to ask for characters to speak? I do not think it is. When the characters speak, it is in short and choppy sentences; collections of such insightful questions, angry grunts or exaggerated outbursts. These characters simply do not behave like normal, rational people. Working with material like this, it's easy to understand why there's only one good performance in the movie, Al Hudson, and that's just because he's doing a bad impersonation of Sam Elliott for his time on the screen. A good director, or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a director of feature films, could have detected these problems and have the writer and the camera staff correct them. However, since Satejowski is so close to the material, he simply does not see them or, if he does, he is not willing to take the necessary steps to solve them because this will hurt his creative vision. Being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive way is the mark of a self-indulgent and misguided fool. Just ask Rob Schneider. <br /> <br /> In the end, we are left with a bad version of the amazing "Garden State" by Zach Braff, combined with the equally amazing "Velvet Goldmine", two films much more worthy of his time. <br /> <br /> Now, before any of the members of the cast or crew leave the word "work" to make me a task for this revision, let me offer this to you. The best I can do is to congratulate Mr. Satejowski for having the ambition to make his own film and put it there for the audience to see. However, the hopes that this film will be collected and distributed are simply deluded visions of greatness. This is a student movie, nothing more, nothing less. If the film has any promise (and let's be honest, at this point, it will not come from the performance, the writing or the direction), it's this: Yes, YES, the people associated with this movie are willing, then, learn from this movie , save it and use the lessons learned in your next attempt; Do not attack your critics, or have a friend or family do it for you. If you can do this, maybe the next one is worthy of distribution, worthy of being called "movie". <br /> <br /> I am your audience and I am willing to see you.
