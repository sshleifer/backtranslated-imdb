This movie was terrible. Biblically very inaccurate. Moses was 80 years old when he took people out of Egypt, the movie is about forty. Moses was approximately forty years old when he fled Egypt, was away for forty years and was with them wandering for forty years. Moses was 120 years old when he died, and he was denied the privilege of crossing into the promised land. I realize that movies use a lot of "poetic license", since the biblical story is not that long, but if they make a biblical film they should still reflect the known facts and maintain the general flavor of the main biblical character, this film fails in this aspect, and in many others. Although the 1956 version also has its problems, theatrically it was much better.
