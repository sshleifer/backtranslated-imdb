A boring and malevolent plot, one of the worst directions I've encountered, an insane performance and a horrible clich√©. The film ends with one of the main characters waking up from a dream. What's with that? Even JR Dallas could not survive that clumsy turn. <br /> <br /> You have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship that develops between a main character and a girl, which apparently must be paternal, but which manifests itself as perverse. You have special effects at the community college film school with gaps the size of Kimberly Hole. This is how the children of corn meet the Passion of Christ imposed in an endless loop of training video of the government administration: in the end, if you are not thinking about finishing it, you have no brain. <br /> <br /> Do not bother.
