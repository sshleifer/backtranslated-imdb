I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. It's so boring. The jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny. It's like, Alex says something that is not funny or interesting and then, suddenly, you hear a sound of laughter. My friend and I looked at each other with a blank look as if we were asking ourselves: "What is so funny? !!". Seriously, every time we watched that show, you did not hear any laughter or cough. Just a blank look. So we stopped seeing it. Personally, I'm a fan of comedies, so I tried to watch the show. But they show us such a disappointment. This show could be one of the most bad comedy comedones of all
