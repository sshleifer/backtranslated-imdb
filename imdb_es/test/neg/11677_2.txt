It would be pretty easy to make this movie sound funny: a girl called is shot in the forehead by a spy from North Korea, but survives. The bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her crave both knowledge and sex. Unbeknownst to her, she moves away from the shots with George W. Bush's cloned finger in her purse, a key that can unlock the power of using nuclear weapons. Just call it a romp, and at least some people will go to the theater. I'm not sure how many went to see this four-year movie when it was released in New York last April, but I sincerely hope there are not many. It sounds like a light and playful pinku movie, but it has artistic pretensions and is really incredibly boring. Many pinku movies in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations, but the aspirations of this film only make the time between the sex scenes unbearable. And then the sex scenes are not even good! I've seen some pretty outrageous things in dirty Japanese movies. I have never seen this country produce something with sex so boring. The spice channel is more imaginative. The only thing that is worthwhile in this movie is the body of the main actress, Emi Kuroda. Otherwise, this is pure torture.
