I'll say it again ... one of the worst movies ever made and made by the director who made one of my favorite movies, "Excalibur". I was surprised to see that I scored more than six. This movie sucks. It looked terrible. It looked like he had been shot in 18 days and Boorman must have been sleeping when he directed it. Arquette did nothing. Simply terrible, rotten, unbearable and probably the only stain in Boorman's celebrated career. <br /> <br /> 1/10 !!!!!
