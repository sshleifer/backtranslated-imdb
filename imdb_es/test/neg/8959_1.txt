I got this movie as you buy one, get a deal on troma.com with The Ruining (which is not much better). The main reason why I wanted it was to see Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods, the DVD is a double feature of that movie. I did not really know what Actium Maximus was at that moment, and when I saw the trailer I got scared. It looked horrible. But hey, what can you say about the trailer? Well, apparently I could say a lot. This movie honestly did not make any sense to me. The special effects were so terrible that you can not say what happens in the name of God. I understand that Mark HIcks had an extremely low budget, but let's go. And it's sad, because in the interview it sounded like it was an epic movie and it meant more than you could see. But, unfortunately, watching the movie is one of the most boring hours and 15 minutes of anyone's life. It is so painful to sit through. I really can not even explain the argument to you because I did not understand it at all and, unfortunately, I've seen this movie twice! Apparently they used some kind of puppets for the "alien dinosaurs" as they did in Star Wars. But these special effects are terrible, I can not emphasize them enough. And most of the time, the bad special effects are fine, but this movie needed them a lot. It takes place on a futuristic planet where the alien dinosaurs fight each other and the bad actors with hoodies run, and it seems they are in the kkk. And some box with a blue light on it is the president. I know that in the interview, Mark Hicks said something about making this a television pilot, well, I can see why this did not come to CBS or NBC. There are two good things about this movie. 1. The music is pretty good, it has an epic score that sticks in your head for days. And 2. The introduction of Lloyd Kaufman is always hilarious. In general, do not waste your time, check out Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods!
