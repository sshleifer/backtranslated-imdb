Rita Hayworth plays a dancer from a Brooklyn nightclub called Rusty who specializes in cheese choir magazines; he manages to appear on the cover of a national fashion magazine, but his impending success as a soloist (with romantic offers everywhere) has hit boss Gene Kelly. A terribly tired piece of technicolor cotton candy, with non-memorable musical sketches (the two worst are irrelevant flashbacks for the 1890s, with Hayworth playing his own grandmother). Kelly, as always, dances well but acts with false sincerity; When he's serious, it's unbearable, and the rest of the time he flies with adrenaline. The script is a major weight, it does not even give support players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden any good line. * 1/2 of ****
