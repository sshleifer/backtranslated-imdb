I was forced to see 'Changi' last year in year 10 of Australian history. Looking around the class, in both classes, the 40 students were almost asleep, the 40 heads on the table whispering to the person next to them. I refuse to believe that because I am only 16 years old, that my opinion does not count, after having studied the Second World War, I not only felt ashamed and ashamed to see this Australian television. I was crazy about the dreadful effort that this mini series applied in the use of movie elements. The performance was bad, the script was very inaccurate and the score was terrible. Please, do not watch this movie, it is partial and very racist (for the Japanese).
