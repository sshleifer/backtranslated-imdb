The unthinkable has happened. Having witnessed for the first time a few years ago, I have had a movie that has been my point of reference for horror and that movie was called "The Island of McCinsey". A film of family adventures with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I'm not making it up), he immersed himself in the creation of films and it's still the only movie I've seen that made me wonder what else the movie's budget could have been. spent on. Like new schools or drugs to treat cancer. However, for absolute and unadulterated levels of garbage, any film will have to lower its standards even more if it wants to succeed in "Guest House Paradiso" to the distinction of being one of the worst movies I've had to watch. <br /> <br /> Based around the puerile but fun television show "Bottom", this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable. Richard (Rik Mayall) is a hotel manager, as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so twistedly lascivious that he almost exudes slime from every action. His friend Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and, together, they try to run the worst hotel in Britain located on the top of a cliff next to a nuclear power plant. Among them, they indulge in violence with cartoons (with sound effects) at regular intervals, steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and look nostalgically at any woman. The plot, as it is, involves the arrival of the legendary Italian goddess of the screen Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel) who is fleeing his wedding and tries to stay at the Guest House Paradiso, to the astonishment of Richie and Eddie. And that's it. <br /> <br /> I used to think that Carry On's films represented everything bad in the UK film industry and, as far as God knows, we spent so much time and money trying to escape that god. horrible legacy. We've had movies like "Trainspotting", "28 Days Later", "Four Weddings And A Funeral" and the brilliant "Shaun Of The Dead" (also starring Simon Pegg) but this ... this drags those movies screaming and kicking back to the days of Sid James and Barbara Windsor, who was flying with the help of a bicycle whistle. "Guest House Paradiso" is so low in its ambition that it insults you the moment you see it. I kept looking, waiting in advance for the beginning of the jokes, but they never arrived. Just an endless stream of trapped nausea, unimaginative scenarios that defy explanations, mildly amusing violence with frying pans and refrigerator doors and almost nothing that raises a smile. The first advertising break came (I was on TV, you'll see) and I was ready to turn off, but my loyal duties to you, my readers, kept me going. "I'm watching this so you do not have to do it" became my mantra for you to remember how much you owe me for this because it was as fun as having sand kick in my eyes and being forced to eat dog food. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I used to love the television show "Bottom". The combination of Mayall and Edmondson's suitably dirty performance with the OTT youth mood worked ... for half an hour each week. Certainly not for an hour and a half, since Edmondson and Mayall give themselves up in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience. Honestly, this makes "Drop Dead Fred" by Mayall look like "The Godfather" and, in case you meet one of these two people (who are practically the only ones responsible for the chaos on the screen that pretends to be a movie), Feel free to have him deliver a boot to your testicular region. You would probably enjoy it. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both as hotel guests) are dragged with this sinking ship, but at least they survived. Mayall and Edmondson should not be so lucky. The equivalent of the Chernobyl film and should be avoided as such.
