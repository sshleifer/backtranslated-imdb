Did this doodoo vessel win a prize? They must have been desperate to give a prize for something. This movie reeks of little bopper things and it made me sick. Fortunately I saw him with Mike and the MST3K robots so it was bearable. Horrible acting, disturbing mother / daughter moment, stupid premise, if you want a bad movie here it is. Be careful, look with Mike and the bots or you will suffer. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10. I still can not believe I won a prize, and the director is defending this * && ^ $$ # $ ^ && piece of ^% ^% $ ^ $ #% @ $ # @ movie!
