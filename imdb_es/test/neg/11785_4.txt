I think Walter Pidgeon was very bad in this movie. Simply not believable on paper. Barbara Eden was beautiful, and she played her part well enough. Nobody else was memorable. <br /> <br /> I remember the television series that came out of this movie when I was a little boy. I even think I had an "ocean view" of plastic that was submerged and it was great to play in the bathtub. Long ago. <br /> <br /> As for some of the criticisms I have read for this film: it is certainly unfair to judge the special effects or scientific knowledge of 4 decades ago according to current standards. The effects were acceptable for 1961. Not very good, but yes. As for science, that was ridiculous even for 1961. There is no excuse. Also, the subcommittee was terribly spacious. I understand that the Navy rejected any help for this film, so perhaps the filmmakers simply had no idea. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie bored me. (And I'm a science fiction fan.) I can not recommend this. Grade: D-
