Allegedly the "real story" of Juana de Castilla, the eldest daughter of the Catholic queen Isabel (yes, the same one who financed the Columbus expedition), the film describes the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, the archduke Philip of Austria. , known as "The Handsome" (and played in a rather boring way by the Italian heartthrob Daniele Liotti, in its most buttery and fleshy place). This is a family history and inductor of the end of s. XV, early s. XVI. Intrigue, betrayal and tearing of bodice. Drips destructive lust from beginning to end. But while La Reine Margot manages to make cruel sexuality and ruthless and ruthless intrigue entertaining, Juana La Loca simply does not get going. It just ends up feeling like a big budget soap opera, with a performance below average, lazy or overly enthusiastic. Liotti looks positively bored and Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala in the main role? Although to be fair she can mature into an adequate talent? He seems to be trying too hard, shifting back and forth, going from a two-dimensional horny appearance to a spoiled teenage hysteria at all times. Some of the supporting actors are fine, except for Manuela Arcuri, another Italian pinup, voluptuous and beautiful, but in reality there is no "actress" to talk about. In fact, I could not feel worried about any character, nor did I feel strongly against any of the supposed villains. What a waste of a substantial movie budget! This, unfortunately, is so rhetorical and deja-vu, nodding to other films of the genre instead of its source material, history, as inspiration. It seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historical era deserved a far superior filmmaker to evoke it.
