The only reason I gave this episode of "Masters of Horror" a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two main actors are good, and it was not filmed on VHS. The story, the dialogue and the plot are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Talk / drive zombies who vote again and influence the political tide against the war! Give me a break! What's next, the zombies that do parachuting again? Maybe the zombies that come back to host QVC programs <br /> <br /> I never supported the war in Iraq, but I do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and "Homecoming" was disrespectful, as it mocks the TRUE horror of war. <br /> <br /> With the zombies mass produced in the current market ... this is SPAM entertainment related to zombies. How "Homecoming" came to "Masters of Horror" surpasses me.
