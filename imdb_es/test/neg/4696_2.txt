The IMDB plot summary makes it look like it's the Noah Taylor movie, when Fairuza Balk is the central character. It's amazing how such a well-established cast of actors could have been in such an amateur movie, meaningless, without a movie. Balk breaks up with Boyfriend Taylor, sleeps with the devil (I guess, played by Dempsey), and accidentally kills Taylor, who follows her for the rest of the movie as a ghost. It may be the worst movie I've seen.
