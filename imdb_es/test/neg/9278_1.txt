This has to be the most frightening abuse of the word comedy that has been seen. It's just not funny and the writers have obviously tried to use the name of the television series to make a few pounds at the box office. This film makes a continuation seem subtle in terms of sexual innuendo (not a feat), and has all the charisma of a corpse with rigamortis. A complete wash I'm afraid !!
