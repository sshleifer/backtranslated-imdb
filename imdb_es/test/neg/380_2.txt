This type is like a previous 1987 movie "Masters of the Universe" based on the cartoon "He-man". Basically, you have a great old world and, for some reason, you have to have almost all the action of the movie on modern earth. Well, I guess now it is not such a modern land and that it is an ancient world now of strangeness and a den of good old days. Well, I guess I can imagine why they put almost the whole movie in modern times in this and that movie. To save money on suits and sets. It is much easier to recreate what is happening in the present than a strange world like Eternia in He-man or an ancient world with strange cults and pyramids, sacrifices and strange creatures that embrace you to death. This movie is forgettable and not very entertaining. His first clue that it's not going to be the best movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is in it. The only thing that has in its favor are the animals that are not as frequent in this as they were in the past. Marc Singer is back and it's sad to see him in this state, the guy was a pretty good actor who just tried to make a sequel to a movie that did not really need it, and even if he did, he came five years late. .
