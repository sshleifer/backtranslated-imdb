Sorry, friends, but these enthusiastic reviews on this prestigious site about this movie "Respiro" are very strange, to say the least. It's quaint madness, I ask and I did not find an answer. Of course, the film is beautifully filmed, in part it's almost a documentary. But the fact is that when it comes to the women of Grazia, she shows all the signs of a deep illness and I wondered throughout the movie what the hell she has. Their behavior is quite worrisome and the (surprised) citizens of the village are absolutely right in wanting to send it to an appropriate institution to see what can be done about their condition. She needs treatment, urgently! A behavior like hers is a hell for everyone around her, her husband, poor children (especially) and fellow citizens. Let's not be falsely romantic about this! I hated this condoning portrait of a mental patient. WHY, for the love of God, the husband should not want her to heal or at least try to do this? Why the horror of going to Milan (a big city, of course, but with many possibilities for people capable of curing it)? Narrow-mindedness? Irresponsibility? Anyway, I was inspired by this site to rent the film on DVD and, after seeing it, I HAD to publish this so that others could form an opinion about it. Frankly, I understand why the film did not go any further as an INDICATION to the Cannes selection ...
