Here is another low quality film from the company "Disney". There is no more Disney spirit. The story is boring. All emotions are false. It is not cute or touching. The Disney company was at one time a kind of magical company that provided dreams for children. Now it's about making money. Shame on the people who exploit the Disney name for their personal benefit. It is the fall of an empire. And, by the way, Pixar is NOT Disney!
