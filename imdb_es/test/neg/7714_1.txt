When one of the stars of a movie is called Sticky Fingaz, you should know enough to stay away. Keep away. CASA 2 is more of the same, this time with zombies invading the university campus (man, how money should have been saved). As usual, the "zombies" are not given any direction, so they talk, and they are given very little makeup or clothing. They look like zombies in one of those inexpensive inexpensive Italian zombies from years ago. I mean, they do not look like the kind of zombies we know and love about the zombie movies of George Romero and Dan O'Bannon. People who fight against zombies are people who are not actors and who shoot weapons and do little else. Some of those who have written here feel that the sequel is a little more focused than the original. All I have to say is that I'm glad the director of the sequel has eliminated the 360-degree panoramic shots that helped ruin the first movie. The CASA 2 is still more of the same, which means that nothing happens for 80 or 90 minutes. There is a fixed piece, which involves soldiers fighting with a zombie soccer team, which at least could have been fun. It is not.
