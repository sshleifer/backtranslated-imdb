In recounting these events that took place some years ago (it is hard to believe that this really happened) I thought, well, here is a basis for an interesting story. Many secrets were never discovered, the horse was never found, the main conspirators were never captured, etc. <br /> <br /> However, this film seems to be distracted by the study of the character and very little attention to the plot. However, some other questions are raised, such as, why on earth would Mickey Rourke be in this movie? It is good to see that Rourkes' career has taken off again, but he should be ashamed to mention this garbage. <br /> <br /> If the topic interests you, do an Internet search on the subject, it will be easier. Educated and I dare to say more entertaining. Avoid this
