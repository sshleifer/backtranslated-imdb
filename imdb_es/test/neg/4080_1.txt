Was this supposed to be fun? This is one of those movies that just does not work. The first, Bruce Almighty with Jim Carey, had some very funny moments. This one did not have any. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrell, who was brilliant in Bruce Almighty, could not deliver here. His performance is very common and he can not take it as Carey did. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this is that I only paid $ 1.95 to rent it. It's a movie for children ... very young children who have only seen about 4 movies in their short lives. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to note that where Jim Carey stars in a movie and they make a sequel without him, that's usually a huge turkey. Does anyone remember the Son of the Mask? (IMDB Worst 100 movies of all time) Avoid these lovers of the movie.
