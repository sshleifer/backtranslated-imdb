No matter what you've heard, "Fama" is not a good movie. It is not worth investing more than two hours to see teenagers with stereotyped problems dancing, singing, learning and watching girls in the locker room. <br /> <br /> Each clich√© finds a small and cozy home in this movie. There is a gay teenager looking for acceptance. That would have been great if it had been treated as something more than a secondary plot point. There is a ghetto boy who has too much attitude ... what surprised me? And guess what? Everyone wants to become great stars, find fame and fortune, and everyone would be willing to crawl over the smoldering corpses of their own mothers to obtain it. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this movie is remembered for its music. But in reality, the only moderately good song is "Hot Lunch Jam," which is still too cheesy to be of any real quality. The two most popular songs are nothing either. The "fame" has no meaning, it is a fluff drowned by the spectacle of a massive dance scene in the streets. And "I Sing the Body Electric" (what does it mean, in the name of Bubba, which means?!?!?!?!?) It's just an incomprehensible joke. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, insipid dialogue and hacking direction (it is, after all, the director of "Evita") are only marginally helped by the appropriate camera work of Michael Seresin. But cinematography alone can not carry a movie, especially one as uninspiring and pointless as this one.
