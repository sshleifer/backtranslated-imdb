If you think it's beautiful to be obsessed with who you're in love with, then I guess I'll give you a good grade ... but I can not imagine that this topic of obsessiveness and little respect for others (like the way Paulie treats teachers they try to help her, they are anything you want to teach your children, yes, it's also bad how Victoria treated Paulie, but guess what, that's life, is not it a more important lesson to learn to overcome these disappointments and take The best of your life, or falling from the ceiling is a better lesson to teach our children? Secondly, when Mary's father did not show up for dinner, and Paulie helped her to release her anger, Mary even said that I wanted him to be dead ... Somehow, I do not think that this is a good message with which you treat Your disappointments through anger.
