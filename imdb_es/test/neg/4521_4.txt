There is the thrill of low-budget black cinema. And there is the frustration of sinuous and uninteresting movies made at a low price. This falls into the second category. <br /> <br /> The Spot is the name of a nightclub. The film is about a policeman whose father has been murdered by gang members. He goes to look for them. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the bad impression. Maybe it's me. But I felt that I had seen this a hundred times, most times better than here. <br /> <br /> He also has a promise: the police are fascinated by a woman who plays records on Juke. Then they meet. Now, although this was done long before I was born, I've seen that kind of juke box. And it's incredibly fascinating: when I was a teenager, I went into a bar that still had a device like that. I have always liked juke boxes, in bars or diners. But this one was different. You talked to him and a sensual female voice answered you! This is addressed here, but is included in the general stew, uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The film has something in its favor: in a small role, it presents the very young Anne Jeffreys. What beauty she was, and certainly still is!
