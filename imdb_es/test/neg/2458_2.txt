What I got after watching this movie was a guilty conscience. The film itself has a plot and a very intriguing premise, but unfortunately it is a movie that can not be seen without being bombarded with pornography. If you plan to see this and have a moral problem with the degradation of the marital act for the visual pleasure of an audience, then you are making a big mistake. This is not the kind of movie with the token sex scene that you can skip on your DVD player. Near the beginning of the film, Baldwin's character is a video that records his sexual exploits without the knowledge of his partner. This and similar films continue to appear throughout the film at unpredictable times. It seems that the film is trying to make a statement about the dignity of women. Ironically, in doing so, they converted several women into prostitutes. I only gave him a 2 instead of a 1 because if they had handled Baldwin's promiscuity better, it would have been an interesting movie.
