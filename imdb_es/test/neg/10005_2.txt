This German horror movie has to be one of the rarest I've seen. <br /> <br /> I was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but it is supposed to be based on a true character. <br /> <br /> Our hero is deaf and dumb as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father. He also has a doll fetish, but I can not figure out where that came from. His co-workers discover him and make fun of him terribly. <br /> <br /> During the day, he is a kind accountant, and at night breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of the dead girls. All are attractive, of course, otherwise, we would not mind the fact that he normally rips his clothes to the waist. Graduates eventually to kill, and that's what catches him. <br /> <br /> As I said, a very strange, dark and very slow movie, since Werner Pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood.
