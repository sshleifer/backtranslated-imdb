Wait to see this ... I mean, even after reading this review. No other movie to date has plagued more than this ... One thing I do not understand is that, when you're stealing a little film in English, why add your own creativity? With the amount spent to make this film, the producers should have considered the purchase rights of "Cellular" to be dubbed to Hindi and released to the film. They could have got some benefits that way, I suppose. If there was an opportunity to rate this movie with a 0, I would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from Tanushree Datta and the girl who played Aftab's partner. I do not know if my problem is that I've seen Cellular long before this movie ... but that can not be a reason to support this movie ... it could last hours but I also do not have time to argue about this useless garbage of a movie, not I want to remember those horrible scenes from the movie ... <br /> <br /> Please, stay away from this movie.
