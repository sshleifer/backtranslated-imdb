Voor een verloren soldaat, for a lost soldier, is a sad example of how it is not translated to film a complex and moving psychological study, of the most magical moment in a man's life, when he is still a child, but begins to become a man. The novel records real life experiences of Rudy van Dantzig, as told through the boy Jeroen, during the last days of World War II at the age of 11, while dealing with his incipient sexuality and his deep fears of abandonment when He was sent to the province. of Friesland, north of Holland by his parents due to lack of food in Amsterdam and has not heard from them for many months, since the postal service has been broken. The arrival of the liberating soldiers to the film is presented in a painful way. Corny way, with the soldiers providing a vaudeville style of entertainment. Then a soldier, Walt, romances Jeroen and the couple present themselves as two men romping. Let them consume their love in a sexual experience. It is taken with calm by the 11 years Jeroen. The reality was something different: Jeroen describes his encounters with Walt, 6 in total, in detail but in oblique language. But there are no misunderstandings of its nature. Walt wakes up to an intense passion for Jeroen, during which he handles it rudely, so that in his final meeting, Jeroen is bruised and suffers a painful wound in the shoulder where Walt has bitten him. During this encounter, Walt violates Jeroen, twice. Jeroen could have easily avoided Walt after their second encounter, when Walt assaults him for the first time, since Walt is clearly anxious to prevent the other soldiers from mistreating the boy. Why Jeroen keeps looking for Walt is a mystery of the human heart and, anyway, I can not explain it. What the movie neglects is the consequence: the nightmares, the dejection, the frantic search in Amsterdam about the possibility of finding Walt, because Jeroen loved Walt, and nothing could shake that.
