Savage Guns (video title) is a very cheap powder, in the lower part of the spaghetti western in which the survivor of a massacre hunts the bandits who killed his brother and left him for dead, reaching them in a city controlled by your boss twisted. <br /> <br /> Despite much violence, this manages to be both boring and colorless with bad characterizations and almost without imagination or humor. <br /> <br /> The main actor Robert Woods lives up to his name with a wood performance and little charismatic that does not generate heat or sympathy at all. In other words, the viewer never really takes pride in him even though he is the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The worst scene (in my opinion) is the annoying scene of a ballroom where a woman sings in a heavy and terribly unsexy German accent. It was the worst scene in Blazing Saddles and the worst here!
