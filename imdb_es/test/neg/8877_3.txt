I will recommend putting this in the "ignore" stack as well. I was a little excited about the concept when my fiancee rented it, and a little more excited when I saw that Milos Forman had directed it. Oh, well ... <br /> <br /> The costumes were nice, of course, but they were typical. There was nothing about them that said they were from nowhere, except the period costume department of any major Hollywood studio. There was no distinction between Spanish, British and French; they all dressed as if they were at the court in Versailles. The sets somehow did not evoke the qualities of the surroundings: the prison did not feel like a prison, the mansions did not feel like mansions, and the outside scenes seemed like they were filmed in a later lot, for everything they did. they were probably practical locations. <br /> <br /> The score was dramatically lower than it could have been. I have been a fan of the results of movies since my youth, noticing them, appreciating them and collecting them, what I want to say is more than John Williams. My girlfriend is a professional, award-winning film composer who has done her work at Lincoln Center and a rising star in the industry. At the beginning of the film, we had high hopes for it and, in fact, it started very well. It deteriorated rapidly, and at several points, including the scene of the release of the prisoners, actually reached a level of annoyance. Actually I reached the remote control to lower the volume. The score was never more than the most obvious option to set a specific scene tone, and it was not integrated into the "soul" of the film (think about the music of Babel and you will have an idea of ​​what I did. He never achieved the greatness he wanted, but neither did the film. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem, as talented as he is, was horrible. For the first part of the film, his gestures distract him so much that he takes charge of his performance. During the second half, everything that was his character in the first half disappeared, replaced by a completely different set of annoying manners, and resembled the love son of Keith Richards and Lestat of Stuart Townshend. I never had the idea that he cared about paper (that is, that the character cared about his life and his actions), or that the character was drawn by writers as something more than an opportunist who, for whatever reason, He changes his mind and decides to stick to his principles in the end. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman was very good, even though her performance lacked the growing madness between her release from prison and holding Lorenzo's hand at the end. that would have needed to really call it an effective performance. Alicia's character was never defined enough to really discern, and if it were not for the gorgeous makeup on her eyes and cheeks, someone who saw the beginning of the film and the end would not know they were not the same character. The prosthetic teeth were horrible, artificial and distracted, but that is not a blow for Mrs. Portman. <br /> <br /> Stellan Skarsgård was fine as Goya. It is not worthy of an Oscar, but it is useful and generally credible. I do not know much about Goya's life, or his deafness, but it seemed that the film was related to the requirement of biographical information, rather than anything that was used in the film. I am sure that it affected Goya's life much more than the simple need of an interpreter, but I would never know it when I saw this. For registration, words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted approximately 30% of the time through lip reading. <br /> <br /> Do not make me start with Randy Quaid. At least he was a secondary character. <br /> <br /> The script reads like one of the "choose your own adventure" books that I used to read as a child: at various moments in the film, several results are possible, and none of the actions that precede them they carry with certainty the way in which the film develops. Ironically, the film is also predictable, especially in its few attempts to improve humor through small pieces of humor. The joke on the hands? Maybe it's because I paint (not very well) as a hobby and I know what the PITA hands are for drawing / painting, but I saw that the joke was a mile away, as well as the repetition in the second half. Was the baby ever there for any other reason than to be taken by Ines? There could also have been a line of breadcrumbs. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. <br /> <br /> (note: this revision is a copy of an answer I made to a thread in the forum)
