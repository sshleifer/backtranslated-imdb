I am horrified to see that so many people have given positive reviews to this "movie". This movie has no redemption factors. The music is not good, the acting is pathetic, I can not understand how anyone could enjoy this movie, much less sing their "compliments". The idea is horrible, certain scenes linked to the plot (as the story of continued love, although the male romantic interest is a HEAD IN CHARGE) are so bad that I wanted to hurt myself physically while watching them. The fact that there is a scene in which a shrunken head flies under a girl's shirt so that he can "feel it" And she likes it to be a sufficient reason for all the people related to this film to perish. The link to West Side Story can only be a mockery, since to make reference to such a fantastic movie in such a horrible movie is only to destroy all the copies of this film. To summarize, this movie is horrible in every way. And if I had my way, everyone who likes it should go straight to hell ...
