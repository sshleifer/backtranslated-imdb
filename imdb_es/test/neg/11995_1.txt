A total and absolute farce of a movie. The "dark power" is the kind of movie that even troma would be embarrassed to throw. The script, the direction, the acting and the action sequences are so terrible that they are almost painful to watch and one can not help thinking that it is a mere execution time of 75 minutes could have been spent better. The previous reviewer must be related to the director, since that is the only reason why I can see from his assessment of this garbage, some might call it bo movie fun 'so bad that it's good' just to justify his enjoyment, but When the main actor (and the most experienced cast member) can not offer his lines convincingly, you know you have a very, very bad movie. Avoid at all costs.
