This movie is a complete and absolute waste of time, one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. And coming from me, that's definitely saying something. In fact, I wish I had given her negative stars instead of just labeling her as pathetic as a star. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I had an open mind. I find the legend of the chupacabra interesting and I like corny horror movies. But I draw the line in this case. <br /> <br /> The performance stunk. The male protagonist offers one of the worst performances in history, with an unnatural aspect and an unnatural sound as he presents his misspelled lines. The female lead offers a slightly more pleasant performance, but that does not really take much. <br /> <br /> The chupacabra ... well, considering the low budget that this movie must have had, the creature was tolerable. However, he looks exactly like someone with a mask and a body suit. The mask is quite detailed and can look good in person, but not so much on the screen. <br /> <br /> Speaking on the screen, one would think that at least they could have used a better camera. It looks like it was filmed with a camcorder to scream out loud. It is not very good either. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the person who wrote this abomination thought. The dialogue stinks and just ... I can not describe what I feel about it. At least not without having problems with the site. <br /> <br /> My advice? Avoid this at all costs. Not worth it. If it appears on TV and you have nothing else to do or look at, then * find * something else to do or look at. Read a book, listen to music, * anything. * Do not submit to this. If you do, you can not say you were not warned. And for the love of God and the lady, do not rent this fool. It's not worth it, even if you have the opportunity to rent it for fifty cents. Believe me, I know.
