Even with the low standards of a dedicated terror fan, I found that this movie is more than horrible. It was a big disappointment since it was presented as one of Horrorf's eight most horrific films. I can only hope that the other seven were better. In fact, I felt embarrassed by the friends I could convince to see this, and these are the same friends that I did to see the new version of The Wicker Man. It has every cliché in the book. In fact, he did everything possible to include them. Let's start with the characters. Instead of a young damsel in distress, we get three: the single, sexy mother with two daughters? a teenager in full bloom and without a brain and a cute but at the same time spooky girl that you know, will have "special" abilities that include supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead. The girl is the same one that was in the remake of The Amityville Horror. It was a bit annoying, but not as irritating as Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> In general, these characters seemed to escape from a LifeTime movie. I thought maybe the horror movies had gone from the scenes in which the female characters go to bed in full makeup and run in the dark announcing their presence to anyone with ears, but not this one. It also seems inconceivable to me that none of them can bother to ensure that the entrance door opens arbitrarily day and night. To give you an idea of ​​how little involved I was with these characters, I spent most of my time thinking about how cold I should have been on the set because everyone was in a coat, even in their homes, and how white their teeth were. . <Br /> <br /> Despite all the plot machinations formulated, the film does not generate any suspense, except to ask when it will be over. There is more atmosphere in the local Giant in the midst of the more mundane afternoons of the weekdays. As for the dialogue, I could have quoted from ten other films and created a better and more credible speech. The level of gore, the sweet of the eyes for a fan of horror, was minimal at best. Without their tiny weapons, the 'zombies' were not at all threatening. You could probably throw a couple of them across the room. <br /> <br /> What really kills him is his banality. Horror films, more than any other genre, can not survive mediocrity without inspiration. Give me a horror movie that is comically inept or outrageously exaggerated with gore. I can even take the new ones with their torture inducing discomfort. Every once in a while I would appreciate a really scary one, anything but this.
