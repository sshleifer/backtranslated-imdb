This movie actually starts quite interesting, but to my taste, it degenerated too quickly into a boring and predictable melodrama. None of the performances is particularly interesting and the camera work is just a standard TV movie, so there's really no reason for anyone to watch this movie unless it's a Jeff Bridges fan as I suppose. <br /> <br /> Bridges plays Mike Olson, a young man who announces at a family picnic that he leaves college to go on a trip. His parents believe that he is "simply acting" and talk about how he "has no plan". He assures them that he does have a plan, and that he needs to discover his true self and his place in the world. So much so that, in fact, he invites them to go on the road with him and buys an old bus to travel, which he and his father notice in a real father-son television movie. Up to this point in the movie, I was a bit interested in the plot and the characters, and I wanted to see how his mother (Vera Miles) would react to life on the road. From the beginning, there is a funny scene in which the father and son have to convince her to make the trip with them. They show her the interior of the bus and little by little she becomes more and more interested, finally she gets angry with some kind of conversation about curtains against blinds in the windows. Bridges marvels at her father (Carl Betz, equipped with the radio announcer's voice) that she has changed her mind. Dad assures him that "the electric oven ... always works!". <br /> <br /> But the movie is going downhill almost as soon as they hit the road. It turns out that Mike's only "plan" is to introduce some "friends" of his who turn out to be random people who are at a hippie rock festival. As soon as I saw the rock festival, I felt a bit disappointed ... particularly because it became clear that the rest of the film would take place at the festival camp and not on the road. But at least I thought there might be a decent band like, well, if they could not afford Hendrix or the Stones, maybe they would at least have Canned Heat or Little Feat or something like that. It says nothing, apparently, the only music in this festival is a horrible choral group with an orchestra that sounded like a poor imitation of the Fifth Dimension, along with an annoying announcer who is supposed to have humor. <br /> <br /> We also introduce ourselves to a group of attendees at hippie festivals and their various medical melodramas. Kathy (Renne Jarrett) is a very blonde girl with existentialism and nature in her mind, who falls in love with Mike before revealing the fact that she needs kidney dialysis to live and has escaped the festival to die. And another 2 campers are determined to have a baby in their tent, introducing the struggle between modern medicine and hippy ignorance (or something like that). In general, the longer this lasts, the more painful the movie becomes for anyone who wants some element of surprise or real drama. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is a waste of time, although it will probably amuse anyone who does. It is really in the period of time in the late 60's, early 70's and the movies of that time. However, I would be just as happy if I never saw him again.
