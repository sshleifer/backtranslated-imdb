You know, I really have a problem with the movie lists. I was reading Maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the 50 best films in the history of all time, and knowing, of course, I have to see them all and write reviews of all of them. This is why you see reviews of movies like Gator Bait and Barb Wire and Coffy on my list. So I noticed H.O.T.S. in the video store the other day and I recognized him on Maxim's list of the 50 best B movies, and I decided to rent it and check it out. My only consolation is that I rented it because I recognized it from a list of B movies, so I knew it was going to suck. <br /> <br /> Given the type of film that it is, I can not say that H.O.T.S. It is a total failure, since it is nothing more than a T & A movie from the late 70s, and never pretends to be anything else. The only place where he is far from his target is in an irregular secondary plot involving a couple of ex-convicts who have hidden a large amount of stolen money in the house that the self-styled H.O.T.S. Move to, because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie. Although the rest of the film is also, this secondary argument is completely superfluous and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a pair of rival brotherhoods in the beloved FU, which exists as one of those Universities that contains a grand total of a sisterhood of women until the rejections form their own to return a Snobs in the other. This new brotherhood, Help Out The Seals (HOTS), is a brotherhood supposedly based on helping the stamps (the secondary plot of stamps is another that does not really belong to the film, and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond to have a stamp that runs through here and there throughout the film). <br /> <br /> This is going to sound weird, but there was actually a scene that impressed me a lot in this movie. A shot that impressed me, I should say. Approximately in the middle of the film, one of Pi's girls, the sisterhood of rival women, pours alcohol into the punch, and she pours herself a glass and drinks it. Oddly enough, what he does while he drinks is that alcohol reminds me of something Charlie Chaplin would do, which really illuminated the film. Obviously, there is nothing in this movie that comes close to what Chaplin did, but that shot only raised my score for the movie from 2 to 4. <br /> <br /> In general, however, the film is exactly What you would expect it to be, a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes (I liked the way in which one piece of clothing was eventually removed for each score in the football game). One of the ideas of GIRLS: Riiiiiiiiight?), And do not think much about anything else. There is, for example, a scene at the beginning of the film when a pair of Pi girls pour hot sauce into the sodas at a H.O.T.S. Party, accidentally staying trapped in an incriminating photograph (the girl who took the photograph did not realize that she photographed them at that time), although the photograph never appears for any reason later in the film. <br /> <br /> I've seen movies like this before, it's like Gator Bait, but without the violence and the hicks and Coffy was not far away. Even Barb Wire is very similar, only with a bigger budget and more silicone. Fortunately, Maxim's 50 B-movie list contains only some more comedies, because while these T & A teen movies are occasionally entertained as bad movies with the occasional half-naked scene, after watching H.O.T.S. I think I've decided that I like bad horror movies better than bad comedies. I'd rather see many terrible actors pretend to be scared than pretend to be funny.
