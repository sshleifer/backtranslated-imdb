Okay, sorry for the cast and crew for this review, but this movie is by far the worst I've seen so far ... First, the acting was fine. It could have been better (especially in some parts), but it was "fine". Then, there was the cheapest video camera (they used). The violence was pretty good. If it accelerated, it would be incredible, but they did not do it (* sigh *) ... It scares. The scares were well written (in the script), but not well done. For example ... (SPOILER HERE!) In the attic, one girl is halfway and the other half is in the dark, lower area of ​​the barn house, then she gets it. The monster pulls it down and then you hear that someone's guts are ripped off. The fears could have been better if the music had not been copied from a CD of cheap horror sounds. The effects on the blood were pretty good, but the blood was like "Kill Bill." K.B. I did it because it looked like the old kung-fu movies, but when the team can not tell the difference between red and pink ... it's sad. The bodies smashed in the movie were good, but the scarecrow costumes were something you would see for $ 25 at a Halloween store. Do not let the cover fool you, the costumes stink! My overall rating is 3/10. If you are interested in independent films, you are easily satisfied or you only have $ 3 burning a hole in your pocket, go to Blockbuster and see the horror of failure.
