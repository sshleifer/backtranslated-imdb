Hitchcock is a great director. Ironically, most of his films seem like a waste of total time to watch. I admire Hitchcok on a purely visual and technical level. <br /> <br /> First the positive aspects. Hitchcock invented the notion of the probing camera. The curious eye that is able to retain or seek information. It is not exactly a new visual grammar, but it was revolutionary then. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Hitchcock perfected the thriller and chase. He has an economic style and is always thinking about the audience. He gives them regular emotions, regular jolts of humor and regular shocks. In short, it anticipates the basic needs of the audience and reproduces them as a violin. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic needs of a human being are mostly stupid. Food, sex, the emotion of danger and a bit of comedy. Hithcock satisfies all these needs on the screen, with the exception of food, which, judging by its size, attended to the screen. <br /> <br /> It is this mockery of the audience that sabotages most of their films. A second drawback is that most of Hitchcock's camera work and visual grammar are now commonplace. What makes his films visible is the simple economy of his stories, the intelligence of his work with the camera and his ability to create tense action games. <br /> <br /> Let's go to "Saboteur". This is a merry romp in the vein of "The 39 steps". It jumps from sequence to sequence until it ends in the typical final action set piece by Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> On an emotional level, the relationship between drivers is not on par with Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll in "The 39 Steps". Hence, the whole story lacks some energy. The plot simply reverberates like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes. And the new scenes only bring us closer to the end, since it is not clear if the hook is the escape of the hero of the police, the villains or their action to stop the sabotage plotted. <br /> <br /> There are the usual Hitchcocks. logical failures For example, a man with handcuffs is released using a fan belt for a car, etc. (Why do not you go in the car, is it possible that the handcuffs are not so restrictive? You can swim in them, after all!) <Br> If you want a better propaganda movie Hitchcock in wartime of the 1940s, I advise you to see "Foreign Correspondent". Both are silly chase movies with a catchy ending, but "Foreign Correspondent" makes great use of umbrellas and tulips, something that Spielberg starts off very well in the "Minority Report". <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 - A good set pieces. Beyond that, however, there is not much to sink your teeth.
