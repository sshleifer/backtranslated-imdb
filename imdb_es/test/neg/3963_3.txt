You know that the movie could have been much better when the animal, in this case, a puppy, is the best actor on the screen! The acting in this movie is so bad, so amateur that the dog was embarrassed to see this. He ("Rusty", our Golden Retreiver) could have done a better job than the people here. <br /> <br /> At this moment it is almost a hackneyed story: the child finds an animal, the pet is not wanted or loved by one of the parents, but the "pet" ends up saving one of the children and now it is a hero and an official member of the family. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> I remember that this movie was a great success, but I could never see it until the mid-90s on VHS. I was surprised at how bad it was. Why all the fuss over a movie? Was it because there was so much sleaze in the early 70s that a good family movie stood out in the crowd? Possibly. There was not a lot of healthy entertainment in the 70s, and many people are dumb by the cute little animal stories. Who could resist this cute little dog? I do not. But I can resist the film: it's a Grade B story with a horrible performance. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for pet lovers of small dogs and I refer to "lovers" because even the owner of an average pet will fall asleep trying to see this movie at this time.
