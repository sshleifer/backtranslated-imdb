The films of Shirley Temple for Twentieth Century Fox are not despicable because they are poorly made (Darryl F. Zanuck supervised most of them, after all); they do not retain much of a "classic" stature among moviegoers, mainly because they are overburdened with the Hollywood optimism of the Depression era. The audiences of the 1930s were appeased by the pleasure of seeing a sunny girl, often an orphan, making adults look foolish in comparison (they fidgeted and wrung their hands while she danced her problems). Seen many years later, Temple vehicles barely survive with history (always aided by musical sequences to reinforce the content), and their time (always too perfect) and exaggerated reactions could leave most modern viewers rolling their eyes in white. No one could be blamed for his exasperation at Temple's performance here (screaming lines at the top of his lungs) or the perversity of his dance steps, parading with a crowd of sailors to "At the Codfish Ball." Even so, the fantasy aspect of this particular story, previously filmed in 1924 from Laura E. Richard's book, is enough to captivate those with the spirit of saccharin proper. It seems that Shirl was taken out of a shipwreck by a government-appointed lighthouse keeper, but when an absent State Board official discovers that the boy is not in school, she threatens to take the child. It really does not matter if the plum-faced officer has a point in the sense that Temple is not rising properly (the woman becomes the proverbial villain almost immediately); immediately you can see that Temple can defend herself, taking care of herself and her elderly guardian in the deal (as well as the local widow who has her hooks for the Captain). Temple is not the only one rehearsed too much; The month of January of Guy Kibbee is aimed at wide-eyed reactions so often that one wonders if maybe he did not film them all in one day. The dialogue is permeated with metaphors facing the sea ("You can not rush a trout!" ... "Well, do not give up on the ship!), And something about the whole company seems strangely pixelated. ** from * ** *
