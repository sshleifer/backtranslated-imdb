Personal note Never again do you see a serious movie with Charlie Sheen in it. Great comedian, horrible stamp. This movie makes Navy SEALS look like a reckless ranger group when, in fact, they are the most militarized elite form in the world. Charlie Sheen helps destroy the reputation of Navy SEAL. Thanks for making an incredibly select group of people look horrible in one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is a great story that could become an incredible action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? There are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but Sheen decides to ruin them with "funny" comments.
