Some describe CALIGULIA as "the" most controversial film of its time. While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually all the big names associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it. Author Gore Vidal actually demanded (with mixed results) that his name be removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film, their reactions ranged from disgust expressed aloud to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was for him to leave. <br /> <br /> For a while, it seemed like I could. CALIGULA was a major box office and critical failure (producer Guccione had to rent theaters to be screened), and although the film was released on VHS to the local market, so many problems of censorship arose that they were presented again. Edited, and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade. But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in the edited "R" version and in the original "Unrated" version. And, no doubt, John Gielgud is glad he did not live to see it. <br /> <br /> The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say that DEEP DEATH meets DUNE by David Lynch through Fellini. day off. Vidal's script fell into the hands of the Penthouse editor, Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to finance the project and attract the big stars, and then discarded most of Vidal's script and brought the director of soft-porn Red Brass. Then, when Guccione felt that Brass's work was not explicit enough, he and Giancarlo Lui secretly photographed hardcore material. <br /> <br /> Viewers who look at the edited version may wonder what all this fuss is about, but those who see The original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. There is a tremendous amount of nudes, and that remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there are very explicit homosexuals, lesbians and heterosexuals, perverted sex and a great orgy with Roman dancers thrown in good measure. The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rapes, tortures and mutilations on the agenda. In a particularly disturbing scene, a man is stabbed to death, a woman urinates on his corpse and his genitals are cut and thrown to the dogs. <br /> <br /> In a documentary accompanying the DVD release, Guccione says he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, the brand was lost. We know very little about Caligula, and what little we know is, in the best of cases, questionable. Apart from that, orgies and casual sex were not commonplace in Roman society, where adultery was a crime punishable by death. And, certainly, ancient Rome NEVER resembled the strange, slightly Oriental, strange sets of the space age and the costumes offered by the designers. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, these sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful, and although cinematography is a commonplace, at least it does them justice; The score is also very, very good. The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who manages to attract our interests and sympathies such as the Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape reasonably well. The same can not be said of McDowell, but in justice for him he does not have much to work with. <br /> <br /> The film has a dark fascination, but ultimately it is a rarity, more interesting because of its flat design and rarity for the content. Some of the bodies on display (including those of McDowell and Mirren) are extremely beautiful, and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography ... but again, some of them are so unpleasant that they could lead you to abstinence, and the bloody And the grotesque nature of the film undermines its eroticism. If you are willing to do it, it is worth seeing once, but it is likely that once is enough. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
