Zombie movies are hot, I love them. I can not get enough. Why buy a movie of this caliber is not an explanation, I just love zombies. Surprise, this really is not a zombie movie; A low budget that I can manage, being deceived only irritates me. <br /> <br /> A group of horror movie clich√©s are in a warehouse / laboratory / who knows what to do to escape a fire storm outside. Panic, screams, low light and (eventually) zombies occur. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the filmmakers, since it is obvious that they really thought they were putting together something good; A serious and terrifying horror movie. It is not, far from it, a boredom of wooden performances, cheesy effects, poor lighting, excessive dialogue and over editing. <br /> <br /> Things go wrong when they take more than 10 minutes. so that the characters feel and begin to realize what is happening. It gets worse when they spend another 20 minutes and they're still sitting around trying to figure out what's going on. All this is plagued by lack of action and bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone gets attached (even if it's not for a zombie) and hope flashes just a touch before the characters are again whimpering (the only emotion that anyone generates) about how much it stinks this. Me too, guys, me too. <br /> <br /> Finally, the zombies are in the mix, but nobody is looking at the worries anymore. I think there was blood and blood thrown away, but I was too busy praying for the credits to take notice. And when the screen finally faded to black, I felt even more deceived by the useless ending inspired by 'Cube'. <br /> <br /> I'll give credit for working hard, even if it failed miserably. That and the punk girl was very hot if it was not used very much. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this to anyone, except for film students who are looking for 'no-no' pointers. <br /> <br /> 4/10
