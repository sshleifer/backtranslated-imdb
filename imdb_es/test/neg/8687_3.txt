The Evil Below begins in 'The Straits of San Sebastian 1683' when the 17th century treasure ship, The Devil sinks in a violent storm. Jump to the "Current Day of the San Sebastian Strait" where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, encounter the sunken sinking of El Diablo and explore it, but are attacked and killed by something that It looks like a vicious eel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns and manages a rental boat called 'Vagrant Viking', which caters to tourists who want to fish, dive and, in general, explore the islands. Sarah Livingstone (June Chadwick) is an art teacher who looks for treasure as a hobby (well, we all have to do something to pass the time, right?), Hire Max and his assistant with little clothes, Tracy (Sheri Able) , so you can try To locate the devil and get rich. Talking about a sunken treasure thrills some of the most unscrupulous members of the local community, as they dodge criminals and thugs, as Max and Sarah draw attention to the fact that El Diablo has a sinister past, a past that supposedly still leaves behind his supernatural legacy. even now ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jean-Claude Dubois, according to the IMDb with a little help from the star Crawford, although the version I saw only included Dubois, I thought The Evil Below had a certain potential and it's a bit different, but unfortunately that's not enough to keep it from sinking into the bottom of the sea like a stone. The Arthur Payne script starts well, with the two divers killed by some kind of sea creature, but this opening is NEVER mentioned again, the creature is NEVER seen again and there are no more supernatural murders. The Evil Below suffers a serious and terminal case of identity crisis, does not seem to know what it wants to be, as it throws pieces and pieces of various genres there from underwater adventures, horror, action, suspense, crime and even has time to launch a Little mystery of murder and religious nonsense too. As a result, The Evil Below feels very little, fragmented and, since the best scene of the whole movie is the opening sequence, I found myself sitting there, feeling increasingly frustrated by the lack of constant horror as I went quickly downhill. Never see the sea creature again. The Evil Below is boring, slow, uneventful, predictable, foolish and lacks any charm or intelligence; In short, The Evil Below does not do anything right for a good movie to do it. <br /> <br /> Director Dubois fails to animate things, although, obviously, he filmed a lot of material from the underwater fauna, since sometimes he thought he was watching a National Geographic documentary with all the fish shots , corals and wildlife in general. Forget about any gore, a bit of water stained with blood and the cough with blood is as bloody as I fear. <br /> <br /> Technically, the evil below is very basic, insipid and totally forgettable apart from underwater photography. of fish. These are point-and-shoot things and, in general, production values ​​are very low, even where the shot was not very sunny or attractive. The acting is bad, but, again, did you expect anything else? <br /> <br /> The Evil Below is a bad movie, its basic story is everywhere and it can not decide what it wants to be & as a result, it ends up being a disaster. Add that to the low production values, the fact that there is no bleeding here and that the horror content is minimal, you have a movie that is probably best avoided unless you are absolutely desperate and even then there are better ways to spend more than 90 minutes of your life. .
