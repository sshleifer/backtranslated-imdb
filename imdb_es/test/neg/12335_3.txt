This movie had the potential to be a decent thriller, but was hampered by having only twenty minutes of a good script, which was mostly used at the beginning. After holes began to appear in the story, you could cross a truck. The film followed a downward curve from good to ordinary to bad to ridiculous by the time it concluded. It is not recommended
