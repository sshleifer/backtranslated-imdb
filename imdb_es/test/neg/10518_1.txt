There are some great Canadian films. There are some shit. Last night, I saw one of the shitty ones. It was not the typical Canadian film in which he tried to be so different being artistic. This movie tried to be some kind of Hollywood gangster movie. It was terrible. <br /> <br /> From the beginning I had the feeling that it would be a bad movie. It had some of the most popular dialogues a movie can have. There was this voiceover for a scene and then it never came back. That always bothers me, when filmmakers simply use voice-overs when they can not think of another creative way to tell a story. <br /> <br /> I know that being in the Canadian film industry should support my fellow brothers, but this movie is garbage. The premise is something like the episode of a soprano, but it is not realistic. The father of some banker's mafia bank is on his deathbed and orders the son to make the business legitimate. Not so original. And the workers complain about it, but they simply assume the fact that they will soon be out of work. To make it legitimate, they use extortion. Irony. But not the good one. Then, a showgirl who had a wig and a hideous birthmark of Elvis that covered half her face, steals the main character and rapes him a little. Anyway, this guy for whatever reason now likes to disguise himself as girls. Then this banker hooks up with a prostitute, when he has a beautiful wife in the future. But he falls in love with the whore because he dresses like a man and puts on makeup. She blackmails him with some pictures of him wearing bra and panties. However, he still loves her. She also has no reason to leave her fiancé, but she does have reasons to be with the prostitute. <br /> <br /> In a film about organized crime and sexual fetishism, there was no action or sex. It was like a Cinemax nighttime porn movie without the good things. The sex scenes were not hot or sexy. He was too amateur. The movie had nothing in its favor, only the plot loose. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was the actor's fault. I think they had a terrible script to work with. What stood out most were the ridiculous characters. The name of the bad boy was Uncle Bunny or something like that. But the name was not important. It was that they were all cliché. The dialogue was ridiculous throughout the film, and the other spectators laughed out loud at some of the "serious" moments in the film. Then, worst of all. It had to be the cheapest end. If you ever remember playing shooting as a child, either with imaginary weapons or with toy weapons. That was basically the end of the movie. But I was more than happy that it ended, and I had to warn my Canadians not to waste time or money watching this movie.
