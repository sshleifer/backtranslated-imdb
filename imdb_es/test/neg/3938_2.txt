Good idea ... shame about the real movie. Would you have liked it to be a little more scary and explain more about the characters and who exactly was the evil woman? If she was torturing those children, why did they help her kill and not others kill her? It's a bit down from Malcolm in the Middle! <br /> <br /> I think it would benefit from being a little longer and going into more detail with the characters, although after about an hour I was wondering when. it would end !! <br /> <br /> It would also have been better if the real characters that killed them were not computerized in reality, somehow it made them look like crap. And what happened to the character of Frankie Munitz? He fell into a bed of wild roses, so he should have been safe, however, the computer game showed him as a game over, that is, dead. The next thing that appears with that irritating blonde girl to rescue the boy who is afraid of the fire is who, I noticed, had no qualms about turning on the lighter when the demon lady was chasing him! However, to really enjoy it, it could make you think twice before playing that new computer game!
