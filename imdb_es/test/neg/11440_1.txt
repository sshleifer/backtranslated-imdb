WOW, I would hate to sound like a critic, but anyone who has rated this movie higher than what I have should have an I.Q. that reaches unimaginably low depths that extend beyond time and space and connect on the planet "Hopper-is-a-retard-for-making-this-movie". WOW this movie STANK. Fred Ward's haircut looks SSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPIIIDDD! In fact, I considered sending Fred Ward some money in compensation for the miserable haircut he had in this horrible movie. Jodie Foster, of course, did not have much to work with, but still achieves a terrible performance at all times. Joe Pesci, oh my ... Joe Pesci (who mysteriously is not the cast) plays the stereotypical character of the Joe Pesci movie, complete with the mafia murder and the constant use of the word F. You will not believe your eyes Dean Stockwell, seeing him in this mess made me feel bad for him because I actually thought he was intoxicated or temporarily retarded throughout the movie. Jon Turturro must have been intoxicated when he agreed to be in this, along with Vincent Price, Bob Dylan and Charlie Sheen. I know what you're thinking, GREAT CAST! I know, and it was the WORST great cast movie I've seen. Dennis Hopper directs and stars, and he does equally badly in both areas. How man could have run EASY RIDER and this goes far beyond my excellent imagination. His OUTRAGEOUSLY bad hit-man accent is beyond the horrendous realms, and is only matched by the hilariously bad ending. They (Hopper and Foster) are the most selfless couple that I think I have met in my exposure to the world of cinema, and you will be encouraging them to lose and then get very angry by the end. What exactly are the TWO THAT LEAD in that action-filled conclusion? I do not know, but I know that if I ever meet Dennis Hopper, I will make a huge mockery of him for being responsible for this waste of celluloid. Join me! IAN
