Well, the title "House of Frankenstein" was a reference to a line from the original Frankenstein movie. When you follow it with a movie called "House of Dracula", which does not make any sense, you know it's starting to become a franchise. <br /> <br /> Without explanation, Dracula is back and he is calling himself Baron Latos. He infiltrates the house of a Dr. Edelmann, with the claim that he is looking for a cure for his vampirism. Edelmann has a humpback nurse who assists him (what about the humpback attendants in these movies?), But Dracula is really interested in his other, more beautiful assistant. At this point, Larry "Wolf Man" Talbot returns (again, without explanation) and turns out to be looking for the same doctor for a cure for his lycanthropy. And then, by chance, he falls into a cave where you can grow plants to help him, which also happens with Frankenstein's monster. Dear God, when will it end? Sure, the other sequels of Universal Monster were silly, but this is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> First the good. There are some great adjustments, and the effects of vampire bats are slightly better than usual. Some of the other effects are pretty clean too. John Carradine is not as bad as Dracula once you get used to him, but still nothing is brighter than Lugosi. In my opinion, Onslow Stevens plays a much better vampire in this movie, even though he has exactly the opposite problem to Carradine: everything creepy and nothing of the kind. None of the performances is as good, but it is more due to the atrocious writing than to anything else: the female parts are particularly poorly written. But as stupid as it is, it's still pretty entertaining for the most part. The best part is that it is short. <br /> <br /> Now the bad ... it is not creepy, it is badly written and it does not work. I expected the three monsters to start a kind of supernatural struggle for power, but it does not happen. The focus is almost exclusively on Dracula, who is not particularly well represented. On the other hand, this is the only movie in which Dracula infects another man, but it is done by a blood transfusion instead of a bite, since Universal always felt uncomfortable with the possible homosexual subtext. Larry Talbot is always decent as the Werewolf, but he plays a relatively small role. Once again, Frankenstein's monster part comes down to the anti-climactic closing moments. For the love of God, Glenn Strange was fantastic as the creature! Why not give more time on screen? It is unfortunate that the series had to end with this note (not counting the classic comedy "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"). In the end, he simply went out in the sunlight and died, just like Dracula himself.
