I had the misfortune to see this movie recently and I have to sit through it. A friend bought it for Â£ 1 and insisted that we see it since it sounded good in the back cover story. <br /> <br /> Within 10 minutes of the film, it was evident that the actors were amateurs and this was extremely low budget effort. <br /> <br /> The scenes were very badly interpreted, the script was stupid and the story contained many scenes that seemed unnecessarily long, just so the movie would have a reasonable duration. <br /> <br /> For example, when the main character rents a warehouse, the film spends a ridiculous amount of time in this scene, with a meaningless dialogue that has no real purpose or need for the plot. <br /> <br /> The main actor is supposedly carrying out a vendetta against a woman who sleeps with men to give them HIV, she never thinks about getting tested. Instead, he becomes a crazed killer who decides to torture her before killing her and cutting her to pieces. <br /> <br /> If this sounds good and you're thinking you'll have a lot of blood, think again. This movie does not have real bloody sequences and is quite docile for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> It does not scare, it does not make you think, it does not offer fun at a fast pace. However, it can put you to sleep, it is sure that it bores you to tears, so, please, save yourself the desperation and follow my header. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS MOVIE 1/2 out of 10 (this does not even deserve 1) <br /> <br /> The movie lasted 78 minutes, but it seemed like it was 2 1/2 hours.
