Finally I managed to sit through an entire episode of this show. I was very, very tired. Clearly. Before I always had to turn it off because I thought it was so bad. Watching a whole episode convinces me that it really is that bad. I could not even tell you what happened, but I clearly remember that I did not laugh. For people who think that this is the new Everything in the family or Married with children ... Have you ever seen those programs? They are well written and well acted and, most importantly, fun! This show is not fun. You might think so, if this is the first comedy you've seen. I can not see who else would do it. I echo all the previous feelings about Arrested Development, etc. It's probably my fault to get frustrated with television and not watch it, which allows stupid people to dictate what really stays in the air.
