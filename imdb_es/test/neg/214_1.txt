this movie is so bad that it forced me to create an IMDb account just to warn others about it. <br /> <br /> I have been using IMDb for a long time, and many movies have been close to making me want to register to praise or beat them, however, none has been so worthy. Until now! <br /> <br /> I'm a big Matt Dillon fan. all I could ask myself throughout this movie is "how did Dillon choose this script"? Really. I mean there are holes bigger than Vredefort. <br /> <br /> I mean it's a today's theft movie, not a set in the seventies. To scream out loud, even a child knows that armored trucks have tracking gps and so on. It makes you wonder what it takes to get a script produced in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I could continue for a long time, but I will not. Believe me when I say this. save your time and take a leap to this. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Matt, I'm still a fan, but this movie was crap.
