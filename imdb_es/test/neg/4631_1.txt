Many people in the movies enjoyed this movie, but it only made me feel misanthropic. If the deceptive "intellectuals" who talk about their irritating sexual lives sound good to you, look at them. I felt bored, but I'm glad I met people like that. The premise of the film was that, as with all societies or great civilizations, they are finally doomed to failure. According to the character of the female historian, who bores us with this fact, the United States shows signs of its decline (it is true that she goes into more detail than me). The next part of the film is about the vacuous, fatuous and sinister behavior of his friends and colleagues, and the various miseries caused by his libidinous behavior, with a vague attempt at humor. A lot of people liked this movie where I saw it. I could not relate to that.
