I really like 50s science fiction movies. I like really good ones (like The Day the Earth S Still Still, When Worlds Collide, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and many others) and, sometimes, the really bad ones because they can be really fun and great to see with friends (like like plan 9 from outer space). However, when a science fiction movie is bad but not enough to be fun, it really should be avoided. This movie is a movie of this kind. The posters make it look like a kind of sexy beast is attacking humanity, while the actual plot is much less interesting. A woman is married to a womanizer. She is contaminated and begins to grow to a huge size and decides to crawl this worm and kick her tail and that's it. In addition, many of the special effects really stink, especially the gigantic papier-mache hand that enters the room to catch the evil husband.
