The worst Korean movie of all time! The plot is ridiculously complex, incredible, and the film does not create a single shock. Accumulate the suspense well enough to leave him agitated without giving him a moment of startle or startle. Whenever there is a chilling moment, it does not bother you because you are still trying to find out who is who and what is happening! It's something like this: a model company recruits 4 people for a model career. but the owners are not what they seem, they have dolls of all and you see a strange girl walking around the place and the owners do not recognize a girl. It turns out that everyone is there for a reason and that is all I could understand. The end is a mess of murders and you do not know who is a doll that is real and who is dead! I do not recommend it to fans of Korean / Asian horror movies.
