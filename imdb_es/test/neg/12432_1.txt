It begins as a very serious social commentary that quickly makes us think of other Clark movies like Kids, Bully, etc. But in the same way, it disintegrates in a no direction. Who is the main character? Is this a serious movie or something like Gregg Araki-esquire over the best dumb movie? Is this a skateboard documentary with moments of dialogue inserted? I have no idea. I found myself looking at my watch and wondering when this shit was going to end. I kept thinking that there would be a great impacting culmination that never came. I cut a good 20 minutes of the film moving quickly through the mindless skate scenes. Yes, it illustrates the changing landscape among those who have not. I got it from the beginning. Kids and Bully was made in such a way that I really felt that I was observing the realities of that group of friends. Wassup felt very prepared, poorly constructed and always worse acting. Teenage Caveman, which Larry did not write but did direct, was terrible. But at least it looked like it was supposed to be a terrible movie that was not taken seriously. Wassup Rockers was simply bad.
