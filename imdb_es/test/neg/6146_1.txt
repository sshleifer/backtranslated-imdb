Besides the fact that Skylar is a complete braggart and his cons are not imaginative, his plans require a lot of preparation to make any of his scams worthwhile. Without revealing any spoilers (as if it mattered with this piece of garbage), its cons are a farce because it requires the effort of days and days of planning, and the use of multiple accomplices and a whole camera team, etc. just to cheat someone in a service that would cost less than a hundred dollars ... also, if you read the credits, rethink some of the phone calls, etc., because they do not work ... The whole concept of this show is a foolishness because all its disadvantages have the cost both in the crew and in the effort of ten times the real cost of the service you are trying to obtain for free ... what is the scam?
