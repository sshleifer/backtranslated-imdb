Like many fans of Western Pennsylvania history, I had been waiting for this popular PBS program that was produced by Pittsburgh's WQED. However, I must say now that I was a little disappointed. On the positive side, I think that, in general, this movie did a good job of explaining the main problems and describing the events of the so-called War of France and India. In particular, his presentation of the Indians' point of view was something new and quite interesting, although it was undoubtedly too emphasized. Also on the positive side, the combination of narrative and action scenes was well done and was somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries composed of interviews of "experts" and photographic images (to the Ken Burns). On the negative side, many of the battles had a somewhat "primed" appearance and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. Above all, I felt very disappointed and frustrated by the lack of importance given to the successful Forbes campaign of 1758 against Fort Duquesne compared to the previous failures of 1754 by Washington and 1755 by Braddock. In particular, I was a little surprised that Colonel Henry Bouquet, the Swiss mercenary in the British service who was most responsible for the success of Forbes, was NOT mentioned. Finally, I could not believe the complete omission of the Battle of Bushy Run of 1763 that began as a replay of Braddock's defeat, but ended as the victory that decided the outcome of the Pontiac War thanks to the trickery of Colonel Bouquet himself. They certainly must be ranked as one of the most successful British commanders of this war.
