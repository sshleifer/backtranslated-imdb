Even though the trailer and the poster of this film imply that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I may not have been so surprised to discover that he was just a minor character (and I mean smaller) if this movie was supposed to be Sally herself would tell it. family! I mean, if you're going to tell the story of a member of your family who has been ignored by history, would you really tell her about the man who relegated her to the darkness in the main character? Your other lover (who happens to be white) as the real love interest? I know I would not! I'm as pale as they come and I'm usually a big fan of Merchent movies ~ Ivory, but I could not stand the treatment of this movie for poor Sally Hemmings.
