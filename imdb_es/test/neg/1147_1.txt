Why, oh, why did they have to try to make a sequel to one of the best Christmas movies of all time? The film is a train crash on all levels and should never have been made. Randy Quaid's portrayal of cousin Eddie is a caricature superior to his previous outings as cousin Eddie. Also, Eddie's character is not interesting enough to carry a full movie. Even the "candy for the eyes" Sung Hi Lee could not exchange this piece of Christmas trash. Please, do not waste your time in this movement, just look at the original again.
