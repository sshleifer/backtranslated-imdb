Terrible! A friend of mine (who obviously thought he had an abysmal sense of humor) recommended it. <br /> <br /> It's coils. I almost turned it off. It's just my anal desire not to leave things without finishing what prevented me from doing it. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this was a British attempt to make a movie with a lot of television actors who also used some malicious script from their partner. In the business. I find it hard to think of anything that comes close to the scarcity of this movie. Less funny than global warming. <br /> <br /> Normally I am not so vehement, but I saw it more than ten years ago and I thought that losing an hour or more of my life is destructive. <Br /> <br /> Pet, plot less, tosh useless. <br /> <br /> I'd rather eat my feet than look at it again.
