An open face stealing from Se7en that is not apt to clean his shoes. The word "predictable" must have been invented for an occasion like this. Lambert is made of wood, as always (his moments of "emotion" are laughable, as is his accent). The 'climax' is not that at all, since we have had so many signs, and in the end we are simply immune to the flesh, rotting and other things. In general a real mess.
