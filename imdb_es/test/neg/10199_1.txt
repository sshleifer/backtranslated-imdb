One of the worst movies I've seen! After seeing it I go out like, what happened? I'm confused to this day, can someone explain that movie to me, please? Both the acting and the quality of the image are so bad that he will think he is watching the school project of someone made with a home camcorder. First, I can not believe that some people can give 10 stars to this movie. Because it's an incredibly bad movie! This movie is not scary at all! There are even no typical horror clich√©s, too. The plot and the performance of this movie was terrible. It is not, fantastic, surreal or horrific. It's a horribly bad Turkish movie. And, finally, there were many unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters. When I see "Gomeda" I feel so hopeless, so sad for the young Turkish filmmaker. Please, do not make the "cinema" that way!
