Honestly, this movie is weak. Very weak. Only the capital character can do something. She works as a supercharger with a defective engine ... so, if you like red-haired Valkyries, look at that. But better look for a picture of Brigitte like Sonja and put it on the desk. You will save yourself disappointments. Well, Arnold also makes his deal ... but it's definitely not his best role. Other characters - bad is not that word. Struggles of swords? Ridiculous monsters. The plot is really a shame. Why was the violation necessary? Especially, we do not see it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is weak. Although there are worse movies ... Without the main characters it would simply be ******. And if someone discusses it, maybe ...
