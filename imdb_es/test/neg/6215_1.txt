The alleged writer and director Mr.Dhawan has copied almost the entire plot of the hit Hollywood movie "HITCH," starring Will Smith. Many scenes are also exactly the same. The plot was just copied and some low quality humor was added (probably from Dwan's own creation) and a frequent dance was added to increase the time of the film to local standards. <br /> <br /> Although the performance of Salman khan and Govinda did give us some smiles, however, it is not for legendary artists like them to be part of the plagiarism, especially when they themselves keep telling people to stop buy pirated discs.
