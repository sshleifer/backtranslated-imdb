The movie was a pleasure to see if you are a fan of the Stooges. The story is told from the point of view of Moe Howard and his relationships with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, also the lifelong friendship with Larry Fine. The film deals mainly with the highs and lows of the career of the Stooges decade. The casting director and the makeup artist did a good job of finding actors who looked like the famous ensemble. The actor who plays "Curly" Howard did a good job of portraying the antics on camera of the most beloved Stooges. A must for any fan of the Three Stooges shorts.
