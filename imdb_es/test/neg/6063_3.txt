After the suicide of his father, Charlie 'Kid' Davis (Ray `Boom Boom 'Mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend Tiny (Michael Chiklis) and travels to Las Vegas with him trying to become a boxer. On the way, they meet Gina (Jennifer Beals) hitchhiking, pick her up and she becomes Charlie's girlfriend. Johnny Ticotin (Rod Steiger) is convinced by Tiny that it is Charlie's couch, and the powerful agent Alex Dumas (Joe Mantegna), after watching him fight, becomes his manager and promotes Charlie's career. This movie is so boring that, in fact, it does not deserve to spend much time writing about it. I do not like boxing, but sometimes I see a movie that is worthwhile on this subject. But this is horrible! Predictable, full of clich√©s, with a horrible actor, a pure waste of time. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Corpo e Alma" ("Body and soul")
