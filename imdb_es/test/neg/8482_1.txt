Well, about 11 years ago the incredible and funny movie "The Mask" came out, everyone loved it and now, 11 years later, the mask reappears in this incredible movie, right? INCORRECT!!!!!!!!!! This movie was the stupidest I've probably seen! I mean, when I rented it, I thought I would laugh so much that I would almost pee on my pants from the beginning. but after seeing this "sequential", the barley even giggled. I do not want to offend the director or the cast of this movie, but it is a waste of time and money. Therefore, the plot of the whole story was about this little baby who has part of the mask and this evil person is looking for something, because that's all I really got. so it would be higher than 2 out of 10 stars.
