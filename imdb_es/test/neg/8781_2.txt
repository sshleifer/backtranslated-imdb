This movie contains the worst acting performance of all time. Spilsbury lacks the energy to say the least. The energy is what Clayton Moore gave us. I never felt once in this movie that Spilsbury was anxious about anything. Revenge, love, justice? Not in the representation of this type. <br /> <br /> There is also no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot did not force them to be friends, you do not have the impression that they want to go out together. In addition, the partner has the most interesting personality. Ewww. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> The narration is amazingly bad and if you are familiar with the Dukes of Hazzard you can imagine how this is. I can not believe that the director agrees with this. He insulted me as a spectator by explaining each line of the plot that I just witnessed. <br /> <br /> Hey, at least the horses and the places looked good, maybe that's what happens when you hire a cinematographer to be your director. <br /> <br /> RATING-2 You may be able to see this for laughter or to show an alien what a bad movie is.
