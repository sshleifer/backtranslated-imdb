The film 'Heart of Darkness', based on the book of 1899 by Joseph Conrad, is one with little or no detail and has an almost schizophrenic plot. If you have read the book, then you know that little or nothing of the important "story-making" scenes were included in the movie. In the book there is so much that is left to the imagination and I feel that this is one of the parts that make the book what it is. An example would be when Marlow spent eternal hours and days, even months waiting for rivets and the whole scene was left out of the movie. Again, if you have read the book, then you would know that this scene in the book is one that almost describes the main theme, the futility, the best. Finally I feel that the film was too cut and dry. However, not enough was included in the original text and how that made the story what it is today. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the book 'Heart of Darkness' (preferably, Norton's critical edition) then do not waste time renting or buying the movie. However, if you have read the book, then I think you will appreciate it much more if you decide to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Eric 2007
