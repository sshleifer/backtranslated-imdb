I hired this movie at my local movie store, without really expecting something to flash or be elegant. Since it was a "B" grade film, made on a very tight budget. The initial scenes of the film were quite original, as was the plot and that was what made me rent the movie. However, the film becomes very boring and frustrating in some points. The story had many holes and the performance also had its fair share of disappointments. At the end of the movie, I prayed that a higher power would take me down where I was, because I was extremely bored, but more importantly I was frustrated. With how the story turned out. I still do not understand what really happened and I do not particularly care. In conclusion, the devil would cry of disgust to know that hell (his domain) was used as the basis for such a horrible movie.
