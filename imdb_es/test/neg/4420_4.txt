The amplitude and height of the scale of this film overwhelm me. About a week ago I published a commentary on the silent epic of 1926 MACISTE IN HELL referring to this as "amazing". Then I came across the RED PLANONIA OF POLAND Bros. SANGRE. Wow ... <br /> <br /> It's about the scale of thought behind this. Pollonia Bros. and her colleague John McBride thought so well that the reflections of Arthur C. Clark and Stanley Kubrick 2001: A SPACE ODESSEY are lucky to have been released thirty-two years before this girlfriend. In fact, Kubrick had it easy with the modelers, the budget, the real actors and the main study backup for his little "Star Trek" scam, and all Arthur C. Clarke had to do was write the damn thing. What's hard about making a typewriter around a typewriter? The Pollonia brothers, on the other hand, had to think radically, out of the box, and quickly. They recruited half a dozen of their friends and colleagues, including an attractive looking girl, bought a bunch of colored light bulbs, raids on old office supply dumps for each keyboard, monitor and hands-free headset they could find, got them all They were identical Black turtle neck, made with each can of muffins in the county, learned enough 3D modeling and skin texture to animate a couple of space flights from the spacecraft, spent a couple of hours putting together a script, running it which is easily the most terrifying spatial monster puppet since that horrible little monster that Jabba the Hut was carrying was rubbed by R2D2, he spent literally days working with a VHS camera and an Amiga to film and edit his film, and they came out winners. This is the best D.I.Y. Direct to the video. An epic film that I've seen, and in proportion to the amount of talent and resources available to filmmakers, including LOGANS RUN or BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA (the original series) as a chilling look at our future, until we reach a news anchor who wears a second-hand suit poorly adjusted and poorly adjusted. As a species, we are condemned. <br /> <br /> Seriously for a minute, however, it's a great improvement in later epics like THE DINOSAUR CHRONICALS or PREYALIEN: ALIEN PREDATORS, which is fun since it was done before. any of those masterpieces. At some point, Pollonia began to take it easy: this movie is executed with a certain conviction that makes you believe that you can really breathe in a vacuum with a dust mask and two bottles of motorcyclist jet. And the scene in which the alien beast consumes a member of the miniature crew made me immediately think about where I had seen that before: GODZILLA VS. THE SEA MONSTER, where the giant monster crab rampages two canoes and eats them with the camera. That made me cry when I was a child. <br /> <br /> This made me cry like an adult because here I'm wasting my time trying to be some kind of critic or writer or writer / critic and these guys get to have fun, actually make an epic sci-fi movie with a lot of cool colored lights, a sexy girl and a talking slide projector called KAL. One of the flight crew members even carries his black space baseball cap back and frustrates with his goatee like that Metallica clown. Is this supposed to be a joke? No. It is an epic statement about humanity, humanity and for humanity, which deserves to be seen by anyone who has the ability to take nothing seriously. Look for it in a 2-disc package called GALAXY OF TERROR in the trimmed DVD containers of your favorite discount retailer, which is probably where it belongs, but how many of us can say "Yes, they have a couple of sets of our movies for sale. at Best Buy. " <br /> <br /> 4/10: Anyone who does not have a sense of humor will want to try SILENT RUNNING or maybe TRON. But someday, an extraterrestrial civilization on the other side of the galaxy will intercept the transmission of this movie and decide that we should not get into the trap. Good work, guys!
