How unfortunate, but also fortunate, that two films about fundraising (The Cave and The Descent) should arrive almost at the same time. Unfortunately for The Descent, its launch in the United Kingdom on July 7 coincided with the same day of the terrorist atrocity of the London subway / subway, which killed almost 60 people and injured hundreds, which is not a good night. Special weekend to visit the cinema, especially to watch a scary movie like Sheesh about sympathetic women who are trapped in a deep and dark system of claustrophobic underground caving. The two films have practically the same elements: a half dozen characters, lost in a speleology system not previously explored, without anyone being aware that they are trapped there. A lot of water, caverns, danger ... then, ultimately, some vicious creatures of human kind or derived from humans determined to take advantage of them. Where the two are so different is that The Cave is an unreal fantasy adventure, totally incredible, more Alien-esquire than horror or drama. The British film, comparatively minuscule and budgeted (filmed in the south of England but set in the Appalachians) is terrifying of five pairs of pants, a touching commotion that causes people to get out of the projections at the beginning of the commotion. Call attention to girls in any previous order. You really have no idea what to expect next, surely not to her! The Descent is also illuminated in a naturalistic way, which makes it even more terrifying, unlike the cave that lights up in a way that resembles a gigantic and magical Christmas Santa Claus grotto, with a room the size of a cathedral dazzling in a gloriously blue light of ... who knows where while the speleologists' torches are used exclusively to artistically illuminate granite jaw heroes (each one more puppet-like than any other Team America / Gerry creation) Anderson / Thunderbirds). They also take fantastic amounts of equipment, however, despite this, the incredibly deep actors clearly forgot to accumulate any feeling of imminent danger, drama or anything worthy of a horror movie, is strictly classified as PG. And in this case, the actors are located exactly in the order in which everyone expects me: I quickly wrote a list after they introduced me to each character, which makes Piper Perabo out of sequence. The Cueva script is totally numeric, unlike Shakespeare, a room full of chimpanzees would eventually write it in less than a week ... Take a typical exchange between the black and white tracks of the "good friend" that appear; "How many times have we been in this situation before it springs up?" - "Too many" (answers Morris Chesnut). I swear, you could hear my suburban London audience gasp at the obvious. The most terrifying thing about The Cave is that in the end there is a clear opening for 'the sequel' - 'The Cave 2: Overground' or whatever. Be scared, be very afraid ... Or instead, capture The Descent and be afraid of truth, a lot, a lot of fear. RR
