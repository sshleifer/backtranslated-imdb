I am completely amazed at the overrated "Cemetery Man" among horror fans! Now, I usually like movies that combine two or more types of genre styles in one and I love almost every zombie comedy I've seen. To my dismay, this Italian cult classic did not really show me much to be too excited about ... Follow the unusual duties of a full-time cemetery caretaker and his retarded, man-child, Curly Joe Looking at the attendees, They seem to get rid of the newly deceased who jumped off the ground seven days after their initial death. He meets a widow who "impresses" her with a spooky tomb environment and develops a quick romance, and then has sex with her at the grave of her late husband. The husband's body springs alive and bites her, provoking a series of events that seem to consume the rest of the film. "The man in the cemetery" tries to incorporate all the elements he can, such as horror, romance, comedy, action, and fails completely in the long term. Go ahead, you can never concentrate on any aspect long enough to make it interesting for the viewer, like the relationship of the lazy partner with a severed head, a motorcycle that rides a zombie that comes out of the earth, the main character decides to shoot. random people on the sidewalk, etc. This is so complicated and boring that it is almost impossible to take it seriously. Sure, it's elegant and often "elegant", but even the most "artistic" films need the right kind of lineage to make sense. The "graveyard man" moves forward heavily, and seems unable to concentrate on anything for more than a few minutes, which becomes very exhausting after a while. People argue that "it's a more sophisticated zombie movie." Frankly, when it comes to zombies, I do not want anything more "sophisticated" than Romero ... There is a bit of gore and nudity, mainly in the scenes in which he wants to play "horror movie", but not enough. to compensate for its lack of structure without compromises. Terrible movie
