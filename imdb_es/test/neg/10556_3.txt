As a fan of C.J.'s previous film, Latter Days, I really wanted to like this movie. <br /> <br /> The best I can say, however, is that it is NOT a horrible movie. There are some good performances, and some funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has a couple of great scenes in which she is talking to her boyfriend's ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> In general, however, it is a good week. The script resorts to rare coincidences and clich√© movie moments too often. (The main character went to Stanford on a golf scholarship, and does his high school classmate not even know he plays?) <br /> <br /> Most of the time, this movie had no idea where it was . Going or what he was trying to say. There are many scenes that are slightly cute, but in the end they turn out to be a waste of time. And I could easily cut half of the characters in the movie without losing anything. <br /> <br /> Even so, despite all its faults, I must say that this is one of the best gay movies of recent years. Which says a lot about how bad most gay movies are. <br /> <br /> I hope that the next film by C.J. be better.
