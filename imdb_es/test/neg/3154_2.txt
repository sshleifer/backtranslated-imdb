Okay, when I was little (and I mean 2 or 3, not 6 and 7), Barney was one of my favorite shows. Then I grew up and threw away all my old Barney tapes. So one day, while I flip through the channels, I see that Barney now takes place in a caboose, and I thought, "Hey, is this the right program?" Once I realized what it was, I got scared. Why did they change the configuration of a school program to a CABOOSE? Since then, the show has been absolutely terrible, and the only reason I give it a 2 is a) because I'm good, b) because of Riff, and c) because in the old days the show was tolerable. Now I just hate it. I hate it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
