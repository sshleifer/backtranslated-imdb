Well, I thought the movie was 1/10 blah. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part is the first 5 minutes of the movie with the nerd girlfriend or whatever, this is the part you care for Tho she had great hooters, I thought it was really a random actor? Heck no, it was not really a model by the name of Larissa McComas but you already knew <br /> <br /> So, that made sense, but that was all the rest of the movie (which I saw anyway) I did not care 4, and I did not bother to see the rest. That's <br /> <br /> everything I needed for C to be satisfied, so 2 those of you who only care about that good, there you will enjoy
