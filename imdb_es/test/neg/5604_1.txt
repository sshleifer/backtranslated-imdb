What production, what waster of screen time and money. This is what some of the so-called European producers think of a science fiction movie. Take the former model, Alexandra Kamp, accompany a first-class American actor and get the most famous film producer Harry A. Towers. Torres then finds some dark products based in Munich. house, Tandem communication, Rola Bauer, and then mix it all without any kind of script and you will get "Sumuru", an invaluable jewel among the worst movies ever made! Get people alive and do something else, whatever you do, not movies, please! To make matters worse, the producers went to South Africa to film, what you see on the screen is a gigantic sand hole, where the "action" takes place, between extremely bad actors and extremely bad fx that any film student would do better.
