I love movies ... and I rarely see a movie that I hate ... but this was the worst movie I've seen, or at least close to it. Any movie that ends with a rape scene is horrible. Without a doubt ... I can not believe that I lost 2 hours of my life watching this movie. I am really angry, I want to recover my money and my time back. HORRIBLE! Do not go to see it, the cinematography is horrible, the plot is horrible, the end is horrible. I did not know what was going on during the middle of the movie because I could not see it (and I was watching it on a very nice big television). The saw for rent, the hills have eyes or a house of wax ... any of those are better if you want something terrifying.
