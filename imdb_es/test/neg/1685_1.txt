Let's face it here. This is one of the worst shows I've seen. My Wife and Kids was really promising in its first season and only came down the hill after that. It's so bad that words do not describe. The acting and writing are so terrible on a constant basis that I wonder if Damon Wayans was producing such a heinous show on purpose. From top to bottom every performance is ridiculous. Damon Wayans calls him completely and George Gore II is so horrible that I shudder in every exaggerated line. Can anyone really watch this program and find it entertaining and much less fun? Please I beg. Do not see this show. As soon as the TV affiliates stop collecting this in syndication, we can finally get rid of this absolute garbage.
