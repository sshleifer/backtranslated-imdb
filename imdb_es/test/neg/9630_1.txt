There are no saving graces in this fearsome, scenic and boring snooze-fest feast, which reminds us of "The rescue of the red chief"! <br /> <br /> Although there are some great stars in this movie, the acting is almost uniformly terrible. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, normally a kind of relaxed man, represses him with a forced emotion. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed is so exaggerated that it's laughable. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielson is terribly bad and it's terrible. <br /> <br /> The son is such a repulsive brat, I found myself encouraging the kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The only decent performance in this mix is ​​the relatively minor role of the butler. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm being too hard on the actors, after all, all they did was read the lines they were given in the script. Ah, the script, that turgid piece of artificial dreck that you'd like to pull on the strings of your heart but it just churns your stomach.
