The 'Olorable Kitty' by Chuck Jones is the cartoon that presented Pepe Le Pew to the world. There are some key differences between the Pepe we know and love (or hate, in the case of some people) and the character of this caricature. On the one hand, the cat in disguise that Pepe pursues lovingly in 'Kitty Olorable' is clearly masculine. In addition, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the climax of the caricature, and his French accent fades when his wife and family appear. Pepe is not even the main character here, the approach that favors the cat that disguises itself as a skunk to scare its enemies. For the most part, the story largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew caricature, but Pepe's aggressive courtship lacks the jokes and direct addresses of the cameras that make him a great character. Nor is he as handsome as he would become and rather uncomfortably animated. In fact, 'Olorable Kitty' is a caricature of quite ugly and clumsy in every way. Its main source of appeal comes from its original concept at this stage before it became the template for all the Pepe Le Pew cartoons that followed. This further development has robbed 'Kitty-able Smell' of any impact and for modern viewers it just seems like a rather boring Pepe Le Pew with a strange and surprising ending. When I was a kid, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risky humor, I love the character and most of his cartoons. 'Kitty Olorable' makes me feel like a child again!
