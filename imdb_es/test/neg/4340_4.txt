The only thing in "Sudden Death" that exceeds the amount of continuous action is the incredible number of holes in the plot. With that, and the large amount of gadgets, one could hardly call what remains a story. To say that the script taken from the premise "Die Hard" would be the most brazen underestimation of the world! <br /> <br /> Here we have a problem hero working on the huge ice rink covered in Pittsburgh like a fire Marshall. On the night of the seventh game of the final series, he receives tickets to be able to invite his separated children to the decisive game and, of course, spend a little time with them. Also catching the game, but for political reasons, is the Vice President of the United States (Raymond J. Barry). When a group of incredibly well-organized mercenaries capture the vice president's box and demand hundreds of millions in government money, our hero Darren McCord has his plans more than mildly offended. <br /> <br /> Whenever a new one of these films of formulas are made, it seems that all that prevented us innovation are the most unpleasant bad and the increasingly spectacular and frightening ways in which the good ones fall apart of them. Director Hyams and his screenwriter have overlooked (not that this is an original sin) in trying to make us detest the evil terrorists. The horrible villains are dedicated to shooting the secret service, security and civilians (old and young) with gay abandonment and with scant regard for the relative threat of each victim. <br /> <br /> Van Damme engages in an abundance of fists and weapon games, heroics and tricks that defy death. The script asks little to the muscular European. Almost everyone else has walk-ons other than Powers Boothe, who seriously overrides his less profound role than the most cruel and petty of all that ever existed. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of intelligent cinematography, and enough Special Explosive f / x to keep someone awake. But in reality, that's all this action movie has, the action. Although there are some ingenious sequences, nothing could be called scandalously brilliant. <br /> <br /> Saturday, February 10, 1996 - Greater Union Melbourne
