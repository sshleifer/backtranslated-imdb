I can not think of anything, I repeat, NOTHING positive about this "Movie"! The whole movie of 1 hour and 45 minutes could be reduced in a short film of 5 minutes! In most of the scenes, there is absolutely nothing to do and it seems that the camera was recorded on purpose, just to increase the time of the movie! All you see is someone in the background walking or watching TV without a specific topic or even talking about anything! I just feel like I've lost 105 minutes of my weekend, my family's and my friends' for nothing! If a movie is wrong or the stage is not good, it's another story, at least it leaves you something to talk about, but about DISTANT, I just have to call it "Film" because it was a movie recorded by a camera. . <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, imagine a 105-minute film based on two or three story lines! With what will you end? 5% content and 95% fillings! This is exactly how "Distant" was at least for us! The actors did a great job playing roles that were not special, they barely spoke or showed special emotions! I picked up this movie in the comedy section of a store, relying on what I read on the back of its cover. I still wonder what was funny was not our face after watching the movie.
