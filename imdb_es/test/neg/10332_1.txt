I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title of the job. It only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is really a stench! The only thing that I enjoyed was laughing at the technical flaws (for example, the audio of "car sounds" in the background simply disappears during the scene with Danny and Dog in Dog's car). The production shows a total lack of imagination (example: the fire of the machine guns in slow motion is repeated many times). Sandra Bullock plays essentially a small part, completely unnecessary for the plot. To say that this movie really has a plot is to do more writing justice than it deserves. The old hardware of the computer is interesting. This film was released in 1982 (not in 1987 as indicated by the IMDb database) and then the current "high technology" was an amber screen on a 4.8 MHz IBM PC with floppy disks. Maybe the PC was the real star of the movie ... at least it was interesting. <br /> <br /> We got this on DVD for a couple of dollars in the bargain bin at WalMart. As the other critic points out, we pay too much!
