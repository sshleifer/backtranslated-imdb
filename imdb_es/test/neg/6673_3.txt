Czech cinematography is traveling in dark times ... this film is tangible evidence. Slama obviously wanted to make a mediocre documentary about fictional people, characteristic of his stupidity. A young and healthy child who does not want to work and prefers to live in a rotting hut with an irresponsible alcoholic aunt. Due to the idiocy of Tonik, who is able to announce "Dad, I will not work in the factory" (I would really like to know WHY); I understand the condition of your "home", but I really am not able to digest the horrible disaster. Narrow sentimentalism everywhere. Why did not Monika accompany her son to work abroad? Young Czech couples do it very often. And take the children of another person to live in a devastated barn ... that's too much. <br /> <br /> Irresponsible mother (badly acted by Geislerov√°), naive and stupid child (Tonik), silly and confused girl (Monika) ... Yes, someone already said it: a misdirected and acted soap opera. Actors such as Martin Huba, Bolek Polivka, Tatiana Wilhelmova and Simona Stasova did everything possible, but unfortunately could not save the whole piece.
