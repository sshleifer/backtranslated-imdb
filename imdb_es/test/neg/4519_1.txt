This is absolutely nothing like the WWF and the 'Age of Attitude' of the WWF. I have always been a dedicated WWF fan and have never taken a look at their competition. Now, I regret the day I wanted WWF to take over. At the very least, the WCW would try something new and radical all the time instead of keeping up to date as a mask of the real intentions of the show and this is also true for the ECW. The WWF has always been about Hulk Hogan, Andre The Giant and other ancient fighters, and the 'Age of Attitude' only managed to achieve the radical ideas of competition. The WWE is the same trash that was before the Age of Attitude, which just fainted and demoralized. The fighters are terrible, the division of the brand is a mental struggle, and the lines of history and stipulations are nonexistent. The WWE is so bad that it ceases to be an ancient shell of itself by pushing the characters and fighters to the main event suddenly and by retaining the barriers of creativity. Of course, the program shakes the brains of sweet, innocent and easy-to-brain children and poor, lousy, outcast and stupid people in the Internet wrestling community who really consider the company a good thing. Anyone who even shudders and thinks that this program and this product are good can go to hell.
