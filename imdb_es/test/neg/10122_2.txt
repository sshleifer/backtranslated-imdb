This is possibly the worst of the great Ava Gardner films. Yes, she is beautiful. But that can wear down over time, especially after the end of the movie is corny and predictable. <br /> <br /> In this turkey, Robert Walker has to pretend he is Eddie Bracken (which probably embarrassed him). Olga San Juan plays the part of Jane Powell (golly, gee). Dick Haymes plays a kind of scary companion (!), And Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and a lot of other female comedians). Yes, the film contains an important popular song, "Speak Low". But take a look at the other pieces, totally forgettable. Dick Haymes sings very well, of course, and so does the un-accredited vocalist's dubbing for Ava. <br /> <br /> The sets are cheap, the script is full of clich√©s and failed humor, and Tom Conway seems like has struggling with liquor (as he was). In short, if you want to see Ava at her best, buy a photo and stay away from this movie.
