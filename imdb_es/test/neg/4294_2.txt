"The Yoke's on Me" is, without a doubt, the most controversial film of the 23 years of shorts by The Stooges. The reason is understandable; By today's standards, this film can be considered racist. For this reason, it is rarely shown, if ever, on television. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that, for the record, the Japanese who were seen in the film were not soldiers; They were Japanese-Americans sent to a relocation center during World War II. They were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this movie. According to all reports, including the US government. UU., Which apologized and noted in the 1980s, the Japanese-Americans during World War II were as loyal and hard-working as any American. His imprisonment during this time is a dark stain in American history. <br /> <br /> There are some Stooge laughs in this movie, but memories of how Japanese-Americans were treated during this time messed up the value of entertainment. Let's not confuse the loyal Japanese-Americans with their representation in this film as evildoers. The loyal Japanese-Americans and the evil empire of Japan of the Second World War are not synonymous. 2 out of 10
