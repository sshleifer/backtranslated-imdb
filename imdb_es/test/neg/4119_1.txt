I can not remember the last time a movie was so boring that I went out. Both Weatherman and The Island were so bad that I thought about it but I even stayed until the end in those. This movie was incomprehensible, not funny and it went on and on and on. Like other commentators, I wondered if the parts were just French humor that I did not understand or if the characters were serious. Finally I gave up and tried to nap because I did not want to bother my husband if he was enjoying it, but he noticed and told me it was okay if I wanted to leave and go out the door. He would like to know how it ended ... if Denevue lived or died, etc ... (I do not even care).
