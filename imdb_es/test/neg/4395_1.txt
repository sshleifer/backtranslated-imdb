Movie without value. A complete waste of time and nothing I expected it to be. The packaging makes it look like it's from the American Pie genre (it's not). rather, it's a ridiculous set of coincidences that makes the movie look more like a writing exercise (try to see how many confusions we can write to turn what should have been a bad SNL into a complete presentation). What is surprising is that the directors (based on their comments on the DVD) take themselves completely seriously. I've been a big fan of the movies that National Lampoon lends its name to, including Van Wilder. With this, I feel completely cheated. In fact, I feel sorry. I expected a farce like Van Wilder's to revive my college days, but instead I was served an hour and a half of trash. What led me to my last unsatisfied expectations? Well, to begin with, the fact that the entire cast appears naked (with a huge sausage that covers what needs to be covered) on the DVD COVER. Add to that the images on the back of the case, as well as the description and trick people into thinking that this is a movie that is not. To make matters worse, the movie begins as one might expect too with half-naked drunken college students trying to do a photographic trick, but ultimately this has nothing to do with the movie. In fact, I did not even realize that the people in that opening sequence were the characters in the movie until the directors told me in the comment. Do not get me wrong, I love the twists of the plot and I'm surprised by the movies, but I hate the fact that this movie tries to become something it is not. Ultimately, he does a great deal of damage to himself (artistically, although it is most likely not financially) because he creates confusion and disappointment for his audience simply because he neglects to deliver what he announces. <br /> <br /> In summary, do not rent this movie according to what you see in the case. It is not your usual National Lampoon movie. The only fun is the fact that many of the actors have appeared in other movies and TV shows that make their participation here entertaining.
