The movie starts with his smartest joke, and it goes downhill from there (pun). After that there is a lot of humor and sexual situations. The beautiful women were the best part of the movie. Jubilant word games are not for central idea jokes, but they try here. The battle between the two groups in the local city (rich and poor) is an old and tried-and-true configuration, so how could it go wrong? Well, there is no reason to envy the "riches" or any reason to feel sorry for the miseries, so we can forget the central plot. Situational humor is everything to go to the bathroom or sexual directed to teenagers, but it only produces giggles, there is no real laughter. <br /> <br /> The only thing that rescues comedy for this film is character humor, with the blind. providing some repeated configurations, but rarely used, and the owner of the black bar provides the mood of "street" or "hood". <br /> <br /> Okay, forget about the jokes, there have to be some snowboard shots since it was a commercial company. Unfortunately, there were only 4 seconds of background action that could be inspiring. The rest were all "B" grade tricks or worse. The big moment, where the main character rides "the goat", a ski race to kill men, provided a shot in which a small avalanche ate the double. This was the best approach in this movie. Any snowboard fan will be disappointed with the quality of the stunts in the movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technical aspects of the film, the soundtrack was average, which is surprising, since those snowboard documentaries are regularly filled with quality songs. Many editing errors can be detected and, although it was filmed on a ski mountain, most "landscape" shots did not convey any sense of the actual size. <br /> <br /> In general, it would be worth it to see if you have managed to completely turn off your brain and you like silicone breasts. Even then, you will not remember any of this two days later. <br /> <br /> The snowboard is still waiting for it to be a definitive comedy, you would do better to see a snowboard documentary in complete safety.
