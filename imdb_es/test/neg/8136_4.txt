Of course I have disappeared in the cinema. The Neil Young concert film 'Golden Heart'. <br /> <br /> There have been many great concert films over the years. The best thing is "The Last Waltz" by Martin Scorsese, who filmed the last concert of the band in Filmore West. A phenomenal concert and a phenomenal movie, that is, if you like rock and roll and you feel as if you were born in it and you were part of the music, and you could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone will show you the chords and that, with a few chords and a letter or two, you could change the world ... as you can suppose, I felt the five in the depths of my soul of twenty-four years. <br /> <br /> Neil Young was in 'The Last Waltz'. They had to digitally, before they did it digitally, they had to manually scrape a large rock of cocaine that came out of their nose, so in the movie there is a bright light that is not the star of Bethlehem that hangs on his lip and underneath. his nose ... He's a little famous in the history of rock and roll. <br /> <br /> But 'The Last Waltz' was made when the band and Neil and everyone else were in their mid-thirties and 'Heart of Gold' was filmed last year when Neil is in his sixties and his band it seems as if they are in the late nineties and the whole movie could be used visually by Christian Right and the DEA in the same way as the Ohio State Patrol films about the dangers of drunken driving when I was in the high school showing dead teens Front windows or hanging from trees or bloody in a ditch. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes and it's a fantastic concert, open them and look at the hidden portrait of Dorian Gray. For example, the once ethically beautiful Emmylou Harris came out of the darkness literally to sing with Neil and from darkness to light, which seemed to be a spectrum of rings that emerged from the river in front of Rivendale. Ghostly, like a ghost, a nose that does not appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery, eyes that make the buttons on the dolls look real, and the ability to express any emotion, human or not, limited by the indulgence without restrictions in Botox. . My mind wobbled ... porcupine ... Peru ... Jack Daniels ... living hard for decades ... My God ... the sweet Emmylou Harris, whom I saw singing for free at Fred's in Boulder, a face 2000 years dead Pharaoh would not accept. But the voice, as pure as a bottle of thick lips of Boulder beer brewed from the waters of Boulder Creek and I closed my eyes and smelled ammmmmbbbererrrrrrrrrrrrrrrssss (a tribute ... one must use homage at least once in any review cinematographic ... Fred's burgers at Boulder Mall and Steve Martin's movie Pink Panther). <br /> <br /> It would have been a great concert sitting in the dark in the Ryman auditorium, maybe twenty rows back. But, close up, in close-ups, it was a work of medieval morality that showed the horrors of indulgence and the consequences of a sinful life. <br /> <br /> The theme of the concert, adorned with the landscape, A Prairie Wind ... the last song, guitars en masse (I counted eight) and I wondered if the irony was at stake. I do not think so. A Native American bassist, a lead guitarist who looked and dressed like Buffalo Bill, a pianist whose face resembled that of the screamer in Munch's The Scream, the chick singers (actually matronal singers, who mostly remember one of United's lost youth). the stewardesses who still sail in the friendly skies) dressed in full-length matching denim dresses ... did not play directly. <br /> <br /> None of them had seen, I would bet, A Mighty Wind. <br /> <br /> It will be a great CD, and I would gladly tell tales of Hippy Dippy Boulder when Neil was a Canadian long-haired singer whose indecipherable lyrics seemed to reflect pain and loss, feelings as universal as now. . <br /> <br /> But, only in a dark bar.
