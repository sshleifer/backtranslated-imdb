While babysitting in an isolated house in Colorado, a teenager is terrorized by an elusive murderer on the phone. <br /> <br /> The remake of the semiclassical horror film of 1979 basically takes the first 20 minutes of the original film and extends. It adjusts to a time lapse of 87 minutes! So it goes without saying that the plot of this remake is quite thin. There is little originality or interest in this movie. There is a lot of Camilla Belle wondering around a dark house wondering who is calling her and finding all sorts of false scares. Everything becomes repetitive and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to gather much in the form of suspense or chills. Certainly, it never reaches the intensity of the original film, especially because it weakens and changes an important plot point of the original. I guess we have to thank you for the PG-13 rating. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there is an impressive stage design and some dark atmosphere, unfortunately there is not much to do to prevent this new version from being sub-par. Belle's performance is also quite mediocre. <br /> <br /> It's just another unimpressive remake. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
