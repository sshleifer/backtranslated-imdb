I've seen this movie twice, once a few years ago in college, and again last weekend. Although I despised her completely the first time, I decided to give her another chance. Terrence Malick is clearly a highly respected director, and it seems that the IMDb viewers, at least, consider the film very well. But, unfortunately, it seems that my tastes have not changed at all. <br /> <br /> Where to start? On the one hand, the narration of Linda Manz is horrible. His voice is so irritating with that horrendous New York accent (please do not try to convince me that Chicagoans speak that way, they do not). She admitted that she just sat and talked about random things, which does not make her a talented actress. She is not even acting! I arrived at IMDb hoping to see her shattered, since her performance is absolutely ridiculous, but people seem to like it! She simply is not attractive in every way, I expected Malick to just kill her. <br /> <br /> The other actors were fine, but they certainly were nothing special. Adams was probably the strongest in the cast, but he also had the only decent part. Except the old one, it was pretty good. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, how could the character of Shepard be so ridiculously stupid? He bought the act of "brother and sister" because ... uh, why would he buy that? Bill and Abby took every opportunity to be sensitive, as if they did not realize that their lives depended on acting in a very platonic way. It was completely incredible. And finally, after a considerable time, the farmer suddenly realizes that "My God, they are together!" He then pursues Bill with a gun, but instead seems to stumble on Bill's hand and ends up with a deadly wound. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, the fate of the characters was equally stupid (and dared I say, lazy). Of course, Bill has to die. Could it be more boring than being shot in a pond by a pack of policemen? Abby continues her happy life, gets on a train and feels really happy with how things worked. And the annoying narrator finds his friend at random and they wander towards sunset. But it's okay, because Malick never gave me any reason to worry about the characters anyway. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, this film goes on endlessly without turns or real developments. I can not believe that they only last 94 minutes, I could have sworn I was sitting in my seat for 3 hours straight. The sudden disaster of the locust was like throwing the Bible in my face; I'm totally fine with metaphors and allusions, but this was completely exaggerated. Clearly the message was: "Do not get married for money or bad things will happen to you". Very original. <br /> <br /> I understand that "Days of Heaven", like all of Terrence Malick's films, is destined to be a work of art. And I agree that the cinematography is simply stunning, and the shots of the magic hour give the film a unique aura. But I need more than good photos to enjoy a movie, and this simply did not do it for me.
