This revision contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> I was looking at the horror movie DVDs on Amazon when I found Flight Of The Living Dead. I already knew by the name that it was going to be abominable and probably a Snake On A Plane scam, but it sold completely at 69p, so I thought I really did not have much to lose. <Br /> <br /> The music played in the opening credits did not fit at all, although I liked the song itself, a pop-rock song is not really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a movie of zombie terror. It started surprisingly well, the initial scenes were not so bad, some of the performances were a bit cruel but not as bad as I initially thought they would be. <br /> <br /> Everything is going well until Laura Cayouette (Rocket from Kill Bill: Vol. 2) enters the picture. She is supposed to be playing a scientist. If she is, she is not very bright. Luckily, it was polished pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> Actually, I laughed out loud when the camera scanned the passengers of the plane during some turbulence. There was a nun. Have you ever been on a plane with a nun? I was surprised he was not holding a crucifix. <br /> <br /> Finally, after 35 minutes, we come to the action of the zombies and use the word "action" lightly. The special effects are quite below the standard, but that is what is expected from a movie with this budget. Being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses does not make you look like a zombie, but it makes you look pretty funny. Using slow motion does not work particularly well either. I think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too much history. Trying to pass the problem as a variant of the "malaria virus" was not an especially good move since considering malaria is not a virus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie unfolds like any other. Another zombie movie Most of the characters are killed and eventually ends with a handful of people struggling to stay alive. Possibly the worst part of Flight Of The Living Dead is the absolutely inconceivable ending. I know it's a movie about people who come back to life and revel in life, but the ending was just ridiculous. Rating: ★★
