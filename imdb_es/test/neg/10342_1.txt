Far from combining the best pieces of Pontypool and 28 days this managed to ignore them. While copying them blatantly. (If that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and got more and more tense, this just sucks. Radio DJ, "we must remain in the air", does not spend time in the air. He sits on his bottom and watches television for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie. Is there a single person in the United States or in the world who does not know what a zombie is? Or have you ever heard of the word "zombie"? Well, by minute 50, this group of misfits is still calling the zombies, "the infected ones" or those who have "rabies". The word "Zombie" may appear as a guest later, I do not care much. Maybe there is a copyright. Where do you have to pay to use certain words? As the Bluetooth headset is called "the ear" I'm not kidding! To finish, without plot + without acting = nobody cares. A waste of time, a shame, bad execution scam.
