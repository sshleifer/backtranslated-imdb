Okay, I do not want to upset anyone who has enjoyed this movie, but it was a really bad movie. The way the scenes and the performance were edited, made me tremble in some points. I really tried to enjoy it, but it was like a student movie, they should have had the smallest budget. I really liked the story line to some extent and the characters were nice, but the movie in general was horrible. Also, why is it that in almost all movies with lesbian characters one of them has to commit suicide or die or straighten up?!?! This is so sending a wrong and unrealistic message. I give it 3 stars and everything I think I think was very kind of me. Just watch this movie if you want to laugh at how bad it is.
