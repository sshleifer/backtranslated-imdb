Fortunately, you do not need a lot of "book learning" to understand where this is going ... Obviously, a line of poverty takes on the great success of Universal, THE WOLF MAN (which was made only a year before), this always finds The observant George Zucco in another of his patented "mad doctors" plays the role of brilliant and vengeful scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who has settled in the depths of the swamps of what I presume is the Louisiana swamp, is planning revenge on four of his former colleagues who humiliated him and forced him to give up his previous job. You see, they mocked their claims of being able to mix man and beast to create an unstoppable army of werewolf creatures that would be useful during wartime. Fortunately, Cameron has found the ideal test subject for his wolf blood injections: a great kid-like wit called Petro (Glenn Strange). Petro has no idea what's going on, does not ask too many questions and allows the doctor to tie him to a table and shoot him with whatever is in his syringe. This results in a time lapse change for the man who becomes a werewolf. Cameron lets him out of the mansion using a secret passage, so basically you get a big guy (Strange was 6'5 ") dressed in a monkey with a thick beard, hairy legs and a set of large plastic teeth, Running around the forest most of the time, after an eyewitness sees the beast and kills a girl, the locals grab their rifles and organize a gang to hunt her in. Dr. Cameron, who can control the beast with A whip and also has a useful antidote to reverse the effect, it also drags Petro into the big city to try to track the teachers who had mocked their original theories and destroyed their reputation in the process. from Cameron, Lenora (Anne Nagel), as well as Lenora's meddlesome boyfriend, Tom (Johnny Downs), whose first inclination is that they are dealing with a vertical prehistoric walking creature (!) <br /> <br /> Although it is a typically insensitive PRC film In many ways, with unimpressive sets, cinematography and m. Ake-ups, as well as a fairly smooth cast, remain visible thanks to the histrionics of the star George Zucco. I have no idea why Downs received the best turnover; He appears in half an hour and really does not have much to do, nor is it so impressive to do so. This is Zucco's program to the end and he's great ranting, talking to himself while fantasizing that he's talking to his teammates ("I'm not interested in your insulting imbeciles!") And slips temporarily in and out of sanity. Strange seems to have modeled his performance as the sympathetic and semi-retarded gossipy country around the entire work of Lon Chaney Jr., from his turn as Lenny in OF MICE AND MEN, to his performance as the aforementioned WOLF MAN. In any case, Strange and Zucco do a good job playing against each other. My favorite part is when Zucco calls him his "guinea pig" in front of a colleague, while Petro sits smiling and looking at a latch. Some of the swamp fog scenes are also quite atmospheric.
