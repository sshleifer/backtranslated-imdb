I think this movie can be called the badly directed film of anger. <br /> <br /> The characters of Joe and Bob were relics of the Second World War generation who did not understand their children very well who oppose war, drink drugs and listen to rock and roll. But I think his real anger was due to the fact that the United States began its long decline from the heights where the war left it. <br /> <br /> The "Joe" himself is a low-income Archie Bunker, ranting on all the things that made him angry, living his life of quiet despair, until he joins Compton, a guy who wants revenge of the hippies who ruined their daughter. <br /> <br /> Honestly, most of the movie. It seems silly, the characters are worse than one-dimensional, they are laughable. Peter Boyle was capable of better things.
