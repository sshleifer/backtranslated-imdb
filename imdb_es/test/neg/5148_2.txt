***** Spoiler Ahead ***** <br /> <br /> I guess you should not expect much from a movie made for television, but this one was especially bad, the plot was a good idea, but badly done, the performance was not especially good. And the end of the movie was just terrible. The main character was perfectly normal throughout the film, and then, suddenly, when we discovered that she was the murderer, he became a psychopath with mental problems. It is completely pathetic. <br /> <br /> There's only one reason to see this movie, Yasmin Bleeth, although have not we all seen it in a swimsuit before? Do not even bother to see this waste of time, if you want a movie about the contest of the beauty world and then see "Drop Dead Gorgeous" instead, it's just an infinite number of times better.
