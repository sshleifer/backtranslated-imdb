Was it an exercise in acting class at the university filmed and released as a movie? The formal posture and stylized style of a "horror" telenovela for people who do not like horror movies but wish to tell their friends that they did see a horror movie. It even includes soap opera music. <br /> <br /> Are you scared by the books that fall off the shelves in the library? Do the closing doors terrify you? Then this movie is for you. Have you ever been kidnapped? Yes, most of us have. When they raped you, was he simply ignored, because the rapist was the great kid? What is scary is not this film, but the vision of this filmmaker of the world. <br /> <br /> And then the little twists are not even original. This is a movie for people who have never seen a horror movie before, who do not want to watch one now, and who want to watch another movie about all those who conspire against the weird kid.
