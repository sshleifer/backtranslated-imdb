The launch (and the direction) in Undercurrent is more insipid than inspired by this black drunkard who from the beginning can not take off. The wood style of Robert Taylor poses an obstacle almost immediately for the very affected Kate Hepburn and from the beginning is a bad chemistry. <br /> <br /> The naive Ann Hamilton (Hepburn) falls in love with the handsome aircraft manufacturer Alan Garroway (Taylor) and hurries to the altar with him. She soon discovers that there are many things she does not know about him. As Alan becomes more remote, he delves into the murky past and Ann soon finds himself living a nightmare instead of the American dream. <br /> <br /> The undercurrent looks like some Hitchcock plans, but Vincent Minnelli quickly states that he is not a master suspense. Hepburn is not a shrinking violet and is a difficult sale for a character more suited to the reluctant styles of Teresa Wright or Joan Fontaine. Minnelli never gets Kate to defer desperately to Taylor's limited abilities as an actor. His attempts are presented as silent Gish, while Taylor's broad descent into madness faces the restricted Bela Lugosi. Robert Mitchum completes the miscasting as the sensitive brother. Talk about the accumulation. <br /> <br /> Director of photography Karl Freund offers some very stylized black interiors, but Minnelli and the cast use the atmosphere docilely and the tension remains lukewarm. With Minnelli away from her fort (the musicals) and the role of Hepburn's victim, she adapts to her like a bad suit.
