This fake documentary has flaws in many points, is badly done, has uninteresting characters, but the biggest problem I have with him is the basic premise. <br /> <br /> This movie uses the idea that H.P. Lovecraft has traveled to Italy and his work is based on real supernatural events he witnessed. I am willing to accept the idea that he traveled to Italy (only for suspending the unbelievers), but that part of his work is based on reality and that Insmouth exists is a complete nonsense. <br /> <br /> First of all, Lovecraft did not believe in the supernatural, in his letters he clearly states that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, his monsters there to show that humans were not so special after all. Another myth used in this film is that Lovecraft was an expert in occultism, he was not, all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sources. <br /> <br /> So we end up with a movie about people who look at each other a lot and when we finally see the monster, it's so bad that you can not even laugh at it, you just feel a pain in your love for the horror. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie Frankenstein Lovecraft said he felt sorry for Mary Shelley because he felt his work had been massacred. I'm sorry for Lovecraft.
