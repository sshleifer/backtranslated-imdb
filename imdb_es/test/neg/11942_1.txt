I remember years ago, Michael Douglas wanted his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, to be in a romantic movie because he felt that his wife had all the assets. No doubt she does it, but NOT in this movie. A colossal waste of time, without history, without character development, without chemistry, nothing. This was not the vehicle we all expected this movie to be, boring and a big disappointment. I did not even watch the whole movie, torture. Catherine Zeta-Jones, obviously, received training on how to work in the kitchen, move around, present a dish, but this was not the food network, nothing was learned here and once her counterpart appeared, supposedly a romantic interest, where she was the chemistry The poor vaga on the second floor of her building is trying to connect all the stratagems and there is no character development there. The loss of her sister was misinterpreted since she knew there was a closeness. The sister's daughter was dropped here and there with something that was supposed to attract you, NO. Just a waste of movie time. The promoters certainly did their job to put this lackluster movie on all the networks that tried it with all kinds of teasers. I'm sorry to say, do not spend a penny.
