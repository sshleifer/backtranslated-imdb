There were so many reasons why this movie could have been great. I will give you three. <br /> <br /> 1. Sienna Guillory. She is extremely good in this movie and it was the reason why I chose to see her in the first place. <br /> <br /> 2. Tim Curry. Incredibly bad guy and I'm always excited to see him in movies (even in Home Alone 2). <br /> <br /> 3. Jason Donovan. For all the Australians and poms out there, this is a rare gift. The ex-star of the Neighbors of the 80s had a throbbing heart and sold drugs. <br /> <br /> However, none of these things, nor the fact that the film is about the drug / rave culture, made this film even remotely interesting. The script was boring, normal performances and, despite the scenes with J.D and any scene with Sienna, I found that everything related to this movie is quite past. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
