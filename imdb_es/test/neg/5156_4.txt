This movie presents cockroaches as super carnivorous killers. This may have been the first movie in which cockroaches were the main killers, although not the first movie in which cockroaches are killers "Damnation Alley" presented a scene with killer cockroaches and "Creepshow" had a story that had them. In this they are the star. Not as good as this could have been, it does not have so many murders. However, I could be wrong at that point, because I have not seen it for quite some time. The cockroaches have become murderous and this strange researcher is in the city to study them. Yes, it's quite strange, since at one point he has his hand in a box about the killer cockroaches and it's like "They're biting my hand", and he says this almost in a state of ecstasy. There is also a super large cockroach near the end of this, as in many insect movies. It's not a great movie, but it's worth taking a look at one night when you get bored.
