Assault on Precinct 13 is the stupidest movie I've seen since Charlie's Angels 2. The shame lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ......................................... .................... I know you said that this movie is a remake of Rio Bravo, but did the writers of this movie really see Rio Bravo? Besides the fact that Rio Bravo is a western classic, the premise of the film was that the sheriff (John Wayne) had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being freed by his brother and his gang. Nobody wants to free anyone in Assault on Precinct 13. They want ALL dead. So, my first question should be: WHY NOT ONLY BURN ALL THE PLACE FROM THE START? Why "raid" the place at all? I know that the rotation of the artificial plot was supposed to be intelligent and shocking, but it did not make sense and / or it presented correctly. If the veteran cop was involved from the beginning, why the need for this whole movie? If the veteran cop made a sudden bargain in the back door during the siege, how did he get the chance? As soon as he appeared at the door, he would have been shot and would have had his entry point. It's all just FUBAR. <br /> <br /> What part of any city can there be a total war in a police precinct (complete with helicopters and massive explosions) but nobody notices? However, as soon as there is a fire, they have to "get out before the fire department appears" ?????? How did they plan to cover up the chaos that was happening outside? Does the police emit bullets in the walls, bullet casings, fingerprints, use of equipment and the fact that bodies of "bishop men" will not be found? What about those police snipers? How could they miss so often? I like the fact that when the two detainees tried to flee, the snipers were frustrated by two tiny mounds of snow. As if it were not possible to shoot a high-powered rifle through a pile of snow. <br /> <br /> The setup was interesting, though ridiculous, but the movie went off when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet in the head for NO REASON. I know that the creators of the film were in shock, but all they got was disgust at the cruelty and anger of the audience. Do not you think part of the reason why this is bombing at the box office is the fact that word of mouth makes everyone tell their friends and family to stay away from this? That particular scene has to be a big part of that word of mouth (that and the fact that each plot is more foolish than dirt). The conclusion remains stupid as the villain pauses to deliver a tirade of the type Austin Powers instead of killing the helpless people he has finally captured. I know several people have mentioned the final scenes that take place in the forests of the city of Detroit (> snicker <) but, why did Ethan's character just go to the forest in the first place? Do not even look to see if the SUV with the secretary and his friend run away? They only cut him off by prowling slowly in the woods, gun in hand. GACK I could go on, but I will not. All I can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all costs.
