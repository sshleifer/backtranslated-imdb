Egads <br /> <br /> I used to think that Keannu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood. I'm not so sure anymore, Willy gives Keannu a tough competition with his "I'm Made of Plaster" performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> Combine that with the fact that there is almost no argument, and not a single nice character, and it is quite difficult to recommend this turkey. <br /> <br /> Natasha does her best, but even Julia Roberts could not save this film from the darkness. <br /> <br /> Avoid it unless it's too late and there's nothing else. -Oh hell, in that case you just read a book.
