First of all, I would like to state, for the record, that it is incredibly foolish to call his film "Embryo" when the subject focuses exclusively on the scientific research carried out on fetuses (both animals and humans) from 12 to 16 weeks. The embryonic stage has ended at the end of the eighth week of pregnancy and, from that moment, the unborn child enters the fetal phase. Okay, honestly, I did not know all this, but I made the effort to look for it and that is the least that the creators of "Embryo" could have done. Do not worry I'm not stumbling over the details or overly bitter, as there are several more reasons to say why "Embryo" is a big failure. Real science can be considered boring and inaccessible, so Science Fiction is a film genre created especially to make science issues, otherwise tedious and yet more interesting and understandable to a wider audience. By representing ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong, or space missions that find evil aliens instead of light-years of emptiness, filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and, at the same time, teach useful trivia about The science. To make a good or at least half decent science fiction movie, writers and directors just have to follow a basic rule: DO NOT be boring! If they can not meet this unique condition, the viewer could read a theoretically accurate book. Something must have gone wrong during the production of Ralph Nelson's "Embryo". The basic premise is potentially fascinating and even enveloping, since we are all sensitive to saving the lives of unborn babies. There were also some very prominent names involved in the production, such as the main stars Rock Hudson ("Giant", "Seconds"), Diane Ladd ("Chinatown", "Alicia no longer lives here") and director Nelson was responsible for the acclaimed classics "Soldier Blue" and "Charly". So, what went wrong? Simple. The script is irremediably boring, cliché and everything seems incredibly silly because the laboratory setting and the scientific team are clearly too primitive to achieve medical advances. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson, in a very poor performance, plays a doctor who has not put any passion into his research since his wife died. When his car hits a pregnant bitch on a rainy night, his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the fetuses of dying animals. He manages to keep a fetus alive, dramatically accelerates his growth process and trains him to become an extremely intelligent dog. Because his procedure is so successful, Dr. Paul Holliston convinces his friend in the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide. However, the female subject continues to grow unexpectedly at an accelerated rate, and after only a couple of weeks is an adult woman, dazzling and super intelligent. The good doctor naturally falls in love with her, but the new and innovative growth treatment also starts to show horrible side effects ... Absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film, apart from a lot of mumbo-jumbo bit plausible and too melodramatic. and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog. That second half of the film contains a bit of action (grotesque) and suspense, but by then the stupidity of the dialogues and the improbable twists of the plot already ruined the fabulous idea of ​​science fiction. There are some really cool scenes, especially the chess match between Victoria and Roddy McDowall (in a highly memorable and ultra hateful supporting role). The grand finale is absurdly grotesque and, literally, on the verge of ridicule, and it almost seems that Ralph Nelson made that last disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thrillers and science fiction movies. The last sequence, including the horrible take of frozen images at the end, certainly does not fit the tone of the last 100 minutes of the movie. But anyway, my sincere admiration and respect for the dog and its trainers. An animal with such an intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better movie.
