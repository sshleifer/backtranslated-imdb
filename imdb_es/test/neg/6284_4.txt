There were only two reasons for me to watch this movie. First of all, Stellan Skarsgard and Marisa Tomei were there (they are good actors) and I had nothing better to do. However, while watching the movie, I immediately thought of something better to do: SLEEP! This movie is a complete waste of time. It's a standard ex-cop movie. The ex-copper is the best that ever was, but was fired. Keep doing things on your own to the annoyance of your old friends and save the day. All GREAT surprises (NO !!!). Go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try this one. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
