Jerry Lewis was slightly funny when he did not write his own material and had a good director like Frank Tashlin. When he began writing and directing his own films, the little talent he possessed was overshadowed by his egomania. Every time his films failed (and deservedly) in the US market (they made money in France), Lewis always blamed everyone and everything but himself; For example, he blamed the failure of this film on the fact that, according to Lewis, he debuted in a double bill with the porn function "Deep Throat". If someone should have complained about that situation, they should have been the producers of "Deep Throat". This is an absolutely idiotic "comedy" about the richest man in the world (Lewis), who is rejected for military service during World War II and decides to equip a special "squadron" to go to Germany and capture Hitler himself. In addition to the many faults that this film has (the script is incredibly funny, the "direction" of Lewis is non-existent, the movie has the appearance of a cheap homemade movie), Lewis apparently thought to surround himself with no talent, about the Hill Borscht Belt comedians like Jan Murray and Sidney Miller were a good idea; He must have thought that they would be so bad that they would make him look good. He had half a reason; They are shamefully bad, but he comes out worse than them. For a "comedy", the character of Lewis is sullen, angry and aggressive; the way he piles up the abuse of his subordinates makes you wonder why they would follow such an imbecile on a dangerous mission like trying to capture Hitler. The fact that this movie has raised money is amazing. It's by far the worst Jerry Lewis movie I've ever seen. I've heard that "Slapstick" is even more pathetic, but I can not see if that's true or not, and it should be avoided at All possible costs.
