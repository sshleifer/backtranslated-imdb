This movie could have been an impressive epic, but the creators seem to have done everything possible to make it seem silly. Even God himself is not spared in this film, since his words are full of childish jokes. The result is blasphemous and annoying. Only people who do not want to see a cheap parody in the biblical story can see this movie without shame. The creators of this insipid production must see 'Il Vangelo secondo Matteo' (The Gospel according to Mathew), a film by Pier Paolo Pasolini, which shows that it is not necessary to pervert the words of the Bible to make a good story. the most impressive result is obtained through a sincere representation of the plain text itself.
