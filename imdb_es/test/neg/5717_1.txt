Corny and some act very badly, but for a Golan-Globus film about equality. I saw this movie in 1985 mainly because I liked the swords and sorcery movies (what was I thinking?). Arnold is playing with a great lord trying to make sure that an old talisman is destroyed before it explodes to the world. Brigitte Nielsen is the main character that at that time was the girl of Sly and a pretty bad actress. Movie producers like to choose the Playboy Women who can not act in low budget films. Brigitte accompanies him while Sonya and Arnold act in wood as Lord Kalidor. There is also Sandahl Bergman (who was in the original Conan movie as Valeria) here she plays the evil Queen Gedren, an obvious field for her role as Conan. And then one of the most irritating child actors on the screen (ernie kings) like Prince Tarn, who should have been slapped and sent to bed. What an irritating scandal. Some of the sword fights are not very bad, but the music really sucks. The special effects are cheap and look very similar to the 70, like the explosion of the castle of the evil queen in the climax of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a very small-scale film, but moviegoers will like it for their enthusiasm.
