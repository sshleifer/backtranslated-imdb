*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: contains spoilers. I've seen some pretty bad movies in my time. And that's logical, since I see about 80 films a year. I should say that of those 80 movies that I see in the theater, maybe 5 are really good, 15 or 20 are not so good, 40 or 50 are good and then perhaps 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible. Here on Earth it falls into a category in itself. This is one of the most predictable, vehement and despicable movies I've seen in my life. It is loaded with unpleasant characters, various situations on special topics for after school and enough fluff here for THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS to look like American BEAUTY. And I'm not being unfair. This is a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a rich man, a poor girl, a poor boy and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all its inhabitants. Are you getting hot and confused yet? Let me continue. One day, the rich mucus comes walking to the city with his new graduation gift that his father bought him, and insults the pretty girl in the restaurant, almost fights with his boyfriend for a long time and then competes against him and destroys to the little one Dining room where he works. So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and his boyfriend have to arrange dinner together. What this does is give us many opportunities to see Chris Klein shirtless so we can understand why the restaurant girl would fall in love with him. He has abs !!! Oh, and he is rich! And ... he's the biggest jerk without respect for anyone. He is James Dean, he is a rebel who does not give a damn! He's rude to everyone in the city, he does not want to associate with anyone who tries to be nice to him and acts like a spoiled rich brat. But Leelee Sobieski still falls in love with him. There is no reason to explain why he does it, he just does it. Oh, forgive me, it's true. I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet as her. Well, if that does not get you wet, then I do not know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> Here on Earth also has some of the most predictable moments that I've had knowledge of in the movie. There was a moment when I left the theater to buy popcorn and read the graffiti on the wall of the bathroom, and I told my girlfriend exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes. Upon my return, she just laughed and said she was right, even when I said there was going to be a dance scene. And also, the disease that contracts suddenly is cancer. This is the most beautiful cancer patient I've seen in my life. Have you ever seen a cancer patient die slowly? They lose weight, lose their hair, their gums begin to rot. It is not a pretty image. Sobieski shines after getting cancer, as if she were pregnant. What an insult for people who have seen their loved ones die because of this disease. And how do you get knee cancer so you do not fall on the field? <br /> <br /> Now I realize that I have seen too many movies and this causes my cynicism to increase sometimes, but this is ridiculous. There was nothing I liked about this movie or Chris Klein's character. He is an imbecile, is unpleasant and never tries to make peace with those around him. Here On Earth is not just a bad movie, it's irresponsible. This received a 4.2 in the IMDb voting table, and that is too high. This is a shame for screen writers, and anyone who has given the green light to this fact should not only lose his job, but should have to promise never to put his foot down next to a script again. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, and that's being generous. This film should be shown in film schools as not writing and directing a film. <br /> <br /> If you are bored and really need something to do and your options are to clean a farm full of manure or watch this movie, choose cleaning cow manure. He will smell better and feel that he has done something good with his two hours.
