I like all the main actors involved in this rather strange movie. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving have shown themselves to be some of the best and most capable actors, but I could not get into this. I do not know if it's because I do not understand the lifestyle or what, but I could not understand this movie. The worst of all is that the actors made some of the ugliest dragon dragons I've seen in my life. I think that was part of the point, I do not know. I realize that it is probably an insult, but I do not know what to call them. I must say that I bought the boys as interpreters (the correct term?) But the story simply was not very good or very interesting. I will say that I do not usually appreciate costume designers very well, although I notice them when they are wrong or out of place, but this impressed me a lot. Very creative, at the very least, it's not attractive, but I do not think it's supposed to be. I do not know if I'm definitely not the target audience and I would never go to see a performance by this type of artists, but I would not go to see ballet or opera, so I do not know. If this is your kind of movie, then you probably like it, but if you do not skip it because it's ... well, not for most of us. I just verified that he won the Oscar for costume design and I will say it with reason. I must say that Ebert did not care much about this movie either, although he liked it better than me.
