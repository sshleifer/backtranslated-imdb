'Be With Me' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie. Just leave it running in the background. talk among yourselves and come back when you wish and at some point it will end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when I saw it alone, I felt like I almost saw the worst, longest, and most sentimental beer commercial in the world when I almost managed to keep my eyes open at the end of rolled credits and then managed ( just a) some more moments of vigil to witness a 'Thank you' to the sponsors of the film, which included Asia Pacific Breweries. Hahaha Methought: How amazing is * that *, given all the Tiger beer shots interspersed throughout this unforgettable fading of a movie? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the dialogue arises in depth between individuals with occasional stabs, but generally, nothing is said or witnessed of any particular advance in the general history of the film. It is as if one could disconnect at any time and return at any later time and really nothing would have been lost, which would have been an unmissable contingency, or part of its plot, in regard to the overall progression of the film. Therefore, the definitive "wallpaper film"! <br /> <br /> Well, I wonder ... What movie were the ones that positively reviewed this movie? I wonder and I keep asking ... Certainly, I could not have been so artistic to the point of Singapore's naive excuse to shoot a camera. Supposedly, 'Be With Me' is supposed to be woven around the themes of "love, tragedy and redemption". But all I witnessed was boredom, a half-baked script with a handful of text messages without words, and the only redemption was the one that occurred when this completely useless film ended. What a sad waste of time, it ended up being! It was also said that the characters in this film were fictitious, except Theresa Chan, who is a "remarkable woman who has triumphed over adversity ..." Well, without disrespecting Ms. Chan, but since she was a character So wonderful and incredible, why did the script have to involve the stories of other characters without the tenuous attempt to connect their lives? However, it still turned out to be an almost unbearably boring movie whose highlights included continuous credits. Instead of linking the destinies of all the characters, I really felt that the film ended up trying almost impossible and evidently fell among stools in regards to any participation of the viewer. <br /> <br /> In general, I am an art - Amateur to the movies of the house and usually does not oppose the slow pace (of which here there is no shortage, believe me!). I hate movies like 300, Transformers, Fight Club, but I consider, for example, Eric Rohmer as a great filmmaker. So I hope I put my criticism in some perspective. However, there was no redeemable feature in the conception and delivery of the entire film that could prevent the eyelids from falling slowly as each minute of "Be With Me" leaked. Watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time. Otherwise, your life would not be so rich for having lost it. 3/10
