Now do not get me wrong, I love seeing the half-naked chicks moving. It's part of the fun of a Moroccan restaurant: eat the belly dancers with your eyes. But not long ago a plot. <br /> <br /> My first big problem is music. I have the feeling that when Ann Rice wrote "The Vampire Lestat", The Cure was more the style of music that she would have liked (although I could be wrong). I know that in relation to current "gothic" music it might seem like a good idea, but they did a horrible job of incorporating it. Lestat was an actor with a pretty good singing voice. That they have chosen Jonathan Davis to be their stage voice is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Secondly, and someone else said it, combining two very complex books in a fucking movie is a bad idea. "Lestat" could have been a movie in its own right, and a very good one if done well. Honestly, I do not think "Queen of the Damned" lends itself very well to a movie. Although I would love to see a film that incorporates a creation story, there is too much, how to write this, "inaction" in the book to make it a very interesting film. And when retelling they messed up pretty badly. Now, look, I have not read it for a long time, I always thought that "Lestat", "Tale of the Body Thief" and "Memnoch the Devil" were much more action-packed and would have made better movies. <Br /> <br /> I know a lot of people (hey, I included) who likes a lot of crap from corny vampires who thought that this was absolutely the worst thing in the genre to be an important movie. I tend to agree with them there. Aaliyah had a good body however.
