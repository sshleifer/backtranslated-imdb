This was screened at Sundance last night to a receptive audience if mute. Clearly, the story is worth telling, it is powerful and true, but did the director have to interpret each role with a recognizable face? I mean, really, you spend your time saying "Oh, look, it's the kind of 'Armageddon'", or "Hey, it's Easy Rider!" and you lose sight of the story. Maybe it's the only way this guy could make his movie, but it's a bit annoying, something like "The love ship", or those old Towering Inferno movies, which were "block blocks with stars". I wish I just told the story with simply less famous faces. In addition, the work of the camera seems a little lazy, as if he had not thought where to place the camera to tell the story in the best way. In general, I thought it was fine, but it could have been really good
