Keep in mind that I only saw about the last half of this movie, so feel free to take my review with the grain of salt you consider appropriate, that being said, seeing what I saw was more than enough to convince me enough that a rating of stars for this is enough. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a sad killing of the wonderful precursor (NL Christmas Vacation) with Chevy Chase, it just does not have Chevy Chase, and it takes place on a generic tropical island, essentially without any connection to Christmas. <br /> <br /> Ol 'Chevy probably did not want to go in because the plot is that he lacks real fun, instead, they have the crazy cousin. Eddie, who, once again, was great in the original, but in this he is a bit exaggerated, and an extremely poor base for any film considering the plot and the acting. Humor attempts are generic to the point that even contemporary television comedy overcomes it, and considering that it is supposed to be comedy, I doubt I have to say more. <br /> <br /> This is not seen for its qualities, because it has none, but for its faults and, again, how Hollywood is shedding its blood of the past in the search for quick money. <br /> <br /> I think I'll see the original before. the next Christmas season just to try to recover the innocence of my childhood, of a lost time when the movies were more than high-budget trash, but meaningless.
