This movie is perfect for lovers of zombies with cheese. It's a movie you can laugh at, from the acting to the terrible action of zombies. Having said that, I gave this to 4 out of 10 for effort because horror is a difficult genre to do. Going through the list, the negative points of this movie were the following. <br /> <br /> #Malena composition # audible sound and sound effects # really bad continuity # cheesy dialogue # a song played through the whole movie #stein could not I do not act and, in my opinion, one of the worse than I've seen #Terrible end # racist time and theft of the character of Simpson called <br /> <br /> the good points # good disguise # police officers seemed to have the best performance in exp #the actors with less lines or small roles seemed to be better # good try with gore <br /> <br /> I do not want to speak badly about the movie, it's funny to see the seams of these negative points and I think that's what makes this movie okay. If it had been better, I do not think it would have made any difference, but it would not be interesting to see a new version with the same cast that I think may have improved in the last 7 years.
