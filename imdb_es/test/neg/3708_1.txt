It is a sin how these things are done, but we would not like to see the best "fictitious scene" ever filmed. Ahhh, the beauty of the low budget Bigfoot movies, you lean to see the beauty the more you look at them, that is if your brain does not melt first. As I said before, this one has the best fictitious scene! Words can not express it, you have to see it for yourself. Wonderful lines like "Smells like dean meat", "They're human ..." (You'll know this when you see it) The creature creates a Blah, Blah! The sound and the scene in which the baby is shot will make you cry (with laughter) you will be rewinding it. He has a car chase, snowmobile chase, a popular Bigfoot song, as well as a Disco song. It does not end there, while you see the credits that a friend noticed "Armario provided by K-Mart". Questions, how could you go as far as for the credits and then look at them? I could only explain this as a kind of shock to the brain, you are so mentally exhausted that you can not move and I also think you should know who was behind the disaster. Everything that is said, this is something you should see, especially if you want to punish yourself mentally. He is a guardian!
