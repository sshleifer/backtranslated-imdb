A couple from Chicago, Dillon and Dougherty, are falsely accused of killing their daughter. People begin to wonder if they did it. The police investigate and find suspicious evidence. The couple is defamed by the public and accused in the press. The police speculate that they are Satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter. They are accused and brought to trial. They are represented by lawyers who seek publicity and give them bad advice and bill them $ 100,000. The evidence presented against them is distorted or hidden by the police. There are fabricated indications of sexual abuse. His other son is removed from them and placed in a foster home. Dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed. Verdict, she did not do it but he did it. He goes to the slams with a sentence of 45 years. <br /> <br /> In the last third of the movie, with Dillon in jail and Dougherty wondering what to do next, we see that people who have been antagonistic now come slowly. In defense of the couple. The witnesses admit to having lied. Other facts come to light that, finally, result in the release of Dillon. The murderer is never found, even though the movie gives us an exhausting nutcase as a plausible author. <br /> <br /> This is a cry from beginning to end. Nothing seems to go well for the couple. Oh, there are some happy moments, maybe a party where everyone is happy to be together and crying with joy, or some point of evidence is discovered in their favor and people embrace. But it never takes long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all faces are frozen in tragic disbelief. (Usually, follow a fade to block). There is not necessarily anything wrong with tragedies in movement, although I can not imagine the pleasure that comes from seeing people suffer. There is also a lot of tragedy in Shakespeare. I guess everything we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way they are told. "Oh, but I'm the fool of fortune!" Romeo cries after killing Juliet's brother. Here we have Dougherty running in his robe down a hospital corridor, shouting, "Where's my baby?" There is no ambiguity or irony in the story, as I am sure there must have been in the real-life events on which it is based. People are good or bad here. Either they are bad, then they become good. <br /> <br /> The film is not aimed at exploring human peculiarity, or the way things work. It is aimed at tearing the tears from the audience. The actors provide top-level role models. I do not remember the last movie in which I saw so many tears. There are rivulets of tears. Showers of them. Waterfalls of them. A true Niagara of them. A lake lacrymose of them. <br /> <br /> Well, I'll give an example of the efficiency with which the film is made by hand. Dillon and Dougherty hire a Chicago cop who works as a private investigator (Ed Asner). Asner sympathizes with them, but in reality he does not achieve much. It seems to be in the film not because of its importance to the case, but because it can provide the victimized couple with a kind of philosophy: "Learn to live with her", which is fine, and because she has colorectal cancer. , so we can see him take his medicine, bend in pain and finally disappear. <br /> <br /> What is frustrating about the film is that by concentrating so intensely on the couple's suffering, one of them is avoided. the most important issues raised: the role of gossip in the regulation of private life. <br /> <br /> Gossip is a really strange thing. If we call it "gossip" it is bad, but if we call it "public opinion", it sounds acceptable, at least. Of course, we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified. (As I write, Michael Jackson is taken back to court on the charge of sexually abusing a child, and I wonder how many of us got excited about the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile). But gossip is not bad either. It's like water. When properly controlled, it is an asset of the community. We need gossip to keep us online. It helps us maintain public order. But, like water in a flood or tsunami, it is a ruin for a village when it gets out of control. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is fine if you are not looking too much along the way. of penetration into human nature. It is done so ingeniously that, given its purpose, it is difficult to discuss it.
