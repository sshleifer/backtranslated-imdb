I'm not even willing to vote for a single star for this shit, but IMDb does not have zero as a rating option ... the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. History of the movie 1. A predatory ship crashes on Earth 2. A foreigner and some face huggers are released and begin to kill humans. 3. A predator comes to earth and begins to kill aliens and humans. 4. Then, a human jet launches a bomb and kills humans, aliens and predators. 5. Some humans find the canyon of the predator's shoulder. 6. The final directors should consider returning the money to the spectators. If you still want to watch this movie, download it from a torrent site and tell me thanks for saving you money ... the whole movie has been filmed in a dark corner of the earth, you see only dark shadows even in action scenes ... too much violence .. I did not expect it from a fox movie
