No wonder this was free with the Mail on Sunday, slow, bad acting and filming (camera, almost at the beginning of the film, is not even artistic) = Direct to the video, but not in this case, why not recover some of their (film production costs) by releasing them for free with a Sunday newspaper in the United Kingdom, at least this way you will get a captive audience and recover some costs. <br /> <br /> I have not given this movie a 1 out of 10, due to the effort to get some old actors out of their shell, it was nice to see some old faces (Vanessa Redgrave, this is not Blow ?? Up), but Vinnie Jones as leader, and I think Gone was better in 60 seconds when he did not speak. <br /> <br /> This movie is falling in Ratings every day, I think you will find your true brand in 3-4 out of 10, in the very near future.
