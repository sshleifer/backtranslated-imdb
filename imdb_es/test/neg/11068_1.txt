I am an avid movie viewer and enjoy a wide variety of movies. However, I did not find any enjoyment in this movie. It's probably the worst movie I've seen in my life. I do not think it had a lot of history, the characters were not nice and the relationship between the characters was, at best, dysfunctional, and the end just made me not like the movie anymore. It is definitely not in the same category as "The Cave", which was, in my opinion, the best cave film ever made. Even "The Descent" was better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a loss of the rental fee of $ 3.79 and my time to see this. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this one.
