I have no idea how he qualifies as high as (5.8 at the time of writing this article) but this movie was absolutely horrible. The performance was not all bad, but it really did not make any sense and the overall quality was bad. Obviously it is a B movie (or a C if such a thing exists) and it seems that it was made during a weekend at a friend's house or something like that. I'm all for low budget movies and, generally, I see the ones I find, but this one is really bad. I mean, "The Fanglys" is bad. I do not know what else to say, but trust this, since I've sat in this horrible horrible movie and I can spare you the effort ... Do not bother. Seriously ... Just do not do it.
