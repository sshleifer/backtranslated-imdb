With a title like that, you'll be forgiven for thinking that this movie is about the great painter, Goya. Then, after half an hour, you decide that it is more about the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even more latitude, maybe it's just a snapshot of the period. With a creepy characterization, too many axes to grind and little respect for the facts, Milos Forman presents a colorful but ambiguous and itinerant mixture that fails in the three accounts. <br /> <br /> Milos Forman (who lost his Jewish father from the Nazi concentration camps, is the great director who painted the artist Mozart as a buffoon and got his way.) He won awards for it, in fact. His life in Czechoslovakia gave him a taste of various and repellent regimes, especially communism, he also did the same, but quite impressive, someone flew over the cuckoo's nest, then, at the age of 74, how can he come to offer us? In the ghosts of Goya, Goya is one step away from the jester, the main character is Brother Lorenzo, passionately played by Javier Bardem, Natalie Portman is just as vibrant as Ines, the Goya model (and later in the film, his own daughter.) The tenuous connection with Goya is that he paints both. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo tortures (and then rapes) Ines, whom he suspects is Jewish. Napoleon launches to liberate Spain (briefly). the dungeon in which the Church has left her and looks for her son. Goya is still painting but has remained deaf. His main concern seems to be helping Ines. And so on. <br /> <br /> Historically, Goya was also a historian. As Forman had sadly renounced the idea of ​​a biopic of Goya, the painter, could this fact have been used to bring the whole film together? A large part of the story seen by Goya. But the painter is too tangential to receive any weight. In the same way, should a document be made of the terrors of the Inquisition? Compared to other despotic orders over time, the Holy See has been forgiven with just one confession. Although one might wonder if Forman is competent enough to be entrusted with an objective explanation of anything. <br /> <br /> "I thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story," he says in the production notes. "There were many parallels between the communist society with which we live and the Spanish Inquisition." But the story is too tenuous to hold our attention. Against our expectations and against a background of something important (the life of a great painter, the horrors of the Inquisition and even the French Revolution), we are asked to feel involved in an infatuation of Goya. The result is that we feel cheated. <br /> <br /> The details of the fund are handled in a terrible way. Goya was deaf in 1792 (when the film begins), not 15 years later. Napoleon is as credible as a cut of a package of cereal. We see the Church issuing a death sentence (when the normal procedure was for the Church to insist that the secular arm do that dirty work). The battles seem too choreographed and staged. A pepper of free naked breasts barely makes up for it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the production values ​​are mostly good. The colors are vivid, the rhythm excellent (at least until we give up to find some argument that is worth it). Bardem is excellent, and Portman is a joy until she starts at full speed like a madwoman. While it does not say much about Goya, what it does say is good, even if it is superficial and quite irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Once I had a drunken conversation until late at night, where my friends and I asked ourselves, If you could choose a director to represent your life, who would it be? In his record, Forman would have to be sadly at the bottom of my list.
