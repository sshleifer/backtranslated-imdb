Remember those old kung fu movies that we used to see on Friday and Saturday nights when our nannies thought we were in charge? Well, this movie plays exactly like one of those movies. The biggest claim of Patsy Kensit to fame was the love interest for the character of Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon 2", and this performance was one of the reasons why she never became great: she is a terrible actress. <br /> <br /> In "Lethal Weapon 2", I thought it was cute. Nice enough to see some of the other movies I had been in, including "Loves Music, Loves to Dance", another big disappointment, which, obviously, did not impress me either. But, as attractive as she is to my eyes, my soul screamed at me to turn it off because she played another cheap and predictable role, and she did it very badly. <br /> <br /> In this film, Kensit plays a comedian (and not a good one) who is working in clubs in France (he could not do it in his own homeland, so he is causing his ears to bleed), that he has bad luck, but, what is worse, the French government wants to throw her out for an expired visa (or maybe they just took her for a decision). But she marries this Casanova (Freiss), who has bad luck, and predictability begins ... terribly! Is there any way to give this movie a NEGATIVE rating? 1 out of 10 stars is over evaluating it!
