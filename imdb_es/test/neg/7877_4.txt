This is not a good movie. Plain and simple. Take out the hardcore sex scenes and what you have is a mediocre plot, an average performance (at best), an arduous direction and a boring dialogue. Add the grot and it will have a mediocre plot, an average performance, a laborious direction, a boring dialogue, with lashes of hard porn. The problem is that pornography is nothing special either. So it's not a good movie, and it's not a good porn either. It fails in both cases. You can say that the women made this film and that they intended to do it with her, and that with her, etc. But talking is cheap, the end result is what counts, and what we have here is a mediocre movie with some sex. by shock value to try to deceive him so that he loses time watching it. One of those movies where you would prefer to have the time you spent watching it again.
