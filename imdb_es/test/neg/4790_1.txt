Apart from the police rock and the show in which the child dies by eating a hamburger in poor condition that was found under the bed, this has been the worst and dumbest show to survive the best time. If it were not for the unjustifiable success of Jason Lee in the cinema, this show would never have left the conception if it had been launched with a relatively unknown name as the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The concept is TERRIBLE. Moron Redneck Hick spends his lottery winnings to redeem himself with the white trash of his past. It is funny? Periodically but not consistently. Is it stupid? Each and every episode. <br /> <br /> I have seen that many of the great shows arrive before their time, but this error has survived longer than I could ever have imagined. The dialogue is incredibly funny, as are the themes of the episode. Each episode for someone with an IQ greater than 100 is an absolute struggle. And the icing on the cake? The annoying voice of Jason Lee that narrates each episode. If it were not for the southern culture of the state and the southern peasants of the south, this show would not have an audience. <br /> <br /> If you're a moron and you need a program completely devoid of humor but full of bad ones Taste, bad dialogue and silly characters fail in life ... well, then you're probably an actor in this Program.
