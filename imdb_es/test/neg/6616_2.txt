"Season on the Brink" is one of my favorite books of all time: an insightful and unwavering look by Bob Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers. And Dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time. So I made a point of seeing this adaptation. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed at all levels. Dennehy's performance was not very inspired, and he seemed unprepared to play Knight, as if he had accepted the role just before filming. The rest of the cast is not much better. <br /> <br /> And it was obvious that this was the first ESPN movie. It was misdirected, badly filmed, and the lack of budget was evident when simulating games (smaller gyms, empty seats, etc.). Skip this adaptation and read the book. It stays well to this day!
