I rented this when it came out on videocassette in 1995. After seeing it again, my idea has not changed much. <br /> <br /> I was an adult and I am still an adult! lol <br /> <br /> The illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers did not bother me. This is not a documentary, it's a fantasy story where animals can talk! <br /> <br /> Although I was not interested in many of the songs, I liked the one at the end of the image where Barry Manilow and another person are sung. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to make an excuse for their primitive animation by saying that CGI was not often used in animated features, but let's not forget that THE LION KING was launched about a year ago. before, and that includes possibly more excellence than any other animated feature that came before !! <br /> <br /> But I think it's fair enough to say that THE PEBBLE AND THE PINGOIN became cheap while THE LION KING was not "t .... <br /> <br /> The highest points for me as much in 1995 as at present is the suspense generated by the few dangerous underwater chase scenes (mostly). <br /> <br /> I also liked the opening scene that takes place on a page of musical notes and a bit of the love story, but most of the time, the story went on and it was boring. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out if you like animation, but if you're an adult and not Take risks, look for another Walt Disney production instead of this one!
