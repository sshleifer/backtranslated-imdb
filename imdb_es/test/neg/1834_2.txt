There is an endless supply of trashy horror movies. It seems that people never get tired of trying to scare and move. Unfortunately, these attempts are rarely successful. This unfortunate movie has almost no redeeming value. The story is highly predictable, most actors lack inspiration or simply have special effects of very low quality. It took a lot of effort not to turn off the DVD and go to bed. With such a limited number of foreign films issued in the US. UU., Why would anyone in the world want to import this nonsense? To top it off, there seems to be an "Anatomy 2" for those who have nothing better to do. I prefer to see the dry paint.
