Okay, yes, I know I'm a Philistine and I do not know or love opera. I easily admit that I could feel different about this movie if I did. But not me. So, for those of you like me, skip this one unless you want to look at pretty girls (sometimes without clothes). For what it's worth, I thought that the first segment with Theresa Russell (whom I did not recognize) was the best of all.
