This movie describes a truly horrible event, no doubt. But everything falls out of bad performances of the entire cast. It is impossible to feel the emotion of almost any character, since all the emotional scenes seem parodies of themselves. For example, a character is shot at the beginning of the film and the cliché despairs: "Will I make it, sergeant?", "Yes, it's nothing", but it is presented as a sketch of a Wayans Brothers movie (no I know if they have already done War Movie) or something starring Leslie Nielsen. <br /> <br /> The sergeant played by Sean Penn reminds me of Al Bundy of Married With Children, while Fox is the best cliché of self-contempt you can imagine ... Thank God, he curses and smokes during this . <br /> <br /> Your emotional "NOOOO !!!" It is definitely more suitable for comedies like Back To The Future than the so-called serious movies like this one. <br /> <br /> To your credit, some of the "main" scenes ... (without revealing too much, where they actually perform some pretty horrible acts) ... are well done and make us take the subject seriously. But that is despite, not thanks to the performance.
