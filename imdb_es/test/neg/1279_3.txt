Some people think of Sweden in a negative way: too orderly, too clean, too serious, too organized and too northern. A people tortured by their own religious destiny and their history, which sometimes leads to depression and compulsive heavy hand. This does not have to be a problem for a filmmaker, since, for example, the late Bergman has shown us what can be possible cinematographic in these conditions. Bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not explicitly mention this identity as such. <br /> <br /> However, Andersson does the opposite: he comments only that this identity dissects his people to the bone: in his world Sweden is equivalent to hell on earth. But he does not take this further and for me this is not just art, but simply an annotation. Despite the exceptional amount of time it took for this filmmaker to have serious limitations, he clearly can not get out of it. <br /> <br /> Compared to his previous film Sånger från andra våningen / Songs from the Second Floor, there is not much progress to be observed either. The intention was that this was more accessible, but the difference is minimal and the few scenes that try to please a wider audience are not the best in the film. The same absurdity and minimalism are also applied, there is the camera position of a shot and the (lack of) action in front of this shot. Yes, the frames are well done, some of the scenes really work and the coloration and positioning are amazing. But does that make an interesting movie? Thinking negatively, this is a step back towards the cinema. <br /> <br /> Andersson's track record as an ad manufacturer shines in the elaborate configuration, but his films are as empty as those commercials. There is a message about humanity, but it is trivial and without much depth.
