For starters, it's a scam from the Japanese movie Battle Royal, except that it lacks the one thing that made BR unique. In the best of cases, it is a weak satire and, as far as real television phenomena are concerned, it tries to comment and everybody knows how twisted and stupid the genre can be. Why was this movie made?
