There is nothing in this that the viewer can point to and call "good". The performance was boring and sedated. The sets and the cinematography seem to have been developed by someone who grew up in a Starbucks and tried to make Gap's perfect commercial. The characters have no motivation, motivation or reason to worry about them. There is such a lack of interest and tension that it is difficult to follow the banal action and dialogue. And the plot ... if someone finds it, I'm sure it would be as boring as everything else. <br /> <br /> This is not fun, it is not romantic, it is not reflected in the human. condition. If you want a good stoner comedy, look at Half-Baked; If you want a good stoner drama, look at Trainspotting. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of one is because it's kind of funny to see some familiar faces in the mid-90s. Which is a superficial reason to give the film even a star, but, of course, again, this is a superficial movie.
