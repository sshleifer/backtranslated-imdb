The producer of this movie calls itself "Nott Entertainment," and that's a surprisingly appropriate name. This is very entertaining for everyone, from the beginning to the end, which is a shame because a mix of movie and western zombies could have been interesting. Every time a low-budget zombie movie is released, it will tend to be "for fans for fans." In fact, I consider myself a fan of zombie movies, but many more like this one and I will be reevaluating my opinion! The movie seems to be a scam from the half decent Australian zombie movie 'Undead', which is expected to instead have the advantage with a cowboy hat; all carry one; but this does not make much sense because the movie is apparently set in modern times. The sequence of credits at the beginning of the film makes us believe that we are going to be in an atmospheric movie, but when the movie starts correctly; It soon becomes evident in what we really are. Naturally, there is a good amount of blood and it is pretty well done, although the good things that I have to say about the movie almost end there. There is a midway twist that could have been interesting if the rest of the movie was out. In general, this is just another zombie movie in a world with too many zombie movies. I do not recommend it
