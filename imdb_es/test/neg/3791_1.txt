Horrible writing, direction and acting! The writer / director has interpreted the southerners, especially the southern authorities, as ignorant, remedies, homophobic and racist (a very popular but ignorant stereotype that the film industry loves to perpetuate). Performance (or exaggeration) and writing turned out to be low budget and amateur. The plot is the same old Hollywood story of the perverted racist and homophobic peasants who are finally defeated by the enlightened people of "Newwww Yoke Ceety". <br /> <br /> I was raised in the small town of Louisiana. where this film was filmed and I expected to see it, but was immediately disappointed during the first minutes of the film. The beginning of the movie shows a gay bar located in the "marshes" of Louisiana. How ridiculous is a concept! There are many gay and gay bars in southern Louisiana, but there are no gay bars in the "marshes" or small towns of Louisiana. Then, they introduce us to the sheriff who uses the phrases "homuh-sex'l" in the worst southern accent and the exaggerated performance of the story. Then there's the scene where the local police are watching service pornography at the police station. I could go on and on about the horrible cheesy acting, the stereotypes or the ridiculous scenes. <br /> <br /> This director and his team were received in this cozy little city and were shown true Southern hospitality. The people of the city of Lake Arthur and the state of Louisiana were only insulted and degraded in the final edition. The good people of Lake Arthur were excited and in love that "Hollywood" was in the city without knowing that, in the end, they would be portrayed as ignorant, racist and homophobic peasant farmers in a low budget amateur film that went directly to the DVD. My advice: skip this or watch it in Cinemax at night if it ever rotates.
