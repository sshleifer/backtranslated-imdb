This garbage looked as much like the novel as a slice of gherkin to a cucumber. The filmmakers took the Alamo section of the book, turned it into a movie and said it was based on the book. Jah Do you wonder what they did to induce Mr. Michener to back this fluff? It was just another Davy Crockett, spark gun, Santa Ana, Poppycock's 13-day glory collection. I almost started to encourage the Mexicans, just to get rid of the damn thing. And what was that scene in which Stacey Keach was trying to get James Bowie to let him look at the knife? The sexual innuendos he used were juvenile and unnecessary. They could have used the film they wasted in that stupidity to establish a true dialogue. This show was a shame for Hollywood. Or can those clowns be ashamed?
