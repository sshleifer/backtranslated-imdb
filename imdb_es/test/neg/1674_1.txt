I do not know if this kind of movie was as clich√© as it seems now. <br /> <br /> Considering how many "Bad News Bears" movies had already been released in 1980, however, I think this kind of movie was already a tired idea. <br /> <br /> A former soccer player is partially paralyzed in Vietnam and confined to a wheelchair. The Chicago Bears offer him a public relations job, but he wants to train. At the same time, your minor nephew is picked up for armed robbery. We are told that he has already been arrested more than a dozen times and that he must now have a difficult time ... which turned out to be less than a year! <br /> <br /> Of course, the child is actually a good child who only needs a strong male model in his life. The same goes for all the children in the detention center. Yes ... even the one imprisoned for attempted murder! I'm sure you already know what's going on, so I'll try to keep the rest of this report. <br /> <br /> Our protagonist becomes the coach of the children's soccer team. Overcome the cynicism of criminals and earn their respect. His team faces a team from the local high school (yes, of course!) And they kick their butts. Now decided more than ever to show that he is a worthy coach, demands a rematch. Can these disadvantaged and scandalous children with golden hearts improve enough to win the rematch? The horrible execution of the soccer sequences ruins any possibility of emotion in this film. "Coach of the year" should be penalized for mistreating my brain. 1/10
