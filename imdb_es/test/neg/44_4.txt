A pretty loose teenage Brisbane slasher. While the plot is based on a pretty decent idea, the writing is deeply boring and two of the three main teenagers are absurdly wooden. The problem is that for children to comply with their plan they have to be much more reckless than what is shown to them, but if they were the ones who worry, it might be difficult to be nice, so they end up being none really. In fact, I only started to enjoy the movie when I began to wish his death. One of those movies where in a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police. I realize we would not have a movie if they had one, but it would be good if we could believe that they really would not. Avoid.
