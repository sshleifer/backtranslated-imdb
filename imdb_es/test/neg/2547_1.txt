What a terrible movie! It perfectly represents the state of degeneration of French society, where the most elementary respect for healthy values ​​and traditions has completely disappeared. The plot does not make sense, the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely superficial and uninteresting. To say the least, the direction and cinematography are very poor and uninspired. Catherine Deneuve is as bad an actress as ever, even when directed by Bunuel in Belle De Jour. The rest of the generally good cast (Vincent Lindon, Line Renaud, Jean Yanne) seems to be completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity, platitudes and restlessness. I can not help but draw a parallel with the wonderful "Le Divorce" by James Ivory, with his careful representation of French and American customs, his superlative cinematography and his stellar cast well taken advantage of. Having seen "Le Divorce" you can feel a kind of empathy with the French, regardless of their weaknesses. "Belle-Maman" leaves you alone with a nauseating contempt for its morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists.
