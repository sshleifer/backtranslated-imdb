There is not much to add to what others have already commented, the film fails a lot where it should not, it has no depth in the planning of the robbery and the characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> One thing That made me think that, although the rest of the gang is trying to remove the pins from the doors of an armored truck, because there's supposed to be no other way to open it, the guy who It is inside the truck, with great ease. he manages to remove the floor of the truck that has a hole so that he can leave, and then re-enter, without anyone noticing, because nobody else could think he could get out of there or even better. , who could have entered from there. <br /> <br /> Promising but not quite.
