Scary Movie 1-4, Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Not Another Teen Movie and Another Gay Movie. Make "Superhero Movie" the eleventh in a series that only ruined the genre of parody. Now I admit it. I have a weakness for classics like Airplane and The Naked Gun, but you know you've milked a franchise so badly when you can see the gags a mile away. In fact, the only thing that could really tempt you to see this disaster is the incredibly funny but massive sale of Leslie Neilson. <br /> <br /> You can say that you need the money, that it withers or tries to do it. Go down with the ship as a good captain would. In no way is this genre toppled, but hell is not helping it. But if I feel sorry for someone in this movie, his decent actor Drake Bell faces immense shame. However, the people who suffer the greatest amount of torture are the public forced to sit for 90 minutes of bile without laughing no more funny than herpes. <br /> <br /> After faking disaster films on Airplane !, the police show on The Naked Gun, and the horrors of Hollywood on Scary Movie 3 and 4, producer David Zucker puts his satirical views on the genre of the superheroes with this anarchic comedy that deals with everything from Spider-Man to X-Men and Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Shortly after being bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly, the outcast of Rick Riker High School (Drake Bell) begins to undergo a surprising transformation. Now Rick's skin is as strong as steel, and he has the strength of ten men. Determined to use his new powers to fight crime, Rick creates a special suit and assumes the identity of The Dragonfly, an intrepid crime fighter dedicated to keeping the streets safe for law-abiding citizens. <br /> <br /> But every superhero needs a nemesis, and after Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald) gets caught in the middle of an experiment that has gone horribly wrong, he develops the power to expel the life force from Anyone who knows and becomes the Hourglass villain. With the intention of achieving immortality, the hourglass tries to gather as much life force as possible when the noble Dragonfly intends to topple his archenemy and realize his destiny as a true hero. Craig Mazin writes and directs this low-flying parody. <br /> <br /> with Tracy Morgan, Pamela Anderson, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Jeffrey Tambor and Regina Hall. <br /> <br /> Hell Superhero Movie can gain some merit in the fact that it is much better than Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie. But with great responsibility comes one of the worst outings of 2008 to date. No laughter, but a little less irritating than Meet the Spartans. And in the same sense it is much more forgettable than knowing the Spartans. But maybe that's a good reason. There are still some of us who try to eliminate from our memory the spot that was Meet the Spartans. <br /> <br /> My final verdict? Avoid yourself, unless you are one of those people who enjoy this type of cinema. As bad as Date Movie and Scary Movie 2, but not as bad as Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie. Super villain
