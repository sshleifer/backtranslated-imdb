Another sequel! Why the hell are you still doing this? This has to be the weakest 'franchise' in history, however, it is still being financed and generating sequels. SCARECROW GONE WILD, who only watched to be able to officially destroy the whole series, returns me to the evil straw man who, again, murders some university students ... That's basically everything. The performance sucks (as usual), the scenes of death are more than pathetic, and do not be fooled by the title, this thing does not have as much nudity as you can think. A couple of good topless girls, but nothing too tight the pants. Let me just conclude my continuous insult (or revision) in this movie by saying: if I meet a SCARECROW IN SPACE or a FREDDY VS SCARECROW on the shelves of the video store, I will be absolutely amazed ...
