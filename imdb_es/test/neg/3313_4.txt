White spots and various shapes, a beautiful nude, random images. That's what this little experimental short film is. <br /> <br /> It's a bit interesting to think how, in the early days of the film, those images could be transferred to the movie, but despite my love for many surreal images. Movies, and a fascination for the strange, this movie just did not do it for me. <br /> <br /> I do not regret having seen it, but if there is any underlying meaning in it, I do not. I do not understand it Visually, it is not so exceptional, in my humble opinion. As an example of dadaism, I suppose it would fit quite well, since it seems to reject any appearance of logic or reason, although I would have preferred it to be done in a more visually interesting way. <br /> <br /> But to each his own.
