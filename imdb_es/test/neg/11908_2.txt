The Canterville Ghost (1996). The director made this production too boring. Maybe it's the generation, but I really liked Charles Laughton's version. There is a time and place for "emoticons" and this production does not translate very well. Patrick Stewart, reciting Shakespeare was very good, but still inadequate. I would not recommend or look again. The close-ups, the quilted text and the subplots were lost on me. Adding material and strange scenes takes away a really great play. The scriptwriter should find another profession in which to lose his talent, maybe the evening soap operas would be a better place. Take a look at the really good version and transmit this.
