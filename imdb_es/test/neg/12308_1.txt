Spend your time in another way, even housework is better than this movie. The jokes are not fun, the funny rhymes that are Dr. Seus are not there. A very bad way to lose one night. My children from 4 to 16 years old laughed a little at first, the little ones got bored and stopped playing Barbies and the older ones went to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and made dishes. So I finished it alone. It was the worst "children" movie I've seen. If you want to watch a funny movie for kids, look at Shrek 2, that movie is fun for kids and their parents. AVOID THIS MOVIE. It's not funny, it's not cute, the cat's makeup is the only good thing there is and you can see it on the disc label.
