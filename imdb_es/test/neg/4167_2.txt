I found the Code 46 very disappointing. I thought the concept was good and, therefore, had great potential as a movie, but I found that it did not work. Code 46 lacked thought and structure and the plot did not flow well. I thought that Tim Robbins's character was not well developed, for example. I thought there should have been more information and thought in his family life and not completely ignored it as I felt it was. When they first violated a code 46, it was suggested that they did not know they could be genetically linked, but that all technology was available to them, they took their fingerprint and, therefore, genetic details when investigating the fraud. I was constantly waiting for something to happen and the story to unfold and yet it never happened. I felt that the film had great potential to be intellectually stimulating, but it turned out to be the opposite. The code 46 tried to be too intelligent and in the end it ended up lacking in imagination. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, the only good thing about the movie was that it was relatively short.
