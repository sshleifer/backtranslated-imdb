I wrote an essay in 1981, the year I graduated from high school called "the last American virgin." I also had a friend named Nancy who was the prostitute in this movie. apparently his daughter seized my essay one night when she was sleeping in my house. One year later I wake up one morning and see the announcement of this movie. I was 18 years old and based the essay on experiences of my life. The film is a bit different from my essay but definitely taken from it. I had no proof of this, except my English teacher, m.Versace, who gave me an A in my essay. I let it go and I never did anything about it. I realized that what happens is going around. I still would not take anything. Action against anyone involved in this movie. I just needed to get it out of my chest, since I never really told anyone, except my closest friend, and they agreed to keep it a secret. The same year I left, I saw Nancy in a market, she really had the nerve to ask me if she had good stories or scripts for her to see. I guess that's what Hollywood is about, get stories from where you can. It was interesting to see parts of my life on the big screen. <br /> <br /> ghostwriter!
