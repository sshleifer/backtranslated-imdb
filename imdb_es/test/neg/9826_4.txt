I wanted to spend part of my Independence Day weekend watching a good movie about Jefferson. This movie was not. It was quite long, long, boring and unbalanced. He spent too much time exploring Jefferson's relationship with Cosway and did not spend enough time in his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady who played Sally, Thandie Newton, was absolutely horrible. His acting was so bad it was like seeing an airhead A1 trying to recite Shakespeare. His voice whining constantly in his nerves! Nolte's accent made Jefferson look like an ignorant man, instead of a genius. Jefferson's relationship with his daughters and his feelings about slavery was also underdeveloped, but the rebellion of his eldest daughter (Patsy) is a key event at the end of the film. The film was too long and the script lacked energy and enthusiasm. On the positive side, the costumes were quite beautiful, and Greta Scacchi played the role of Cosway well. If you want to see a film about the revolutionary era and / or Jefferson, then see 1776, it's much better than Jefferson in Paris.
