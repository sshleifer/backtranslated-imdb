According to the comments made so far, everyone seems to hate this movie or love it. I think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a BIG movie, it has its interesting moments. On the one hand, it was filmed in a place in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I do not remember it, but it's in the credits). The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. It's beautiful, even for me, that I lived in Colorado for several years. <br /> <br /> Next, you have Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors. Harry Morgan has never been in better shape than when he plays in a Disney movie. He is literally hysterical. Also, remember the wonderful Mary Wickes? Even though she has a "small part" in this movie, she is great, as always. If you do not know who she is, think about Disney's animated version of Notre Dame's Hunchback (she was one of the gargoyles), and she was also the most interesting nun in "Sister Act", as well as the best nun. in "The problem with the angels". She has always been a great character actress and most character actors never get the recognition they deserve. <br /> <br /> In addition to star actors and actors, in the 1960s and 1970s, Disney may not have had the "best movies", but if you actually see some of them from the Beginning to the end, you will notice that each movie has a really funny or hysterical moment.The whole movie may not be fun, but there is always a comic gem (at least 1 or 2) in each "live action" movie that Disney has Done, whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his voice shouts, or Tim Conway spinning around, or Joe Flynn giving him a look of horror that is priceless, all is well, the whole movie may not be good, but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in all the Disney films of this period that I have seen, Disney in this period always managed to make a person smile, despite the stupidity of the film. <br /> <br /> About these comments , I do not agree with the viewers that dic in which every Disney movie in this period is horrible. That statement is not entirely accurate. Rather, it is easier for me to recognize the fun moments and ignore the weaknesses of the plots. <br /> <br /> Some live action movies from Disney are real classics (Old Yeller, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins), but for those who are not, I can appreciate them for what they were: good family fun at a time when the movies had become vulgar, crude and offensive.
