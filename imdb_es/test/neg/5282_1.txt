First of all, I'm upset because there's no "0" option of 10. <br /> <br /> I got bored tonight, and while I flip through the channels, I see Dr. Chopper. Since nothing else is on, I decide to watch it, hoping it's just another horrible horror movie, with an argument similar to Cabin Fever. <br /> <br /> The man was wrong ... Dr. Chopper made Cabin Fever look like he should have won numerous Academy Awards. Let me remind you, Cabin Fever contains a scene of a boy hick kicking from a porch screaming "pancakes !!", characters that leave their dying friend in a small shack to bleed and Shawn of Boy Seets. World mistakenly touching a hole in the thigh of a girl. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that Dr. Chopper was a lot of things, smelly and smelly. It was not even funny shit. It reminded me of a horror movie I had to do in 8th grade, called "The Campout". Except for the fact that "The Campout" had a better script (we wrote about an hour before filming), better actors, plots, bloody scenes and camera work. I was hoping to get some laughs out of a poorly made horror movie, but instead I could only see with amazement what I thought to myself: "Was this done by 8th graders?" <br /> <br /> The performance was horrible, the events and different small plots were grouped and made no sense, and violence and violence were minimal. I liked how from a small knife wound, people died instantly, and the only weapons the assassins had were small pocket knives ... if you're going to make a horror movie, at least give the killer (s) a demented murder. device. <br /> <br /> Besides, what the hell was the point at which the girls of the sisterhood of women made their promises? Good way to bring some scenes of girls running on their bras, even if they have no relevance to the story. And I must say that my favorite phrase was when the blonde says to Dr. Chopper: "I would like to introduce you to someone ... my inner bitch". His "inner bitch" then proceeds to grab a trash can, throw it to Dr. Chopper, the miss, and get scared of the killer again. <br /> <br /> Wheww ... well, that was very long, but I felt that I needed to express my feelings about how absolutely horrible this "movie" was. I know that everyone has their own opinions, but if someone qualifies this movie above 2, it should be fired into Hell ... <br /> <br /> ... seriously.
