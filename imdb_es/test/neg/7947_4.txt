I'm sure many kids will love this movie. The only woman who shows "balls" (unfortunate play on words lamented) is made to look, talk and look like a man, the other 2 women are portrayed as sexual objects with one thing in mind: sex / being sexy, with sex as their only attribute and ability (Iris), or as frightened little princesses, whose neurosis denies any professional strength and authority they had before hell was lost (Doc). The only strength that Iris has in the end is the result of the advice of a big and strong man. In addition to my negative reaction as a feminist, I have to support the work of the camera, and Ethan Hawke is great in the first scene. After that his performance loses steam. Empty entertainment for a brain that wants to take it easy. At least the film touches the issue of the duality of good / bad in the criminal mind.
