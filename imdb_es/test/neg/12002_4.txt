I could not help looking at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found that this movie was a total ballast. Childish humor, cheap-looking games, cheap-looking effects, a plot that makes "Legally Blonde" look like "The Usual Suspects" and so many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez had brain surgery in some place after 1996. The only thing left as its brand are some camera movements, but that's where it ends. Okay, so the boy decided to do something new to change, a spy movie for kids. Well, if I were 12 years old, I would feel insulted. The best thing about this movie is the absolutely incredible Carla Gugino who just stole all the scenes she was in. Unfortunately, there were not many. 4/10
