Wow this really is stereotyped, terrible crap. I'm sorry for anyone who has wasted their money to see this. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure I did not laugh once during this whole movie, I just can not believe they made such a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Now I will be more cautious when watching night movies. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the worst movie I've seen in my life. I'm not saying it's the worst movie in existence (although it could be), but I do not think I've seen anything so stupid and ungraceful in my life. makes the Scary Movie series look smart. <br /> <br /> 1/10 I would give it a 0 if they let me
