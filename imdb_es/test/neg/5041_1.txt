There is only one way to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> so bad is hilarious. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that I started laughing. The male protagonist in this movie who tries to use a gun is so ridiculous that you would think he was trying to copy a toy action figure, I know this sounds ridiculous, but when you see it for yourself you can not help but agree. <Br /> <br /> the monster looks like a CGI boy trying to recreate the clay monsters you get in the old Sinbad movies. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is good for only one thing: a great laugh for the bad films can be obtained. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a bad script with bad acting and the special effects go wrong <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU
