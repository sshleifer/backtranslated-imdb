I went to see this with the strength of Albert Finney alone. He is one of my favorite actors and rarely fails. I'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly: it's a little boy who is about to be born, but as his mother goes into labor, he refuses to leave! This sends God and the whole factory of human beings to a crisis and Albert Finney is called out of purgatory to try to convince the child to change his mind and decide to want to be born. So Finney takes the unborn child to an adventure in the Big Apple with the hope of showing him all the reasons why he should want to live. <br /> <br /> Despite the ridiculousness of the plot, I could have accepted it if the director had not tried to turn this into your typical sentimental moralistic Hollywood movie. As a director, the film became unbearable because of a horrible soundtrack to sentimental music that Hollywood directors seem unable to resist. <br /> <br /> Masa created the somewhat unconventional story by giving her hand at all times. The twists and turns that were in store in the plot were completely given away by the way the story unraveled. It was as if the director assumed that the audience is just a group of idiots who can not see the obvious clues from a mile away. <br /> <br /> Even Finney in his performance, although satisfying, seemed a bit uncomfortable. of place; and the little boy with curly curls, although it was supposed to be cute, was actually quite boring. Bridget Fonda seemed intent on trying to duplicate Demi Moore's performance in 'Ghost', shedding tears at any moment. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film has not been successful so far in the US distribution. UU., What surprises I think it has the box office's potential to be a modest success, which appeals to both children and sentimental adults. As for quality, it's not a horrible movie, it just is not very good. (4 of 10)
