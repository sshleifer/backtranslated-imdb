"Return of the Seven" has some good action scenes, and Elmer Bernstein's score is as exciting as ever. However, it is a boring movie, because it simply does not involve us emotionally. The absence of Mcqueen causes a very bad impression, and the fact that his character here is played by a different actor (little known) is strange, in a bad way. The characters are not developed, so we do not connect with them, and we almost do not care when some of them die. This sequel is a passable but poor imitation of the original.
