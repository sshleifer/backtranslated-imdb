At first, look at a control panel that says "8 miles of California cost", and no, I did not write it wrong, they really did not realize the cost instead of on the coast. These people must have been idiots. <br /> <br /> It's good if you like terrible movies, but the simple fact that they could not find a simple spelling problem made me believe that they really did not make any effort. Creating the movie anyway. The Navy uniforms are not correct at all in any way. <br /> <br /> Wow, completely ridiculous, but good if you're looking for something incredibly stupid to see. How these people made money with this surpasses me.
