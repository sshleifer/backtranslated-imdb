First of all, this is one of the worst "soft thrillers" I've seen in my life. Of course, as all erotic thrillers want to do, it is a brothel of the lady and is established in a brothel. This, of course, makes the simulated softcore sex that appears every 10 minutes look "in context." Whatever is. <br /> <br /> Forget for a moment that this was never meant to win any prize. The actors are terrible and their line reading made me tremble. The woman who plays the police is so bad that it is beyond description. She must be a very good friend of the guys who put the movie for this terrible adventure, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are only a little higher than porn. Other than that? I guess if you're really drunk and you need something to laugh about, this would be a perfect movie. And if that is the case, I recommend a quick advance to all the scenes with the female police. What is that accent, Brooklyn? Fun!
