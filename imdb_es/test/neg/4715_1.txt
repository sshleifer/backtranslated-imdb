This movie was a big disappointment. The plot sounded great, about a creature half leopard and half leopard in Africa that becomes the subject of a documentary made by young American adults. When many of the crew members are found dead, the 2 survivors are interrogated. I would not even call this a horror movie, since most of the film is actually about (the) adventures of the aforementioned narcissists 20 and twenty-one, which include sex and excrement from smoking to get high (not so entertaining how it sounds - trust me). The creature is rarely seen, and the main actor (who is also the director, the scriptwriter, the editor, and the producer!) Is incredibly annoying. <br /> <br /> In the end I felt so annoyed by the never-instructing dialogues that I went ahead to the end. He had guessed the ending in less than 10 minutes in the movie ... and he was right. Therefore, this horrible movie is also completely predictable, as if it were not bad enough. The moral of the story: avoid the films that are acted on, directed, edited, produced and written by the same person. And avoid this movie, unless it's held at gunpoint.
