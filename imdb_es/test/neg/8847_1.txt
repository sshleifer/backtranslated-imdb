I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This movie did the impossible. <br /> <br /> While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts, this film was a lesson of over abundance. As in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. It would have helped if the film had a little more movement in the plot and the work of the camera, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. The performance was absolutely terrible, on the verge of bad levels of student films, while everyone struggled to improvise something called a script. Did these people receive any address? Were you persuaded to be bored and bored? Either one would not surprise me. <br /> <br /> What was even worse was the rather strange makeup that the creatures on the other side had. Either way, they all sucked. Do not watch this movie. That's all I can say (unless you're sleepless).
