* Spoiler alert! * It only gives me the nerve that some people have to redo (and I use the term here freely) good movies. In the American version of this Dutch thriller, someone decided that the original ending was not pasteurized enough for the American public. So, what do they do? They create a new one! a stupid, improbable, I-pretend-I'm-dead-but-I come back to life-again-so-the-good-boy-can-kick-my-butt-some kind of end anymore. Do yourself a favor and get the original.
