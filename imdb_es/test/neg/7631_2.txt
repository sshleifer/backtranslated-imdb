With so many good movies that came out in 1995 (particularly "Mortal Kombat" and "Seven"), unfortunately, there had to be some bombs too, and this movie actually falls into the last category with a boring, predictable and awful ending. It seems that Antonio Banderas has not been able to find a decent script since "Desperado", the only notable film he has done. Anyone with an eighth of a brain could tell who was DeMornay's stalker from the beginning. His flashbacks of his mother's death did nothing more than confuse a story that was already very thin. Too bad that Dennis Miller was wasted in this movie; this part resembles his strangely similar role in "The Network". <br /> <br /> The convoluted ending made me shake my head, as I did throughout the film. In addition, any film that depicts animal cruelty in any form or form, no matter how fake it looks, automatically takes my thumb down. <br /> <br /> To summarize, if you want to enjoy a good thriller, avoid this at all costs. Never talk to strangers ... especially those who recommend this movie. 2/10
