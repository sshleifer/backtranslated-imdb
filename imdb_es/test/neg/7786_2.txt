When a BBC murder thriller is full of heterosexual dysfunction, you know who should be the murderer: the homosexual. ? Let's see, could it be the mother who (against all common sense) is allowing her teenage son to make unsupervised visits to his serial killer father behind bars? Could it be the bad-tempered son, who is impressed by his father's sensible attitude towards women? Could it be the same serial killer, who seems capable of manipulating the events behind bars, the Hannibal Lecter? Could it be Mom's boyfriend, a school teacher whose affair with a former student led to the suicide of his wife? Or could it be the daughter of her boyfriend, who speaks aloud the secrets of everyone at school, causing unspeakable misery? No, it is not one of these probable suspects. It's ... the homosexual! <br /> <br /> The only mystery for the viewer is to guess who the homosexual is. Of course, it could be anyone, since the only characteristics of The Homosexual are the shameful secret and the propensity to murder and, otherwise, complicate the lives of "normal" people. The homosexual is the invisible root cause of the ills of society; Only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the fractured family rejoin, and things can go back to normal ... whatever it is. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, both Jemma Redgrave and Robson Green are now officially beyond their expiration dates. The world could go wonderfully without seeing it on the screen again, but while the BBC has roles for The Wronged Woman and The Misunderstood Man, I guess they'll keep coming back in movies like this one.
