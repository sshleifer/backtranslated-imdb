"Engaged", as in Heather Graham, to be COMMITTED to saving her husband / marriage, and then COMMITTED to a psychiatric ward for not doing so: what intelligent and intelligent use of words. <br /> <br /> One of those philosophical wanna-have philosophical movies in which the narrative is a series of observations so wise that rub poetry (club-chique poetry of the 90s, better known as "poetry" chit-chique "). Oh, it's so je-ne-sais-quoi ... Written / directed (or "secured") by a woman (Lisa Krueger, whoever you are), this is a useless, lethargically directed road-movie filled with New Nonsense Spiritual age and characters that are meant to be interesting but that are simply seen before or simply boring. Latinos in this film, as part of the poor urban minority, are often glorified in all their primitivism obsessed with mysticism as a "spiritually superior" people, which is the "climax" of the political correctness of this film. <br /> <br /> The whole thing has no life, and it ceases to be only when good cast members occasionally appear (Kay Place, Baker, Wilson). On the other hand, we have Casey Affleck, which is one of the best examples of why nepotism is on par with first-degree murder as a crime. I have rarely seen a more apathetic "actor"; a skinny, ugly imbecile who traces his lines sleepily, almost as if he pronounced them in an almost awakened near-sleep, plus that weak voice, one of the weakest male voices I've ever heard in my life. (He must have gone to the Latvian Performance School of Tobey Maguire). To turn this idiot into ANYTHING he says a lot about ANY movie, that is, about ANY director or producer. Therefore, Lisa Krueger is a waste of space without talent. We also have that imbecile who had the main role in the "Werewolf" simulated by MST3K; I think his name is Goran Vishnjic, but I'm not sure. Take a look at his ridiculous accent and mute speech.
