Here is another great film critic who will love it. The problem is that it is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The premise of the films is simple. Nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is. <br /> <br /> The first half has a lot of slaps, something very broad, while the second half is a descent driven by a character towards Fantasy and melancholy. <br /> <br /> The two halves just do not mix. The individual scenes work very well (the guys who crash in the house of a friend who has a new Filipino girlfriend are hilarious, while a later scene with the big guy who works in the restaurant pulls on the strings of the heart.) Simply they do not coincide with each other <br /> <br /> The film is also missing full configurations. One scene shows guys desperately looking for a change in a deserted vending machine to buy a sandwich. The next scene has the whole crew in motion sitting in a restaurant. Where did they get the dresses and the wigs? (The crew includes both the big guy and the dwarf) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the food? And the most disconcerting is why are they in friction? Clearly, they are boys in danger and, let's face it, is there something more memorable for witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf who eat a meal dressed as a woman? I mention the big guy and the dwarf because, apart from the old guy, everyone else seems to mix with each other. (In fact, they wear white outfits throughout most of the movie) The film has very little character development in the first half and, as a result, the second half really lacks an emotional hit. As we often try to find out who is who in their individual pay scenes. <br /> <br /> Speaking of a drag, the second half has all those wonderful camera shots and great emotional moments and a great symbolism that makes it a great movie. It's also terribly slow, which makes it a boring movie. <br /> <br /> 9 Souls is a big disappointment, the critics sprout on a great movie and it's there somewhere, good luck finding it yourself.
