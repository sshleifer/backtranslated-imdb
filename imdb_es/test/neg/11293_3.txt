Well, first of all I have not seen "The silence of the lambs" yet ... but, I think it would have made me sick if I had seen it before this piece. Not because of the appalling violence but because of the lack of everything else. Anthony Hopkins was very good like Hannibal and he really believed that he was as psychotic as he was playing himself but, by the reaction of the audience around me, the film was full of clich√©s of the "Silence" that left me lost in some places where others were laughing at what was on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now, I heard that the movie would be very scary and that if the director wanted to annoy people ... he did it ... but, only in 2 sequences? I mean, if you want it to be scary and I mean, so scary that you're going to play the movie outside of that ... you need more than 2 sequences ... I always see it as a movie that has to become that cinematic jewel that finally gets you It will take you to another place and time or it will go over (which most of the time is done with bad taste). But, this movie left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep sometimes. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are the stars of the movie, right? Well, with the exception of Hopkins, I did not feel this way ... Who cared about the stupid Italian police officer? I definitely did not do it. So, really the movie is left with a big hole talking about a guy who dies anyway. I mean, come on ... who cares? <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the movie is good if you want to see Reader and Starling one more time, but if you are going to have a good thriller ... You will skip once and you will be defeated maybe twice. It depends on your level. <br /> <br /> Thinking about the amount of money that this movie will bring ... probably another "Hannibal" will be made and this movie probably will not be in video until the fall. If you have to see it, wait and save $ 3.50 - $ 4.00 and get it on video. Do not spend a lot of money on this movie.
