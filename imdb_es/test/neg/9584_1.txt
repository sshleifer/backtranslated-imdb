This is a seedy movie, a simulator of a movie genre of surprise ending. And a genre that has been made much better before. The plot advances along, with a predictable ending. (Yawn) The characters are unpleasant, and some are so unpleasant that you can hardly see them. Matt Dillon, a fine and intense actor, is totally wrong here and is rigid and polite. The others are forgettable. Much of the dialogue is sophisticated, again a simulator that tries to be ingenious. I would not hire the writer to write my shopping list. Yes, it is so bad, that it goes from being misogynist to simply rude, like in the beyond of the fraternity house. With so much real talent out there, I'm really surprised that this movie was made. It shows the total lack of imagination of the office suits ...
