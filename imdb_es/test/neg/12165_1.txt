I love the work of Stephen Kings and the book was great, but I was very disappointed when I bought this film on DVD. This was one of the worst B movies I've ever seen. It feels like they have a tight schedule and they only took one opportunity in each scene, even if it turned out to be a bad one. And where did they find the actors?
