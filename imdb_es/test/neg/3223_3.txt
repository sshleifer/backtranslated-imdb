Well, I'm a big fan and follower of Elizabeth Berkley. I bought this on DVD outside of eBay for my boyfriends' birthday. We sat down to watch it and it was very boring. I do not remember laughing once. It only lasts about an hour and a half and it seems it will take forever to finish. Elizabeth is great at this, however. Maybe it's just because I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Berkley though. If I was not in it, I would not have seen it, but every time it appeared on my face it would light up. Unfortunately, even Elizabeth could not save this movie. Only the general story and the horrible comedy make this a movie that you would rather lose to lose an hour and a half of your life. It is a very forgetful movie.
