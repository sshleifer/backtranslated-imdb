Okay, imagine that all the US states UU., No, all countries have exactly the same trees that grow and the foliage of the soil. Imagine, too, that the camp of a monk hunter, so far from the marked route that you had to do in the first half of the approach by the river, has a perfectly paved and perfectly straight path that leads to it. Imagine a world where you have to wear a full biohazard suit to collect a diskette, then leave it in a ziploc bag and transfer it to your pocket without precautions as soon as you return to the office. A world where two nine-year-old girls are happy to donate a lot of blood without complaining. This is the world in which this film is developed. <br /> <br /> Besides that, it is one of the most clich√© excrement pieces that has been my misfortune to witness in many years. <br /> I liked it. :)
