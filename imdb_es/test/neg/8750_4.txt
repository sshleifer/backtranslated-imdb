For all its many shortcomings, I am inclined to be charitable with "Thing". Here is the nugget of an interesting, spooky and claustrophobic story in the style of Hitchcock. Put it in the hands of a writer like Theodore Sturgeon or (if you prefer the British perspective) Robert Bloch, or the guy who wrote "Day Of The Triffids," and you may have had a nasty and disturbing ghost story that was the best. thing in an anthology of books of horror stories and suspense. <br /> <br /> However, someone chose to tell this story as a long-running film and a second cheap class, and thus most of the potential is wasted. . A story like this really needs a voice like Sturgeon's to highlight interesting aspects of the character from a better perspective. His classic story "The -widget-, -wadget-, and Boff" is an example of how you can gather an isolated group of "ordinary" characters and in the space of 40 pages you can turn them into the most sympathetic and friendly ones. and the fascinating people you've met. A good writer can, with a few chosen words, make the reader "see" some of the most vivid and memorable events to scare their emotions. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a movie in which some of the most irritating and unpleasant characters that have been made are grouped together and made to interact in an unconvincing way "Where did that come from?" Moments that just stay there. (That is to say, the blonde psychic girl declares that "Everyone is evil and I hope they are destroyed!"). We get progress rhythm and slow motion blocking and boring sets and rigid actors. I blame the director for the 'rigid and superficial' part. All of these are 3rd rank actors who never got to the big time, but they are also "real" actors, and a good director could have got better performances from them. We call attention to the lesbian tones that make the viewer feel uncomfortable and exploited without offering any kind of reward. (If I'm going to exploit my lower instincts and feel guilty about that, I want them to do things better prepared than this.) And we got more than an hour of creepy accumulation spread in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anticlimaxes I've seen. <br /> <br /> Good things about "Thing"? Um, well ... some of the shots in the foreground of the witcher's head that silently uttered their directives were quite effective. The greedy and cunning widow sounded faithful to life (even if she wanted to put a sock in her mouth). The first scene in which the big, "simple" hand of the ranch quietly lights the greasy cowboy and kills him had a bit of an impact, because the plot had taken the trouble to establish the big guy as a rather sympathetic character. And as I said before, the idea of ​​an insidious force from the past that confronts the members of a community isolated from each other is good and can maintain interest far above the real merit of poor performance. <br /> <br /> What it definitely is. <br /> <br /> But, as I said, I am inclined to be charitable, because the director was probably working with a painful budget, time constraints and the best actors he could find for the money. Heaven knows how future generations will judge easy things like "The Cave", "Wrong Turn" or the remake of "House of Wax" in 40 years. I hope they are charitable for our own tastes by supporting the waste of films of our generations.
