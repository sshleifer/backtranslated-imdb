You have an hour and a half of braindead heads. I have to save the action of the world until the end, a line and a woman somewhere in the equation. This time he plays a guy who helps people in the witness protection program. To quote the cover of the film. Clears your past to save your future. Woppi, this has to be great :) I bet the younger people will like it, but it's a little over the top for my liking. And the phrases are really something else, and I do not mean that in a good way. After killing a crocodile he manages to say. "You're luggage" If you're in the right mood, you can enjoy the movie. And as for the action of the brain, this is not very bad. But almost before the movie starts, you know exactly what is going to happen. But if you like this type of movie, you will probably enjoy this one. I rate this movie 4
