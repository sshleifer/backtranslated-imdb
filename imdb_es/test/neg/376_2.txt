This is the best example I can think of to prove the theory that when Hollywood runs out of good ideas, they make a terrible sequel and ruin the first one. Now do not get me wrong, I love the first Beastmaster; I even liked the third quite good, but this movie is atrocious. I am a big fan of fantasy / sword and witchcraft and I hated to see such a terrible sequel made of a classic as the first Master of the beasts. So, why do I hate this movie so much? Well, where do I start? First of all, the whole idea of ​​the movie is ridiculous. Dar and his evil older brother Arklon (who is not mentioned anywhere in the first movie ... Huh?) Intersect in our world through a dimensional time portal door. You see, the Earth is simply on the same parallel interdimentional plane as the world of Dar. While with the first movie, you are made to think that the movie only takes place in the past, but with this one, you are shown to be a completely different world. That is one of the many things I hated about this. continuation. It did not work with "Masters of the Universe", and it sure does not work here either! Movies like this should take place and stay on your own timeline and in your usual environment. For God's sake, what's next? Hercules in New York ... er, uh ... a bad example! Continuing ... <br /> <br /> Arklon is looking for a device called a neutron detonator that is used as a threat against his enemies to rule his own kingdom. Then, it depends on Dar, his ferrets, his eagle and his tiger (it's not painted with spray this time) to go out and save the world ... but on the way they have the help of a young, great, and the daughter of The senator, who is caught in this mess and shows Dar for Los Angeles, takes him for a ride in his BMW and helps him out of difficult situations here and there. How convenient is not it? And speaking of convenience, I found it very convenient and easy for Arklon to sneak into a highly guarded military base and escape with a stolen and highly destructive nuclear weapon ... even with half the US Army. UU And L.A.P.D. after him ... very easy, even for a wicked barbarian sorcerer from another world. There are so many plot holes in this, I do not know where to start; like why did Arklon go to the zoo of L.A. at the end of the movie? He has absolutely no reason to go there; and would not that be the last place where you would attract your greatest enemy that has the useful ability to CONTROL ANIMALS? <br /> <br /> And you do not love this kind of movies where you describe the police as total idiots and even with half a dozen cops shooting a guy, still can not beat him? The police in this film belong to the series "Police Academy"! They are as useful in this film as reading glasses for the blind! Even the title of the film does not make sense: "Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time" ... they never went through a "time" portal because the film is not set in the future of the world of Dar, a world is set parallel along ours in the astral plane, so that they NEVER pass through time, only a dimensional world along their own; so there is NO real time travel involved! This movie tries to come out as funny and does it ... not because of humor, but because it's so bad ... and that's very soft. The acting, the dialogue, the plot, the characters and the ending are so funny that it's very funny. What else can I expect from the guy who brought us "Return of the Swampthing" (another bad sequel)? What we miss most here is the wonderful direction and the serious feeling of Don Coscarelli of the first! Avoid this stinking piece of garbage like the bubonic plague and hit the first and perhaps the third if there is nothing better on TV.
