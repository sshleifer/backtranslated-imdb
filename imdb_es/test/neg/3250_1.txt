This film surpasses everything there is. Well, it depends on what you're looking for ... it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. This movie is in its own complete league ... I do not think any film can get close to it. I'm not sure what the director intended to do as ... a thriller or a comedy. If he thought he was doing a thriller, then, luckily, he created one of the best Bollywood comedies of all time. You have to see it to believe it ... a matrix + terminator + a series of other films in one, along with a story that goes back to Hindi films of 1980, with an icchadhari naag (a mythical snake that can become a human). <br /> <br /> It is an ideal movie if you are sitting with a group of friends with alcohol aside, planning to laugh about the movie! I'm not sure if I give a 1 or a 10 ... Based on flipping a coin, I've decided to give it a 1!
