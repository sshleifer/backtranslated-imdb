Certain filmmakers can do nothing wrong in the eyes of national critics, which is why you should never pay attention to them. This movie is a perfect example. Critics like director Eric Rohmer. <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager ("Pauline") who cares during the summer and the relationships they have with some men. . It's talking, talking, talking and more talking. <br /> <br /> For those who look at the cover and expect to be exciting, there are some quick shots and a couple of bad words, but otherwise, this is a work of harmless French morals. A friend of mine lent me this tape. He thought he was getting a sexy French movie, and he was disappointed. I was just as disappointed because I was also very bored. <br /> <br /> How this gets so good reviews is almost unfathomable.
