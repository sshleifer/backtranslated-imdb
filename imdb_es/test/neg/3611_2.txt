George Sluizer of THE VANISHING fame (made the disturbing European original and the Hollywood remake) directed CRIMETIME. He should not be blamed for this confusing and poor film, because all the problems are found in the Brendan Somers script. It is poorly focused and lazily written. For example, the killer walks through a nightclub waiting for a victim, any victim, and starts talking to a teenager. Go to the next scene in which she tells the villain "I've told you everything about me, tell me about your life". Unfortunately, the girl told the villain her life story off the screen and is a terrible example that the screenwriter could not bring a character to life through dialogue. I know for sure how difficult this is, but for a script produced, the writer should have tried harder. <br /> <br /> It's hard to explain the message of the movie. In some points, it seems that it is a NATURAL BORN KILLERS that satans the voyeurism of the media with the crime (maybe it has even influenced the infamous video game MANHUNT), but the script is not ingenious enough to carry it out . When you have a sex scene that does not advance the plot or the characters or a subtext, you know that you have a badly written script and CRIMETIME is a badly written script
