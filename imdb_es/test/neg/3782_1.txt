This is a VERY bad movie. However, I read that it was done by a high school teacher, so maybe I should give him some praise for his ambitious (but terrible) special effects. Here's the plot: a monster emerges from a pile of garbage and pollution in the city of Milpitas, California, and embarks on a destructive uproar. I'm about to ruin the "big surprise" about the monster's appearance, so please read the rest at your own risk. You have been warned! The monster looks like a giant two-legged fly with a gas mask. In some scenes, the monster is an actor who wears a costume. In other scenes, the monster is created by stop-motion animation. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The plot is predictable. Keep away!
