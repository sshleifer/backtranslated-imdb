My qualifications for this review? I own all the Alien and Predator movies and I have and have read almost all the books that I can find that are related to this series. <br /> <br /> I can safely say that this movie is a stench. Save your money and do not waste your time. If you like mindless action, meaningless blood, no plot to talk and if you like Hollywood, watch the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a serious fan of the Alien series, send a message to the most crowded people, Costumes on Paid in Hollywood and 20th Century Fox and do not give them a dime. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many plot holes in it that you can strain the pasta. Read the other negative reviews to get the big picture, everything has been said accurately, so you do not have to repeat them. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are cardboard. You want them all dead. And, the film does not disappoint, almost everyone dies. Even the hot, blond with bubble head. Do you feel bad for her? No No plot, no character development ... who cares. The Predators are also idiots now. They scan everything but their own dead warrior. They're supposed to be a high-tech society, right? In the movie Predator, they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. The trophy kills. In AvP, they scanned Charles Weyland and let him go because he had Cancer. Major Plot hole! <br /> <br /> In addition, the R rating is due to the fact that they have children in the film who have a hugging face, a lot of blood and violence, and there is a scene in the hospital where a large pregnant woman is injected with bursts on the chest. She is implanted by Hybrid Alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a mouth-to-mouth love orgy and everyone is born in, say, 30 seconds. Gore sensational a lot, nothing more. These scenes are laughable, not serious. It is almost as if violence occurs and the Alien looks at the camera and waits for applause, a thumbs up or a nod of some kind. <br /> <br /> The Aliens in this movie are all on drugs that improve performance. They develop quickly and spread rapidly throughout the city, tons of them, everywhere in record generation time. Pathetic because it does not adhere to the story line of the series and does not add anything to the continuity of Aliens, Aliens Predator. <br /> <br /> I have noticed that the positive reviews are written by people who love gore. Funny. As a movie, as a continuation of the Aliens franchise and the development of the Aliens vs Predator franchise, this film is, at best, a clich√© of cheesecake. If you have faithfully followed this series, all the rules are broken and the Aliens and Predators are reduced to comic characters. <br /> <br /> There is not a fantastic and memorable action scene. There are almost no special effects worth remembering. There are no brand actors. The plot is as thin as the onion paper that finally ends with a "We have two options to get out of this mess ... The hospital or the center of the city!". I just got wet. The center of the city means that everyone will be attacked by the Big Brother who, somehow, knows that the city has been infested because it has an AWAC in the air that can see the infestation on a radar screen in the Red Spots of special effects. I almost fell out of my chair. Extra-terrestrial radar of special effects in an AWAC on Middle America. I'm breaking out laughing. <br /> <br /> Having to get to the helicopter platform made me choke on my popcorn. Has anyone played a game called ZOMBIES? You have to take your game pieces to the Helicopter Pad to win. I almost laughed. <br /> <br /> The ending is enough to make you shake your head in amazement. Who did 20th Century Fox hire to write this script? OH, OH, ask me ... a fifth grade student. There really can not be any other answer. Oh, yes, there may be another answer ... Low Budget Cheesecake Sci-Fi. <br /> <br /> The end? "Colonel Stevens takes the Predator pulse rifle to Ms. Yutani (Francoise Yip), she tells him that Earth is not ready for the technology it represents, Colonel Stevens knows that Yutani does not want the technology to be used in the Land". You're kidding me, right? Ms. Yutani? Who is Ms. Yutani? (forshadow: Weyland-Yutani: The Corporation) She is in the film exactly 2 seconds and yet, in her infinite wisdom of the Far East, she says that the world is not ready for technology. Seriously??!! The brothers Dweebs (Strause) as directors? Who is responsible for this hemorrhaging-abortion of a movie? They are the Doug and Bob McKenzie of the directors and, nevertheless, Fox entrusted them with the Alien franchise. They are promoted as experts in special effects and, however, the film is all low-budget special effects. Hmmm, I see a pattern. He laughs <br /> <br /> This movie is only made to empty your wallet. It does not serve any other purpose. It has no plot. It has no major characters worth mentioning. It is disconnected. It does not adhere to any of the principles of character established in previous films. It does not do anything to advance the franchise. The special effects are lame, minimal and low budget. And, there's no end to talking about that. It is low budget and strictly designed to take your hard earned money. Nothing else. <br /> <br /> Save your money. Or you see it on television where it will end very quickly. Buy a bootleg or lose this bleeding ulcer completely. There is a reason why Fox did not preview the film to critics. Critics would have eaten this mess alive and nobody would have gone to the theaters to see it. JR Giger, the original creator, is in this very moment, leaning over a toilet spilling his lunch. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox, this movie stinks. It's as bad or worse than Alien 3. You insult us. <br /> <br /> Wash now ...
