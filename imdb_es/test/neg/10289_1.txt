This is a snuff film. I'm surprised that you even consider yourself in the IMDb library. And, Bill, Julia and all the other "professional" actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick movie. I thought I was going to see a somewhat classic horror film with a creative ending that writers like to invent ... that usually makes no sense when writing a horror movie, but as spectators, we try to rationalize and understand. This ending was not creative. He was sick and has all the characteristics of a snuff film. I am surprised that it has been published for this end, and I am more surprised that it is available for distribution at the end of June 2009. It should not be shown in a theater. It is detrimental to innocent minds on many levels ... see the movie, the ending, and you will understand this affirmation. In addition, in the plot is a sweet girl "who has not yet 9", says his character. She is not at the end of the snuff, but it is an integral part of the movie. Why do directors feel they need to be shocked by a sick movie to gain recognition? The director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks this is an art movie.
