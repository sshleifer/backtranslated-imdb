By Randolph Scott's standards of the 1950s, this is a disappointing and heavy-handed western star. You could do without two or three of the characters, while two or three could receive more prominence. (Humor needs to be completely rewritten). De Toth handles the action well, as always, but his understanding of the general narrative is weak.
