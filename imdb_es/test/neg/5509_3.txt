Okay, nobody will confuse this with Citizen Kane, but you must love a movie in which women always topless. There are some cat fights and some sex too. On the other hand, I hope you have not paid too much for the boy who wrote the dialogue. Here is a good example. After one of the captive girls dies: <br /> <br /> "This is terrible, it reminds me of the day Zenobia died" "A relative?" "No, my favorite cow." I guess they saved some money on the script and made it explode into big special effects like that plastic crocodile. I will say that it took me three sessions to overcome this excellent work of art, never a good sign. I guess that's what happens after a time when everything seems the same. I hope that the people who hope to rent it do not get impatient. Do not worry, people are on the way.
