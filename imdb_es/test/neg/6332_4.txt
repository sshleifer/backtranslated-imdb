I have to say that I am a big fan of these scams of 'The Last House on the Left', even the ones that most people seem to hate are often very dear to me; but one of these types of movies that I did not like very much was 'Night Train Murders' by Aldo Lado, and unfortunately it seems that the trains and The Last House on the Left do not mix, since Terror Express is another disloyal scam. off. Something that this type of film really needs is a starkly unpleasant protagonist; and although Terror Express offers three possible candidates, none of them takes charge and becomes this villain, leaving aside the lack in the most important area. Actually, it has a good start since three young men in a passenger train begin to slightly irritate the guests on board. This leads the audience to believe that there is more in the store, but unfortunately it never gets going once the scene has been established. From there, the trio ends up 'taking' the train and uses its new power to terrorize the guests and rape the women. <br /> <br /> It must be said that there is a lot of squalor in this movie, which will be pleasing to many viewers; but there is almost no blood. The director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes, and he may have got away with it too; If I could shoot a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men have taken the train by force vanishes once it reaches sex, since the people you expect to be powerful and strong seem very willing to show their women a good time and, despite it, A very docile sandwich sequence, none of the sex is particularly interesting. Since much of the film is occupied by these sex scenes, this becomes a massive problem. Movies like this often lack style, suspense and credibility; but you know you're seeing a bad when you get bored. As expected, none of the performances is anyone's thing; And the three centrals, in particular, stand out as being garbage. The address lacks style, and there is very little tension or suspense; Making it difficult to take care of what is going to happen. In general, this is a pretty bad example of an exploitation film, and I can not recommend it.
