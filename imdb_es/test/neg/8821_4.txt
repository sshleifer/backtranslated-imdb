I had heard a lot of bad things about this movie before I saw it, but I thought that all the negative comments were probably due to the low budget and poor performance of the movie, both of which I can deal with when it comes to zombie movies. However, I did not expect this movie to be really boring; If there is one thing you can tell about low budget zombies, their blood and entertainment, but unfortunately, this movie does not have any. I'm quite surprised, because the two previous horror films I've seen from director Bob Clark, Deathdream and Black Christmas, were very clever and entertaining movies, but Children Should not Play with Dead Things just does not do it. The plot line follows a group of young adults who travel to a funeral island to get into the rituals and bring the dead back to life. However, they soon learn that playing with things they do not understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island come back to enjoy their blood. <br /> <br /> It seems that the plots could lead to a decent movie, but what I did not mention is that the interesting parts do not start until the last twenty minutes; and since this is a ninety-minute movie, I'm sure you can guess that this is not a good thing. The opening time and ten minutes are completed with bad performance and even with worse characters. I can understand how to set up a situation so that the horror is more powerful once it is presented; But please, if you're going to spend so much time on that, you really have to make it interesting. All the characters in the film are exaggerated and annoying, and personally I just wanted the zombies to hurry up and eat them. The film does not stop having its merits, however, since the atmosphere is outstanding. Lucio Fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and zombies that eat meat can be combined well; But Bob Clark already did it with this movie. The direction is not bad either, but it is affected by the bad effects of makeup and a clear lack of blood, which probably will not please fans of zombie movies. In general, I really can not recommend this movie; but if you're a zombie fan, you can get a kick.
