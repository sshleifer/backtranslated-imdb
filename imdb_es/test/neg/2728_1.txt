It's a little hard to believe that this came from the same director that HELLRAISER gave us. Where is the style, the feeling and the charm? I mean, HELLRAISER is not a great horror movie, but at least it had something. NIGHTBREED is like a big ball of bad ideas badly executed. From the opening there is a problem with subtlety: the monsters are shown in the first shot! The sequence of the opening dream shows too much for too long. Our hero does not show professional acting skills (but nobody expected that from this bastard genre). There are murders that one would like them to be more interesting. Then we have David Cronenberg. Man was never really destined to be an actor. He adequately fulfills the role of the chilling psychiatrist, but what he should have done was to get behind the camera and save this mess. Then we came to Midian, a spooky and spooky graveyard with a fake door too spooky. This is not a great improvement over the cemetery in PLAN 9 FROM THE OUTER SPACE. It gets worse when we meet the creatures in it. There's nothing really wrong with the character's design and makeup effects here (well ... except for the guy without the scalp, the guy with the pointed chin and forehead, and the fat man with dark circles around the eyes ), The problem is the way they act and the terrible dialogue that is given to them. Barker's photograph of the underground city is tired and this part of the story could have been greatly improved. Some could call what follows SPOILERS. After our hero dies and becomes a "night shift", we wait to see what he will become (talk about flying things and werewolves), but when the time comes to change, they apparently thought his hero was too nice to give a decent creature design. With the turn in the "character" of Cronenberg, the story becomes less interesting until the battle of the monsters against the rules (which is simply bad). Barker's mythology failed him here. There is no genius and little originality behind NIGHTBREED. The image could have used a bigger budget, a serious script and a character design that does not leave you saying "oh ... oh, how silly". What a waste. It is not scary, not cold, not even very dark, just weak.
