Some of the supporting actors try, very hard. And the camera shots in the desert are pretty beautiful. Otherwise, this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> William Shatner's character, Harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. He is also a psychopath, a man who literally escapes from a mental institution. The objective of this film is that amateur writers are psychopaths? Harvey will do anything to make his script read and become a movie, even if that means taking a film crew hostage. Do the amateur writers ... crawl? Maybe they will. <br /> <br /> The movie's configuration is too long. We did not reach the point of history until well into the second half. The first half of darts and flits between varied characters. <br /> <br /> "Shoot Or Be Shot" is touted as a comedy, but I did not find it funny. The dialogue does not contain subtext. None of the characters are credible as real people. All are stick figures that perform "action" in a way that resembles cartoon characters. In fact, the film is basically a caricature for adults: stupid, inane, apathetic. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some actors are in this movie. They need money or exposure. But what are the initiates Shatner and Harry Hamlin doing here? Maybe Shatner wants more comedy roles. Is this the best you can do? Is Hamlin desperate for money? I used to be a respected actor. What happened? <br /> <br /> Although the story is supposed to be a satire, it appears more as a disdain for amateur writers. Maybe that was not the intention. But that's how you can interpret the movie. As such, the script was very, very badly written.
