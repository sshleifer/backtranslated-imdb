The film starts quite promising, the use of images and simple short clips convey the bigger story, which would normally need a considerably higher budget than here. However, I began to worry as it continued, combined with another voice too hoarse Max Payne about the film that began to look not so good. I hoped it was just the introduction to the story. <br /> <br /> The story is what really caught me and led me to this movie. The idea that a research scientist has created a virus that actually protects the cells it infects from other infections was an interesting scientific idea. Then, the subjects who had the strangest disorders, looked for the scientist and offered to perform their human experiments, made me think that this could be a very good little movie. However, the introduction had not gone well. <br /> <br /> There seemed to be a change of pace when the film went into recorded interviews with the four main characters of the film, the test subjects. Although the performance was not excellent, there seemed to be a lot of room for the development of the character throughout the film, and the recordings were made quite well with a varied mix of characters. However, these faded through the movie. They were not used again after a few short clips and I felt that there was a missed opportunity to provide great character development when reflecting on them, however it was not. <br /> <br /> The images are disconnected more and more from the story, often repeated to represent something that is still happening. This disconnection and repetition is reflected in the annoying and distracting comment. He began reciting words one after the other. Short sentences, meaningless and without reciting scientific ramblings that are too relevant or interesting. If there was something to describe, four or five words would be used, it was too long, repetitive, circular, looped ... you are getting an idea. <br /> <br /> Now this could have been to reflect the confusion and the character, slowly caught in their own thoughts, rambling because of the lack of food and water. What he really did was cause me to disconnect completely from the voice and in the final stages of the film I discovered that I had not been listening to some of the ramblings. <br /> <br /> Several times In the event of an event, the camera shows all the characters one after the other for their reaction, which seems to be somewhere between confused and reflective. There are repeated fades of the same scene to the same scene, for example, a sleeping character fades to black, then vanishes again in the character that sleeps again. Look, we know that the character is asleep, we know that time has passed, please keep going. In general, there are too many atmospheric cuts and long, hanging shots to complete the time. <br /> <br /> The performance was not bad, and the characters were fine, but they were not exploited or developed. When they were interacting, there were some really cringeworthy moments. For example, when one of them asks if he is hungry, the camera looks at each one of them and returns to a group shot, they stop, look at each other, return to the camera and slowly say "No". He raised a giggle or two. Their dialogue was slow, brilliant and, either completely missing or totally unnecessary, there did not seem to be a middle point in which the dialogue was located. <br /> <br /> However, there were some good scenes, but they really were. It's hard to find unless you've seen them in isolation, and this is what seems to have happened with this movie. The film has been seen as a series of scenes and not as a complete story. <br /> <br /> Nowhere is this seen more than in the main story. The characters are infected with the virus that has been killing the animals, the one that was being designed for them. They tell us that it develops in stages to something dramatic, and that is what we expect. What we get is that the characters eat a lot together, everyone vomiting together, the water that comes out of their mouths in unconvincing currents, then everyone falls asleep, these are the phases that really happen at the beginning of the movie. Then, everyone says "OK" together when they are asked how they are, and that's it. That is the virus done, nothing else happens. <br /> <br /> Much more could have been done with this movie, much more developed with the virus and protecting them from all kinds of damage. I could have explored a serious change of these characters as they got infected and took care of them, I could have developed these characters, show them making decisions and do things that connect to their character that is shown in flashbacks to interviews. <br /> <br /> The ending is not even confusing, intriguing or stimulating. It just shows something that happens and that's it, although in a long and extensive style with the irritating voice above it. I really struggled with this movie and saw several members of the Press leave (including a famous television critic who was leaving in the first twenty minutes), I stayed, but I regretted the lost time.
