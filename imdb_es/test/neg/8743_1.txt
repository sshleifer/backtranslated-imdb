Boy Oh Boy, this movie stinks. This movie is one of the worst pieces of garbage I've seen in my entire life. Please, even if your life depends on it, DO NOT DO IT, and I repeat: NOT under any circumstances, see this horrible piece of garbage. Just look at this when it's presented as an episode of MST 3000. That was the only way I could sit through the whole thing. If I had to see it without that program, I would have stopped seeing it before it was over. It has only one use: a cure for insomniacs!
