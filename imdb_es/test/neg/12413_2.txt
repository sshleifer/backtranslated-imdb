Actually, not so much for this movie ... whether it's a doubles driver or a collection racer has a car on fire at the beginning of the movie, goes to the bar, is approached by a gang of motorcyclists that ruins their possibilities with a very charming lady, offer him a job, he returns to his place, refuses, the police asks him to accept his things. What happens is a very annoying little movie in which the hero does not do much, a gang of motorcyclists that can kill and, for some reason, the police can not impose a crime on him. I'm not sure why the biker did what she did in the end, but it's a bad movie, there are always scenes that make little sense. I'm still trying to figure out if I heard it wrong when they said that the hero of the piece was a double car driver. You may have told the driver of a stock car because a stunt rider would be running and I would not think it would be so weird for a stunt car to crash. The actors are bad, and all the cyclists are quite annoying and the hero is a bit incompetent ... actually this movie is not full of kicks, but it is the worst.
