I saw this on the science fiction channel, so I knew it would be bad to start, but I was surprised at how much worse I expected. The CG effects on the dragon were terrible, even for the science fiction channel and the writing was pathetic. I could not tell if this was supposed to be as stupid as a joke or if it just came out that way. The only redeeming quality of this film is that it is so terrible that it is almost funny, especially in the part where the character of Patrick Swayze's gentleman goes home with his father Knight who retired after losing his legs and is now in bed with his armor for the sole purpose of letting the public know he was a gentleman. Most of the film focuses on a huge dragon egg that turns into a not so huge baby dragon with some of the worst CGI I've ever seen in my life. This was just horrible.
