I can not believe I'm wasting my time with a comment, but this movie is strangely bad. If 20 different directors were brought in to film different parts of the film without having any idea of ​​the story that the other directors are filming, this is the result I would expect. <br /> <br /> I also think that some scenes were spliced ​​out of order, things do not always seem to progress in order. The movie acts as if we knew we know half of the characters. <br /> <br /> And Steve Guttenberg tries to make a maniacal and Robin Williams comedy in this movie. Ewww. And the whole premise of putting an ex-convict in charge of a group of children just does not seem realistic at this time.
