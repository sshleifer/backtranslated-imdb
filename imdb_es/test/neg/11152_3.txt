I was waiting to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger's return to action after the sad films he had made after "Eraser". "End of the days", however, can be added to the sad films in which he has had the bad luck to appear. <br /> <br /> "End of days" starts off well with a sequence of grabbing action, but it quickly becomes a bore, diverting attention from action and suspense and, instead, concentrating on research of demonic events and the approaching millennium (read "Doomsday"). <br /> <br /> The performances are obsolete, the special effects more or less, and the gore abound. If I considered myself a Schwarzenegger fan, I could not believe that I did not like this movie, but with such a horrible and unconvincing script, what could Arnie have done, besides having passed on to this turkey? <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 <br /> <br />
