Technically I'm a fan of Van Damme, or I was. This movie is so bad that I hated myself for losing those 90 minutes. Do not let the name of Isaac Florentine (Undisputed II) deceive you, I had high hopes for this, depending on what I saw in (Undisputed II), man ... I was wrong? all the fans of the action wanted a great return for the classic hero of the action, but I guess we can not see it soon, since our hero keeps coming with those (going to the border - far from the city and murderer - those bad - back-home-movies-I mean, for God's sake, we're in 2008, and insist on making those disappointing movies at all levels. Why ??!!! Do yourself a favor, skip ... seriously.
