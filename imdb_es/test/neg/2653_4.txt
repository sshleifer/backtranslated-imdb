I really like Harrison Ford, so I rented this movie with enthusiasm only to be disappointed minute after minute. Mr. Ford seemed to be walking through very warm waters in search of a place to urinate. His co-star was very good and had the best lines. The story intrigued me, but the mistake, BIG MISTAKE, since everyone is identified through a driver's license or passport before boarding any US commercial aircraft, left in my mind numerous questions of conspiracy. <br /> <br /> I could have worried less about these people. In fact, the secondary plot of the Internal Affairs investigation was more interesting than the two lovers killed while flying first class to Miami. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the director, Sydney Pollack, who gave us the classic Tootsie and other movies. This is a waste of time and energy.
