I've had this movie, in the back of my head, I saw it. I've wanted to tell people over and over again, but I never remembered it. Now I found it now, finally, I can tell people what is the worst, the most horrible movie I've seen in my entire life, without exception. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete garbage, and it is not suitable for a dumpster. . All prints and other copies of this film should be rounded, loaded on a large rocket and thrown into the sun. Only the purifying heat and the pressure of the sun could purify the materials in which this film is stored, so that they can be useful for the universe again. <br /> <br /> I like movies. I like bad movies And yes, this is an opinion. but this movie was pure garbage, filth and excrement of some beast that should never be seen, let alone named by man. <br /> <br /> I would rather see a marathon from the Uwe Boll movie than see this movie. And I hate the Uwe Boll movies.
