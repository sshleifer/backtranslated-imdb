This movie was pure genius. John Waters is brilliant. It's hilarious and I'm not fed up with that, even after I've seen it about 20 times since I bought it a few months ago. The acting is great, although Ricki Lake could have been better. And Johnny Depp is magnificent. He is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor. And watching most of Johnny's movies, this is probably my favorite. I give it 9.5 / 10. Rent it today!
