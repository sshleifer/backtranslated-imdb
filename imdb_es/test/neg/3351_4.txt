When you look at the cover and read information about it, a completely different type of film comes to your mind than the one you get here. On the other hand, maybe I read the summary of the other movie called "Mausolem", since there were two films of this title that were released almost at the same time, with two graphics that had key elements in common. However, when reading things about that movie here, I know that I saw this and not that one and that movie is even less than one could imagine that it would be a movie with that title. I'll be honest, I hope more of a zombie type image and to a certain extent you get it in this movie. However, there are more things related to occult and strange powers, as witnessed by the opening scene of the people who are removed by the examining magistrate at the beginning of the film. The film also has the old theme that children who go somewhere they do not belong to have a crazy party, in this case it is in fact a mausoleum. The other movie that I do not think really has that key feature that plays that prominent role in the movie and I see that the score for this is also higher, even so, it just was not the movie I was expecting.
