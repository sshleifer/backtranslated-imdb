How dare you? Adam Low, without apparent shame, puts his name to this false tribute. It is not even a study, analysis or serious comment of the great work of Visconti. Yes, it's long and portentous, yes, we have some wonderful clips from the movies that, most people interested in the subject, have already seen. But what resonates the longest leaving the most lasting impression is gossip. The last and loudest voice comes from a third-rate German actor, ranting and delirious. The appropriately named Mr.Low directed this, hoping, I imagine, to get better grades than his previous one, more to the point, but a deadly boring documentary about Kurosawa. Well, I have news for you, Mr. Low and your companions. You lost a great opportunity and I will not give you another.
