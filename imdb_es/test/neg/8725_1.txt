It's a weird and weird movie and it does not deserve a better grade than David Lynch! The special effects are badly made, the actors are mainly bad and in this film it is not a race that is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the dominators, but it seems to be a crazy movie, which pays homage to the type sect of organizations. Surely not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the six-part epic! Look at David Lynch's, it's the perfect tribute to novels!
