This movie lacks everything. Except Bobby deol, who in his own standards is mediocre, nobody in this movie has approached to act in a single scene. Kangana is completely false in her performance. <br /> <br /> The great Anupam Kher has a special appearance and is better in those 2 minutes than Bobby in the whole movie. Music does not complement the movie <br /> <br /> as well. The contrast in music between Bobby and Upen does not stand out as well. Great concept gone completely wrong. The movie does not have an adequate ending. Please, do not waste your time like I did in this movie.
