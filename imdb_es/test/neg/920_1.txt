This is absolutely horrible. It is everywhere and nowhere and does not have any kind of point. I have never understood what is good about Jeff Garlin or Sarah Silverman. Bonnie Hunt is so above this nonsense that she must have been a personal friend with the people involved because there is no way that she has read any part of this so-called "script" and thought, "Yes, I want to do that!" In most movies I can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or fun. There is ZERO of that in this. It is extremely silly. There really is no other word to describe this. This is possibly the biggest waste of money making a movie I've seen in a long time. Skip this at all costs, you'll be glad you did.
