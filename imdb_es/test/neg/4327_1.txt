I felt as if the two hours I spent watching this movie could have been better served perhaps by going to the used local bookstore and looking for old fashion magazines and Halston ads. Or maybe looking at the dry paint. Those two jobs would have at least compromised my mind a bit more than "India Song". The most frustrating part of sitting through this was that I could see what environments / atmospheres were trying to be created and the idea of ​​these could have been interesting if they had developed further. Instead, what happened was a presentation of an incoherent and stupid chain of events, with the same scenes repeated over and over again to give a point to our senses. <br /> <br /> I did not like to spend more time on this movie when writing any kind of review, except perhaps to warn others against this waste of time.
