The screen treatment of the Broadway comedy hit "The Gay Divorce" (a title that was considered too outrageous for American viewers, although it was used in the UK) refers to a man and a woman (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) who are in shameful circumstances while she is in the process of divorcing her spouse; they dance, they discuss, they make up, they dance, they argue a little more and they dance a little more. Betty Grable is very attractive in a brief moment (singing and dancing in the number "Let's K-nock K-nees" with Edward Everett Horton openly sissified), but the star couple looks distressed and unhappy. The surroundings are sophisticated, but the characters are only one-dimensional. * 1/2 of ****
