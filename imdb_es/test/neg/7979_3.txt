This was my first "Bollywood" movie and I found it in the same way that many other recent viewers did, through "Ghost World". Having read a bit about the Bollywood film industry this week, I understand a little why there are seemingly unrelated musical, romance and comedy numbers in a horror movie. But "Something for everyone" does not always translate into a cohesive product. <br /> <br /> The number of musical dance "Jaan Pehechaan Ho" is a subject that could not have done. in 1965. Now it's all over the Internet, with many people struggling for a good English translation. Laxmi Chhaya does an incredible job dancing after take, making everything look fresh, new and fun, even when a normal person would run out. She sends! <br /> <br /> On the beach with Miss Kitty is a light and pretty fun, in total contrast to the horror plot. Even so, I find myself singing in Hindi a week later. I found an approximate translation: <br /> <br /> if you want to live in this life, then listen to what I say, leave your sorrows behind and join the party. Follow my advice <br /> <br /> Those who want to live live with laughter and singing, relax and relax the people of this world, what do you know? come to me and I'll explain to you <br /> <br /> whoever sees me, will stop worrying in this world where fish swim freely here and there <br /> <br /> My second favorite number in the movie is The butler's dream, where Mehmood is fascinated by Miss Kitty's dance. The tiki-type electric idols are wonderfully sticky, as is the whole set of this number. Online, I saw it described as what would happen if "Liberace vomited" !! Very funny. <br /> <br /> Gumnaam is not a good movie in general. That's why I gave him a grade of 3. He's actually a stinker from a movie with some funny and kitsch musical numbers that have nothing to do with the plot of the murder.
