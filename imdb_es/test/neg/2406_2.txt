This movie is worse than Cat People, which I saw during the same week. It has all the style of the 80's. The punk rockers of MTV, the real ones who are antisocial, are not the commercial type of PC of today, boys of the fraternity and a bad guy called Splater. I really like Splater, and the movie feels that blue lighting of the 80s, but the rest looks like a low Canadian budget. I have seen a lot of this while living in this great country, and I realize that this kind of movies were made due to tax deductions. Avoid at all costs.
