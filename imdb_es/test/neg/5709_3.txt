I really can not see how anyone can have any interest in watching this movie. A woman meets a man, he also wants to play, she, but only until she realizes what is being lost. She leaves, and that's it. It took 9 1/2 weeks before Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) left John (Mickey Rourke). She should have left it after 30 minutes and end our misery.
