The previews were so funny that I could not wait to see this movie. I just got home and I must say that I could not have been more embarrassed with this movie. Yes, there were times when the jokes were funny, but the stereotyped roles were painful. Joan Plowright is a good actress, but the scene with the "spiritual black" was in bad taste. Needless to say, the laughter was few and far between in the movie theater for a mostly white crowd (I was one of the few blacks).
