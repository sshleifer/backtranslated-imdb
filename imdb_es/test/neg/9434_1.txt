Can there be a worse movie? Even Ed Wood, at his worst, could not think of something so bad. Cheesy, stupid, long-winded, ridiculous ... and those are the good points. I saw this crap in the early '80s when, to begin with, it was incredibly boring and, in fact, I sat through the whole untapped affair, although that would probably have been a more pleasurable experience. Actually I remembered it because it was so bad. Somehow, it saddens me because some of the best directors started making films for television (ie, Spielberg) and it was a wonderful way for them to get their initial material to the public, but this shit just killed everyone. process.
