Well, we have JP from Grandma's Boy and Chuck from, well Chuck. I thought this movie would be pretty good based on the reviews, and it started quite high on my movie scale, but in the middle it only lasted for so long that I kept losing interest. I really got bored, probably because you can see immediately what's going to happen at the end; The story is quite simple, I jumped more than 15 minutes and I did not miss anything. This movie should have been a short work, maybe around 45 minutes to an hour at the most. It starts well and finishes well, pity that the filling is tasteless, dull, dull, and lacks everything but time. Some people say that they like music; I do not like jazz and I'm not going to watch movies because of their score, I'm going through the story and when that goes on ... well, grades fall in my book. <br /> <br />: Good opening, great closing, boring filling. The story was great, but if you do not know what's going to happen in a quarter of the way, you have not seen too many thrillers.
