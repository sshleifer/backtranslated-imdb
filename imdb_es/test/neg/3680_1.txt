If they had a zero of 10, I would enter it. Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed to take money from the public. I do not know how movies like this premiere on Video or Pay Channel. I'm disappointed with Vincent Gallo. Val Kilmer was there for about 8 minutes, so I can not get so mad at him. Only the person who included him to be the star in him. It's like Marlon Brando in Superman. There is no plot, except Gallo, who seeks and finds his friend in the catacombs. Why they were looking for the doors of hell that only the director knows. They should have kept this film in Moscow and burned it to the fire to keep all the homeless extras warm for the night. There is nothing more to say about this film that all the other critics have written. I wish I could forget this movie that hurts my brain.
