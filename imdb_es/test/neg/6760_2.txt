This film is a 50s science fiction meal. To its credit, the plot manages to achieve an alien invasion without actually producing the aliens. But now, if extraterrestrials needed energy and could absorb it from sources such as hydrogen bombs, why would they come to Earth? Why would not they just suck it from a STAR? The only credible reason for the presence of Kronos is a direct attack on the society of the Earth, not the mere gathering of energy. None of that is even hinted at; Kronos may have been built by a superior race, but its activities on Earth are the most primitive. The end that the hero-scientists plan for Kronos is based on nothing but pseudoscientific inconsistencies. This amounts to the tactic of "reverse polarity", which has been used in both bad science fiction and has become a joke in itself. Come down and behold, this makes our unwanted visitor release their collected energy. No one in power seems to worry about the impact that the release of so much energy (which by the end of the movie includes, among other things, the total performance of a hydrogen bomb) will be in the vicinity. And unfortunately, by the time the movie ends, the surroundings are the suburbs of Los Angeles. Whoops!
