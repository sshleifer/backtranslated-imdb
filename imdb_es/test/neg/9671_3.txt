Entertainment similar to Disney with some moments of graphic violence and similar sexual references to Disney. Bad comedy next to moralization full of clich√©s. Noah as Abraham, Lot as his evil friend. Special effects laughable. Exaggerated acting with bad timing. Sodom and Gommorah were destroyed before the flood? Strange twists and too many subplots that the Bible does not mention. God as a dubious father who just needs to be entertained whistling before deciding that the world has to be saved from disaster. <br /> <br /> The film's wannabee director B, John Irvin, adds another failure to his useless list of misdirected films that are seriously lacking in plot and direction.
