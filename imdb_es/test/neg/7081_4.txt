As a documentary, this is ridiculous in a kind of countryside: a collection of recreated biblical pictures mixed with solemn interviews of so-called "experts". Think of it as an infomercial that pushes Jesus instead of the thigh masters. <br /> <br /> However, the detailed scene of the crucifixion is, in terms of historical accuracy, superior to similar scenes in wide-screen Hollywood extravaganzas like "Ben-Hur", "King of Kings" and " The Greatest Story Ever Said. " Instead of dragging all his cross to Golgotha, for example, John Rubinstein simply carries his cross beam tied on his shoulders to his outstretched arms. The nails are not passed through your palms but through your wrists. Their feet are not nailed separately, but one is placed over the other so that only one nail needs to be used. By the way, Rubinstein's flogging before his crucifixion ranks 35th in the book, "Lash! The one hundred scenes of men whipped in the movies." which probably is not true to the shameful reality of the Roman crucifixions, but concessions must be made. Interestingly, the "good" thief is placed in the left hand of Jesus, which goes against a long tradition. However, just why this thief is played by a plump and overweight man is a mystery, especially in view of the fact that the "bad" thief is something of a "fool".
