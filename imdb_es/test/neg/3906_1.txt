I saw this movie partly because of some positive comments here on IMDb. After wishing I had recovered those 90 minutes of my life, I feel it is my duty to come up here and say ... Please, do not bother to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I can not argue. The efforts of the actors: they did what they could with the material, but that material is terrible. The rhythm was deadly: slow, meandering, and you saw everything approaching an hour away, and then it took forever to happen. The dialogue was boring, meaningless, nothing funny. The characters were completely unfriendly. And the cinematography was, in my opinion, of very low quality: the clich√© of "the character uses the domestic video machine!" I was used to a very bad effect. <br /> <br /> Yes, Jeri Ryan is a great person. Do not let that fool you and waste your time in this movie.
