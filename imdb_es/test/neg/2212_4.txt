Yes, it may not be for adults, and some adults may find it stupid, but if you do not think about it it's really not that bad. <br /> <br /> The story has Alvin and his gang, crossing the world, looking for jewelry for a bad person, and the misadventures they come in contact with. <br /> <br /> So the animation is good, and the story is beautiful, and the songs are forgettable but it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 6 out of 10 or 4 out of 4 stars.
