This Asterix is ​​very similar to modern Disney cartoons. No soul, technically good and the usual jokes for adults. Maybe it's because this is the first caricature I saw after Laputa: Castle in the Sky, but it was quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> The plot is designed and is forgettable, but it implies that Asterix and Obelix go to the territory of the Vikings to rescue a spoiled teenager who then learns humility and also finds love. Oh, and at first they do not get along, but after facing adversity, they all share a deep bond of friendship ... yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> It's best to be careful with the jokes. The Vikings get all the best. Like Vikea (the Viking chief's wife) who gives a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next raid. Or the Vikings without knowing the meaning of mercy (literally). Oh, and Olaf, the dumbest Viking, is actually hilarious (both for the voice acting and the dialogue). <br /> <br /> For example, on board the Viking ship: (After a speech by Abba, the captain's daughter) Olaf: Who is this new boy? Captain: That's my daughter, brains of cod! Olaf: Your ... daughter is ... a man?
