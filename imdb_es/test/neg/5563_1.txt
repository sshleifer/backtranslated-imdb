What should I say? I only saw this movie out of curiosity, and it's really a shame ... I grew up in Brittany with stories of Celtic legends, and I spent 5 years in Rennes, the city where this movie is said to take place ... Shame No actor No camera of this movie came to Rennes. They could have at least chosen a probable city, or a probable forest, but nothing SEEMS like Brittany or Rennes ... And calling it a film about Celtic legends is really making a fool of the audience. Besides those details, it could have been a good movie, but it sucks. Silly stage, silly characters and without originality. Definitely to avoid.
