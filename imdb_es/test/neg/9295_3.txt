**** Contains Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I waited for this show to finally turn on to see it. I recorded it to be able to watch it several times, and there is something in this program that really bothers me! <br /> <br /> I recognize that this was a movie made for television. Not only that, but it was made for Lifetime, which is a channel that I despise. Because it was made for television, I can ignore the huge holes in the plot. I can ignore the massive lack of character development in the character of Ally Sheedy. I can overlook the fact that George C. Scott and Rachael Leigh Cook, both very talented actors, definitely did not reach the best of their abilities. I can see beyond the fact that the character of Don Diamont was so clich√©, that you knew that when you saw him he was the villain. I can even ignore the obvious error in the timeline (she was raped during her winter vacation and then, more than a year later, she took her baby out). <br /> <br /> The most important thing I can not understand. Once this is over: there are two trials for the custody of the child. In the first trial, custody is granted to the father of the child because he is "better educated, has a community college degree and has a full-time job". In the second trial, the trial is reversed because the judge considers that evidence is missing that Emma (RLC's character) is an inadequate mother, and custody should not be taken from the primary caregiver and given to someone without prior interaction with the child . <br /> <br /> The problem is this: nowhere in the course of these tests is the fact that a 30-year-old man raped a 15-year-old girl and took her into consideration. If it was a rape or not, he had sex with a minor! Will not that be taken into consideration when the judge chooses him for custody because he is a "mature adult"? Mature adults do not have sex with minors! <br /> <br /> It's not the worst cable movie you'll ever see, but it's not a great show either. ** outside ****
