After completing the mediocre novel, Heart of Darkness, I went to see the film, which was a complete and absolute disappointment. At first, I expected the movie to help put together the puzzle of a book. However, even though I had read the novel, the film still did not make any sense, so I can not imagine how lost it would be if I had skipped the book altogether. It seemed that the writers chose their favorite parts and put them in the film, and omitted anything that could help viewers understand the meaningless plot. This terrible movie did not make any sense at all, and I would strongly recommend that you not watch it, as it will only leave you completely bewildered and bewildered.
