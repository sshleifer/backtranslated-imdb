I saw part of the first part of this film and small fragments of other parts. Maybe I'm wrong, but I do not think it's worth watching this movie. The characters and the strange events get their attention and are quite interesting, but there are also bad things and some rude things. The magic and mythical side of that turned me off, and for most Christians this movie would not be very appropriate or worth seeing.
