What the hell is this!? That was my first reaction to this movie (actually, my first reaction was more insulting). This is not Star Wars! Star Wars are spatial battles, this movie has none. Star Wars is the Force, this movie only has a delayed witch with a magic ring. Star Wars is a battle of lightsabers, this movie has no battle worth mentioning. Star Wars is humor, this movie is not. Star Wars is a galaxy far, far away, this movie has HORSES in it! Besides all this, how did Lucas come up with the crazy idea of ​​letting a five-year-old baby play the lead role? Great, big disappointment. Do you like Star Wars? Do not look at this! 1 out of 10
