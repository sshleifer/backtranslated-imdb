Christopher Lambert attracted me to this movie. What a waste! The plot has more holes than my rope vest, the special effects were not very good, it did not take long to find out who was the mother of the creature and the creature had more than a small debt to Predator. Anti-climactic this movie could have done much better. However, it raises an interesting point. When will Hollywood discover the rich vein of European folklore that is waiting to be exploited?
