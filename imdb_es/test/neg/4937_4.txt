"Shuttle" is an independent thriller about four young adults who arrive late at night on a bus from the airport to discover that the driver is a sadistic psychopath. Scary and it's a little interesting plot work, some aspects just do not. The bad dialogue and the unpleasant characters give a good reason not to worry about them. But, often, the suspense works and asks you the question "What would you do?" and, generally, what you DO is not what these idiots do in the shuttle. <br /> <br /> If you're waiting for a bloody and senseless horror movie, you'll be wrong. This is a movie that makes you use your mind, but, unfortunately, not until the end. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten.
