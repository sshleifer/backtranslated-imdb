I think my summary says it all. This MTV response to the classic Candid Camera TV program features a Gen X (or Y generation) type that uses fake helicopters and wears several hats, wigs and lenses, and puts people in quite extravagant situations although often not very interesting . Example: Kennedy has a boy who invites his parents to his "wedding". Kennedy is the bride, made with a full wedding dress and a long wig. The "joke" is that the parents immediately understand that their son is marrying a man who says he no longer has his "parts and pieces". The problem is that this schtick lasts too long, obviously to complete the time. And Kennedy is as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. The camera would have executed three or four scenarios in the time it took Kennedy to overcome this, running, constantly asking "Do I look fat?" I recognize that the show was not made for me. It was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think that JACKASS is the peak of comedy today. So let them laugh. Thank God the show was short-lived.
