The water shows the plight of Indian widows in the late 1930s, in the end, the problem still exists largely by providing statistics in the end, refers to Gandhi several times in the film before finally having a scene that Describe it and do nothing extraordinary. or new in the movie. Yes, the cinematography is quite impressive, but that can not be the soul of any film for me. <br /> <br /> India has had several problems like many other nations, but has gotten rid of many of these problems in general. What happens if you make a film about racism in the United States in a particular year that ends with 'x the number of Americans who still experience racism'? <br /> <br /> a) How would it be relevant, and, b) How would it be something as extraordinary as the one that is represented in the cinema. <br /> <br /> A view I read from a Deepa Mehta The interview was that this film is being interpreted as a voice for the marginalized everywhere. From the reviews I read everywhere, what I hear is how the director did a great job and was brave in bringing a problem to the world. The film is more about a specific problem that a society faces (and has been eliminated through reforms in general). <br /> <br /> I do not see anything shocking about the movie. In addition, the film lacked soul and changed between the plots of Chuiyya and Kalyani. Sarala, the young actress from Sri Lanka, played the role of Chuiyya superbly and that was the only thing that impressed me about the movie, unfortunately.
