Sit in your basement with the light off for an hour and a half. That's almost the same as seeing this underground search of the Devil's door. An American researcher Owen (Vincent Gallo) travels to Moscow and gathers a rescue team to search for his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzia), an archaeologist who has disappeared in the catacombs below the Russian capital. You will be surprised to discover that the underground inhabitants thrive in the dark and dark complex system of caves and tunnels. The seekers will meet the doorman of hell, Andrey (Val Kilmer), and they will make a deal to continue their adventure; only to succeed in having fear almost without thinking when realizing that they are among the living dead. Also in the cast: Joaqu√≠n de Almedia, Oksana Akinshina, Sage Stallone, Joss Ackland and Julio Perillan.
