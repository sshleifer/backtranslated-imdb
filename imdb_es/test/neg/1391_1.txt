Carlos Mencia is just not funny! His show is painful to watch for that. Their sketches / parodies are all very horrible, and this really feels like a filler for the Chapelle Show, which although I'm not a big fan of that, it's a lot more fun than this crap. Carlos Mencia gives the stupid speeches and too often depends on finishing his monologues with a delayed voice and going "der, der der". It's just not funny. Often, when talking to others, he plays with words. They are horrible and painful. When people do not laugh, he blames them ... why would someone laugh, it's not funny. He has an immense sense of humor in everything he does in this program, it's amazing that anyone who is not a 3-year-old sees this. One of my least favorite things to do is to dilute each theme and make it look like a joke. I hope this racist idiot is removed from the air as soon as possible because he is meddling in a station that no longer needs to be killed.
