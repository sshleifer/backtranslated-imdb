Be very afraid of who likes this movie. They probably inhaled too many pieces of paint when they were children. It's so horrible that I refuse to relive a plot. Oh yes, there was not one! This movie is a true definition of what Hollywood creates for people who do not want to think about a theater. Do the bad guys win? Do the good guys win? Who cares!
