1) If you want to make a film about social realism, it is very important that the audience identifies with the characters that are being represented. 2) The audience can not identify with characters that are highly stereotyped or with situations that are obvious. 3) If you have a bad actor, then you can not build a character. Anyway, even if you have good actors, your work will be ridiculous if you force them to speak with a fictitious Andalusian accent. <br /> <br /> Jesus Ponce ignores those 3 points and also makes some cheap jokes that are completely out of place. place. His script is so predictable: a woman leaves prison, meets her old drug addict boyfriend, life is hard, etc. Be that as it may, the fact that history is anything but original would not be so bad if only Ponce were not a complete incompetent writing and filming. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long they will continue to give our tax dollars to make movies like this one. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 3/10
