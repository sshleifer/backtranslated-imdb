So much fantastic chemistry between Kristen Scott-Thomas and Harrison Ford, but every time the story about their relationship began to gather momentum, the script was cut and dealt with an irrelevant secondary plot that did nothing to advance the story. In fact, the secondary arguments had nothing to do with the story at all. They were like commercial breaks in which you saw a trailer from another movie. <br /> <br /> The writers (or someone who controlled the writers) obviously did not trust themselves to write convincingly about the relationships and inner lives of their characters. They seemed uncomfortable unless they launched some weapons battles and bar fights. Or maybe they did not trust the audience to pay attention to a story about a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship in difficult circumstances. After all, we all know how boring "Casablanca" was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the relationship between Kay and Dutch had developed further and allowed themselves to play, the writers would know how to finish the story. This movie is a disappointment for not doing more with its wonderful actors, who gave good performances but could have done more with a better script.
