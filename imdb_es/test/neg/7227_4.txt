If Daphne Du Maurier had established REBECCA in San Francisco in the 1950s, it might very well look like this bizarre, highly unusual, Robert Wise. Valentina Cortese plays a survivor of a concentration camp who steals the identity of a dead woman and insinuates herself into the life of Richard Basehart (who is also the guardian of the dead woman's son) ... it is absurd and exaggerated, but Also topflight entertainment. Cortese is great, she is slowly crumbling when she realizes the mistake she has made. Basehart is fine although a bit bland ... although the lighting towards the end makes it seem very threatening. Fay Baker is a very good caregiver, like Danvers. Wise is a good director and keeps things moving at a fairly dynamic pace. It also organizes a clash of cars out of control, now classic, with Cortese (or at least a double Cortese) at the wheel.
