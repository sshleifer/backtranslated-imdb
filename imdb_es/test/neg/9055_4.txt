Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) who looks for her lost sister. It turns out that his sister has joined a sect that has disappeared in the jungles of Borneo. With Vietnam veteran Mark at his side, he goes out to look for his sister. <br /> <br /> As usual, the performance is not of the highest quality, but you do get the girl from the Cannibal poster flick Me Me Lai, who spends most of the time. The time on the screen with the naked breast, the female protagonist Janet Agren was covered with gold paint and was abused with a dildo submerged in blood of snake among other things. Now that has to count for something! <br /> <br /> But, I must say that I find it a bit difficult to recommend this title. If you are a fan of the genre, you will most likely recognize every bloody scene in the movie bar with only a few. And I say it literally. Many of the bloody scenes are removed directly from other Cannibal films, such as MAN FROM DEEP RIVER and LAST CANNIBAL WORLD. There are probably more films trapped there. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is one for the most diehard fans to mark their list. If you have not seen any movie from the Italian jungle, you'd better watch CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and if you're an avid fan, you've seen most of the bloody scenes in other movies.
