A cheerful girl (yes, ditzy is as complex as her character) will not accept no for an answer and will do extravagant things to get her husband back. It is too implausible to be credible with characters so flimsy that they go through the movements. But not foolish enough to be fascinating in the way it is said: Being John Malkovich was. So it ends up boring. <br /> <br /> sv
