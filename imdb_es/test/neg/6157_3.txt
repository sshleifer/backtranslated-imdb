The story and the characters really REALLY needed work. The idea of ​​the world is quite clear, but nobody bothered to develop it either through the exhibition or through the plot. Despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the film, it makes sense that you do not use the exhibition, since no one is new in this world. And yet, when Matt Owens (Bill Paxton) and Byron (Bob Peck) deviate from the course and get lost, and enter the worshipers of the wind and the fat, lazy, and rich of the museum, we get none. Real idea of ​​who these people are, or why we should care about any of them. Smart movies have ways of developing this by simply making the characters live in the world. Simple things, like ordering a drink in a bar or talking about something in the past: this is the kind of thing that makes the world of cinema memorable, not endless shots of shitty planes and the cheap effects of someone trying to make Loops in an ultralight. <br /> <br /> If this is too difficult for you, here is a little advice: analyze the multiple locations. If everything is becoming uncomfortable because you are getting close, stay in one place for a while and have the characters talk a little. All superfluous trash must be eliminated. Get rid of the whole scene of wind lovers. Get rid of the stuffed museum people. Get rid of all the junk that is missing, unless you can make the wind relevant to the story. Have everything ready in a big plane, or something like that. Just make people talk about something that matters to us. <br /> <br /> Hey, get rid of Bill Paxton. Have the film focus on the character of Tasker and his relationship with the robot, Byron. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film's biggest problem is that we do not care about anyone, because nobody takes the time to explain their motivations or delve into their characters. We do not like Matt (well, because he is played by Bill Paxton, among other things). He is a scoundrel, who does not redeem himself enough, except to let go of the android, Byron. And this action has even less meaning than most due to three key points: <br /> <br /> 1. Byron is a murderer. 2. Byron is indestructible 3. Byron can leave at any time he pleases. <br /> <br /> We try to like Byron, because there is a kind of pathos, but it is underdeveloped. All we have left is a glassy-eyed robotic robot that is acting tenuous and wooden in one moment, and practically nutty the next. We do not know why or how he develops emotions, but we do know for sure that he murdered someone. We do not know why he murdered someone, or the circumstances of this spooky event, because it is not developed. We can not feel sorry for him if we do not know the story. All we know for sure is that he murders people. And he likes Bill Paxton. <br /> <br /> We do not hate Tasker enough (partly because he is played by the good guy Mark Hamill), because although he is rough and ruthless, he does not do anything out of the ordinary for His character - a peace officer post-apocalyptic. Of course he kills Montclaire (Robbie Coltrane) and his team, but they are drug dealers, on the way to growing poppies for heroin. And they shoot him first. It does not kill anyone who does not get in the way, or who does not try to physically harm it first. That goes just as well for the final showdown at the museum. He uses a dash of police brutality against a lazy dilettante (F. Murray Abraham is wasted in this role), and all the others point him with a gun. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand what it is about. Belitski (Kitty Aldridge), partner of Tasker. After only 10 minutes accumulated with Matt, she is ready to change sides, despite her cries of loyalty, and even though Matt is speaking badly and is hitting her. If that is love, then I will choose to hate any day. <br /> <br /> Seriously. The character of Paxton is as adorable as Simon in "True Lies", or Pvt. Hudson in "Aliens". Does anyone fall in love with him in these movies? Not because? Because he is an idiot and a loser. Why put him in charge of this movie?
