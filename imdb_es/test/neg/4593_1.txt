"Speck" apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer Richard Speck. However, not many murders are found in this movie, and none of them is explicitly shown. The most disturbing scene of the whole movie is perhaps when Speck tramples one of the eight unfortunate nurses in his own bathtub to death, however, even this is simply implied and not shown, except for a few unconceivable downward thrusts of Speck's leg. The most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voiceover, which should be a testament to the boring nature of this movie. Every aspect of this movie is horrible. Unless you have a penchant for boredom, do not bother. This movie only reaches 72 minutes, but it seems an eternity.
