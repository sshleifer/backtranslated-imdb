Man this thing bites! I'm sorry I've ever sat and seen it! Friedkin was crazy about making a movie that tried to win the sympathy of the spectators for this lunatic. He killed people! Very grizzly could add too! And Friedkin wants you to feel sorry for him because "it's not right"! I say that Friedkin can forget him! I hate the guy on whom this movie is based and I hope they did it right and gave the juice to their pitiful butt! In short, do not waste your time! He is sick and evil!
