If you've been to Eastern Europe (or even your armed forces), this movie may be interesting. I do not know why he calls this a comedy (of course, there are some funny moments), but it is not a good movie if one of the orderly officers speaks for 15 minutes about the achievements of socialism at a Christmas dinner, and the officers in general act Like funny thieves, the soldiers run from the base to meet their girls at night, and surprise, surprise, one of the girls is the commander's daughter. The East German army was known for the abusive and humiliating service of its recruited men, and the comedy was basically not filmed on the premises or with the equipment to make a good East German army film and its time has already passed. . Despite this, some of the actors and actresses tried to act well, but came out only in the roles that are known by East German television and some small films. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it was basically boring and very cheap.
