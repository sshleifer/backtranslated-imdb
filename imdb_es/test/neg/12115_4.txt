The children's plot was ripped from a loose Hollywood movie, a terrible performance, a cheesy dialogue and sex scenes that were not quite "on par". That's another great softcore parody! I really enjoyed this movie! Of course the performance is terrible, but that part of the fun! The plot is ridiculous, but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around sex scenes of girl with girl. And because it's just softcore (no penetration) the sex scenes were a bit bland. But it's like the big god of the soft piggy Russ Meyers said "who cares what goes on below the waist". I do not know if I would agree with Mr. Meyers on this, but what the hell ... the movie entertained me for an hour and a half. I give it a C +, it would have been a solid B if they could have chosen more girls to look like the actresses of Russ Meyers. VaVoom! VaVoom! ~
