I was very excited for this movie! My expectations were under control because I read the book first, so I expected differences. What I did not expect was how big the differences were. Starting with the physical appearances of the characters ... like the lack of tattoos of Channing Tantums n Amanda Seyfried was not a brunette lol but I let it go ... the developments of the characters were not at all ... you did not have time to love the character of Amanda Seyfried and you could not feel her for her or for John when they parted for the first time ... I thought the two weeks had been rushed and I hated that she left first and then he ... that would eliminate the emotional separation ... And why did Tim change the book? Why did they make him dad instead of a brother and why did they make him so old and the film lacked that intense moment when they discovered what happened at the end? I want to spoil it hahaha, but for those who saw it, you know what I mean) and whhhyyyy ooooo wwhyyyy if they changed the ending ... in the book it was heartbreaking and emotional and emphasized in the decision of the character of Channing Tatums why they twisted it. .. it just made it look like a hasty end ... it was terrible ... tha What disappointed me the most ... the end of the book should have been exactly the same :(
