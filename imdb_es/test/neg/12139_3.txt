Let me be clear. I hate this kind of movies. I do not like anything where the protagonists are all English bourgeois. I think that this type of literature and cinema is terribly pretentious. You'll never make me read a Jane Austen book willingly. That said, the only reason I read W. Somerset Maugham's book and saw the next movie was for a class. <br /> <br /> Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a beautiful English woman who lives in a villa borrowed in Florence before the Second World War. One evening, after having dinner with some of her wealthy friends related to royalty, she voluntarily picks up an Austrian refugee, has sex with him and ditches, and then commits suicide. As the movie gets closer and closer, you really want to not like Mary. <br /> <br /> What the fuck was this movie! In the first place, there were many plots and characters invented in the film that were not even in the book. I doubt very much that the late Mr. Maugham would have appreciated them. The characters, although rich, were some of the most superficial and self-centered people I have seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give him anything less than three stars was because the performance was the only redeemable thing. The always talented Kristin Scott Thomas is perfect for the role of Mary. In fact, I could not imagine anyone else filling their shoes. Sean Penn and Anne Bancroft also had supporting roles, which were as good as the protagonist. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the pain of watching this movie.
