This is a very, very boring and uninteresting action movie, and without Chuck Norris it would have been unbearable! In addition, the low budget shows it in a big way! Some of the fights were good, but the story is ridiculous, and there is no threatening villain. The dialogue was ridiculous. It took me a while to finish this movie, but Chuck Norris did something bearable. I really do not have anything else to say, since I was only paying half the attention, because it was incredibly boring, however, it recovered a bit towards the end. The address is terrible. Don Hulette, does a terrible job here, with a terrible picture, a horrible rhythm, and in general, the movie looked boring! There is no gore. The performance was terrible. Chuck Norris is very good here, kicks that ass and makes the movie almost bearable (Chuck rules!). George Murdock, is terrible as the main villain, and very unconvincing. Terry O'Connor, he's decent here, and he had good chemistry with Chuck. Michael Augenstein, he's decent like Chuck's brother. In general, it is quite simple to AVOID! * Out of 5 (Chuck saves it from the BOMB classification).
