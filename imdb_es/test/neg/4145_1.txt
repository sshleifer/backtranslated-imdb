Incomparable begins in Los Angeles with Jim (Roger Cline) and his wife Alice Fhelleps (Tamera Noll) arguing while driving in the pouring rain, unfortunately Jim crashes the car and his daughter Heather (Leigh Silver) ends up dead while Alice turns in a chair wheels for vegetables. Devastated by the death of his daughter, Jim begins visiting prostitutes and then kills them by the voices in his head. Erm, that's it. <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Chad Ferrin. I hate the unspeakable as a movie. There are some movies that you see occasionally that move the 'goal posts' as it was with respect to everything you see below, some films are so bright that all the others will be judged by them, while others like Unspeakable, for example, They are so bad that they are fixed. A new low kinematics. This is really one of the worst movies I've seen in my life and I'm really surprised by the largely positive comments on the IMDb, although I'm not surprised by the low overall rating on the homepage, I'm not sure if I missed anything, But for starters, Unspeakable has no argument, it has no history and many seem almost random. There was nothing in Unspeakable to keep my interest or entertain and, as a result, it became a test of endurance to get to the end. The film tries to be surprised by some loose scenes of sexual abuse of a priest for hire by a priest, there is a scene in which a disabled person shits himself, falls on the floor and his sickly sick woman begins to feel her dirty genitals, his legs. and underwear. If someone can find such an entertaining shit, I'll cut my wrists now, the characters are some of the worst I've had the misfortune to meet, the dialogue is hilariously bad and some seem as if they came straight from a dirty fag. The worst type porn. It does not work as a horror, since it is not scary in the least, it is absolutely funny and frankly insulting to claim that it is trying to be a serious drama about someone who suffers a great loss and tries to cope with it. In general, I just think It's a piece of useless, badly done, poorly made Troma. <br /> <br /> Director Ferrin films as a poorly made documentary, the special effects are terrible and are part of the 'we are going to put ketchup in the face of our actor & the audience will be convinced that a variety has died of bloody death, there is no graphic violence at all, other than a suicide in which someone sticks a knife in his mouth. Considering the amount of prostitutes in Unspeakable, levels of nudity are kept at an absolute minimum ... <br /> <br /> Apparently Unspeakable had a budget of around $ 20,000 and all I can say is a Where did all the money go? Oh, a quick note for the filmmakers: if you're going to record live sound, make sure the actor does not offer his lines next to a main road where he seems to be driving half of Los Angeles ... The performance sucks , Period. <br /> <br /> Incomparable is, in my opinion, total shit. It's probably not the worst I've seen in my life but it's right down there and I do not remember seeing such a horrible movie recently. One to avoid unless you're a masochist or sleepless.
