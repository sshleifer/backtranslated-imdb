Meh, it sums everything up for me really. Boring story, dull dialogue, boring action scenes (HOW do you do something like a fight or a dull shooting? Do you really have to TRY to do that?), No real characters, etc. Just bored. Snipes is a talented actor and physical actor, but none of this has surfaced in ANY of his work on DTV, when there is an opportunity to give the audience a much more superior product than they are used to. Imagine a decent script with a few solid characters that interest you and some damn explosive action, fights, shootings, etc. How can it be so difficult to manage? My personal opinion is that the main actors in the productions simply do not care. There is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing. Look at Snipes in the first 2 Blades, Passenger 57, Rising Sun, New Jack City, Demolition Man, etc. Impressive, intense performances complemented by decent scripts (though not always exceptional), good releases of support and perverse action. <br /> <br /> None of that is evident in any of these releases so far, which is a tremendous shame. The distributors slap Wesley's face on the cover, knowing that the audience is going to annul them, since they have not yet realized that they have not seen him in theaters for almost 2 years. <br /> <br /> I'd love to see Snipes work with someone like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to make the most of DTV production, and work with Alpha Stunts, which are simply some of the best types of action that exist. Together they would make an incredible team and a Snipes action vehicle that we would all be proud to see. <br /> <br /> The detonator stinks. It's not as bad as The Marksman, which chews, but still really sucks.
