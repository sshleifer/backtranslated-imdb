An annoying and unskilled American documentarian learns of a legendary <br /> <br /> South African monster, the Half-Caste. Tradition says that it is a creature half human, half leopard and the closest parallel is that of the werewolf of the European tradition. Instead of focusing on the creature, the film follows the meanders of the film crew. There is little action or suspense until the end of the movie. This problem is aggravated by numerous irritating characters that generate an incessant amount of conversations even more irritating. The basic premise is wasted, since it is marginalized by the inexplicable focus in the documentary team. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the director was influenced by the approach of The Blair Witch Project (1999) or The Last Broadcast (1998). In any case, the film fails at most levels. Avoid at all costs.
