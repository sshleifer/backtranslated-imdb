I do not think I'm ruining anyone's experience of this movie by telling you not to see if you have something better to do, like cleaning under the stove. It gets dirty down there and you have to clean it sometime. <br /> <br /> I think the film lacks sex and violence, although there is a trick of chasing a car that seems so dangerous that it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer. The heart of "Gargoyle" is in the right place, but his aspirations are conservative. At least it is not pretentious. But I had a great time acting in it, playing the lazy perennial in the horror movie that says "What's in this hole?" and dies for his arrogance. I also met Michael Pare. Every film addict must work with a basic B film element at least once before death. And the Romanians are the most charming people I've ever met. Literally the most beautiful. Walk down the street in Bucharest: if 7 out of 10 women are not absolutely beautiful, you are walking down a street that I did not find; and be comforted by the fact that at least 5 out of 10 are available for drinks. <br /> <br /> Part of the film was shot at Casa Radio, an abandoned, unfinished building, of the Communist Classic Bloc-cum-Georgian Nightmare originally intended to house propaganda ministries of the KGB, ie Radio Europe not so free. The building, five stories high, occupies one block; Best of all, while its facade radiates solidity in the state of Big Brother, it resides near the center of the city like a post-apocalyptic ruin in a jungle of burdock and hemp populated by dozens of gypsies and dozens of wild dogs. Construction at Casa Radio was suspended when Caucescu and his wife were executed on television in 1989, and there are still gaps that fall from the sun-baked upper floor (which offers surreal views of a quarter-mile stretch of modern concrete, decorated with protruding reinforcing bars and old car parts, overlooking a crumbling ancient city) to the damp and spooky sub-basement (which is duplicated in the film for Gargoyle's lair). There are no American style railings or warning signs for Bucharest. <br /> <br /> Since the demise of the Soviet Union, Casa Radio has hosted several non-union film shoots, including "Highlander III". It is attractive to producers because it is a cheap, massive place in terms of scale and available space, odd looking and without insurance headaches, as it is still owned by the state. In addition, nobody complains if it is not cleaned after its production: everything that remains on the site is interpolated in the construction of the marginal neighborhoods of Gypsy residents in this urban jungle. <br /> <br /> An assistant director was bitten with blood by a wild dog during the filming of "Gargoyle". The apples provided by the food service were put into service by the cast and crew as projectiles to keep the marauding dogs at bay. I was also bitten by wild dogs in Bucharest, once in a bar (!) And once in a city park. I also survived two car accidents in two weeks, both in taxis and none of which were seen by the drivers involved as a reason to stop them. <br /> <br /> GEEK NOTE: The science fiction network or the Channel or whatever was one of the sponsors of this film (the smaller the budget, the more producers there are on the set), so It's a bit strange that no one had problems with the original title, "Gargoyles", until it was almost time to show it on the network, even though Sci-Fi already had an unrelated series of that name. The title was changed at some time relatively close to the launch, since I have a copy with color correction labeled with the previous title.
