I love how everyone treats this show as if it were the next great American comedy. I saw five episodes of this abomination, and the only person who approached a true teacher was the old man who loved and hated his work. The rest of them were just nice people trying to read the lines written by people who never really went to a real classroom. I loved how each episode consisted of the two idiots (one who went to bed and the other who did not) got into some kind of bizarre problem that indirectly involved their students. The British girl who thought she found a nice quality in the main idiot, but in the end she was surprised that he became an imbecile. The hot girl who was there with the particular purpose of being hot, and the director and her lackey who served to somehow advance the almost nonexistent plot forward. I loved the way that almost all the teachers in this program were very young, but I ask you to remember your high school days and remember the teachers you had. . . Did they look like this? Or did you go to high school that had middle-aged people teaching in it? That is the secondary school to which all the others were. The show lacked any form of research on what happens in schools. In public schools, principals do not have the power of the superior and dismissed teachers, the school board does, but in every episode that I observed, the director threatened to fire his teachers. Think about your history class. . . . . or think of some kind of history, did you ever see an incredibly hot British girl teaching in an American history class? No. Did you ever see a teacher's room so big you could really play basketball? No. <br /> <br /> The teachers could have been a great show if they really had been based on some form of reality. What makes teaching fun is the story that comes from interacting with students, and teachers find it funny because they deal with students day after day. The excessive emphasis on their lives outside of teaching made it another four-camera comedy that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment that said unrealistic lines, and I'm sorry, I just did not buy it. The program could have modeled itself from other currently successful situation comedies and use a single-camera format, and should have focused more on the teacher's relationships with their students and not on each other. <br /> <br /> He gets a star for trying and a star for the hot girl (she was really hot). <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a failed situation comedy that will go down in history as a hacking attempt to understand a profession. I just hope that if they do another situational comedy based on teaching, learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity like this never touches the TV screen.
