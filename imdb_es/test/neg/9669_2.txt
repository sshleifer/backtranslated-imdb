A bad bad movie ... a terrible plot, it depends on Bolo Yeung's character, but he speaks maybe 20 words in the whole movie and he only has one fight scene, still in good shape, considering he was also in the kung fu classic "Enter The Dragon" It's interesting to see William Zabka ("Johnny" from The Karate Kid) in another role of martial arts.
