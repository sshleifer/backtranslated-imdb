In the next door, weird things happen with your neighbor. <br /> <br /> "The Grudge 2" has a terrifying sound and visual effects, with the spooky woman and boy, and I've been surprised a couple of times while watching this. movie. However, the complex script with three subframes is totally confused, which makes the intertwined story a complete disaster. There are too many characters and situations, and at some point I completely lost myself with the disconnected and fragmented narration. In the end, I felt completely disappointed with this confusing but also spooky movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Grito 2" ("The Scream 2")
