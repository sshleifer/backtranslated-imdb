After having seen this film several times, I came to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very bold decision to make a muse for Goya, when the artist directed what most would consider a stormy and passionate life while the French Revolution and the Napoleonic people were enraged. throughout Europe, surely one that would have enough drama to draw on. While I understand that Mr. Forman was reporting in the microcosm of the tragedy of Agnes life the devastation of the world at that time, I was left with the feeling that Goya had left out, much of his humanity. The strongest and most eloquent point that this movie made was that, due to the fallen nature of man, each of us is a potential villain in the stream of life, each of us has evil within us and we must fight with God's help. How eloquent when Goya says he should have helped Ines more, how true for all of us! We must defend and protect the innocent. The magnificently ironic scene in which the priest, once imprisoned and sentenced to die, pronounces the sentence of death to Lorenzo, who originally condemned him, is a matter of genius. I was left wanting something more when the credits rolled. Maybe less of the unreal coincidences, and more of the inner life of the characters.
