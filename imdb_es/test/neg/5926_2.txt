I have to say that it is not very good. Polly Bergen is fine in this movie. The rest is like that. I'm gay and honestly, there are so many clichés for this moment in history that it's just sad. We started watching it and then turned it off, then decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the movie. But all told, the basic idea of ​​the movie is good. If it was rewritten with less suitable lines and a better performance could have been really good. Above all I would not recommend it. Also, this is the line of thinking coo coo is so scarce. Besides that, the fight in the hairdressing salon is fun because it is very bad. The lesbian sister who is in the room with them while they try to put on is so weird that sad.
