This movie is a strange fantasy tale, which I'm sure does not attract anyone more than 10, but it's too strange for children. The plot is stupid, and the performance is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Kathy Ireland, 25, plays a teenager who acts like a 9-year-old girl. She seems to have picked up her character's voice when listening to Alvin and the Chipmunks. Her shrill, shrill baby voice becomes annoyed when she starts talking. All the other performances are bad, but the truth is that Kathy Ireland is by far the worst. The plot is also terrible and is a kind of mix between Alice in Wonderland and Mad Max. Wanda Saknussemm (Ireland) receives a letter that says her father, who left her long ago, fell into a bottomless pit in Africa, and when she goes looking for him, she falls into an underground world full of strange people with an Australian accent. It's one of the best movies you've ever seen, with terrible lines everywhere. <br /> <br /> It is annoying the effects that this film uses for the development of the character. Kathy Ireland is a nerd who will not do anything or go anywhere. She flies to Africa ... wow, what development! She drops her glasses and then does not need them. Why dropping glasses means that they do not become nerds? It should represent his descent to blindness. It is simply stupid. The only positive thing I can think of is that there are special effects and semi-good camera work, and the musical score sounds good. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a ridiculous family fantasy that will only appeal to those who do not expect anything from a movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 84 minutes PG for violence.
