I think this movie was a terrible waste of time, and I would know it after seeing it 5 times in class. This movie does not show what happened absolutely perfectly during these times. Nobody can really say that these things happened to the letter. In any case, the only good thing would be the actors, even if they really were shit. They were reading the script without expression. something boring. I prefer to see school play. so I'd definitely never want to see this movie again in my whole life. It is a complete waste of time, unless you want to waste your time and if you want to see an unrealistic view of what happened in 1981.
