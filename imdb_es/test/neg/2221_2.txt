Slightly entertaining and self-conscious, but what else could it be? Cushing in one of his poorest roles, and he often sounds dubbed. McClure is too much Cheezy to be believed, but who can blame him on the wasteland of this movie whose plot about the ancient dinosaur birds that rule humans has "vintage charm" of the nineteenth century, but not enough and unfortunately the script has the racist connotations of the literary genre in movies. Good effort from the actors, but a poorly conceived production.
