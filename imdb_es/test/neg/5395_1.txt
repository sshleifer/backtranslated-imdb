I got this in The Horror Six-Pack from Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. This is not the worst movie ever made, but it still stinks. In fact, this movie was very bad, I do not know how I'm going to write this review, especially since 1. I took it out of the DVD player because I could not see a second more or a second. Ike is coming and God knows how long it will take me to do this review. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a scientist and his wife. The scientist receives a valuable artifact and examines it when this supposed Urban Legend known as the Skeleton Man kills him, and then his wife. So ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but there really is not much more I can say about this POS, except it does not bother me. I am currently using the disk as a roller coaster, and if you see this, you may want to do the same. Casper Van Dien and Michael Rooker must have needed cash ... BAD! <br /> <br /> PS. I will be reviewing the films in the boxset and I could do a new revision in Ghoulies IV.
