I was sick one day and I was flipping through channels and I found this movie terribly out of range. The plot and even the subplots (if you can find one) have been made until the extinction. BUT, as bad as the story was, I reserve a special comment for Liza Minelli. His character was absolutely one of the most annoying characters I've had the misfortune to see in a movie. His only two competitors in this category are John Leguziamo in "The Pest" and Julia Stiles in everything he has done (or half done). Maybe he performed exactly as the script suggested or maybe (moan!) That's the limit he has for his range of performance. Either way, they should have been rewritten and killed in the first 30 seconds of the movie (eg, Like the girl who fell off the balcony in Lethal Weapon (I) (but at least she had nice breasts)) > <br /> The most humbly presented ...
