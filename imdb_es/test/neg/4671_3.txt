spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie is not full of action; It is slow and boring. It is not funny or exciting, it is predictable and plays with cheap sentimentality and vague patriotism. The special effects are not imaginative nor impressive. They are noisy and without inspiration. <br /> <br /> Acting talent is wasted on irremediably stupid phrases and clichés. These characters are mentioned by characters who should be called simply "giant and gentle black man", "eccentric genius who is about to break", "square-jawed hero", "coward by the book", "unlucky player who lives for a code of honor, '' impulsive princess '' and so on. <br /> <br /> And the writing! How many non-dramatic regressive accounts did you think could fit into this? A scene in which people have to turn off a bomb cutting one or another cable, already counts as fiction? The drama of the last 15 minutes of the film depends on the interest of the audience if an imbecile can put aside his personal differences with Ben Affleck and say goodbye to Liv Tyler in time to SAVE THE EARTH All the work is done, we just have to wait a couple of seconds for Harry Stamper, the imbecile, to throw some cotton candy lines in. I know Bruce Willis is a generally charismatic guy, but his character Harry Stamper is a boring obnoxious. I thought he won the Golden Razzy he was awarded for this role. <br /> <br /> As the film is so long, the plot so obvious and the dialogue so disposable, you can not help but notice the inaccurate inaccuracies. , inconsistencies and holes in the plot. 800 feet in something the size of TX is less than a puncture. Try walking 800 feet inside TX and see how close to the center it is. After all the discussion about artificial gravity in the Russian station, it seems to be arbitrary once inside. Actually, gravity comes and goes throughout the movie. Does it make any sense for someone besides Michael Bay to give these idiots a pair of ferries and send them to fly an asteroid that threatens the Earth? <br /> <br /> The commercial style telephony / insurance / sentimental tailings mounts were disgusting. <br /> <br /> I like action movies. Really. This is boring, stupid and really sticking to itself. It deserves hatred and contempt because it is all that Hollywood's most expensive efforts have become: a lot of cheap clichés that range from one costly explosion to another. Oh, yes, everything is permeated by a conservative Neanderthal perspective on sex, politics, etc.
