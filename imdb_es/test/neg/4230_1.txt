I do not remember when it was the last time I was so disappointed in a movie. I probably expected it to happen too (in a way that you can expect action in dogma style movies, of course). But there is nothing to do here. Luckily I was watching him at home and could change channels every time the silence and the stupid and numb faces started killing me. And that was very often! It really is not a pleasure to see the ugly people who do not speak and move slowly, pet the pigs and kiss the men in French, not to mention the ugly bodies that have explicit sexual relationships. If only it made sense ... the whole situation of the murder is ridiculous; It seems that it was only created to show one more vagina, since zero characters are capable of solving the crime. Having only four pseudo-developed characters and a movie that is not going anywhere, it is quite obvious that the director chose a murderer. And that does not make sense either. Despite all the boredom and suffering, I must admit that somehow I was moved in an inexplicable way. Maybe you should check it yourself although I do not recommend it.
