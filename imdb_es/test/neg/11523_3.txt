I really should have learned more about this movie before renting it. It was one of those movies where you still see him thinking he has to improve. Then, when it's over, you feel stupid for having lost precious time in your life that you can never recover. Ice-T did his bad boy thing and, well, that was the highlight of the night. The images of the shuttle appear to have been made with a small toy inside a box and the scenes of spacewalks were fun because you could see the ropes tied to the spacesuits. The script was missing and the scene of the car chase with the guy who was bleeding and unconscious was incredible because he was driving better than I could have had one of my best days. In general, I have seen worse things, but this is not one I would recommend or would like to remember.
