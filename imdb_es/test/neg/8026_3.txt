Being a movie buff completely destroyed with a house to furnish, I am a big IKEA fan. Virtually all my home is full of cheap chipboard things. And you know how all those elegant home items in IKEA have those funny names, a bookshelf called "Holika" and a bathroom mirror called "Grundtal", well, that adds to all the European charm. <br /> <br /> Like those articles with interesting (but horribly translated) names on the shelves of IKEA, I would like to provide some translation to some of the criticisms I have read about the "Kraftverk 3714" manufacturing Swedish <br /> <br /> Original comment: "For a low-budget movie, this is a very good thing, it would be great to see what these guys could do with a Hollywood budget!" <br /> <br /> Translation: The material of the film is horrible, the lighting is pedestrian, the cinematography is not interesting, the sound recording is hollow. <br /> <br /> Original comment: "The science fiction drama David Lynchesque takes place in a strange forest city and is equally strange characters!" <br /> <br /> Translation: these "actors" act for free, the story is circular and exhausting, the ideas that affirm the film are desperately trying to be existential but they are simply mundane, and the adjustments (especially the interior ones) are boring and full of ugly wallpapers. <br /> <br /> Original comment: "The editing is well done and the conservative use of computer graphics shows that it is not necessary for convincing CGI effects to come out of a Hollywood studio!" <br /> < Translation: When you have incomplete cinematography to begin with, hide the imperfections by digitizing them all on a Mac and mix them vigorously for three minutes. Witty! <br /> <br /> I took a risk on this DVD because I like independent films, especially those that try to tackle the genre of science fiction, often expensive and inspiring. I mean, some of the best science fiction movies of all time have been made with little or no budget, spfx and specious actors. Take the travel warning film at the time of Peter Fonda, "Idaho Transfer", for example! A classic. <br /> <br /> But "Kraftverk 3714" does not fit into the category of "science fiction that is carefully dependent, discrete and dependent on the idea". It focuses relentlessly on characters who do not do much and do not say interesting things. Go round and round in circles. It's too long (this comes from a big fan of Tarkovsky). Worse yet, his concept of "aliens that change reality" is the forage of Twilight Zone 40 years ago. It's just not a well-made movie, and I really wanted it to be, damn it! <br /> <br /> However, being the IKEA fan that I am, I made an impressive observation. First, anyone who has purchased at IKEA knows how their complicated shopping carts work: all four wheels are multi-directional. Cars can turn 360 degrees perfect, and it takes some familiarity to handle them like a professional, as any greedy IKEA buyer knows. Well, I'll be damned, but one of the leading actresses of "Kraftverk 3714" goes to a grocery store in the middle of nowhere and what is she pushing? A multidirectional shopping cart! So, after all, that's not an invention of IKEA, but it's another wonderful invention (let's call it "Tacklebee" by hell) from the land of Hei-Doo.
