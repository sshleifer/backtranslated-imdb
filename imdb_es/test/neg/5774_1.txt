And unfortunately, me too. ANY movie that is based on a bad word game like its slogan or its title should be relegated to the $ 2.00 box, but we decided to try a second consecutive bad movie movie night. We had a winner in "House of the Dead": accompany him if you want a laughable movie. <br /> <br /> Some witch jumped into the water after being set ablaze by Mr. Miner. A guy threw himself into the forest. And that same guy grabbed a new girlfriend right in front of her previous one. I do not remember much more. The last third of the movie was absolutely tasteless, and we were all waiting in agony until the end.
