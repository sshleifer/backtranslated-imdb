The sex life of the men of potatoes is about the sexual life of several men involved in the delivery of potatoes. So there are no surprises there. It is, in fact, more or less what can be expected from the title: it is a peculiar comedy related to sex and potatoes. Sometimes the movie works. It is a vanguard comedy, sometimes uncomfortable, about the lives of some unimportant and quite mediocre men who have problems of various types with women. Where the film clearly does not work, and why it failed at the box office, is that the strange and uncomfortable parts are perhaps a too peculiar and uncomfortable tone. Instead of laughing during the scene of a man suspended from a basement ceiling masturbating over another man while he makes love to his wife, I think most of us just groan clumsily and wonder what Andy Humphries would think. Well, maybe he shows us what he was thinking clearly.
