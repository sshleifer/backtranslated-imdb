This show is based on the concept that high + disgusting + repetition = fun. The comic writing does not exist, in fact I face serious repercussions even compared to entertainment of any kind. Here is the premise. Two girls accidentally get their scams posted on the Internet and, after their initial success, hilarity occurs. They come up with the idea that they should do a webcast to show their brilliance. <br /> <br /> Well, then, where should I start? Let's start with the hint of laughter, the reminder that we use frequently but never the success that we, the spectators, should laugh at. According to the Foley boys, this show is the funniest thing on the planet. We should all drop loads on our pants because of the brilliance of the humor before us. The laugh track goes seriously every few seconds. It is very possible that he usurps Scooby-doo for the king of laughter to make excessive use of. <br /> <br /> Then the in-your-face-scream-on-the-part-of-our-lungs-the-madness-of-grouping-of-words-to-seem trick is also employed -tonto with little or no success Whoa and let's not forget to create new words to sound funny trick. Is that web-o-licious and poop-tastic? What the hell ... <br /> <br /> Finally, the acting. I can not complain at all here. The actors are young and inexperienced, but this must and can be corrected with good professional help. Due to inexperience, Nick should help the actors define their craft. Instead, in the usual way of nick, the actors are placed in front of the camera and they are told to "act". What for the most part is the recitation of robotic lines, lost time and epic failure in general. <br /> <br /> The lack of something in this show makes it an unpleasant representation of how not to be funny. Do not waste your time. This show is degrading all of humanity.
