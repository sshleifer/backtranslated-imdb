The business executive is kidnapped, made to roam miles and miles in a forest for days and days exchanging dialogues with his kidnapper. And we have to listen to all the nonsense ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, your brat wife and family are at home with the FBI wondering what to do ......... in no time She seems worried about her husband's fate, except when it comes to the rescue ... A love story "Give me a break!" <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, and almost every scene is filled with a air of expectation that something significant is going to happen, but it never happens. <br /> <br /> The result of the kidnapping is predictable and stupid, and it becomes even more foolish when we learn the fate of the kidnapper. <br /> <br /> This is garbage: <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
