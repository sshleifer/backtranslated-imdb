This is definitely a "lesser known" comedy short of the twenties. The only reason I saw it was because it was on a Kino Films DVD with shorts without Laurel and Hardy with Ollie. They are interesting and historically important, but also in general, below average for the movie style. Compared to the shorts of Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle and Lloyd, they are definitely one step below in quality and humor. Also, the music that accompanied it was quite poor by the standards of other silent DVDs. I ended up turning off the sound due to the inappropriateness of the music to establish the proper mood. But, despite this, it is still worth seeing them. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest about this short film. It was the last of the 8 on this DVD and, when I arrived, I was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts. Therefore, it is possible that the film is a bit better than a 4, but certainly, if this is the case, it is not better than a 5! The movie is a fairly standard short about an incompetent bellboys. Nothing particularly interesting and there are certainly MUCH better silent shorts out there.
