This film is a juxtaposition of several characters of super bad and tough motorcyclists, little connected but without a real story. Some of the scenes are very well filmed. If they took the same cast and the same team, and made a movie called Gent, who was the coolest character in the film and proposed an interesting and continuous story, maybe it could be decent. As it is, prepare for a series of intruders of tough-guy characters, all of whom do nothing more than ride the desert all day and cause problems, while those who remain never burn in the sun and keep Perfect hair and clothes, and you never need to look for them. a house or money, etc. There was a kind of background story about the characters that went through several people who were murdered and a treasure that was probably supposed to be the plot.
