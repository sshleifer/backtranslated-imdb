A multimillionaire marries a doctor. He has not worked in a day and she is dedicated to his profession. He sees it every day. Something has to give. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Henry Fonda, finally decides to do something with his life. He becomes a salesman in a department store, but soon he is fired because the poorest people need work. Meanwhile, Dr. Helen Hunt, (Barbara Stanwyck) has given up her practice? What is there to do? <br /> <br /> Kirk (Fonda) buys a bankrupt hospital and now both will be happy helping others while they make an existence. <br /> <br /> What about the writing here? ? When she is upset with her husband, Dr. Hunt says: "You have been acting like a gestapo." This is supposed to be a comedy. Swill. <br /> <br /> A very boring and tedious movie. Very little happening here.
