4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> A somewhat unbelievable story with some haunted house-like "crashes" that really do not fit. <br /> <br /> Gary Oldham's performance is very erratic ... Not so much the quality of the performance but the consistency. His character does not behave consistently. Sometimes quiet / relaxed / methodical / reflective, sometimes violent / noisy / almost mad. It just is not credible. <br /> <br /> Have you dated many 80s movies? Will they be more pleasant in 20 years? <br /> <br />
