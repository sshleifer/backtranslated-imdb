I'm a fan of good, plausible action movies. And I'm a big fan of elite military units like the Navy SEALs. Finally, I'm a big fan of Michael Biehn. Unfortunately, none of those allowed me to really enjoy this movie at that time. I gave him another opportunity more recently when I bought the DVD. Here are the problems with this movie in a quick list: 1. It is a poor man's weapon, for example, it includes a virtual music video of the SEAL team playing golf with a soundtrack of "The Boys Are Back In Town", that concludes with Charlie Sheen makes an inane chase to recover his towed car. <br /> <br /> 2. This is simply a Charlie Sheen movie, when Sheen tried to be famous before starting to do things like Hot Shots. The reports I've heard indicate that Sheen was a baby on the set and affected the roles and direction that the other actors in the film got. <br /> <br /> 3. Biehn is the head of the SEAL team, but Sheen rarely obeys him. Any SEAL that shows the lack of discipline that has the character of Sheen, or that endangered the team as it does, would not even have managed to overcome the training of BUDS, much less have formed a team. <br /> <br /> 4. The SEALs are trained in weapons. However, in one part of the film a SEAL has to "discover" how to use a Stinger missile from the United States. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in the movie. The assault entrance at the beginning, Bill Paxton as "God", and some of the images in what was supposed to be Beirut at that time. In general, although this movie is a loser.
