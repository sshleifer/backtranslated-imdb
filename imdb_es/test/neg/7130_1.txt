This "remake" is a complete misfortune: so mediocre, cheap and prosaic, it would not deserve more than a couple of rancorous lines. <br /> <br /> It is also a cheat, with a ridiculous script served by such contrived and amateur "acting", you are always aware that there is a stage, a camera, a fake, no direction, no suspended reality that Allow you to delve into the story. <br /> <br /> The claustrophobic and suffocating tension of The small spaces and halls in the original Japanese masterpieces (Ju-On 1 and 2) are almost lost here in exaggerated sets and spaces. <br /> <br /> But worst of all, the moral enormity and the unbearable suffering, that both imparted a merciless logic to the original mother and the child victims became relentlessly vengeful ghouls, are completely ruined by utter nonsense and fear of the boogie-man style. <br /> <br /> If the American public is not willing to read subtitles and rise above the lowest common denominator, preferring to swallow this type of condescending colony. They deserve this pathetic curse: the movie itself.
