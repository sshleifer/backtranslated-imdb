Very poor quality and the acting is just as bad. This movie is an excellent example of the current England and mentality. Jesus is not mentioned in this film nor does the film present any kind of writing like Christianity, as most people know. <br /> <br /> I am also very surprised because this movie is a BBC program and the BBC is well known for its quality in programming, but it seems that the BBC's attempt to rival the psycho-drama of Hollywood is failing completely. <br /> <br /> Deficient performance, bad plot, bad culture that seems to have no religion. I would not even bother buying this, instead, it's better to try to rent it or buy it when you go to the $ 2 container.
