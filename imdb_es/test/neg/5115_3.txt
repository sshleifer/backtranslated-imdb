This movie is exactly the same as Ridley Scott's, "Someone To Watch Over Me," which is a classic. It stars Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers and the bad boy of the Fugitive. It is a quality film, with good direction and great performance. This movie is the opposite pole. It's the same plot, just less a good performance and add the direction of the TV movie. I have to say that I like the interaction between Lowe and the woman. She is sexy and her romance is credible on many levels. Unfortunately, that alone can not save this carbon copy of the classic Ridley Scott movie. <br /> <br /> Typically, poor quality television movies have a certain redeeming quality that, at least, you can see. I think that for me, the redemptive value of this film is that Rob Lowe and the protagonist have chemistry. That and I could see and compare the plot with another quality movie.
