To be honest, the movie was SO HORRIBLE that I loved it. Never in my life have I seen such a TERRIBLE movie. I was in shock. I mean, I do not even know what to say. <br /> <br /> The characters could not even keep their own weapons, in one minute a guy had an M16 and his friend had an MP5, then in the next In the scene they changed the weapons. (Do not ask, trust me, I know my weapons) And I'll never understand how they came from a place that looked like Vietnam, to an Arizona highway, to my backyard, and then to a chemical plant in California, that's what I took from him. <br /> <br /> Why would you fear a boy with a Halloween mask who uses a garbage bag for a cloak and will shoot you with plastic arrows? How is that scary? I wanted to swallow arsenic in the middle of the movie. I love how the "skeleton man" decided to randomly go to a wave of murders on that particular day. But hey, whoever made this movie should get shot in the knees and fed to a lot of fire ants. <br /> <br /> Good morning.
