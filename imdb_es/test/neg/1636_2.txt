There are many reviews that describe this movie as the worst one ever made. Of course, there are many mistakes: a mediocre performance, a rather boring and clich√© and, at times, paradoxical writing, and the sound of film B and the "special" effects. As noted, there are a lot of shines in the plot, which make the inhabitants of Cave a weave of fantasy film, especially compared to the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings. However, this movie is not the worst movie ever. Most, if not all, (including this revision) of these reviews are written by fans of MSTK3. Therefore, many of these reviews are quite summaries of the MSTK3 episode of _Cave Dwellers_. <br /> <br /> In the episode, Joel, Tom Servo and Crow tell the Mad Scientists that this is the worst movie ever sent. to them Of course, loyal fans have taken this appointment and ran with it. I have found that this film is endearing, not in the way one finds _Foresto Gump_, but in the effort put into this film by the cast. Also, this movie is ridiculous without its MSTK3 treatment. This is because _Cave Dwellers_ does not take itself seriously, and is not trying to import to its viewers some kind of fair theme. For all the puppets of monsters, the medieval delta wing and the continuity lapses, this film is no longer advertised as what it is, a surface representation of a rather superficial genre. <br /> <br /> In the same way, I can not dare to hate Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster. Instead, this hatred is for Coleman Francis, Tony Cardoza, Jennifer Lopez, Arch Hall, Jr., and so on. <br /> <br />
