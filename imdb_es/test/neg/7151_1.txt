Help, I've ended up in the cinema hell! What a stupid movie this is. Nothing really is good about it. <br /> <br /> Let's spit it out: <br /> <br /> 1) The story is incredibly implausible: an anti-EU terrorist group is chasing a group of guys driving through Western Europe carrying a Delivery of transparent bags filled with xtc pills. And the worst is that: they are serious about it! <br /> <br /> 2) The level of action should put a lot of shame on all the faces involved. <br /> <br /> 3) A money-eyed boy decided to let everyone speak in English for the international market to catch up. The ugliest advertising in history! The native French and Dutch languages ​​that speak intelligently have all the meaning and the result is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 4) The soundtrack is totally out of place and is badly chosen. <br /> <br /> 5) The camera, the editing and effects work is supposed to be some kind of post road movie style. , but it is hardly worthwhile and is not meant to accompany this story (read: anti-history). <br /> <br /> 6) Hidde Maas. The hero of Wildschut never fails to convince. A true actor. Usually, I would give him an extra point just for the fact that he was close. But no, I'm sorry, not this time, I just would not forgive myself ...
