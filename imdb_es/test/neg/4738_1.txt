AVP2 is a horrible movie. The dialogue was useless, the performance was pathetic, I practically did not have a story and you can not really tell what the hell is happening half the time due to the continuity errors and the holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> BUT! You will love it anyway. Because it pushes the limits in blood, violence, death, destruction and chaos. They have even killed children, newborns and unborn babies in this film. You'll be sitting there thinking "Oh, my God, that's disgusting." And they surprise you by killing the 'sexy girl who always lives with life' when the predator and the aliens fight in the hospital. <br /> <br /> It's as if the film industry said "We know that what we did in the first Alien Vs. Predator movie was bad, so we're doing it again, but this time we're getting help from psychopaths with vivid imaginations "It is predictable, the absonic and the useless ... but it will think for a while after seeing it.
