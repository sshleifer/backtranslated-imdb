What could go wrong with a movie that includes a group of Italians who pretend to be Flordians, and some vagabond-lava-octopus-crustacean like the hellspawn-devil-fish?!?! <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong, I tell you! <br /> <br /> This is a very good episode of MST3K because the interference in the ball, which without fail, is easy to do considering that this movie is a scrap piece with a terrible and boring plot. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for the MSTied version. 1/10 for the version without MST. <br /> <br />
