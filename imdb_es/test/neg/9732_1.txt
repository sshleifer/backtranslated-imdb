It seems that every time a conventional film company wants to make films for teenagers, it focuses on one thing: sex. Do not get me wrong, I'm not rude, but the fact that these people think that removing stones is all that interests me is highly offensive. Take The Convenant, a film that relies heavily on you finding the main characters attractive you think you can escape without a plot and / or a script that was not written by a six-year-old child. This is essentially The Craft with (supposedly) hot guys. And, yes, that's it. I got bored to tears. Even my friend, who usually throws bad movies at us, hated it. It's really incredibly bad, to the extent that it can be fun. I would have laughed if it were not for the fact that several other women who attended the cinema seemed to enjoy it. They were accompanied by several sly-looking guys who huddled positively and died when the boy's (really clich√©) boy's kiss came towards the end. Watching them squirm really was the highlight of the movie. I do not think that, in general, Hollywood movies publish good movies for teenagers (or, in fact, for anyone), so I think I will give up. Unless you're a teenager who likes The Pussycat Dolls, think of Paris Hilton as "sexy" and see MTV as a kind of wasteland. Life is hard when you are fifteen years old and you like art. :( P.S. Someone should have told the Director that not all teenage girls find that the members of the band are "totally HAWT LOL !!! 111 !!"
