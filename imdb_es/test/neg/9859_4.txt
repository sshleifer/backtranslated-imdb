Being an admitted chess addict, I was excited to see a documentary about the 1997 rematch between Garry Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. I expected to see the match in depth and much of what Kasparov had to say. Chico was wrong and misguided for a mile. This documentary is very similar to many modern documentaries: there are many flashes but not a real substance. After seeing it, it saddens me to say that I felt I wasted my time. One of the most annoying aspects of the documentary is that it does not stay in one place for a decent period of time. It has the typical MTV-type edition, where the camera shows different images and quick sound fragments of people every five seconds. It is very sad that the making of films has been diluted until the attention of a 10-year-old child. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is difficult to make a film about chess, but that does not mean it is a movie. I should make it flashy. However, 'Game Over' had a couple of interesting ideas. The idea was raised whether computers can think like human beings or not; if computers have advanced to a new unique level This is what Kasparov thought after the game, but this movie is not deep enough with this idea. In addition, this film tries to introduce a strange theory. It tries to imply the paranoid that a human being was doing the movements along with the help of the computer. Kasparov was suspicious about this, but to this day there is no evidence. Towards the end of the film, he tries to imply the strangeness that perhaps Anatoly Karpov could have been the human being who was doing the movements in secret with the help of Deep Blue. It's interesting to think about it, but I do not know how plausible or realistic it is. I still would not recommend this movie, not even for chess addicts.
