Amitabh and Jiah Khan, raised great expectations in their press conferences, although it was very easy for critics, and also for fans, that after all, this product so promoted, Ram Gopal Verma Factory, is going to fall flat on its face. , in all probabilities! Why, because Jiah was so immature and childish, and Bacchan, confused guilty and insecure. they themselves did not know, what the hell they were talking about, to the press, following the line of the label, that some love stories should not be understood, or something like that! Why the title is Nishabd? Ramu needs to update his knowledge of Sanskrit, since Vidhu Vinod needs to study Mahabharata, marking online, another glorious failure of the year, Eklavya! The comparison with sweet hearts, and that of Lolit, is inevitable, since the so-called plot was supposed to be inspired by them. but, unfortunately, Ramu has hardly made any serious effort to deepen the psyche of aging and young people. Lolly pop sucks the last indicator of innocence? and contrary to that childish streak, the show of legs on the dining room table, with a Vijay, which is Bacchan in that role, explodes in shouts of intrepid laughter incessantly after the halls. this girl, in fact, is in her seductive game, attracting poor Vijay to think, she is in love with him. The legs are also thin enough, and that act of putting the water hose through the legs is pretty obscene. is beyond anyone's comprehension, how can a girl, come as a guest to the house of some body, be so shameless, shameless and excessively powerful? and why the hell of that stupid wife, played by Revathi, remarkably well, though badly written, and unrealistically characterized, encourages her own husband to dance with a young girl who says sexually? That part of Vijay, try to get some refreshments for your daily life is an absolute stupidity. because, apparently, it seems that he is happy as he is, with a well-established life and a pastime to recreate. This is reminiscent of Blame it on Rio, the eldest father, and his young love, superbly played by Michael Caine. Bacchan looks terrible in the close-ups, and above all, where Kevin spacey and Jeremy Irons looked bland and handsome, so young chickens are sometimes attracted to older men, because of their charming personality, compared to the vulnerability of young children. your age. The only good thing about this movie are the green and extensive landscapes, the winding roads and the pleasant cinematography. without substance, not even a sparkling spectacle of emotions, drama, or even intriguing, stormy sex as in Lolita, this superficial movie is not surprising, he fell flat on his face and had to end up on the screens during the first weeks. Next time, before mentally copying any Hollywood theme, Ramu should do his work at home and Bacchan should think twice. You can not fool all people at all times, Mr. Bacchan!
