Code 46 is one of those science fiction movies in which the government controls who you can love, and in fact will punish you if you try to procreate with the wrong person. Those who have and those who do not have live in completely separate territories, the powers can eliminate their memories, etc. We've seen this before, but it's okay, there are no movies that are 100% original. This type of premise is always fun to contemplate. Unfortunately, just imagining a future like that is more interesting than seeing Code 46. The characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. Maybe it's a comment about a dehumanized future, but it's still boring to see it. Is slow. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the images are nice, but generally (along with its "evocative" soundtrack) it looks like a commercial of glorified perfumes. The code 46 also sometimes uses the type of television camera work that I find annoying. You know, two characters talk while the camera "floats" on one side. Two seconds later, he is floating on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep your attention. <br /> <br /> My friends liked this movie. If they tried to see him again, I probably would not unless they agreed to pay me $ 50.
