Mel (Ethan Hunt), the main character in this sex-filled nonsense, points out several times: "He deserves something better than this!" The "she" she refers to is ginger, played by the beautiful Brandy Davis, who in fact deserves better than this. Brandy deserves something better than this movie, his beautiful writing and the pervert Mel. A boy who goes down to see his girl dreamed of having sex with another man, even in a virtual world, seriously does not deserve it at all. An A- for simulated sex scenes, an F for the script.
