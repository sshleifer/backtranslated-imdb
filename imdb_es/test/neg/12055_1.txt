But I can not say how I really feel about this pile of smoking manure. Where to start The quality of the film, there is none. I've seen clearer photos in the funniest VIDEOS AT HOME in the United States! The performance is poor, the effects of blood are good. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over again. At least on a Friday the 13th or HALLOWEEN we are left with a main character for the most part. There are no main characters, only victims. Man, now we come to the worst part of everything. The final survivor kills the clown and discovers that he was one of his friends. Then, when the police finally arrive, they do not believe her and she is locked in a rubber room. What kind of ending do you call it, shit, that's what. In my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie, which was just a sloppy script. The excuse: "It has to end badly, it's a horror movie". or "We have to finish badly to leave it open to a sequel" are just unconvincing excuses and that's it. I must give the BLOOD OF THE FIELD the TURKEY OF THANKSGIVING.
