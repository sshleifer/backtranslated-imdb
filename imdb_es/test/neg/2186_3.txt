OK, so this movie is well acted. It has a good address, but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years. The heterosexual man "deciding to be gay" and the homosexual man "Deciding to be heterosexual" I enjoyed it until the last 20 minutes, after that I was very offended. As often happens in these films, heterosexual actors play the leading roles and gay actors play the right secondary roles. The protagonists are played by handsome men, but do not let that distract you from the fact that this is a movie that leaves you feeling unhappy. All the romance and relationships that you expect to happen do not. Unless you are a priest, in which case God bless the heterosexual woman who cures our homosexuals.
