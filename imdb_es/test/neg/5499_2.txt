In the past I've loved Tim Burton. He loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. The costumes drama scenes in the beginning were the kind of bad and heavy things that used to plague the historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the head cutting scenes, which just left me cold, and that's the kind of thing that should mean something, I would think. Yes, there were some beautiful trees and cloudy nights and the rider who jumped from the tree was a nice special effect, but in general the film was boring and useless.
