THE STAR PACKER is one of the approximately 152,000,000 westerns in which John Wayne performed during the 1930s. Well, the number is a bit exaggerated, but it seemed almost as many. This is because these B movies were created quickly with very low budgets to be the second feature, or less, in a theater. Most Bs were quite cheap and tended to reduce costs to keep costs low and THE STAR PACKER is no exception. To save on costs, incidental music is not used, runtimes were kept below one hour, writing was often quite derivative and actors are mostly minor talents, and Wayne himself was definitely far from being a family name at this time. Some of these characteristics of Wayne are quite good, while others, like this one, can be seen, but they are also quite silly and inconsequential. I enjoyed this movie and most of the others, but it's probably because I have a bit of sun. <br /> <br /> Wayne plays John Travers, a Marshall of the USA. UU That investigates the actions of a local gang to persecute him. The locals go out and steal from the stage. This is strange, since the film was apparently set in modern times or near it, as they used modern telephones and machine guns, things I would not expect to find in the Old West. Such anachronisms are quite common in B Westerns, since the films of Gene Autry (for example) abound in them. Wayne's partner is Yak, played by a double and friend in Wayne's real life, Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> The bad boy is an unknown figure known as "The Shadow" and dispenses his instructions through a black screen. That hides his face! This sounds exactly like a character in a series of movies: the kind of evil that kids loved, but adults complained because they were as stupid and a bit like Blofeld or Dr. Evil. The problem is that if you listen to his voice and pay attention, it becomes evident at the beginning of the film that this "Shadow" is George Hayes. Now speaking of Hayes, this is the same guy that later in the movies was known as Gabby Hayes, but here and in several of Wayne's early films, he does not look or look like Gabby. In THE STAR PACKER, he was well dressed, well articulated and clean-shaven. Imagine that! In real life, apparently this was more the real George Hayes, though I doubt it was evil! Now, as you can see in the last paragraph, there really is no mystery in this movie. You stay with the performance (passable and nothing more) and the acrobatics, that in fact were quite surprising. Again and again, one incredible feat happened after another, like men jumping from horse to horse and some scenes of great fights, all done, by the way, by Canutt and his friends. Canutt was often John Wayne's double in the movies, and this went on for decades. The problem with some of the stunts, however, is that it seems that the filmmakers actually killed a few horses to get those big pieces of "tripping" that are seen later in the movie. Until around 1940, filmmakers often strung thin metal wire and ran horses at full gallop. In the process, the legs of the horses were generally broken and the horses were subsequently sacrificed. One of the worst examples of this was the movie JESSE JAMES, where several horses were brutally killed, which led the American Humane Association to insist that a representative of the organization participate in the filming to certify that the animals are NOT injured in the production. Then, since about 1940, movies have this little disclaimer. The STAR PACKER was done long before the disclaimer and I can not see how the horses did these "tricks" without being killed. <br /> <br /> In general, this is, in the best of cases, a hobby due to a bad plot. , on occasions of bad performance and an incredible cruel attitude towards horses. I do not have a bleeding heart, but I can not understand this contempt for a poor old animal.
