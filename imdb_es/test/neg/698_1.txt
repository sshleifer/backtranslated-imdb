I really enjoy this genre, but The Cell was one of the worst movies I've had the bad luck to see. While about 25 percent of my audience went in and out of the theater during the visualization (or left altogether), I was foolish enough to excel. The main problem with this story (there were too many to list them all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things ... one, to provide fear to the murderer (you get caught twenty minutes in the movie that is missing) and you must Give the victim whose life is at stake (the tank girl) the development of enough character to really interest him if they arrive on time with her or not. Not only did I lose the girl's trail, I got such a small idea of ​​her that it was just a blurry face and when I remembered that it was part of the story, I really did not care what happened to her. While the images were interesting in a flashback of LSD, they often did not make sense and this should be a lesson that images can not compensate for the lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example). Do you know or care what happened with the women kneeling in that field and looking at the sky? Ridiculous.
