Irwin Allen, former master of the cinematic, took out all the stops in VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. A Walter Pidgeon, very old, who could actually have died when he played this role, is the commander of an atomic submarine that should be the size of the Empire State Building. All rooms are gigantic and some even seem to have no roofs. You could play bowling and hold a formal ball simultaneously in some of these rooms. The submarine, called Seaview, is in its first race when hell breaks loose: the Van Allen radiation belt catches fire and the Seaview must launch a missile into the belt at a certain time, otherwise the world will fall in flames of global warming! Throughout the trip there are a lot of actors of really terrible characters, many taken from television. This turns them into television hackers. The worst thing is probably that poor Stella Stevens, Barbara Eden, as naval secretary, got too tight, dressed in high heels and acted as if she was appearing in a beach party movie. Maybe it's because Frankie Avalon is also on the way. Joan Fontaine, of bad age, almost unrecognizable here, plays a visiting doctor with a big secret, but in truth, who cares? VOYAGE is a really bad movie, obviously made for young children, but what child will sit still to take endless pictures of a miniature model of Seaview that moves again and again from right to left on the screen in what obviously Is it a study tank? There is not a scene in which we believe that these people are really on board a submarine. When the ocean view is shaken, the actors are thrown, sometimes in opposite directions to each other. As in the old STAR TREK TV series, when the bridge trembles. If I remember correctly, you can not see any fish or sea creature, except an octopus that is momentarily hooked on the submarine, a nod to 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. The octopus, if real, was probably about a foot long and it shows. Worse still, when people are standing next to the glass nose of the Seaview, the ocean they are supposedly observing is obviously a close-up that involves an invisible air hose that bubbles up, probably filmed in a fish tank. You have never seen bigger bubbles in your life. One would think that only these bubbles would break the damn submarine into pieces. Unfortunately, an elderly Peter Lorre is also on the way. Near the end, when the missile is entering the fire belt, Lorre is enthusiastically seen congratulating Pidgeon while everyone else is waiting for his signal to begin to shake hands and embrace victory. A scene from a shot if I've ever seen one. What stinks. It's not even good to laugh. Stay with silent operation.
