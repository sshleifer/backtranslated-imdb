Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of comics (but if the comics are of the same "quality" as the movie, it's hard to believe there are any), but this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Non-existent argument, laughable acting, silly dialogue ... This movie is so bad that it hurts. Much. The fact that some people actually gave this 10/10 is an insult to any good movie or at least mediocre (or at least bad). If you hate yourself, then look at Tank Girl! On second thought, if you hate yourself SO MUCH, maybe you should kill yourself ... My rating: -34/10
