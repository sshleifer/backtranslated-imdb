CONGO is probably the worst big-budget movie of the nineties. It is so bad that you can see it again and again. A group of people with different agendas go into the darkest Africa, where they find a temple of riches as in MINES DE KING SOLOMON, but with cannibalistic gorillas that guard those riches. For their part, humans have a "talking" gorilla named Amy who helps save the day at one time or another. So much for the plot. Dialogue everywhere is witty, the performance almost uniformly atrocious, certainly countryside (Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson are available to insure the ham factor) and the special effects are abysmal. Wait until you see the cannibal gorillas. And the lava! Oh yes, did I mention that there is a volcanic eruption to finish the grand finale? Laura Linney, of all people, is on her way on this bumpy ride. What could he have been thinking? This is around the same time he appeared with Richard Gere and Ed Norton in PRIMAL FEAR, a movie that helped ensure his stardom.
