This movie was horrible, and it does not even deserve to be called a movie. To my way of thinking, it's more like three mediocre episodes of Disney cartoons that come together freely to make a single video that pretends to be the sequel to the first Atlantis movie, which was much more well done and enjoyable. And where do I start with the problems of this DVD? The history? The characters? The images / animation? For me, they are all bad and can not be seen. First, the story on this DVD straight to video is ridiculous and useless. The only good thing about this is that it is consistent, that is, constantly bad, from the beginning to the end. Once the film is over, I still do not know why Milo has returned and how the incidents occur in the three small stories related to each other or to Atlantis. And all I could remember about this movie was how bad it makes me feel after seeing it. The characters feel wooden and lack personality, and the drawings look very different from the first. It can be said that obviously they are not in the hands of the same animators of the first. As the DVD played, I worried less and less about what might happen to the characters and I just hoped the movie would be over soon. In addition to the story and the characters mentioned above, the quality of the image is poor in this as well, probably one of the worst in the direct video products that Disney has released. As a fan of the original Atlantis: the lost empire, I could not be more disappointed with the return of Milo, which is a total waste of time and money. Thank God I rented it first instead of buying it. Even so, I still wish I had never seen this shit or even known its existence.
