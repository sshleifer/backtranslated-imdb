"You know, I've been to some cities where the girls were not so pretty, in fact, I've been to some cities where they're downright ugly, but it's the first time I've been in a city where there are no girls at all. that fans of the great classics remember this phrase that belongs to Vin ... one of the seven magnificent TRUE (from the first movie) ... <br /> <br /> Now I would like to express it here again. You know, I've seen some movies where the plot is not so good. In fact, I've seen some movies where the plot is terrible, but it's the first time in my life that I see the movie where there is no plot at all. <br /> <br /> OK. Maybe my previous statement is a bit exaggerated, but honestly ... how can you call the plot a crap that is happening in this movie? The bad guy (oh, do not ask me to give him his name, because I do not remember him and he's not even close to Calvera, whose name and character is unforgettable ...) he's trying to build the church with the name of his deceased children , who died in some battle, and this bad boy is kidnapping the poor villagers to force them to build the church ... <br /> <br /> first of all, how big the church must be to have to force hundreds of villagers to build it ... is it an Egyptian pyramid or something? but well, let's stop here about the plot and the absolutely forgettable character of a bad guy and let's say some words about the Seven ... <br /> <br /> The good old Chris of Yul Brynner, always calm, always silent , speaking less but speaking wise is gone (unfortunately). Oh no ... it's as quiet as before ... but now, the calm is so false that you do not buy it. (imagine, he meets a good old boy, whom he must rescue after so many years and there are only a few "hello, hello" and not even a handshake (that I remember)) ... honestly, it seems more like meet two strangers in an internet chat, instead of meeting Chris and Chico. That makes "new Chris" look more like a robot or terminator instead of our beloved fast weapon ... <br /> <br /> I will not stop talking about other characters. There simply is not ANY ... (imagine if a strong actor like Yul Brynner is so easy to forget, then other characters will be seen) ... <br /> <br /> There are still some attempts to give a background story to each of them ... for example, one is the favorite man of women, the second is a man with a dark past, whose wife was raped and murdered by the Indians and since then he is killing everyone and everything that is being moving ... but none of these characters makes any sense or can not take your heart. <br /> <br /> I remember that I was a small child and when O'reilly (the character of Charles Bronson) died in the first film I was crying. Here, I just did not care about each of them ... even if all of them with all the film crew would die, it seems I would not mind anymore ... <br /> <br /> So, please, go and see this movie ... I recommend it, because you will not have the other chance to see something worse than that.
