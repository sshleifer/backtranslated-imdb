Today, being President's Day, my wife and I had the "The Notebook" DVD, reviewed in our local library. It is a movie released in 2004 that fell under our radar, since we are great moviegoers. I am an author published with the hope of playing my first book on the screen. I noticed references to "The Notebook" in reviews of other films, that's why I mentioned it and this morning was the perfect opportunity. We both liked it very much. It made my wife cry; We could relate to many things with our own continuous love affair, and I even struggled to suffocate. <br /> <br /> This afternoon, after a lot of homework, work in the garden and lunch, we decided to really catch a matinee. When we arrived at the theater, after having seen most of the films in progress, we chose to watch "Victoria Day", which for some reason was not in the theater, even though both the IMDb films and those on my phone showed it there. So, instead, we saw the poster "Dear John" and that it was written by the same writer as "The Notebook", which makes it the obvious choice, since we enjoy both 'TN'. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! First, the characters did not have the same credibility or sense of empathy as 'TN'; and we kept commenting on all the similarities, about a dozen or more, which quickly made us realize that this movie was nothing, but, as another critic commented, "the notebook of a poor man!" I had a real 'cow of money' feeling, which means that the Sparks simply threw a story together, based on the exact 'TN' template just to make quick money. Not only that, after trollop of 'bug eyes' unlikely 'Dear John's-John' for the cancer patient with problems, we ridicule the film with each one, passing a stupid and soapy line to the end. There were only about 6 of us in the theater during this Monday morning at 4:45 p.m. and my wife even told me to keep it low so I would not ruin it for the others ... it was so bad. <br /> <br /> Seeing this on the heels of 'TN' ensured that the scam similarities were vividly recognizable and flagrant Sparks, cheap attempt at painfully obvious template writing. We just wish we could have seen the "Victory Day" in its place ... no matter how bad it was after seeing this bad entry to the cinema. And oh ..., during the last 30 minutes, I kept saying "... do not give the coins to the cow ... do not give the coins to the cow?"
