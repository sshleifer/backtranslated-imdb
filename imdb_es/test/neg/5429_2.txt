This is one of the best Crichton books. The characters of Karen Ross, Peter Elliot, Munro and Amy are very well developed and their interactions are exciting, complex and accelerated in this impressive novel. <br /> <br /> And approximately 99.8 percent of that was lost in the movie. Seriously, the script and the direction were horrendous and clearly made by people who could not understand what was good about the novel. I can not blame the actors because, frankly, they never had the chance to make this turkey equal to Crichton's original work. I know that good novels, especially those with a touch of science fiction, are difficult to bring to the screen in a way that matches the original. But this may be the worst absolute disparity of quality between the adaptation of the novel and that of the screen. The book is really good. The movie is just terrible.
