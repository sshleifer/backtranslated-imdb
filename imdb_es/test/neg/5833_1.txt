This was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. The story was about a prisoner sent to space to try to save humanity, but it turned out that the prisoner was aboard a spaceship with a lesbian nympho commander. The whole story was about having sex over and over again. There was no need for all these images, just to create a soft porn movie. Of course, we had to watch the heroine of the movie having sex for about 2 minutes. I do not know what all this had to do with the real plot of the movie, except that I assume men see it. I gave it 1 out of 10 only because there was no other lower rating. Do not waste your money or your time, it has nothing to do with science fiction, but a movie for young teenagers to watch t & a. The creature was alone more than half the movie and looked like the alien in the movie with Signorney Weaver. Poor excuse for entertainment.
