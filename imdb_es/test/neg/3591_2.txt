Following the good words of my friends, I hired this movie, hoping that at least it was equal to the laughs of a similar movie, "House Party", but I was very disappointed and I got bored. <br /> <br /> Falling asleep while watching a movie is never a good sign. I do not know if this did not appeal to me because I do not live in "da hood", or if I'm not black, but probably one of the two. <br /> <br /> It tries to simulate some movies, but it only makes a couple of laughs, but in the long run it fails miserably. I miss him.
