If you are an American 'TOURIST' looking for a 'TRAP' here it is. Was this "Trading Spaces visits to TUSCANY?" There were too many stereotypes. Little attention was paid to the development of the character and the plot. YAWN. The highlight of the film: the launch of the flag. Poor guy! I thought I was going to lose an eye!
