Enter the Ninja (1981) was the first of several "Ninja" films produced by Cannon starring Japanese sensation Sho Kosugi. But the star of the first "Ninja" movie was the legendary tough guy Franco Nero. Regrettably, neither Mr. Nero nor Sho Kosugi could make this film visible. When you have two bad guys in an action movie and it's neither observable nor fun, there are some things that are missing. But I digress. Skip this chapter and watch the next movies of the series. They are more interesting and very funny. <br /> <br /> The next one is Revenge of the Ninja. Instead of playing the "evil oriental" (I use that term tongue on the cheek, yes). He is the star! Strange for a western movie. Look at it instead. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except for fans of Sho Kosugi or fans of the movie Cannon.
