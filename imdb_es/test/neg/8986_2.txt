The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins to relive her childhood traumatic past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). Tory discovers that her friend was the first in a series of murders that are still happening. Can their psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the ongoing murders? <br /> <br /> You really do not need to find out because, Oh my God! This was so bad! I know that all Nora Roberts fans will come to this movie and give you tons of 10. Then, the rest of us will see an IMDb score of 6 and really think it's worth watching this movie. But do not be fooled. The ending was predictable, the interpretation TERRIBLE (I do not even mean the southern accents * y'all *) and the story was trivial. Just remember ... You were warned!
