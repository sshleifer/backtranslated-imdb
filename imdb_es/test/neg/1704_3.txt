This film, if it had been done correctly, has so much potential. The parody movies are always fun, and people like them because they are light, stupid and silly, but fun. This movie was fun in parts, but it could have been a lot more fun. The performance itself was good of all the actors, but ... I was not satisfied. It seemed a bit empty, and my summary of the title says it all about the effects. The right green screens were not used for this movie ... funds were added, which looked terrible. No wonder this movie went directly to DVD lol. It was not ALL a total loss, it's fun and it will give you a good laugh (THEN, NOT WITH THE MOST OF THE TIME).
