This is a gift for fans of Z-grade movies. Here you will find writing and acting bad enough to rival anything Ed Wood produced. Veteran bad movie actor Cameron Mitchell is a former makeup artist for "Paragon Studios" who, after an unpleasant acid incident in his face at a social gathering, becomes a mad scientist and titter with a rubber scar on his face . he takes revenge by kidnapping the Paragon actors and turning them into living statues in his Secret Laboratory (tm), located in the local wax museum. Or are they zombies that carry out their orders? He is not sure <br /> <br /> Happily, many of his favorite movie cliches are here. Take a look at the villain's lab! Are those mysterious smoking vats of liquid? Colored water test tubes without purpose explained? Hurrah! And that? Do we see spare arms and legs arranged informally on a wooden shelf? You can bet! Marvel at the clumsy detectives who act directly on Plan Nine! Now, enjoy a stupid car chase and hear more dizziness screaming than you could wish for. Raise an eyebrow at the plot of the line, which becomes even more opaque by the totally meaningless ending that seems to have no connection with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Cheesy trash and lots of fun for connoisseurs of bad movies.
