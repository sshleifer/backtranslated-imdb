The most irritating thing about "Dies d'agost" (August days) is not simply that NOTHING HAPPENS in this film, but that the director Marc Recha has the nerve to pretend that this film is a tribute to leftist Catalan journalist Ramon Barnils. Unless mentioning the name of Barnils sometimes constitutes a "tribute", this claim is a complete fraud. You will not learn practically anything about Barnils in this film or about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) or about the special role of Catalonia in that war. Nor will he learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic Catalans for years by the victorious and vengeful Franco. <br /> <br /> The images of the Catalan countryside are very beautiful, of course, but "Dies d'Agost" does not have a sufficiently extensive and varied collection of scenes to qualify as a travel diary. The large number of still images shown, for example, the not very illuminating images of the forest floor, is the clearest indication of the scarcity of ideas here. The aimless drifting of the brothers Marc and David during their camping trip does not produce a convincing film. On the contrary, the strongest impression is that of a movie made by and for middle-aged hippies. Do not waste your time. Read a good book about the Spanish Civil War in its place. (I recommend the biting anti-Stalinist "Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Spain" by Felix Morrow, which contains an exciting account of the 1937 Barcelona uprising). <br /> <br /> Barry Freed
