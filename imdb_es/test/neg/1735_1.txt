What really caught my attention in this movie was how little the plot made sense. So many characters were introduced at random, it was like I imagined that "THE ROOM" by Tommy Wiseau would be imagined again for the Disney Channel set. We had the old wise couple who kept going out where "Jane" worked, telling the same story about how the "sodas" brought them together, or the mother of Jane / Stepmother / woman with random crying that would appear at random times. <Br /> <br /> Aaron Carter's performance is definitely the highlight of this movie: he actually waited for every scene in which he appeared. The editing is tremendously bad, with cuts of scene that do not make sense. The character of "Jane" is really irritating, he approaches and he laments "J.D. McQueen". The scenes with the "Music Awards" are more depressing than anything else. And the end of this movie is surreal.
