I'm not surprised that the creators of this desperate film could not find a distributor in the UK, and then they had to release it as a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. The distributors could see clearly what the filmmakers and the Sunday newspaper could not see, that this was a movie that simply was not going to recover its costs. <br /> <br /> As it is a thriller about riddles, it would have helped if they had chosen a main actor that could adequately enunciate, instead of the murmur of Vinnie Jones, who seems to pronounce "enigma" as "riell". And it would have helped if the dialogue had not been flooded by noisy places or scenes flooded with distracted and inappropriate music. The plot is ridiculous: the lost story of Charles Dickens supposedly helps our hero to solve a series of modern murders, but also a copy of the Adventures of Tintin of Herge, since the link between Dickens and Jones is more non-existent than faint. And we have the ridiculous premise that a presumed investigative journalist who puts his hands on a manuscript of Dickens that had not been previously discovered, would take several days to read it, only so that Dickens flashbacks can continue to play throughout the film, as Yes I had some connection with it. That they do not I mean, if you found a new Dickens manuscript, would not you go to a quiet place and read it? The film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become obligatory since The Sixth Sense, but in this case it does not surprise you as much as it insults your intelligence. If the movie suddenly becomes supernatural at twelve o'clock, revealing that Vinnie Jones is a robot could have been more acceptable. It may not have seemed so turgid if the movie had been elegant, but it is not. And in several places it seems decidedly amateur: there is a scene in which a table is placed with a cutting and jumping technique of the 60s, but they have not made sure that the person placing the table is completely out of the frame between the cuts. As a result, you can see how things change at the edge of the frame, when you're really supposed to be seeing things change in the center of the frame. A good rule for making movies is: if you do not understand how to make a technique, try something else. <br /> <br /> The real puzzle is why someone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie. first.
