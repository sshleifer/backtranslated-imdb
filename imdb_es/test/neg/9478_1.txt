Just what the world needed: another shallow film of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. This film delivers horrible messages to girls all over the world, with a stereotypical "high school" experience. They make learning anything seem completely taboo. I can not stand the false French accents, or those guys on mopeds running around that eventually "fall" for the twins. Why am I putting everything in parentheses? Because everything is stereotyped. The twins even complain about not having a stereotyped grandfather. They must be happy, they even have a grandfather at all. How does this fit into Mary-Kate / Ashley's mold? He has them fixing a single man who (panting!) IS NOT HIS FATHER !!!!! Yes, friends, they actually have a mother who appears during the five seconds. I have not even sat for thirty minutes and I can already tell how it will end. This film is so pitiful that it makes Miss USA look like an academic bowl. Really.
