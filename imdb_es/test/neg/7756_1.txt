The only thing I regret is that you can not qualify a movie in IMDb with a 0. "A Dinner ..." he definitely deserved it! AT LEAST. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER? * The movie begins with a group of people entering a crypt to awaken an ancient vampire. When a man cuts himself and his blood drips and falls on the rotten and dry corpse that is supposed to be a bloodsucker, the metamorphosis and the vampire take place, in an effect similar to the ANIMATION (you would believe it!), Hurries quickly. A more human form, only to reveal that he is wearing a suit and a bow tie! A BOW-TIE, yes. Red, if my memory serves me well! I tried to see random scenes skipping a bit, but there was nothing better than the initial sequences. That's the point when I turned off the movie, cursing her for making me wait to see a vampire movie. Surely it is not one, unless you are 5 years old and you can take that stupidity so seriously. <br /> <br /> So, if you like vampires and do not want to feel rebellious or even disgusted, learn from my mistake and do not even try to see this garbage!
