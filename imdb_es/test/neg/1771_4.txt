This is a species that is already becoming a beautiful model (Mathilda May). A crushing baby wanting to kiss and kill! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a strong release and is infected by a virus of perforation in all the medium until the end. <br /> <br /> The weakest Spot is the presentation of the basic plot / story. As I should have compared it, Natasha Henstridge's species obtained the same plot, but they add a very interesting lateral plot and do not mention the good actions and the strong cinematic ending. <br /> <br /> This explains why Patrick Stewart joins the company fleet. in Star Trek Next Generation; I wanted to find more models in glass cages, floating inside Halley-Comet. <br /> <br /> A must see for science fiction fans.
