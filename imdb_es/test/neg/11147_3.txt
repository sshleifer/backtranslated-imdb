The plot of this is reduced to Ah-nuld against Satan, and what I remember most about the movie is a lot of explosions, shots, blood, noise, and let's not forget that inflammable satanic urine. The story does not make sense, it's completely predictable and it's so full of holes that I could not take it a little seriously. Stick to "Rosemary's Baby" or "The Exorcist" if you want to see a good Devil movie and ... um, well, I can not think of any good "Action" movie right now (probably because it's so far and few between ), so it is only in that category. This movie gets a rating of 3 out of 10 for my camp value, and for a good performance by Gabriel Byrne as that old debutante Satan.
