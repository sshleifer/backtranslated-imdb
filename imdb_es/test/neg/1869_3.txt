The beautiful and busty Stacie Randall plays the bad bitch, dressed in PVC, Alexandra, the faithful acolyte of Faust, an evil entity trapped in hell. Determined to free her master, the evil wicked gets into a store to steal a magical gem vital for her success; but while performing a satanic ritual to summon Faust, the foolish mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the ground, resulting in the loss of the gem and in the release of two tiny, troll-like creatures, called Lite and Dark. <br /> <br /> Now Alexandra must find a replacement gem, which will not be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her former lover, police detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis), who investigates the theft in the warehouse and knows very well what the evil Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, the half-dimensional pints of skill wise, Lite and Dark, get into all sorts of bizarre problems while trying to find a way back home. <br /> <br /> In the movie world of Jim Wynorski, all women are big-breasted girls with the fashion sense of a cheap prostitute. Ghoulies IV is no exception: every woman in this film, whether it is a police captain, an antique curator or a mental patient in a nursing home, is hot, hot, hot and wears little, and this is the fact. that makes this piece of STV, otherwise totally impossible to decipher, almost bearable. <br /> <br /> But be careful, although the presence of a half-naked and quality crumpet makes the march a bit easier, there is still a lot about this movie. to justify it being labeled as an ordeal: the performance is wooden and the dialogue is painful; the black humor (as the propaganda on DVD describes it) is as fun as a knee for the adepts, with the comedy of Lite and Dark jokes that are particularly worth shrinking; and the special effects are the gangue basement, which consists of gummy creatures and visual effects that would have been seen ten years before. <br /> <br /> 3/10 only because of the high bimbo coefficient.
