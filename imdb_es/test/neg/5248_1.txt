When renting this direct video movie, I did not expect an amazing movie. (It does not mean that just because a movie is in the movies it will). Following the story told in the epic poem, this film offers a unique vision of the history of monsters and super humans. The general picture can be summarized as conflictive, with its mix of medieval and post-apocalyptic (reminiscent of Mad Max). With a soundtrack of rock and techno to start, one is feeling a little off. The fight scenes, although incredible, are entertaining, and Christopher Lambert has some of the most interesting combinations of weapons that I have seen in the film, although it is often somewhat ineffective. The special effects used for the Grendel monster are surprisingly effective and are one of the few highlights. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert offers an average performance like Beowulf. It will not be as memorable as Highlander, but at least it was not as poor as the Fortress. The cast of support is quite neutral. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good story of action and adventure with a complex and attractive plot, I would not suggest this movie. However, if you want a film that is of little substance, full of campy battle scenes, and a somewhat predictable plot, find a copy of this.
