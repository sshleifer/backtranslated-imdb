I loved the original P.H. and I was somewhat satisfied with Bloodwings (II) and Ashes to Ashes (III), then I saw part IV. Oh, boy ... As a pumpkinhead enthusiast, I did my best to give Part 4 as much credit as I could, but it's pretty bad. The fight of the wedding reception right at the beginning of the movie is a terrible disaster for one thing. The argument of Hatfield and McCoy is incomprehensibly stupid and clich√©. How did the producers manage to use that tired family history? Wow awesome. The performance, in addition to Henrickson, is below average. The plot and the script are numbed. The current edition and cinematography are media, as is the address. I mean, the movie is not a total loss. As always: I really like watching Pumpkinhead, I love seeing Haggis the witch, and I like to see Harley's ghost in action. But the three characters had too much screen time. I thought that Haggis and Harley would end up going to a dinner club to have something to eat and drink at night, the same way they were being such little buddies in their cabin. The conclusion is ... I just wanted all the characters in this festival to vomit a plot to be dead within 20 minutes of the beginning of the image. Where does Sci-Fi get these so-called "film production professionals" anyway? I could do a better job writing a drunk stone script. I'm sure there was a limited budget and everything, but come on! Look at it if you're a fan of the other three, but only once. And then come back and keep the two originals. What a shame !!
