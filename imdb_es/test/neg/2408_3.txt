During my struggle to stay awake during this borefest, I struggled during my almost dosing to discover a stupid plot with regard to fraternity brothers, incredibly annoying, annoyed, that I was in trouble with a psychotic, half radioactive half radio / half cyborg called Splatter who sends his soldiers after them for the murder of his prestigious politically vocal leader (... for whom Splatter committed suicide and blamed them for becoming the leader). These painted monsters form a group that expresses their feelings in an anarchic, though not violent, way, living in ruined streets abandoned by the "civilized world" expressing their concerns regarding nuclear disarmament. Anyway, most of the film has these five fraternity fans running through dark streets with painted walls, while Splatter and his punks chase them. Fortunately for these guys, they find a punk chic to help them on their journey out of this rather ugly land with which they are not familiar. This territory in which the boys of the fraternity are immersed is a true labyrinth of streets and alleys with the idea of ​​a more difficult exit, especially when the madmen and the Splatter group occupy almost all the shifts. <br /> <br /> Yes, they deceived me like others. Thanks to the HR Giger poster, which is more excellent. If only I had been the designer of this dreck ... this is not the case and we, the viewer, left a film modeled after, of all the films that it seems, THE WARRIORS by Walter Hill, except that this movie does not have the style or sand that the movie has. The film has a plethora of funny little fragments and boring confrontations between fraternities and punks with often ridiculous hand-to-hand combats. The environment is quite interesting, and there are some atmospheric uses of neon light, but the environment is not the problem. It is the plot and the characters that grow in the environment. The saddlebags under my eyes weighed every minute more this film continued. Yes, Texas CHAINSAW is starring Edwin Neal (... a funny-looking man who has an entertaining interview on the DVD that I rented for this movie in flames) and Marilyn Burns has "key" roles as opposing members of her faction against The government resulted in the final conclusion within a complex of buildings at the end. Neal's character, Splatter, uses these metal spikes that emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims.
