I hate movies that end like this !! <br /> <br /> This 16mm disaster is full of clich√©s, stereotyped characters, a generic, finished "plot" and a terrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this "Movie" we have the aggressive black guy, the girlfriend of the black guys, the blonde bitch, the possible "computer hacker" lesbian, the teacher of pedophilia ... Blah, Blah , Blah ... And then the Pumpkin Man. <br /> <br /> "Do you think someone is taking the legend too far?" This question is asked towards the end of the movie. Carrying the slogan of Scream 2 too far. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ***** Usually, I do not go into spoilers but I have to rant ... <br /> <br /> A dream? All was a dream! This is the most sissified way to finish a movie. "I do not know how to explain all this, and we do not have more money ... Let's make everything a dream." This is what the director / producer / actor / type of FX must have been thinking about. Yes, the director is the character of Mr. E. He did almost everything in this garbage movie. This is such a difficult ending ... And the director, it's okay, so he's been doing all the kidnapping! What did that have to do with the movie? Of course, black people are killed, the bitch is dead, the teacher who has a past of sexual harassment with the students dies (he is the main suspect) .... yuck yuck yuck !!! This movie burned my heart. <br /> <br /> Meaningless, meaningless, and made with the parents Visa and Mastercards (which tells me that it is probably still being paid), this movie is silly, boring and simply stupid. ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the credits. The way they presented the names, etc, at the beginning and at the end. It had a spooky feeling. Too bad the movie did not do it! <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
