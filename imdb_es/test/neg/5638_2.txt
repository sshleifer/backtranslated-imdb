Come now. How did all these talented actors / actresses end up in this mess? Was it some kind of blackmail / lost bet situation? Vinnie, you're a muscular man. I know what you were born to be. <br /> <br /> The jacuzzi scene? The Scrabble scene? I expected to hear the sound of "dragging the needle on the disk" at any time. <br /> <br /> And what was wrong with him carrying Dickens's invaluable manuscript? Let's see, I'm drunk in a bar, why do not I get Dickens's priceless manuscript? I'm going to meet some questionable thugs on the edge of the Thames, why not take my Dickens manuscript with no price? <br /> <br /> Crapola. <br /> <br /> Terrible. Avoid.
