I recently rented this promising mini series, I did not even know that it had been adapted for television. I really wanted to do it since the icon of the book is one of the best spy thrillers I've read. What a disappointment it was. The plot hardly resembles that of the book, the characters are completely wrong and there is an appalling performance. A pity really. The story behind Icon is perfect for the silver screen, but I think the television budgets are not big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book. <br /> <br /> Forsyth deserves a lot, much better than this. Avoid and stick to the book, which is a must read.
