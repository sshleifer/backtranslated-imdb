So, you've seen Romero's movies, yes? And you've seen Jacob's ladder, right? And the latest Hellraiser movies? Well, now let's make a movie from three o'clock, just put everything together and make a big mess, does it sound like a good idea? <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Absolutely horrible of God. Yes, it's an independent film, who cares? Is that a pass to make film excrement? The film tries to establish credibility by focusing on the interaction of the character, that is evident. Unfortunately for writers, they are not good for character interaction. This is not the night of the living dead; The characters are not entities that shout their lines inane each other in a vain attempt to be caught by the microphones on set. The dialogue is never interesting. For a film that focuses so much on character interaction, one would think that the characters would have something more to say than "WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO" ​​"I do not know" "WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING" Well, what are we going to do? "I DO NOT KNOW." "We should go". "Let's just accept our destiny." "No, we have to leave." "Good, let's go out." "No, maybe we should stay." <br /> <br /> This is not an exaggeration, there are exchanges in this movie that reach that level of redundancy and inanity. <br /> <br /> The worst of this movie? Half is a dream, and it really has no purpose. Nothing in the dream has relevance to anything in the rest of the movie. The writers could not decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster movie, so they only did both. It's obviously ridiculous, the cheapest trick in the book, and it's insultingly insulting, especially because I'm pretty sure they cheated on the idea of ​​Jacob's ladder, which handled the concept with much more competition than these pranksters could expect. do. <br /> <br /> And then there is the edition. The years of watching MTV and playing horror-themed videogames must have inspired the filmmakers, but it was probably a sad thing that they did not realize what made the editing and choppy obfuscation in those pieces of media effective in the first place. . In this film, you'll be confused often, and not in the right way, David Lynch, but the bad one. "Wait, I thought I had just died, right? So who the hell was that? Wait, who's that guy? Where?" Where he came from? How did you get here? kind of way It is constantly and constantly bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a piece of ridiculous garbage and should only be searched if you want to be wrecked with some friends and laugh at it. <br /> <br /> And as a final note: as for the "comedy" that other people talk about, everything is involuntary. There is not a single piece of intentional comedy in this movie. It is assumed that everything is a serious serious study of characters, because filmmakers want to have credibility in their concept of horror. Unfortunately, their pretensions do not match their capacity.
