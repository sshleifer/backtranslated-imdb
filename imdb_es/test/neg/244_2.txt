Following the pleasantly atmospheric original and the funny and silly second, this sequel incredibly bland, slow and uneventful is presented as a big disappointment. Once again, the infamous and criminal brain The Bat (hammy Luis Aceves Castaneda) is trying to steal valuable jewelry from the Aztec mummy Popoca. The bat builds a hilarious and awkward robot with a human brain to achieve this atrocious goal. Directed in a flat way by Rafael Portillo, with a script with style and tedious of Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calder√≥n, a raw continuity (for example, the bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film, but it is miraculously alive and well here! ), An unbearable slow writing, an excessive amount of footage from the first two films, a meandering narrative, a lack of action and a paralyzing impulse, largely depressing by the movements (not) of an understandably disinterested cast, and a badly organized climate battle between The Mummy and the Robot (the movie finally explodes into a stupid life with that big punch, but unfortunately it only lasts two lousy minutes and, therefore, it turns out to be too little too late to relieve the severity of the boredom overwhelming general), this numbing, dry and rough drag rates snorefest as a complete wash.
