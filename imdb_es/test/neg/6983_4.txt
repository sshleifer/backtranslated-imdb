Yes, I know that his character was supposed to be a drunk, and maybe he was just acting silly. But something tells this critic that Mr. Pleasence was actually drinking a lot and was intoxicated during his scenes in the movie. Basically, everything he says is confusing and often unintelligible. Or maybe it was just the poor production values ​​... it's hard to say. <br /> <br /> Anyway, The Race for the Yankee Zephyr is a movie that just does not work. That is also a shame, since the movie has an incredible opening and a generally interesting plot. Ultimately, the production values ​​are too low and the action is too low for this New Zealand adventure to deliver the goods. The story is about a US warplane that is full of gold, money and medals, which crashed into a lake in New Zealand during World War II. The plane stays lost for about forty years or so until somehow it is washed on the ground and a drunkard (Pleasence) literally trips over it. At first, he collects all the purple heart medals and tries to sell them in the city, he actually gets $ 75 each for them! Little does he know that once he sells them, the local jeweler gets on the phone and starts looking for information about the plane. Before you can blink, all the attention draws a rich wretch (Peppard) and his henchmen into the city and they quickly try to force the old man to leave the plane's location, since they know there is much more than just medals. . The old business associate of the drunks (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) then rush to try to claim the fortune before the bad guys can get to it. The resulting action is simply not as fun as you expected. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty horrible, except for Pleasence. George Peppard tries to do some sort of (I guess) Australian accent, but it's not convincing. Lesley Ann Warren is not that bad, but Ken Wahl is really bad. He's basically making his best impression of Michael Pare on his worst day. And that is saying something. Let's hope he has earned enough money in this film to fix his front teeth that looked a little crooked. I do not remember if he had straightened them out when he was in Wiseguy. The rest of the cast is quite talentless. Probably mostly locals who never did much more. I guess the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for much of the movie and the lack of danger. The villains are too good and ridiculous to be taken seriously. And, honestly, there are NO helicopters in the movie that look like the ones on the DVD cover. And none of the boats in the movie have painted teeth, either. <br /> <br /> However, the film has its strengths. The beginning, which begins as a newscast and then becomes part of the story, was a nice touch. Brian May's score sounds too similar to that of Mad Max 2, but it included a nice little gait that they play for Pleasence in some scenes. It sounds just like the one in the Great Escape! There are some exploits of helicopter and a great chase in boat that apparently killed three specialists during the filming. The landscape, despite the grainy aspect of the image, is still quite beautiful. However, what you will remember most are the drunken antics of Donald Pleasence. It was almost enough to save this movie. Almost. 4 out of 10 stars <br /> <br /> The Dog.
