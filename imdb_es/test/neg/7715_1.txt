I used to work in a video store. I saw this title in the horror section and I took it home as a free rental one night. <br /> <br /> This movie was really horrible, there is no redeeming quality about it, because you really need a very respected subgenre. Film and it's just about destroying it. If the first film was not economical enough, then this film really takes the cake, it stays (mostly) inside and at night ... thus avoiding the scenic adjustment of the first film In the first 5 minutes of This movie, a comic book college runs on an attractive student. Instead of mortifying himself, the professor apologizes and the girl mentions that, despite being thrown by the hood of the cars (he accelerated when approaching her), there is nothing to worry about ... which attacks her with a lever and kills her! If this is not strange enough, he wants to perform an experiment with her, bring her back from death ... and so she feels the need to take off her clothes to do it. <br /> <br /> Soft Core Female nudity (and pubic hair) is rampant throughout the film and, to be honest, it's the only real thing to keep the average male audience interested ... like the swimming scene in the first movie ... but even having said that this movie goes from bad to worse with its acting of bad character, shitty dialogues and absurd plot twists ... why introduce a character Fundamental that has survived 29 days after a zombie attack to kill them in 10 minutes? very bad movie
