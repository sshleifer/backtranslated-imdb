Ughh this movie is horrible The script is stupid and, of course, Chase does not tell Zoey that he does not love her. Like all the episodes ... I will never understand Zoey 101 (the program) Also, why the hell does Logan's father TAN act again? And it's just about Zoey and chasing what happens with the other characters. It is always the same in each episode that Quinn makes and invents that something goes terribly wrong with the invention and Zoey's brother always gets involved in it. If you have not seen it, do not waste an hour watching this because you will be wasting your time! SMaybe this may be interesting for an 8-10 year old well, but I can imagine that someone older is watching this movie repeated. But what can you expect from Nick?
