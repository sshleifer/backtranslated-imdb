Let me start with this in the record, I'm a big fan of George Clooney and I love John Krasinski in 'The Office'. Well, it was and I did it. <br /> <br /> This was the worst nail in the world and it took 113 minutes to start it. The amazing boredom was interrupted only by my frequent efforts to read my watch and estimate when it would end. <br /> <br /> Each funny scene was in the previews. The three. There was no real story, no development of the character, and the script was just bad. I had a colonoscopy that was more pleasant. <br /> <br /> The title should have been SuperDuper Bad. This movie is a padlock for a Razzie. I should get a lot of Razzies. I want my money back.
