I'm not kidding: there's a scene in this movie where a tramp hits his head on a cornerstone of the tunnel and explodes (no fireball, though) in a million pieces! He made a child in front of me scream in terror! ... In a movie with G rating! <br /> <br /> This movie could serve to convince children that Santa Clause is BAD! His assistants are ugly, misanthropic, exaggerated and bad. When Santa appears (here is an anagram of Satan!), All the 200,000 elves begin to sing "Santa is coming to the city" as if it were a druidic war song. Then, in the reflection of the object "Rosebud" of this film (a bell that whispers indications of why you can not hear it sound: "doubt ... doubt ...)), appears the old Saint Nick, who looks like a stoic Donald Sutherland, with a bright face like that of Moses in "K10C." When we hear him speak, his thundering voice sounds less like a very old elf, and more like the voice of James Earl Jones slowed down by 20%. ! br /> <br /> The syrupy music is out of place, it is boring and repetitive.It does not follow any emotional thread (as in the very effective "Titanic" score). It seems that it is thrown at certain points in order to generate sensations of warmth and magic, can not be shaken, partly because it does not match the images of the film.There are some musical trains (without pun) where, out of nowhere, the mysterious and symphonic score of happy beat in POLKA with voice on the locomotive of the title, it simply makes all the Lula sounds as if it had gone into production! <br /> <br /> Finally, Ree with some other critics about how, well ... "dead" everyone looks. Sometimes it seems a bit macabre. The motion capture technique is good for allowing sequences of roller coaster trains, such as Kings Island, to look convincing from a distance, but up close, "real" actors should have been used. In general, a good attraction to kill time in front of the television, but not much more here.
