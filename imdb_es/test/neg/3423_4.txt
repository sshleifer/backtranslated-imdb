Macbeth is one of the stories most often told in the cinema and has been translated many times into numerous stages of theater and celluloid. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s, Macbeth tells the story of the betrayal between royalty and a man's quest for power. Director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) tries to update Macbeth by placing him in the contemporary underworld of Melbourne. Macbeth (Sam Worthington), Macbeth (Sam Worthington), a film in which characters replace swords with pistols (Romeo and Juliet by Baz Luhrman) and royal vassals by gangsters, is a harsh, violent but critically flawed film. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (Sam Worthington) works for King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After being elevated to Thane of Glamis by The King (as it was prophesied to Macbeth by three witches), Macbeth begins to put his eyes on the throne. One night, the King comes to stay at Macbeth's house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) convinces him to kill the King to take over. Macbeth kills his teacher and then assumes his crown. But success has its downside, as Macbeth will soon discover, when he has to do everything possible to protect his murderous secret. <br /> <br /> Well, first things first. The main flaw of the film is Sam Worthington. His interpretation of Macbeth is in one word ... boring. Honestly, I did not care about Macbeth while watching the movie. She felt more sympathy for Lady Macbeth from Victoria Hill because she at least bothered to act. Worthington sits somber and with a wooden face throughout the film. I felt he was making his best impression of Johnny Deep's character George Jung of Blow ... but without the charisma. I've never seen Worthington in a movie, so I'm not sure it was his or the Director's fault, but in any case, the glue that should have bound everything in a cohesive unit is weak. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good, but when combined with the Australian Gangster motif Geoffrey Wright seems a little out of place. Frenzied rhythm action sequences mixed with long Shaksperian reflections create a conflict of rhythm within the film. I understand that this is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialogue intact. But hard and fast action scenes after a three-minute soliloquy tend to be annoying, if not a little pretentious. <br /> <br /> The camera work is very stylized and, for the most part, it works well. One thing that I found annoying was how the camera moved slowly from side to side, almost constantly. I do not care about the shots in that way, it's just exaggerated. It goes beyond the scope of being cool and elegant and, on the other hand, it becomes irritating. Apart from that, the art direction and the cinematography are pretty well done. <br /> <br /> For all the good qualities that Macbeth has; An elegant address, a Shakespearian dialogue, a strong soundtrack, naked supernatural witches (the strange sisters) and good assistants of brutal and bloody violence. All these strengths are forgotten when one considers the uninspired portrait of Sam Worthington of Macbeth. The role of Macbeth was essential to unite everything and, in this respect, Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed miserably, which made Macbeth an unforgettable foray into Shakespeare.
