I had seen this movie as a child (Before World War II) and I was surprised that the local library had a copy. I saw it again after about sixty years and I forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not an "A" movie. No editing, bad script, weak acting and not much direction. It should not even be as tall as a "B". I laughed at how tired I've become over the years. I think I thought it was good when I saw it originally.
