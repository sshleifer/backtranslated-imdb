This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was a complete waste of money. If I had not been to the movies it was my two young cousins ​​(who also thought it was disappointing, but not as terrible as I thought), would have left the cinema. There were two points in the movie that I almost laughed at, but the rest was boring, ridiculous or painful. I thought it would be a parody in all the superhero movies (which I love), but actually it was mainly based on Spiderman, with some indirect references to other superhero movies like Fantastic Four and Batman. I really can not think of anything good to say about this movie. Do not waste your money with this movie, there are many other better movies out there!
