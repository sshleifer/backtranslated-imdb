Although I'm usually a big fan of John Turturro's work as an actor and director, ILLUMINATA is a big disappointment. Although the movie has some lovely moments, it generally falls flat. Worst of all, the movie is confusing. Where is the movie? Italy or an Italian company in New York? Why bother making a historical film if it does not convey a scenario? If you want to see a well-inspired and well-made historical film about theater, go see the work of Tim Robbins THE CRADLE WILL ROCK This movie has many advantages, including an excellent performance by John Turturro.
