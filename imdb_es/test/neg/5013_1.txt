This movie was on the pay channels today and I had nothing to do, so I had it on. This has to be the worst football movie ever made. This has to be one of the worst movies of the period. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system, and they gave it 2 stars out of 4. This movie is not even a half star. Bad acting, Scott Bakula sinks as always, Larry Miller. Sinbad, I could not act if I tried. Rob Schneider's liners stank completely. Fred Thompson should feel ashamed of being in this movie. The only saving grace for this movie was the hope of seeing Kathy Ireland naked in the shower, not even close. A complete waste of time and film. If we could give a negative number, minus 9.
