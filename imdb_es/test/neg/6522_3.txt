This script was slightly original when it was written in 1935, but the poor performance and the inconsistent quality level make it impossible to recommend it. Some of the vignettes are absolutely terrible and dialogue is never natural. Some of the plot twists were creative, but I was very surprised to see him so highly qualified here at the IMDB. Some scenes are worth it, it's like a movie that, if it fails to entertain completely. If you like this kind of montage, run, do not walk and get "Tales of Manhattan" (1942), a wonderful movie that follows the life and times of a coat.
