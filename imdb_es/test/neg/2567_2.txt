Dr. Steven Segal saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak. This movie seems to me a stupid seriousness that has become a classic of the unwanted camp (the best kind). Memorable lines include "Knowledge is like a deer, pursue it and it will escape" and "Drink this, it will make you feel better." It is so sublime that they could not have made it worse if they tried. <br /> <br /> Segal tries to convince you that he is 1. sensitive: saving a wounded pony; 2. a good father - for a saccharine cooking scene for his daughter; 3. a man of science - looking at a false spectrum; 4. in tune with nature - using homeopathic remedies; 5. politically correct and multicultural, having Indian friends; 6. an iconoclast: when opening a rural practice after a previous life in a national research laboratory; and 7. an action hero: being really fat but still able to fight. ROTFL. <br /> <br /> It's good to see it as a Saturday night movie, with friends, preferably (but not necessarily) drunk.
