The American Will (Greg Evigan), Maura (Alexandra Paul) and his little daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, the daughter of Greg's life) strange things happen when they move to a large house and recently inherited in Ireland. In the basement there are crisp corpses, a turkey sprinkling blood, furniture movements and the ghosts of a dead child and a cackling old woman appear to scare the girl. The paranormal investigators are finally called to banish the evil spirits, but Maura is possessed anyway and pursues everyone around her with a blade of flesh. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of clich√©s, but there is an outstanding performance by Alexandra Paul. .. Too bad it does not belong to this movie (or any other that comes to mind)! She can barely keep a straight face and her exaggerated and hysterical tantrums are a joy to behold. In any case, she is much more interesting to see than anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 of 10
