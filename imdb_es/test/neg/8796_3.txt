A single mother, her son and daughter and her hippie friend camp out in the woods. Appears a maniac with dummy and mannequin with a yellow ski mask. He begins to terrorize and sexually rape the family before murdering them with a machete. "Wilderness" is loaded with hard and ugly sex, forced incest and flagrant racism. It is as bad politically as the thugs XXX. The score is stolen from Hitchcock's horror classic "Psycho" and also "Jaws". It's bad and there are some huge mistakes in logic. The repetitive nature of the sex scenes causes the movie to move, while the brief execution time is a blessing. The scenes of violence are quite unpleasant, for example, the hippie girl is stabbed with the machete her groin and one can see blood in her crotch.3 out of 10 and that is to be generous.
