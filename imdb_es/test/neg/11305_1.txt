I know it's quite unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the whole piece, but I'm going to do it anyway! I waited to laugh, I tried to give him time. I think 20 minutes is enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh. My laugh never came, so I gave up. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid mood, not so stupid that you have to laugh. It is nowhere near that high degree. Let me correct that, it's just * stupid * - it's not stupid humor. You may have thought that certain scenes were fun, but they were not. I suppose, if you were really bored, you could mix the movie with a hallucination and end up with a slightly entertaining experience. <br /> <br /> A very pathetic effort.
