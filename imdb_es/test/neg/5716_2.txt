You know that this movie is in serious trouble when the BEST acting work is the supporting role played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. While this was relatively early in his career and he was not the best actor, compared to Brigitte Nielsen, he is Sir John Gielgud. In fact, this movie shows that the only reason she received a lot of attention was her tits and because she was involved with the incredibly self-destructive soccer player, Mark Gastineau. So, instead of this being her "premiere movie," this and a Beverly Hills Cop brand are as high as her one-note career. It was also obvious that the finance wizards gave up on this movie as well, because the supporting cast (apart from Arnold) is quite scarce and the script is boring, boring, boring. Fans who are looking for another CONAN movie would no doubt be very disappointed with this slow and uncomplicated movie.
