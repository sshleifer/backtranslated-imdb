Title: Dracula AD 1972 <br /> <br /> Director: Alan Gibson <br /> <br /> Cast: Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Stephanie Beacham <br /> <br /> Review: Sometimes movies can Be the moment Capsules that transport you back to a given moment. In this case ... our time capsule is Hammers Dracula AD 1972, which transports us to a time when Austin Powers would have felt at home. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of kids (it's not a gang! They were a group!) that love to hang out in a coffee shop called "The Cavern". One day, Johnny Alucard (hmm strange last name ... wait ... tells Dracula upside down!) A new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks. It offers you a night of black mass and black magic. To which they also say "sure why the hell not, it could be fun!". So in a short time, they are resurrecting Count Dracula from the ashes. <br /> <br /> This movie opens with a swinging party in the house of some rich slum dwellers. He does not know about the people at his party, but there everyone is partying all night at his house. Doing drugs, kissing me on the tables. The filmmakers ensured that this sequence was completely wrapped up in whatever the young people considered cool at that time. Everyone says words like "exit" and "groovy" and end many of their sentences saying "all that jazz". So yes, it's pretty obvious that this is the 70's. To top it off, there's a band that sounds like "Jefferson Airplane" ... I mean you'll drown in all things from the 70s. And while I was observing this, I was asking myself "how the hell is Dracula in his black cape and I'm going to put on all this?" And that is exactly what happens. Old Dracula feels out of place in the middle of the whole party, rock and roll and drugs. Many of the scenes in the film are great ... but, unfortunately, the music they decided to add to the process does not fit at all and takes you out of the mood of things. Something horrible or frightening will happen on the screen and, suddenly, a lot of loud trumpets and congos will start to sound and they will finish coming out of the element of terror. That took the atmosphere out of this movie. <br /> <br /> But in general, leaving aside all the music of the 70 that distracts to the side (a disease that also suffered the satanic rites of Dracula), the film was quite good. But I will mention this. The story was just a repetition of what we had seen before in Taste the Blood of Dracula. In fact, the story is almost identical. Let's see ... a young child inherits the Draculas ring and the ashes ... check. Then he decides to return Dracula to life with the help of some people who know nothing of what they are doing ... verify. Black Mass to bring Dracula back to a desecrated church ... check. The list of similarities goes on and on. So this movie is not very original if you ask me. <br /> <br /> There are some things that make this movie worthwhile. For example, the fact that the film is a time capsule for London in the early seventies makes the film entertaining. I kept laughing and laughing every time someone spoke in the jargon 70. I could not believe the clothes these people were wearing and the cars they were driving! For me, the movie was fun, but we're here to scare us, we were here to see Drac kill a few virgins and take revenge on Van Helsing's House. Did we get any of that? Okay, yes. There are some good sequences compressed there to satisfy fans of old hammers. In the first place, there is the sequence of the Black Mass that was above all Satanic! They mention the names of many demons and they shed a lot of blood. That sequence was incredible, but music ruined it at its most crucial moment. Then there is the true resurrection of Draculas, which I admit was great from a visual point of view. A little mist comes out of Draculas' grave and, slowly but surely, the silhouette and face of Christopher Lees emerge from the fog. Good shot! I loved! We have a Cushing and Lee face at the end. And I could not help but laugh at a moment when Dracula throws a piece of furniture through the air. I laugh because he has done it in every movie since Horror of Dracula. It is the tradition of this hammer where the characters begin to throw themselves candlesticks and chairs. And I think, for me, it's not your most exciting things to show that a villain throwing a candle to our hero. Oh well, anything, the disappearance of Draculas in this one is very similar to all the other previous Hammer Draculas, the vampire goes off and then we cut a series of frames until only ashes remain. <br /> <br /> All in All, an unintentionally funny Hammer Dracula movie. It's stuck in the 70's and, although that makes it a fun watch (and it's not as horrible as Dracula's Satanic Rites) it still does not match up with the Dracula universe we expected from Hammer. <br /> <br /> Ranking 3 1/2 out of 5
