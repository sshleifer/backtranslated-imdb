. . . and that's only if you like the sight of a beautiful woman with beautiful and full jars that go through the so-called African jungle. So there are no problems for most men. <br /> <br /> I saw it as one of those bundled packages. Forget about the plot that is essentially a flimsy story for our heroine to show her jugs on the screen at every possible opportunity. Just to give you an idea, our heroine changes from vine to vine and climbs the best animals at every possible opportunity without any reason for you to see her jars from all angles. Again, I have no complaints. <br /> <br /> The "fight scenes" are ridiculous and are at the limit of pornography. Our heroine was caught by the bad guys at least five times in the movie. On the occasions when she has to fight, the "fight" involves rolling on the ground, growling unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. I'm surprised he has not pulled. It gets so bad that the evil boss had to remind the "fighters" that "I said, the one who draws blood first wins!" to avoid seeing more stupid combats. <br /> <br /> The witch doctor Kuku was a bloody explosion. From being a big and tender bear at first, he became manic-depressive when he was captured and then, completely psychopathic. He spent the whole movie muttering lines without being irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Next to Liana (our heroine) jumping topless, you can also see many other amazonians, as well as a woman who decided to jump naked to the lake to swim without good reasons. Yes, it's that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Look at the beautiful Liane in her bloated glory. Even though the film is more than 20 years old, the charm of seeing blond women showing their beautiful jars on the screen never ages.
