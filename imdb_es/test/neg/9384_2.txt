Talk about creepy. If you really want to sit and watch this episode where the girl who was in Firefly is later kidnapped, there's entertainment for you, but only if you like this kind of thing. Not what I thought, to be frank, this episode was frightening. Fortunately, it's one of the few duff episodes in season 3, and the only episode of Charles Grant Craig, so you do not get much of this kind of stuff in season 3. So, general verdict? Just read the summary at the top. This is a strong contender (Hell Money says hello!) For the worst episode of season 3. However, to be honest, I really did not expect much. I wish I could Oubliette this episode together. That's something they got right: the title.
