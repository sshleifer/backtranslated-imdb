Obviously, someone was trying to catch the wave of the "Blair Witch". <br /> <br /> This film was created like all the "reality" shows that appeared on television lately (and I must admit, I took advantage of this), but this movie is MUCH more cheesier! Probably, the first three quarters of the movie are full of "participants" that pass through the house, WHINING. Give me a break! Spending 10 minutes whimpering to climb the attic is not my idea of ​​a good time. Any paranormal event are shameless configurations. Without chains, but too perfectly captured by the camera to be real. The "participants" were not very nice either. Two silly guys who do not take it seriously, a girl who gets scared with the fall of a hat and the "paranormal" overexploited person par excellence. Is this becoming the "formula" cliché for a ghost movie? <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the last 15 minutes were pure tension. They took every ounce of tension in the movie and stuck it in those 15 minutes. I admit, I spent that time walking in the kitchen. I would not really recommend this film to younger viewers, even if it is PG13. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for entertainment, if you do not take it seriously, you will get an opportunity. of this movie There are lots of situations to make cracks! If you are looking for a great story ... look elsewhere;)
