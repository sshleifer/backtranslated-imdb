A boring walk through the banalities of Mormon making a demonstration. Absolutely not funny. A testimony of the generalized theory that for bath humor to be fun, it must necessarily be vulgar; It also reinforces the claim that a close relationship with Jesus does not make you funny. More propaganda than movie, do not worry about any social problems that arise on the table after this. The saving grace of this film is its accurate portrayal of young Mormon girls as particularly attractive. Oh well, it's your $ 7.50.
