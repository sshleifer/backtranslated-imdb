Well, maybe the performance was not bad, but I'm writing this review as a public service to prevent anyone else who happens in the intriguing beginning of this telefilm from discarding two hours of his life waiting for a development of the plot they never see. The principal investigator has a hunch that he has eliminated the missing marine officer (Guy), and few people other than uninvolved passers-by and the defendant seem to dispute it. So what is the point of staying with this drama? Beat the devils of me. I kept thinking (or hoping) that there was some kind of plot twist or new revelation, but none occurred. In short, I can not think of a single reason to sit down and watch this television movie without meaning, based or not on a real story.
