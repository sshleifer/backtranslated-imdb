I made sure to watch this movie because it's a science fiction movie from the 1950s, one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, as I waited anxiously for the aliens with insect eyes or the mad conquerors for power, the aliens in this movie were a big disappointment! First of all, you only see one very briefly at the beginning (and he looked quite normal) and also you could only see a small spaceship! In the second place, the alien was neither the evil conqueror nor the benevolent friend of humanity, but a real strange ball. And finally, the plot itself seemed so silly, preached and heavy that it caused more yawns than emotions. <br /> <br /> When the film starts, five people from five different parts of the world (Germany, Great Britain, Russia, China and the United States) are kidnapped by a foreigner. The foreigner gives each of them devices through which they CAN destroy all life on the planet if they wish, because the foreigner admits that their race of people would love to inhabit the Earth, but they will not kill themselves to obtain it. Then, he returns them all. While it is 100% obvious that nobody WANTS to use these devices, the alien announces on television the identities of the five without saying that the weapons are so powerful. So, all the militarists in the world want to find the five and force them to reveal how the weapons work. Much of the rest of the film consists of some of the five that are hidden and one that is tortured to reveal how the device works, since the Soviets want to use it. This part of the movie seemed pretty silly. Surely the USSR was an evil and corrupt nation (sorry, but it is a fact, especially under Stalin), they would never have thought of using it as they did in the movie! Later, one of the five (the German scientist) somehow realizes that the devices can also be used to kill all the EVIL people who hate freedom. Then, he uses it to kill all the evil ones and probably others who were anti-freedom and the world becomes a paradise. Preacher, foolish and full of plots: this film is not worth it, although it is an interesting relic simply because of the way it deals with communism, in particular, the tensions between NATO and the Soviets.
