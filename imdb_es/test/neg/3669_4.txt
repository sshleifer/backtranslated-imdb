"Undercurrent" has a cast of wonderful actors who could have come together for the perfect comedy in the room. Unfortunately, they are practically wasted in a 'woman's vision' marijuana, and a very thin one in that. Katharine Hepburn is really radiant like a tomboy / old lady who finally gets married, but her husband is deeply disturbed and harboring dark family secrets. Director Vincente Minnelli has no idea how to assemble this extravagant plot, invented by Edward Chodorov from a story by Thelma Strabel, and the first-class cast (including Robert Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Edmund Gwenn) is stepping on in murky waters. ** since ****
