I could not believe what I saw ... (once) brilliant actors appearing in this terrible effort that should never have been done. The plots are terrible and the dialogue is appeasing (at first I thought it was a parody), and the acting was abysmal. Everything is bad, from cheap sets to fake backgrounds, lots of enlarged paintings. The respectable filmmakers fight to make their vision come true, but this blasphemous and pathetic attempt of a miniseries comes to our television, with 3 winners of the Oscar awards that appear. I can only assume that everyone involved in some way hurt the writer and the director and were forced (perhaps at gunpoint) to star in this useless television garbage.
