In general I would call this a disappointing performance. Try the old approach of "Anthology of horror", but it fails miserably. The acting was bad, and so were the stories. Any aspect shown in the film was obviously random, just to attract the R-rating for sex. Typical, I suppose, but badly nonetheless. Take your $ 5 and rent a REAL movie instead!
