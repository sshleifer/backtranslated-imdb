Terrible. Absolutely terrible. Long, confusing and not very rewarding. After about three hours of this painful disorder, the end is the last nail in the coffin. Not even the magnificent, sexy and beautiful goddess Francesca Annis can save this poor adaptation of the work of Agatha Christie. The plot drag and drag and the time passes slowly and suddenly you realize that you have no idea what is happening. In the end, even with the usual explanation of the villain, there is still much to explain and then ... it's over. A complete waste of time and undoubtedly one of the worst adaptations to bear the name of Agatha Christie.
