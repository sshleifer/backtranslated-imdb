First, when does this story take place? It has to happen after the first movie because Kuzco knows that Pacha and Chicha have their third child, but it can not happen after the second movie because Kronk does not have a girlfriend or wife or something like that. You never see her in the program. <br /> <br /> Also, why does Kuzco go to school? The whole plot of the show is that Kuzco goes to school so he can be emperor. But was not the emperor before this? And who is the emperor while he learns to be emperor? Should not it be Yzma? Or was Yzma fired on this timeline already? And if that's true, why are you waiting for her not to become an Empress? Also, you know that in the first movie he said that he was trained from birth to be an emperor by private tutors. Then you should know what you are doing. <br /> <br /> Kronk. Why is Kronk a student? He is around 25 years old, they said in the first movie. He is an adult who goes to high school. Does everyone think he's a jerk? I really like Kronk, but I think that because of his age and because everyone knows he is working for Yzma, he should have been a teacher. Being a Home Ec teacher would be best for him. <br /> <br /> Malina, it's very unpleasant. She supposes to be the love interest / moral compass of Kuzco. But for a long time, she is bossy and knows everything. She commonly says that I like "I should be proud because I'm pretty and smart". <br /> <br /> She has ESP when it comes to Kuzco and she knows when she's in trouble, when she cheats, or even when she sings the Hot Hot Hottie song in her head, although she applauds him, the school newspaper and keeps straight A + in all its classes. <br /> <br /> She seems more interested in using her beauty so that Kuzco does the right thing and does well in school and then go out with him. In fact, it seems more motherly to Kuzco than a love interest. <br /> <br /> Yzma. When I bought before Yzma tried to make Kuzco fail, she became Empress. I'm not sure how it's supposed to work with being fired and everything. Yzma seems to be reliving the first movie in each episode. In almost every show where she appears, she turns Kuzco into an animal with the hope that he will pass him a class. (There are only 3 times where I can think that did not happen). The jokes that Yzma is old are not as smart in the show as they were in the movie. And the classic jokes about Yzma are used to dying in the show (like "Pull the level, Krunk!", The roller coaster and the lab). <br /> <br /> Also, some other points that do not make sense in this series. The fact that every time something is assigned to Kuzco, everyone acts in this way will make it happen or not to the class, but it seems that every task that is given happens. So, why is an assignment so important? <br /> <br /> Seriously, who is ruling the kingdom while this is happening? Do they have a consul or a steward? You never see anyone ruling the kingdom unless Kuzco has regained his powers or that Yzma is an empress. <br /> <br /> Why does Kuzco go to a normal peasant school? Should not I learn how to run a country, what to do in case of war or something that will be useful in the future? I could see taking normal farming classes (so he would know how to prepare the country for a famine or something), but knotting? What help? <br /> <br /> Now I know someone is going to say "But it's not supposed to make sense, it's supposed to be funny". Then they should have more funny things there. All the fun things about the show have already been done in the movie. Also, if you notice some of these huge holes in the plot, why do not you make fun of them like in the movie? (For example, when Yzma and Kronk arrive at the secret laboratory before Kuzco, Pacha, Yzma and Kronk can not explain how they got their first job). <br /> <br /> There are some good points, it's good. See some of the characters from the first movie in the series like Bucky and Monkey with the error. Pacha and her family are still very good characters with a good feeling of the land. I feel that this series would be fun for younger children. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the series is not as good as the film on which it is based, but it can be good for younger children.
