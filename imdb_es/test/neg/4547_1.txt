When I decided to try to watch a movie about cryogenic zombies ("cronoides"), I did not expect much. That is exactly what I have, and then even less. Apart from the lack of special effects (squibs?) And a great lack of talent as an actor, "The Chilling" also presents the worst absolute script I've seen in a movie. I had to stop the tape several times during the first 45 minutes to repair the damage done to my intellect by witnessing a dialogue as atrocious as the one that is here. <br /> <br /> In addition, the collection of characters is so Formula and one-dimensional is ridiculous: the corrupt doctor; her assistant, played by Linda Blair (we know that she is his "assistant" because he repeatedly refers to her with that title); the recently widowed businessman with a golden heart who develops a romantic interest with the character of Blair; his son with the alcoholic, abusive and unemployed boyfriend of Blair's character, who is presented with the most ingenious use of a flashback; and, of course, the rough, strong and bearded security guard who becomes the hero. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the preservative fluid that some cryogenic laboratories use in their bodies is highly conductive, which naturally results in a disaster when all the laboratory containers end up in the open air in a remarkable sequence of events during a electric storm (on Halloween night, nothing less). As for the zombies, if you like to see people wearing green latex masks walking around in aluminum foil suits, then "The Chilling" is the movie for you. The zombie action is very weak in its maximum expression; The primary killing method of the zombies seems to be to grab people by the shoulders and shake them to death. The businessman and security guard do most of the zombie fighting, including a very exciting scene of refreezing the undead with liquid nitrogen. Let me tell you that the scene of the steel factory in "T2" has nothing in "The Chilling" when portraying a frozen enemy in its tracks in that way. <br /> <br /> How Linda Blair ended up trapped in the middle of this piece of dreck is indeed a mystery. It is true that her career did not shoot exactly during the 80s (unfortunately), but this movie is a shame to her. The script does not even have the decency to put it to good use. The most they give their character is to shout things like "Here they come", "Do something", "Hurry!". The only thing I can imagine is that poor Linda was compensated for her work in this film with food rations. The hero is played by Grizzly Adams himself, Dan Haggerty. In this image, he faces stiff acting competition from his beard and the security dog, and does everything he can to overcome them both. <br /> <br /> The only terrifying part of "The Chilling" is the introduction that appears. The factual elements of cryogenics and suggests that "the film you are about to see could happen in your own community." While counting the number of times that some of the names are repeated in the closing credits, I was surprised to see suddenly that Lucasfilm was credited. Fortunately, it was only for the sound production of the movie. 1/10.
