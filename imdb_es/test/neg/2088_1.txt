This movie is bad, yes, but if the producers had used a REAL KANGAROO, it would have killed the actor with whom he was boxing. I'm Australian and I've seen two men seven feet tall 'Roos fighting each other, it's not a pretty sight, since the object is for one or the other to kill his opponent (this is the way to secure the herd of females) and there are incidents in which someone has boxed in a kangaroo and has been injured or killed, so when you see a kangaroo on television or in the movie, it is likely to be a woman or an animation, as it is a good idea not to hurt the actors (they could be upset about losing the ability to breathe). There is a strange idea that Australian animals are cute and adorable, that is false, many are dangerous (10 of the 12 most deadly snakes live here) and most are simply ugly (koalas are as soft as stealing wool). So if you come to Australia, BE CAREFUL!
