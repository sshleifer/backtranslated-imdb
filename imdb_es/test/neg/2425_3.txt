First of all, let me say that I live in South Africa, where rugby is our most important sport, and our national team, the Springboks, have won the Rugby World Cup twice, which is a big problem here. I've played my whole life and I'm surprised by the little attention to detail in this movie! At first, I thought it had the potential to be a great movie considering the cast of Neal McDonough, Nick Ferris, Gary Cole and Sean Astin for the love of God, but it turned out to be a mockery of the sport. Basically, they combined it with their normal American football movie every day. <br /> <br /> My first problem is that this movie supposedly captures the values ​​of rugby, but the discipline or I must say that the total lack during games is contradictory to this. In the end, it looks more like a game of the NFL in which Penning was approached from the ball several times, in front of the referee ... that would have immediately led to a pair of red cards, because foul play like that would never go unpunished In by a referee, that's what you I can assure! Nor could you find a coach in world rugby who had so little control over his team. Any coach would take a dump in the head of a player if he intentionally hardens an opposing player or doubles it as he did in the final ... red card and some suspension, full stop. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is absurd for a coach to take a new player, who has played as the wing of his life, move him to the whore, which is a highly specialized position and says it is for the good of the TEAM. What?! Hooker is a highly specialized position in the first row where you have to be able to scrum extremely well and, preferably, be able to throw the ball at the start time, which Penning NEVER does for some reason or another. Going from one wing to the whore without extensive long-term training, it would first lead to the death of your team at the time of the scrum and, secondly, the poor boy would probably break his neck! How is that good for the team that asked you? Finally, the overall high emotional tone of the film is too much, because although rugby is a great sport, and creates great friendships and team spirit, it rarely gets hand in hand. I have seen real life soccer dramas with less emotion than this movie and it was great, but in this the ability of Sean (Penning) is dragged too far and the film tries to force an emotional response out of the audience. that sometimes is boring and hard to see. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has made some great sports films over the years, but the next time you venture into a sport you just acquired in the United States, you should try to do your homework and maybe do that some experts get involved in the fight. <br /> <br /> DO THE RIGHT OR DO NOT DO IT AT ALL!
