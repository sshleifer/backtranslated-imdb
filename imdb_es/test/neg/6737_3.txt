I hope this was done before Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds because it was silly, Seagal was not to blame for it being trash when the few action scenes took place. The plot was also confusing and, basically, only felt rushed, perhaps it was filed and launched to capitalize the most recent Seagals films. bring Under Siege 3 and lose some weight!
