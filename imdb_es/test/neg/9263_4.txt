This movie is a great boredom. It has a lot of predictable plots and infinite feelings from the start. It starts well with a class number, but it seems lost halfway. <br /> <br /> The on-screen chemistry of Surya and Jyothika works very well and a good part of Bhoomika. Why include Vadivelu in it? It disappears completely after a good half hour! Santhanam returns to prove his wit by synchronizing the comedy. <br /> <br /> The songs of AR will surely last some time. But I could have done better. Whatever the inconvenience, it is worth seeing once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good time pass.
