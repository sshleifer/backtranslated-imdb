Yes, the video cover of this movie made me want to see this movie as a child. It was called "Screamers" on this particular cover with the slogan "Men turned inside out!". I even had this deformed looking skeleton on the cover, so it made all sorts of cold bloody images go through my mind. Maybe some kind of movie about some strange virus that caused a person's flesh to burn, maybe a movie about undead zombies that look more bloody than what you normally get, a scientific experiment that went incredibly wrong and now there are strange men with their skin dripping. Their bones go to the racket. Yes, all these thoughts went through my mind, and one that did not was to catch the guys on some island practically bloodless and bored. This movie is really more like the Island of Dr. Moreau than anything else and, frankly, that movie also bored me, it's too scientific and it's not enough to kill for my taste. These movies are a lot to understand and there is not enough blood for my taste. Yes, I know, I have strange tastes, but I can not help it, I like my horror films really bloody or fast and exciting and this movie really is not either.
