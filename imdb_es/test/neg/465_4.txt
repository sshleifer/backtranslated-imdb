I must say that it did not impress me at all, probably because I expected much more from this movie. Maybe an accent on religion vs. science or on the meaning of life, not just a few lines. So, if you expect something to think about after watching this movie, do not do it. It is more psychological than philosophical. Vote 4 for the final, it is clarified a little and because I have a great respect for the documentaries of the BBC. There are a couple of very interesting scenes that actually made some sense. It was a brilliant idea to add it in a film related to the theory of evolution, which was not the main theme. Oh, I just forgot to say that for more than 1 hour, the movie is pretty boring and, in a way, cruel.
