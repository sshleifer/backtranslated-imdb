This movie was absolute trash. The director and the stars (?) Should be expelled from making films forever. The plot of the paper refers to a sordid director played by the sleazy director (now that he is acting) advertising on the Internet for women to star in a snuff film. <br /> <br /> There is no horror at all, the girls are strung and boring, the direction is meaningless, the music is out of place (the heavy metal at the scene of a library?), and the lighting is horrible. The director should have charged a couple of shopping carts filled with aluminum cans and obtained a script, sober actors and some light bulbs. As it is, this is an unpleasant, unpleasant and messy mess of a movie.
