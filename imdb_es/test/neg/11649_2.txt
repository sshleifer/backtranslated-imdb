This film worked together with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. The writer obviously bought the playbook "How to write a movie about space disaster" and followed it game by game. In particular, the typical stereo use of astronauts who talk to their loved ones from outer space, like a brave show in the face of disaster, has been done over and over again. <br /> <br /> Max Q seems to have been written with the hope that the producers will throw $ 50 million into the project. But, judging by the second half of the film that contained numerous special effects attempts, the producers could only raise $ 50,000. To know that the movie was nominated for a "Special Visual Effects", Emmy has me absolutely stupefied. <br /> <br /> I think a handful of high school students with a pass in Media Studies could have created more credible effects! <br /> <br /> And the holes in the plot are too numerous to mention. But I will choose one as an example. Now, I'm not a NASA expert, but it's probably highly unlikely that a worker connected to the shuttle simulator will suddenly take a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. Surely there is someone with more experience in Mission Control whom the Program Director would call instead of a twenty-nine-year-old who has not been in the control room before. <br /> <br /> The only one who saved this movie is Bill Campbell's work. He manages to make a good attempt to save something from the train crash that is this script. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 out of 10, with the work above Bill Campbell's average on the main paper keeping it from a lower mark.
