This is the story of a maniac policeman who, for some reason, has it for a young university student and his classmates. After informing his supervisor, who in turn suspends him pending the psychiatric evaluation, he finds an opportunity for the psychology to torture them when, in a bet, the children pirate the security of a department store and open the door. Only they stay locked in the store, along with the weirdo. Murder and chaos are on the march, and children try to survive until morning, when they may be able to escape. <br /> <br /> 'Dangerous game' would have been a successful psychological cat and mouse thriller game probably if it was placed in a different location. The idea of ​​a psychotic policeman chasing a group of innocent teenagers in a department store simply did not work. Especially when he's face to face with his quivering quarrel quite often, and yet he does not do anything serious quite often. There was no real confrontation, since it would be enough for this kind of story, and it may have worked better if, for example, the teenagers were loose in the neighborhood and defended against this weirdo (especially if that took a few days while making them more and more paranoid ... although granted, even that is a cliché). <br /> <br /> It's also a shame that it was not a better thriller, considering a funky cast of the young Australian. characters. Even a carefree adventure in spite of the madness of the villain intermingled through the image could have even made it a more satisfying image. Instead, it started again, and I'm sure it had a lot of action sequences, but it ended up on the edge of ridicule.
