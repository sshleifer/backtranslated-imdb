Once I heard that the largest and oldest preserved Germanic heroic poem was transformed into a movie, it almost became my obsession to see it. The first flashes of his appearance that I caught never disappointed me. A futuristic interpretation. With Lambert, our favorite mountaineer and Mitra, the tomb of the grave, in the main roles considered attractive, although some doubts came to life (an important female character in Beowulf?) ... Two hours ago I saw the movie. After reading the director's name, my world fell apart. As I said, as of that moment, there were not many surprises. In the first place, the film has NOTHING to do with the original Beowulf if we ignore a couple of violently stolen names. If they had not stolen the names and declared that it was a new story, it could have happened as a stupid F-class action with beautiful costumes and set design. That's just a crime! An attack on a legend and its ideology, as well as common sense. Ok, let me be positive for a second ... apart from the general electro-gothic environment that is good, it also has good music. That was all for the positive part and this comment.
