********** POSSIBLE SPOILER ********** Madonna plays an ex-convict who needs to retrieve some valuable information that could free her from the murder she was imprisoned for four years ago. Griffin Dunne is a tax attorney who is marrying his boss's daughter. Together, the two are supposed to come together in a world where chaos prevents you from getting on the bus ... <br /> <br /> When you get into that, this is a stupid movie. Without trying to reveal the plot **** POSSIBLE SPOILER ****, the bad guys in the film try to protect their boss by recovering the information that would incriminate them for the murder for which Madonna was sent. What kind of bad guys do not commit murder while trying to hide the original murder?!?!?! <br /> <br /> Then there are the policemen who are following Madonna who follows the bad guys in a limousine, where they have brides tied up! And let's not forget those same brides who fought from the front door to the front door, still tied! And I hate to say this, but that Patagonian feline looks like a cougar! There may only be four of them in the New York City area, so they could be in danger there, but I know there are many of them in the Rockies (see "Charlie the lone cougar" if you really want to see a great "cat" in the movie.) And let's see the old man who falls asleep on his feet ... NAW! <br /> <br /> The plot is there, but that's all there is in this I was barely out of my teens when this movie originally came out and I had some Madonna fanatic, but that was the only reason I liked the movie, but since then, it has lost popularity with me. she is simply a terrible actress (the good thing is that she has that career as a singer), she qualified maybe with a "5" at that time, but it was reduced to "just a 2" over the years.
