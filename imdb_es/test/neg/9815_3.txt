This movie is a bad movie. But after seeing an endless series of bad horror movies, I can say that it's a little different from the many I've seen. Not in the plot, which is a fairly regular story, but rather in the way the scenes are cut. Murder Weapon gives us many scenes of inane dialogues, but they last much longer than in most movies of this type. Because of this, some of the victims seem a bit less like cardboard cutouts. Only a little. It was difficult for me to discover exactly what was happening at the beginning and I was wondering if certain events were sequences of dreams. My favorite scene is when two men run from the murderer and take refuge in a car. In the glove compartment, they find a gun. "Thanks God!" One of them exclaims happily. That guy's head suddenly looks like the head of a mannequin, and it lasted just long enough for me to ask, "What's that? Where's that mannequin in relation to the two guys in the car?" So BOOM! My head exploded and I realized that I was supposed to be one of the guys in the car who shot his head with a shotgun. I love that scene, but the movie is a very bad movie. 3/10.
