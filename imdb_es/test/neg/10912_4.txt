Cujo is a giant, adorable, kind and affectionate San Bernardino, owned by the Camber family. During the opening sequence, Cujo chases a rabbit over the fields and through a local forest somewhere in Castle Rock, Maine. The rabbit disappears in a burrow and Cujo pokes his head in the entrance hole. The rabbit disappears from sight of Cujo, the enraged Cujo begins to bark and in doing so, inadvertently wakes up and bothers a colony of bats, one of which bites him in the nose. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace-Stone as Dee Wallace) is having an affair with Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone, Dee Wallace's real life husband) that her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh Kelly), who works in advertising, discovers. Obviously their relationship becomes tense. Happily oblivious to all this is his son Tad (Danny Pintauro). Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) arranges the cars to live from his barn in his country house. Joe is planning a weekend of boys with one of his friends Gary Pervier (Mills Watson) when his wife Charity (Kaiulani Lee) wins $ 5,000 in the lottery and decides to take her son Brett (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) with her to a trip. to see his parents. Arriving at Gary's house to pick him up, Joe finds him dead on the floor, goes to the kitchen to ask for help and his dog Cujo, who is now rabid, attacks him and kills him. Donna and Tad drive to the Camber farm to try to repair their car. The place is deserted, except for Cujo, who is now completely furious, with foam in his mouth, his coat dyed blood and maddened by pain. Cujo attacks the car to try to reach Donna and Tad, luckily for them the windows remain firm, at least for the moment. Donna tries to start the car, but it has completely broken down, both are trapped with nothing but the hope that someone will come to rescue them. Cujo waits, ready to attack and kill anyone who crosses his path. Directed by Lewis Teague, I thought the movie was a bit slow for my liking. The first half progresses slowly, the second half accumulates a steam head, but I still felt it was a bit disappointing and unexciting. The performance is good for everyone involved, I have no complaints. Technically the film is fine, photography, music, special effects, editing and in general it is well done. The big problem is the script of Don Carlos Dunaway and Lauren Currier and, in particular, it is the first half, most of which seems to be filling in to lengthen the execution time. Arriving just below the 90 minute mark felt more. It is also a bit predictable too. Cujo, like a monster, did not really scare me either, I just do not think the overweight drooling of St. Bernards is scary, I suppose. I guess there's nothing really bad about it, but I do not think I'm in a hurry to see it again. Average, it's not so bad if you can find a cheap copy or capture it on TV for free.
