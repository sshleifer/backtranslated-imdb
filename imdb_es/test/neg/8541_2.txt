A group of adventurers travel to the 'dark continent' to try to locate a lost heiress named Diana, who disappeared years before in a plane crash, and who is now believed to live with a savage tribe that considers her his goddess. <br /> <br /> Once again, my search for sleazy films and European cannibals has taken me deep into the territory of Jess Franco: a seemingly infinite cinematic desert full of scripts of poor quality, full of great works of camera and abundant with a horrible performance (Franco's regular, Lina Romay, takes the prize this time for his unfortunate performance as a sick old woman). It is here, in this hellish place, that I finally stumbled upon Kilimanjaro Diamonds, an abysmal exploiter based on the jungle so stupendously bad that it took me three successive afternoons to finish seeing it. <br /> <br /> Crabby and relentlessly bored, even by Franco's standards, this tedious piece of junk fails on almost every level: the story is a terribly boring derivative of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan, albeit with a twist female; the film seems to have been filmed in the local botanic gardens, although the grainy footage is poorly integrated into the film in a futile effort to convince viewers that the action is really happening in Africa; and the death scenes have almost no blood (you can usually trust Franco for some splashes, but despite the initial appearances, this is not a cannibal movie and it's not that bloody). <br /> <br /> Where the director What is successful, however, is in his casting of the young and attractive Katja Bienert as Diana, the jail of the jungle. Running and jumping through the undergrowth into nothing more than a tiny loin cloth, with her curvaceous body revealing the fact that she was only sixteen at the time, this nubile beauty is quite impressive. Franco also offers a nudity more courtesy of Mari Carmen Nieto as the treacherous traveler Lita (who gives us a glimpse of their untamed regions), and Aline Mess as the topless warrior woman Noba, thus avoiding just getting another rating of 1 / 10 from me (Although I'm sure he'll receive a lot more in the future, I still have many movies to watch).
