This film began in a tense way, but it was destined to, with a dominant mother, a witch of a rival, and a faltering beauty queen who constantly occupies the second place. There was a bit of silly overexcitement, and some unlikely plot points (she ranks second in EVERY single competition? EVERYONE?) Unfortunately, the film suffers horribly because of its need to, well, be a television movie. Instead of ending at the end of the film, a funny twist in which the murderer reveals himself (in a semiplausible way), the film continues for another twenty minutes, just to make sure that justice is done. Of course, now that the murderer is revealed, he suddenly experiences a complete personality change: his character is completely rewritten, because writers no longer need to keep their identity secret. The cheese completely sinks what might otherwise have been an amusingly entertaining movie.
