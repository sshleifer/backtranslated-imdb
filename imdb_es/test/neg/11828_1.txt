Ah animorphs I loved the series of books and enthusiastically devoured each one in high school and when I heard that there was a television adaptation, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> Oh, what a disappointment was the final product. I think that for me, this was the moment when Nickelodeon stopped being a great and more generic programming. <br /> <br /> So, what was wrong with the series? Let me count the forms: 1. The characters were HORRIBLY ill-prepared. In the books, the Animorphs were between 12 and 14, the TV cast was at least 18. I remember being horrified when I first saw the photos of the cast. <br /> <br /> 2. The horrible acting / bad writing. I do not know which one was the culprit, so I'm getting into the lumpy mass that it was. Maybe it was the fact that the cast's accelerated age hindered the humor that is, at least, cute that comes out of a 13-year-old boy because Marco is not funny. In fact, I do not remember a single funny moment in the group and there were some. The actors were certainly not helped by the writing, which was insipid at its best and the head was pathetic at its worst. <br /> <br /> 3. My lord were stingy with the budget. Only the final result of the Andalites should have convinced Viacom to pull the plug ... Their heads had slits that clearly showed what the helmet was. <br /> <br /> 4. Back to the cast: Rachel was, by far, the biggest disappointment, far from being the warrior woman in the books, the best equivalent in the television series was "scarecrow". Also, I know that Cassie was an idealist, but there is a difference between "idealistic" and "idiotic". <br /> <br /> 5. One of the worst opening titles of all time. The music had to be so obvious? 6. Answering question 6, "yes", because everything else was stunned, so why are not the less intelligent viewers receiving a thick song like the brick of a rap rock con or whatever else? /> <br /> Since then, there have been major disappointments (Iraq, 2004), but in case I have not clarified, this program was a failure and was an abomination for the series of books in which it was supposed to be based
