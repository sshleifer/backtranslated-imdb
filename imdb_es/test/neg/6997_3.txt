With such a promising cast and a director that I've heard great things about, this movie disappointed me completely. It started with signs of a great epic tale of gangsters and it became a completely confusing mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and useless scenes (and I did see the full version). I love Robert DeNiro and, as usual, he did an excellent job as an actor, but in all his other gangster films, no matter how many people he murders, I always had respect for his character, but in this film he was a drug addict. . , rapist no matter to anyone but himself. In addition, James Woods, another excellent actor, had some completely ridiculous scenes written for him. I thought that the parts in which Robert DeNiro called him crazy and he turned around, left completely from the left field and towards the end, the writers simply threw this random comment on how his father died in a madhouse and that's why James Woods it did not. How to be called crazy. There was a lot left to develop in this movie. Also, we never discovered who the men are at the beginning trying to kill Noodles and never discovered more about Joe Pesci's character. It seems that the writers gathered around five different stories and never fully explained any of them. The only redeeming quality of the film was the story when the characters were young children. The story went smoothly in this part of the film and the children did a great acting job. In general, I was very disappointed in this movie and I do not see how anyone can compare this with the Godfather 1 and 2, or even with Goodfellas. I'm sad to have lost four hours of my life watching this movie.
