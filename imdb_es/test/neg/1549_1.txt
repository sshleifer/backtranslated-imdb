For a while it seemed that this show was on 24/7. Then apparently there was a second season or some other kind of continuation of this horrible show about the two most foolish and conceited people that have been filmed. All the other comments have captured the essence of these two heads of selfish and perfectly haggling. You can not say much less about them, besides what everyone else has said. <br /> <br /> I doubt that these two women have souls, and most likely they have made some kind of Faust treatment to get their lizard snouts. A television series. May fates protect the human race from any further exposure to the Ghastly Girls!
