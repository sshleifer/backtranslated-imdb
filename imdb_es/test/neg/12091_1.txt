***** SPOILERS ********* <br /> <br /> This movie was really horrible. This woman cheats on her employers from the beginning and then selfishly proceeds to destroy them. In the end, you see her doing the profession she learned from the father of her "student". I put the student in quotes because the governess really never seems to teach the child anything. She seems to hate her and can not bear to be near her. I felt sorry for the girl who simply wanted to be loved, in spite of that, it was understandable that she would say and make outrage to get attention, but the viewer was not supposed to sympathize with the girl, the viewer was supposed to sympathize with the governess that He hated his student and manipulated and deceived his employers. I just could not do it. This was not the story of a woman made by itself, but it was a window into the mind of a person who uses others at every opportunity without any other thought for anyone outside of their own family. I could not stand the governess! This was a really horrible movie. I only paid one dollar to rent it, but even that was too much!
