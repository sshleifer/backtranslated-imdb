I thought that this would be a funny comedy without sex or nudity. Well, there's no sexual content, but as for being a "funny comedy," I only remember laughing a total of three times during "The Green Butchers." Hilarity focuses on cannibalism and mental retardation, which is only bad humor, in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I should have left this movie and I'm kicking myself because I did not. In fact, I should not have seen this movie in the first place. The only good thing that came out of this movie was the fact that Bjarne and his brother finally repaired and left behind their ugly past. I advise any well-meaning person to stay away from this great movie.
