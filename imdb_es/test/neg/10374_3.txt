This film must be renamed: Sex in the 70s in a part of New York City called Greenwich Village and Chelsea. <br /> <br /> This movie does not talk much about sex in the 70s, except in the public's hyper-sexual environments. and private sexual spaces in New York City. I doubt that the Manhole bar symbolizes real sex in the 70s and that kind of sex is much more frequent in the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the period of time seems like an explosion. And it is quite important to document the scene to which the film refers. But as for calling this movie Sex in the 70s, the title is a bit misleading. Technically it is not an Nominated Oscar, but its harshness feels appropriate for the subject. <br /> <br /> In general, an "eh".
