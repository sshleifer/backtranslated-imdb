Like most people, I could not wait to see this sequel to Ocean 11, but it really sucks, I must say. It sucks because there is simply no good script, it was cheap. I hope that the producers donate all the money that this film has made (or will) to the victims of the tsunami in Asia so that this film has at least one good reason to exist. It's so bad that I can not even write a decent comment about it, but ... I still advise the creators to do "Ocean's 13". Ocean's 13 will be about the same thieves who try to steal a script well hidden somewhere in Hollywood. The number 13 member will be a foreign screenwriter (maybe Russian) who knows all the tricks to write a copy of this script well hidden, so they can replace the original they will have to steal. Or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent script for a film in which not only Julia Roberts is played, but also all the other star members of the Ocean movies. 13 People because it is the lucky number of Andy Garc√≠a's character.
