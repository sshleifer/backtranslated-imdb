Personally, the book was a very well written, amazing and exciting piece that was not brought to justice for the film. Seeing the film at 12.01 in the morning to see which important parts of the book were left outside frustrated me, seeing that it affected the "different" outcome of the film. There was something to be desired for this film, but in general, it was missing in the plot. <br /> <br /> For someone who has NOT read the book, I could see how this movie would look attractive and attractive. Fun with his controversy and suspense. However, for a dedicated reader who has read it seven times, I did not see the strong connection between the two: the film and the novel. <br /> <br /> Missing important characters (such as Maximilian Kohler) and the Abrupt twist in the plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti, the plot of the film was slightly scattered, which led to a different shot at the conclusion of the story. The Hassassin was also depicted as a common white man, compared to that of the novel in which he was depicted as a Muslim; His motives in the book are based primarily on his links with the Illuminati; however, in the movie, their motives are based on money and seemed more work than a personal link to the task at hand.
