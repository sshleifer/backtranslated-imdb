How in the world does a thing like this enter my home DVD player? How does it even get packaged and distributed? Are there absolutely zero projections in which a movie (and I use that term lightly) has to happen before it is posted on the shelf of a video store? I'm all for making DIY movies, but come on! That does not give me the right to gather a group of my friends and relatives, a shitty camcorder, a horrible story and put it all together to create a lot of trash and call it a movie. And I want people to stop using the words "Indie" and "Campy" to describe these kinds of movies. They are not either. In no other profession, something like this would be considered acceptable. If someone tried to sell you a car that was as bad as this movie, you would recover it and say it was a lemon. If it were a surgical procedure, I would be suing the doctor for malpractice. I would like to be able to recover my time and money after seeing this. Shame on video stores that store movies like these. They are a scam to the public. Do you want "campy"? Go get any of the movies on Friday the 13th (even the AFTERNOON) or Dead-Alive. At least those do not make you want to kill yourself. It's because of movies like this that make people automatically equate to trash.
