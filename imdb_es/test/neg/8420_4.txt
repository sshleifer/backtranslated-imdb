A dryly irreverent satire, but sadly without grace, of detective films, with Michael Caine, stony faced, playing a British author of criminal stories of bad blood traveling to the Mediterraean to help write the memories of a possible gangster; Soon, he realizes that he is being followed and his life is in danger. Caine narrates the process with considerable sly wit and discreet sarcasm, but his actual performance is lacking in energy (Caine's outbursts of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere, and he does not connect with anyone on the screen). Other cast members (particularly Mickey Rooney, a silver-haired Lionel Stander and Lizabeth Scott) perform very well in colorful roles, although Al Lettieri has an insulting part as an apparent transvestite homosexual (Lettieri insults himself without being able to defend himself, an unenviable position). Screenwriter and director Mike Hodges has the germ of a good idea (to satirize the detective films of the 1940s without compromising the discourse and the harsh medium), but he does not have a great sense of humor. When a Bogart imitator (ask a question about a hawk) is the best joke, what follows is anemic. ** since ****
