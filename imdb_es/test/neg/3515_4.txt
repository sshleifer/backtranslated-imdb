I recently saw this movie on The Sundance Channel and it kept me interested from the beginning. However, it seems that it takes a long time to get where you want to go and in the end, I felt somewhat cheated. In short, Noble Willingham (of Walker, Texas Ranger fame) plays a boat salesman who begins to be harassed over the phone by a man claiming to be his son. According to the mysterious caller, Willingham has a dark and dirty little secret that affects the son and he (the son) enjoys remembering it. I will not ruin anything for anyone, but for me three things prevented me from liking a lot of this movie. One, the movie has more rude language than Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino and Glengarry Glen Ross combined. 99% of it is spit out of Willingham. It did not take me long to exhaust myself with the constant four-letter words. Two, I just could not believe that someone answered the phone so many times, especially when it is known that there is a caller on the other side of the line. No matter where Willingham is in the film, whether at work, at home, in a restaurant, etc., the phone rings and he always answers by throwing poison at the "son", and then hangs ONLY TO ANSWER WHEN THE CALLER CALLS BACK IN ENVELOPE TEN SECONDS! How many of us would do that? Now I realize that we probably do not have a movie if he does not keep responding, but I just could not stop disbelief on that particular issue. Three, and this is the least of the criticisms, why is the director opposed to showing us the "Corndog Man" (a.k.a. the caller)? Most of the time, it's just a voice at the other end of the phone. I could have lived with that if other things had fallen into place, but since they did not, it was just one more. I give credit to the film for being a somewhat original idea and for keeping my attention with suspense from the beginning, but that's all. I see it, even if only once. However, if you're like me, you'll be saying "Triple K Marine!" in your dream for a night or two after you finish watching it.
