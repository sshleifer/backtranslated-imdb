I have not seen or heard the original version. <br /> <br /> I'm not Russian, but I'm learning right now. <br /> <br /> Neither do I have preferences for Russia, Bulgaia, the United States. <br /> <br /> But what I have to mention is: <br /> <br /> In German synchronization, throughout the film, all Russians speak with a Russian accent. Americans speak "Hochdeutsch" (without an accent)! I have never heard such stupidity! Also, this is boring. <br /> <br /> I hope the original is better. <br /> <br /> The rest is a simple thriller, they are not really good ideas. Like a cheap version of a James Bond movie.
