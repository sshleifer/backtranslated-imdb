Woohoo! After the first five minutes of watching this "movie", I was tempted to put a bullet in my brain and end my life. It is really difficult to describe what exactly this film is about. Honestly, I do not know what kind of human being could even finance a stool. The film seems to have been shot on video or 16 mm. Normally I do not have problems with SOV films, they are 16 mm films made with poor quality, but this was horrible. And where did they find these "actresses"? I've seen some bad performances, but this takes the cake. Look at the first 5 minutes and you'll see what I want to say. BCI Entertainment must be boycotted for distributing this horrible mud. This has to be the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. I want my 74 minutes back! If you can sit for the first 5 minutes, without shooting your TV or committing mass murders, then take a picture. After all, what do you have to lose?
