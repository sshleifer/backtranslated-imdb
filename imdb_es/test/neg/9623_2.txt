Having enjoyed the writing of Neil Gaiman (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in "The Dream Hunters") in the past, I thought that Mirrormask was a sure thing and it disappointed me a lot. The beginning, the live action section of the film was intriguing enough. The relationships between the characters were believable and easy to empathize with, and I loved the sets, the costumes and the artwork of Helena. The subsequent scenes generated by computer, however, were unbearable. The dialogue was clumsy and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and the CGI was horrifying. The events occurred for the most feeble reasons, and most events seemed superfluous to any plot that might have existed. I only saw the first twenty or thirty minutes of the film, so I'm not exactly an authority, but I strongly recommend that you do not see any of that and keep the written work of Gaiman.
