The Emperor's New Groove was a great twist for Disney. It was not a musical! He had clean, fresh jokes and no political twists. It was just a very funny movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk's New Groove, on the other hand, is tired and weak. My 3-year-old son still loves Emperor's New Groove, but he fell asleep during Kronk. There really is no real conflict (which, in the first movie, leads to all extravagant adventures). Due to the lack of conflict, it almost seems that the animators expelled the writers and simply invented the story as they went along. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen that would make the movie fun. . . and I'm still.
