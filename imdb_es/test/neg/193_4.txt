Hair, the movie based on the success of Broadway, does not achieve any of the exchangeable cinematographic qualities. You can not take the work and turn it into a movie. If one is so tempted by rock music to see this movie, that really detracts from the quality of a Broadway show. Worse than watching replays of comedies. musical fiasco, and I can not believe that others have rated it so high.
