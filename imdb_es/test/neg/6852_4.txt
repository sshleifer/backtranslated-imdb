This is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999, when a strange disease breaks out and ... I stopped worrying. This is supposed to be about two people living one over the other or under the other in an apartment complex. There's a leak and a plumber puts a hole in the man's floor so he can see the apartment below the woman. Also, given that there is a crisis in much of the dialogue, they are actually news reports ... <br /> <br /> Sound promising? <br /> <br /> Not really. <br /> <br /> I got distracted and started doing other things that are deadly in a subtitled film. Basically I started not to look, which made the events seem even more surreal when I looked up. <br /> <br /> It may work for you, it was not for me.
