For the most part, I considered that this movie did not deserve a comment, but the last 10 minutes I was asked to write one. You see, in that moment we learn (SPOILERS ... if you can call them that) that the devil's emissary has no chance of properly preparing the world domination for his master, because he is not an expert in martial arts! "Prosatanos" has been lying in a hole for centuries, waiting for "human greed" to set him free, only to be defeated in a single one-on-one battle against the 54-year-old former karate champion, Chuck Norris! Imagine what would have happened to her if she had faced Jackie Chan ... (* 1/2)
