Mom starts at night in the middle of nowhere, in what looks like a wooden building in the desert. A truck stops and an angry father takes out his fucking daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) and leaves her there, but she is not alone while the somber figure of Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) watches her from a short distance. . Virginia tries to make conversation, but as she grinds a cigarette under her leopard print, high-heeled boots and high thigh boots, Nestor grabs her by the throat and drags her into the darkness. Nestor opens the top, becomes a monster and begins to eat his guts. Virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer who has Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) and LAPD baffled, or at least that's the message that a local television news reporter named Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Mller) is saying to his viewers. Clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) and, therefore, his mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has a spare room that he decides to rent for the "blind" dark sunglasses that use Nestor. Unfortunately for Emily, she accidentally removes Nestor's sunglasses, which reveals that she has strange colored eyes, Nestor becomes a monster again and bites Emily into a carnivorous monster like him. Nestor takes Emily to train her, they find a homeless homeless tramp (Rory VanSaint), they kill him and they eat their insides, but Emily's son, Clay, has witnessed all this and must choose between doing the right thing and his love for his mother that now turns out to be a grotesque monster that sucks blood and eats meat! <br /> <br /> Edited, written and directed by Patrick Rand. I thought mom was a pretty horrible movie. Looking at some of the other comments on the IMDb list and the genre that has been given, it seems that many think that Mom is a horror comedy. Well, I can tell you now that I did not see any comic elements in Mom because there are none, unless they are very subtle. The only thing I can assume is that people see comedy in the real situation presented by Mom, who is an old woman who is becoming a carnivorous monster and in the foreseeable problems and emotional anguish that causes her son who discovers it. There are no jokes (aside from naming a Beverly Hills prostitute (Stella Stevens)), humor slap or something remotely funny in the movie itself and, as far as I could see, it plays completely straight in its execution time 90 minutes So, since there's no comedy in Mom, that means there's a lot of horror, right? Bad, mom sucks and is terribly slow to watch, especially after the first thirty minutes, which consists of Nestor becoming a monster a couple of times, biting Emily and showing her how to look for food and Clay to find out. Up to this point, Mom was moving at a pretty decent pace, had some special makeup effects and I was interested, unfortunately mom runs for another hour, which is basically the emotional shit that Emily's son suffered, the eventual collapse of her Marriage and him. to be divided between love for his mother and the fact that he is a carnivorous monster. This part of the film is incredibly slow, boring and as boring as the wash, even having the nerve to resort to a clich√© role-reversal scenario in which Clay tells his mother to go to his room and stay there closing the door behind her, dismissing her. And put bars in the window so you can not escape from your room. Mother's script totally ignores the origins of the monsters and asks us to simply accept that this exists without giving a single reason why we should, no matter how silly an explanation has been, I think some background of the monster would have helped. Technically, my mother is insipid and cheap looking, although I can not say that it is wrong, is something very normal, with nothing that particularly impresses or something that I can make fun of to pass the time. The special makeup effects on the monster are fine, but they are used in very fast flashes, they blink and you will miss them. Do not be fooled by the illustrations of an elegant video box as I was, the monster only has three times the maximum and all are within the first thirty minutes. Nor do we have much blood, a cut arm, something to eat short intestine, a burned body and a drill in someone's arm is all we have. The acting is fine, but please, Mr. Brion James, what is that little accent about? At least James had the good sense to know that he was insane and sensibly chose to be killed early in the process, everyone else is anyone expecting the black lieutenant who was also a black police officer in Fright Night (1985), but can Did you recognize it from Die Hard 2 (1990), which made Mom & Die Hard 2 in the same year? Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! In general, there's nothing I can really recommend to my mother as a horror movie and certainly not a comedy as far as I'm concerned. Very poor, very disappointing and, once again, I have been tricked by an elegant video-box illustration with many pictures of monsters that look great. Definitely one to avoid.
