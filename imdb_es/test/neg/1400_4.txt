The stylized Hollywood westerns, full of family conventions, seem to have eternal life and this is an avatar. All content seems to have been removed from the back of a 1939 drawer, a larger budget was applied and this production is your problem. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper has played this kind of role dozens of times: the displaced Southerner, quick in the draw and firm with honor, although a bit easy to do so whenever possible. He plays Blayde Hollister, who travels to Texas in search of the gang that destroyed his cotton plantation. He wears a buff-fringed shirt and packs of two six handles with ivory handles. Speak with a country accent: "A feller could get hurt doing this." (Cf., "Sergeant York"). The gang is led by the contempt of Raymond Massey, who buys and sells land, usually by reckless means whenever possible. The gang includes Steve Cochran, who can not play against a Westerner, although in general he is very good at garbage bags. The woman required is Ruth Roman, daughter of the owner of a Mexican plantation, who seeks and speaks of Mexican as a brown betty from Boston. <br /> <br /> I do not think it bothers me too much with the plot. No doubt someone has analyzed it in detail and it is not worth mentioning. As in any western 1939, it is labyrinthine. Everyone, except Cooper and his friends, is dishonest and there are multiple double crosses, changed identities and hidden secrets. <br /> <br /> Everything is retro. The plot, the dialogue, the wardrobe, even the music. The score is for the sturdy Max Steiner from Warner. He's the guy who scored "King Kong." That was in 1932. This movie premiered in 1950. <br /> <br /> The name of Cooper, by the way, "Blayde Hollister", prompted me to review the records of the RACA, the American Royal Cowboys Association. - to see if that name appeared in his archives, which date from the beginning of the date until February 4, 1911, when the last Real Cowboy passed away due to an unfortunate encounter with a deranged peccary. There has never been a true cowboy by the name of Blayde. Hollister, yes, but not Blayde. In fact, there are no records of any Real Cowboy named Wade, Luke, Cole or Matt. The most popular names for genuine cowboys, in descending order of frequency, were Clarence, Mortimer, Noble, Nebukadnezzar, Plautus, Pinchbeck and Hortense. <br /> <br /> If this film had been released in 1939, it would have been routine. In 1950, it is a calamitous monument in the history of human recycling.
