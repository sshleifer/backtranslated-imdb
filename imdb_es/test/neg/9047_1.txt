A gore snore. I saw this horrible, stinky, worthless piece of trash in Cameo Movie House (now Crobar's famous nightclub) on Washington Avenue in South Beach in 1980 or 81. I was 17, my three friends and I were laughing at this. horrible, disgusting, piece of garbage. The theater was on its last legs and mostly there were drunks snoring and sleeping in the place. Nothing was lost. The worst performance of all. These actors deserve the Academy Award for the worst, and I mean the worst acting roles in the history of cinema. The joke was that the theater showed another Mi Mi Lay (A great name at least!) Stinky ... City of barons. Enough talk. If you are less than 12 years old, you may have some chills. More than 12, you will be snoring after the opening credits. It's amazing that someone has spent a penny on making this movie. And to think, it is considered a "cult" classic. YUK !!!!
