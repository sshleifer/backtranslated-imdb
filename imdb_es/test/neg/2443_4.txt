Miserable movie Not even to be compared once with "To Kill a Mockingbird" or "In the Heat of the Night". <br /> <br /> Yes, there are racial prejudices, but the film is, at best, ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Come now. Would you really have Elizabeth Patterson, of all people, guarding a prison to avoid lynching? Patterson, in his day, played the mother of all and was the owner of "I Love Lucy" before Fred and Ethel Mertz bought the building. Did the man's gun kill a white man? <br /> <br /> Claude Jarman Jr., who was so fabulous in 1946, "The Yearling" appears in this mess. I still had those sad eyes. My eyes would also be sad if I appeared in this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> For me, this was just a failure of Faulkner all the way.
