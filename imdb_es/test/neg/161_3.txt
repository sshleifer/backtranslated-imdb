This film is about the complicated friendship, romance and deception between two men and two women during World War II. <br /> <br /> A great effort has been made so that "The Edge of Love" is seen in the right period. However, I find this effort too excessive, particularly in terms of the tone of the colors. Most of the first half of the film is processed so much that it has a strong bluish tone. It is difficult to distinguish who is who in this tone. <br /> <br /> Another damaging point is the elegant use of the lens of division of images. There are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing, like three smiling faces of Keira Knightley or four pairs of arms embraced. That simply makes the film confusing and difficult to follow, instead of being artistic. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it's just boring. The way the story unfolds is not at all attractive. The unstable character of Sienna Miller is annoying. In fact, all the main characters are annoying and unpleasant. The accent of Keira Knightley is impossible to understand, which makes it an additional impediment to understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> I strongly advise avoiding "The Edge of Love", unless you see a movie just to appreciate great costumes, beautiful sets and lighting.
