I've seen this movie about thirty years ago and it stayed with me until now. When I found it on a DVD, I did not hesitate too much, even more, because I have a predilection for the first Belmondo films. But what a bad surprise! Some films must be allowed to renounce public exposure, to preserve a certain memory and not to shock audiences. <br /> <br /> Widely acclaimed as one of Chabrol's rare cynical works, the only lasting impression I received from a reporter. Seeing it is ... boredom. Some movies do not really age in style. But what about films that have no sense of style? <br /> <br /> Failures in the script, uninspired acting, presumably due to lack of direction, a kind of production design, which does not deserve its name, less than mediocre photography and, finally , the worst editing work I've seen in a long time, makes this really hard to bear. <br /> <br /> My impression was that it was a group of people with a lot of money and equipment, but obviously, no idea or skill whatsoever. It really is a surprise, that this did not abruptly end Chabrol's career. Do not blame the general bad taste of the 70s, this is shit in its own right and a worthy contender for the most useless loss of celluloid.
