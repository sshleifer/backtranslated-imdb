Oh, another Seagal movie. In no less than a few months they come to populate the shelves of video stores. As bad as submerged? No. But that does not say much. I like the perfume of a pig. <br /> <br /> Seagal is a professional thief who wants to resign, but he looks for a last job only to be subdued by his bosses. He lands in prison and is a friend of a gangster who helps him escape and seek a refund. <br /> <br /> It's good to see that Seagal finally does not play with an agent, a cop or what he usually plays. Actually, we get a location from EE. UU In Las Vegas. Next, a territory of Eastern Europe as usual. There's also no wire-Fu here. Don Fauntleroy does a good job. <br /> <br /> However, most of the action and fight scenes with Stevie are clearly double. Scenes from other movies, lack of realism and logic in even the smallest situation. Seagal and Treech make such an inspiring (unintentional) team laugh a minute. Whisper the rest. <br /> <br /> Several notable faces approach the slums. of your emergency days. Nick Mancuso appears in sleepwalking mode to carry a check. No more rappers. Please? At this point, action scenes and diagrams are more predictable and are recycled generically more than ever. It's an old scene that Seagal needs to hang or hang up. He should have left a while ago.
