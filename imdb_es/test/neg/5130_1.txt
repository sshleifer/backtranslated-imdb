I registered on IMDb.com just to be able to comment on this movie. My God, what a pile of smoking horses this was! It should not even be promoted like a real movie, this is very deceptive. This is the best film project of a 15 year old. The acting is terrible. But even good actors could not save this. Dialogue is probably the worst part of this movie. Who the hell wrote this shit? And that constant joke that comes from the fat lesbian that Kaye is a "damsel in distress" became old very fast. God, I'd rather have a camel bathe my ear instead of seeing this shit again. Do not rent this movie. If you got the movie for free, do not see it. crush it with a hammer. Even if the destruction of this video caused you to lose your Hollywood video or box office account, it would be worth it. This is an abomination. I suppose I have said all I can about this without being redundant. any question .... send me an email.
