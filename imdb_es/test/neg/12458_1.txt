Why do people make bad movies? Did not anyone who works in photography know that what they were doing did not make sense? There is something in this image that puzzled me, in addition to the fact that I found that this "movie" was unrealistic, pathetic and poorly made. I admire them for the attempt, but the "actors" in the film sometimes seem to be struggling and no character has substance or says something slightly intelligent. This movie deserves zero stars. But I did not have that option, so I get a 1.
