It's a truth that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie; This is not an exception. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Yankee lover, but your astonishingly simplistic view of the world and your ability to reduce everything in black and white, as well as make events (even fictional ones in novels) conform to An agenda that has little or no relation to complexity of any kind is extremely irritating. <br /> <br /> Wilbur Smith is descriptively detailed but weaves intricate stories that deserve more than what has been delivered by this horrible mix of movies. <br /> <br /> Really sad for those who will never read Smith. They will be left with a less than decent representation of their Egyptian series, which must be said to be gigantic in its exhibition. <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones movies were fast. Trying to replicate it by manipulating Smith's novels in this production is lost by a country. <br /> <br /> Pathetic, except for photography and Art Malik.
