Movies like this annoy me simply because they do not deserve the funding that allows them to end up on my DVD player. This film is ambiguous on its cover and even more impenetrable in its casting choices (why is Ms. Song a romantic interest? They only wanted an Asian woman there, or her unconvincing character actually lends this story to the "message" "A new perspective? One has very little to follow to get closer to this movie, much less as the story unfolds. But a good hour in the process, I realized that the boring cast is all that the casting agent could unearth, the unconvincing character studies are the result of the enigma of the writers, and the story is amorphous and plagued of subtle references to the afflictions of Capitalism, materialism, and getting ahead in the postmodern world. Towards the end of this film, just before I paused and missed the last two minutes, I had the feeling that "Everything's Gone Green" is a product of "connections" in the world of cinema: someone with very little talent knew someone with very little ability as a director, knew someone without any sense of marketing (but with a big disposable ego) and took out this dazed and inefficient attempt at capricious nonsense and humor with conscience. And this is the most maddening: How many infinitely better scripts were overlooked in this trip almost impossible to see? Skip this movie and feel good about yourself for doing it.
