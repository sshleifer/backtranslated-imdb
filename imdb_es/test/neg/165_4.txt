After seeing this, I came to the conclusion that it was probably a movie for girls; later I discovered that Keira's mother wrote the script to confirm that. However, a film for chicks may have some appeal to men; he does not do it, and it seems that it does not seem so attractive to women (looking at the dark receipts at the box office). One element in which I think both genres agree is the stupidity of the scene, in the film, in which an analogy is established between the pain of childbirth and the pain of a limb that is being amputated without anesthesia. Although men do not suffer the pain of childbirth, we understand that it is a painful process; However, it is a natural pain while an amputation certainly is not! Women understand this even better. I suspect that some woman was trying to make a feminist statement in bad taste. In fact, many things in this movie are in very bad taste. Although the movies of today are known to have bad taste, this really "excels" in that department. This could have been a good movie showing the problems of Dylan Thomas during World War II; and how strong was the feeling against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the army at that time. Keira's mother, who writes the screen, tries to show how this feeling was used against Dylan, but it really confuses this. Instead, we received a film about how two young mothers come together; kind of In a certain sense. Maybe. Somehow. It is noteworthy that a soldier (the husband of Dylan's wife's friend) is sent home after serving in combat; However, it is not clear if the war is over! Many things about this movie are not clear either; and although I have declared that I will do it again, since it seems to be the central motive of this mess.
