Please, do not waste your time and your money with this stinking turkey. <br /> <br /> This is an exaggerated melodramatic love story in the context of New France (also known as Quebec in the 18th century). Or is it a historical saga of New France with an epic romance? I do not know, and at this point I do not care anymore. <br /> <br /> There is a rich story to tell about the intrepid French adventurers, rogues and other varied characters who settled in Canada and parts of the United States. This is not. The characters are total clich√©s, the story is exaggerated, without breath and without charm, and in a short time all that the viewer wants to do is to leave the cinema, check his head and take over his character. Anger to be deceived by the hype. <br /> <br /> This movie was the biggest disappointment of my year in terms of cinema, especially since then, as a French and Canadian Canadian or French historian (or whatever) I am a) a believer in the fact that the history of my people in this country has not yet been told as well as I could in the film b) interested in this topic c) a movie lover who thinks that cinema these days could do wonders with this great story and tragic <br /> <br /> As I said, do not waste your time with this frustrating trap.
