Although supposedly autobiographical, this film shows very little understanding of both the psychology of the protagonist (which results in a flat and fragmented characterization) and historical processes on a large scale, and my hope of learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary Iran remains . dissatisfied Instead, I found my sensitivity somewhat muffled when a succession of bearded Islamic villains replaced each other, provoking, torturing or killing the Iranian middle-class Iranian prototypical whose Western cultural sympathies were patent (and whose exoneration seeks the film rather shamelessly) . The understanding of the film seems to show that it is the media market, as it serves to fuel prevalent Western popular ideologies (ie, "please the crowd"). <br /> <br /> What redeemed the film from being boring was its creative animation, a genuinely minimalist image that, nevertheless, always kept the screen rich, expressive and unequivocal, is not a small party by which I give some stars.
