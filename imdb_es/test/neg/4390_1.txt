The box is the reason why I originally picked up this film and the back is the reason why I rented it. But I soon learned that I had been cheated. I thought that this movie would be something like a road trip / Eurotrip / American Pie. But I was wrong. This movie is one of the dumbest I've seen in a long time. The unclassified version invites you to look, but you will be completely disappointed. The acting was terrible and the sound effects barely noticeable. A very low budget appeared with all the configuration that takes place in the same building. Go out and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can not believe that National Lampoon has put his name on this. DO NOT BUY IT, DO NOT RENT IT. Do not waste 2 hours of your life on this.
