I have never been a big fan of Almodóvar, but, in general, I have always found something to enjoy in his films. Unfortunately, I had more trouble finding something to enjoy in Broken Embraces than I would normally think I would. <br /> <br /> I find that the biggest failure in Broken Embraces are the characters and the lack of depth they show. The film is essentially a love story, one that is tragic and one that wants to involve the viewer in their stories. I found this problem from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our "hero", the director / screenwriter, Matthew, is having sex with a very attractive young woman he just met. His agent enters when the woman leaves shyly. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our "hero", the director / screenwriter, Matthew, is having sex with a very attractive young woman he just met. His agent enters and rolls his eyes when the woman leaves shyly. Mateo babbles something about the need to enjoy life as the only thing he has left. Having been blinded in a tragic automobile accident that also killed his "true" love, Lena, played by Penelope Cruz, the viewer could accept this idea, except that the rest of the film never illustrates why Lena was the love of his life or any other The depth of your character or any other. <br /> <br /> Cruz plays Lena, the mistress, of an industrialist named Ernesto Martel. From the beginning, their union is quite pathetic, since Martel seizes Lena's jealousy, and Lena avoids the uncertainty of being alone by staying with the much older Martel. To avoid it, Martel finances a film for Mateo so that he can control the star of the film, Lena. Naturally, without a subsequent story, Lena and Mateo fall in love. And, in the world of Almodóvar, it really is that simple. Matthew, in the initial scene, has sex with a sexy young woman, now Matthew falls in love with Lena, then it is revealed that he had a child with his agent after their love affair. Your child responds to this information with a laugh and an "Oh, good". Once again, there is no depth, there is no understanding for any of these characters, everything just happens. From the beginning of the film until the end, I did not get any deep emotion from Mateo. It's flat, and it does not differ much from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The only scene that I enjoyed was when the film producer, Martel, is watching video images that his son recorded under the guise of Making a Matthew Documentary. There is a pleasant moment of Martel watching obsessively while a lip reading confirms his worst fears. Later, Lena confronts Martel while she is watching the images and speaks out loud, matching the video images of her lips as she talks. Some pretty bright moments. Quite devised, but still really fascinating. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for me, the rest of the movie left me quite bored. I could not worry about these characters or their situations, so no astuteness on the part of Almodóvar can compensate for this lack of depth. I think that if you are a fan of your work you will enjoy this movie, but if you are like me, in the middle, then you will find that it is missing.
