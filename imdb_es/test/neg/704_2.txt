I never want to see this movie again! <br /> <br /> Not only is it terribly bad, but I can not stand seeing my hero Stan Laurel looking so old and sick. <br /> <br /> Mainly I can not bear to watch this terrible movie! <br /> <br /> Frankly, there's no reason to see this horrible movie. The plot is simply stupid. The actors surrounding Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really bad and Laurel and Hardy have been more entertaining in any of their previous films! <br /> <br /> I warn you not to look at it, the images will haunt you for a long time!
