I recently saw this movie and I said to myself: "This movie is bad!" William Shatner is a great actor, but he is not a director! <br /> <br /> It's not just that the acting is bad, it's terrible. And instead of a plot, we have a very bad story called a plot! What I really thought was bad was at the beginning where Kirk and McCoy were teaching Spock to sing "Row, row, row your boat." <br /> <br /> Do I have anything against William Shatner? I do not. But when it comes to being a director, it sucks! This movie is not one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But it's the worst of the Star Trek series! <br /> <br /> I noticed that after this, Shatner did not direct another film of the series. Apparently they did not want him to direct another movie again after this happened! <br /> <br /> In general, this movie stinks! <br /> <br /> 2/10
