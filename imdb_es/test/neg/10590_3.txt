This is one of the most boring movies I've seen. The three main members of the cast simply did not seem to click right. The character of Giovanni Ribisi was quite annoying. For some reason, he seems to like to repeat what he says. If he were the "Rain Man", it would have been fine, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
