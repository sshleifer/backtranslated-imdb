This movie is strange, even for a silent movie. Essentially, follow the adventures of an engineer in postrevolutionary Russia who daydreams about going to Mars. In this film, it seems that the producers KNOW that the communists have really ruined the country, but they also seem to want it to look like they have achieved something good. <br /> <br /> Then we come to the "Martian Scenes", where everyone on Mars wears ridiculous hats. They have a revolution after being inspired by the Earthmen, but they are quickly betrayed by the Queen who accompanies them. Except that everything is a dream, or it is. (And since the Russian Revolution finally led to the Stalin dictatorship, it makes you wonder if it was all an allegory). <br /> <br /> Now, I have seen the GOOD Russian cinema. For example, the Battleship Potemkin by Eisenstein is a good movie. This is just, well, silly.
