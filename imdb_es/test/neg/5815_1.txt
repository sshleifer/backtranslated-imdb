I saw this movie when it came out. Let me see now, this guy who had previously skied Mount Fuji manages to accumulate funding and hire staff to document what sounds on the surface as a bold and daring act, to ski to the highest peak in the world. Well, AND THE SPOILER COMES HERE, what happens after a lot of people manage to help him reach the top, and he loses a life in the deal, climbs on skis, manages to make it Down a very , very short, at which point his PARACHUTE opens ... and that's it. And instead of recording the images to hide this astonishingly anticlimactic ending to a shameful shame, the guy goes ahead and releases it. END OF SPOILER I admire the incredible courage and effort that the film crew must have had to get some of the incredible shots they got. ANOTHER SPOILER: Oh, yes, one of the Sherpas dies by falling into a crack. The narrator, who quotes the "reckless skier", casually comments that, according to the Sherpa religion, since the body of this man can not recover, his soul will roam the world forever and never know how to rest. Is it worth it ?, reflects the narrator. he responds, because he had the intention of letting this clown "ski Everest". I do not remember ever seeing a piece of celluloid more valuable. This is one that can be lost at all costs.
