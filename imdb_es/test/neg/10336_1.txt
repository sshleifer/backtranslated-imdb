I will not go into details about why this movie deserves a terrible rating, many other people have already done it. Suffice it to say that of the more than 400 films that I have had on DVD, this is the ONLY one that I got rid of; It was so useless that I could not see any other time wanting to see ANYTHING. br /> <br /> However, I have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (since 15-15-06). While reviewing the 4 review pages, I did not see any rating higher than 3 stars. Regarding voting history, 78% of the users rated the movie with 4 stars or less. It seems to me that some people are filling in the urn to keep this film off the list of the "last 100" of IMDb. It would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this film as 10 stars (none of those who wrote a review of the film) are real active users. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled, this movie is not worth your time.
