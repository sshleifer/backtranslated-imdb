It's just a bad movie, which can not be ignored. The performance for the most part is very wooden (the only exception is the performance of Adrien Brody as the creator of Solo, Bill) and the story is light enough that you will probably forget it at the MOMENT of watching the movie. That said, such films have more to do with the action than with the plot / performance and, as such, live or die for the pieces of action, which after all is the goal of those films: to give young people 14 Years to smile Adults see films of real substance. And even in this, Solo does not manage to deliver it: the little action that is carried out is badly done, boring and without inspiration. After watching the trailer for this on television, I expected something similar to Predator with a robot that would replace Predaot. Instead, I got a rather lifeless action movie with a poorly constructed depth attempt, taking the message that robots can also feel. Watch Terminator II or Predator instead ... the two classics that this movie desperately wants to be, except that it lacks inspiration or, to be fair, the budget.
