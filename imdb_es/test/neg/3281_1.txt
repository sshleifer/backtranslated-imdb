This is a piece of celluloid CRAP. You can know when you're watching a mafia movie of "you want to be" ... and this is it. This caused NO SENSE, it did not start at the beginning of his life, the characters were everywhere ... and the TERM "GOD FATHER" DOES NOT EXIST until PUZO wrote the book. , borrowed the PHRASE and converted it into his AFTER the movie ... THIS cheat piece would think that the phrase (representing the don mafia) was used in the 20s ... when these people were only called " DON "... out of the original The Godfather movie, if you want to see another decent mafia movie, check out The Last Don (part 1) of Puzo, the second part.
