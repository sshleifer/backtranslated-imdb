I am just completing this comment, because I could not stand the fact that a positive comment was presented on the "complete information" page. I really think that this is the worst movie that has been made in my country. This is not only due to the terrible plot, the horrible English and the tension curve that is as flat as our country. No, it's because it was a serious attempt to make a good action movie, according to the Hollywood standard. It had to be "The European action movie of the year". For this purpose, they even hired Fejda van Huet, actor of the Academy Award-winning film "Karakter", to do the work. I do not care about bad movies, I can even enjoy them if they are unpretentious movie movies. but I can not stand movies that are terrible, but they're supposed to be type movies.
