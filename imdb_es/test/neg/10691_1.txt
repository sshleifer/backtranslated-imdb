I had never before seen such a tale of hangers without talent so ungrateful that his golden goose had not been able to put it. These sperm monkeys are parasites and bad examples of friends. I felt sorry for Troy while trying to connect all his friends with Hollywood concerts, but as soon as things got sour, everyone went to the street. Overnight was an artificial effort of self-indulgent retribution against a man who went against the forces of Hollywood to maintain the integrity of the story. The simple premise of Overnight is to try to communicate the message, "look at this guy, he screwed everything up", when in reality he has a strong clandestine follow-up, he faced the hard blows of friends and executives, all in the name of getting a Project done in the way he imagined it. Frankly, the only productive pair that any of these guys played in the overall execution of the Boondock Saints filming culminated as nothing more than extra bodies in the first bar scene, after that all they did was whine why they were not a big problem. based on escalating his rancid efforts on top of Troys shoulders.
