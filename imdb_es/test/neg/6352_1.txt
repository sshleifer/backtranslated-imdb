I bought this movie for a dollar and I thought it could never go wrong, my big mistake was seeing it. He enjoyed the performance of Ice-T and the rap that gave a lot of class to this movie about Los Angeles and the world of pimps. There is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice network and has a career, but due to mental problems since childhood and the murder of this other boxer, he retires. He is hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls who work for him in his job and make sure they are not beaten. This boxer falls in love with the boss's girlfriend and starts all kinds of problems. This is entertaining and then it becomes a great laugh comedy.
