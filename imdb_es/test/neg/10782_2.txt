In case your esteemed readers have never heard, this film was the main inspiration of the last year of Samuel L. Jackson-Eugene Levy Clunker The Man. This pair of action comedy and comedy soaked in the 80s combines Billy Crystal and the late Ethiopian Shim-Shammer Gregory Hines together as some clever Chi-town policemen who do not follow the rules. That is the extent of the movie. Interest is affected by the delivery of Hines lines that is terribly similar to that of Will Smith and by the cameos of now more famous actors such as Joe Pantoliano of Memento and Jimmy Smits of "NYPD Blue". My favorite scene is, I do not know, the pursuit of cars on the tracks, I suppose. Basically, I only see this movie as a great help in the demolition of friends movies. Well, this and Lethal Weapon 4 ... and Rush Hour 2 ... and The Man ...
