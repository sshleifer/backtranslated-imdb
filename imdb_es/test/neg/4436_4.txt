Quintet marks the only adventure of both Paul Newman and director Robert Altman in the field of science fiction. It was said of Newman that he could not do comedy, but he tried until he finally got real success in that genre with Slap Shot. But the failure of this movie left him shy and he never tried again. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. It is a futuristic ice age, provoked by who knows what, but presumably it is a nuclear winter. Even during the ice age thousands of years ago, the equatorial parts of the earth still sustained animal and human life, but apparently not here. The seals have survived and Paul Newman is a seal hunter abroad. <br /> <br /> But the hunters need a little R & R and Newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring that the natives play some kind of game Six people and it's a kind of Russian roulette. To win you have to kill five other participants in your game. <br /> <br /> It's a sad turn to see what man has arrived. Which is one of the reasons why I could not get into this story. The atmosphere is bleak, the story is grim, the people are grim, everything is so grim. No wonder this would fall short at the box office. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that almost everyone thinks will never be on the list of the ten best films of Paul Newman, including myself. <br /> <br /> This is the future of man, which annoy.
