"Congo" is based on the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton, which I think lacked the usual charm of Crichton, the intelligent characters and the punch. Well, I'm sorry to say, but the same thing happens with the movie. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot: <br /> <br /> Greed is bad, warns this simple story of morality. A megalomaniac C.E.O. (Joe Don Baker) sends his son to the dangerous African Congo in a search for a diamond source large enough and pure enough to function as a powerful transmitter of laser communications (or is it a laser weapon?). When contact with his son and the team is lost, his daughter-in-law (Laura Linney), a former CIA agent and a computer fan, is sent after them. In her search, she is accompanied by gadgets and some eccentric characters (including a mercenary (Ernie Hudson), a researcher with a talking gorilla (Dylan Walsh), and a crazy Indiana-Jones guy who searches for the Mines of King Solomon (Tim Curry After some narrow escapes of surface-to-air missiles and some African wildlife, everyone discovers that what we love most often turns out to be the source of our fall. <br /> <br /> The actors In this film, We had talent, Dylan Walsh acts like a pathetic crybaby, especially at the end, Ernie Hudson is not convincing (is not it surprising that he has been a star of TV movies?) and Laura Linney is nothing special. talented actors in this film had very small roles: Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry, an always pleasant actor (although sometimes he marked himself for life by constantly remembering his days in "The image of horror" ". <br /> <br /> This movie also had some other problems, including the dire direction style, cheesy dialogue and a simply boring plot, which was completely shattered compared to Crichton's novel. <br /> <br /> Even the effects of Stan Winston's creature could not prevent this movie from being a disaster. I am deeply disappointed with this movie; There was not even a quality of countryside to be redeemed. It was simply horrible, corny, boring and ridiculous, and proves to be one of Crichton's worst book-to-film productions. <br /> <br /> 2/5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
