This film had an excellent premise and could have been a fascinating look at racism, attitudes towards women at work and relationships between men and women in England at the beginning of the last century. However, it simply became a soppy love story. But what was worse, is that the love story was totally incredible. The performance was mostly poor, the direction was confusing, but above all the script and the story did not exist. The only thing I liked about the movie was how dark it must have been before the electric lighting. I really have an idea of ​​how little light a candle emits.
