Worshiped by fans for his unusually charming creativity and Hollywood for his softball, easy-to-use movie making techniques, Tim Burton tipped the scales too much in favor of the formula with his new annoyance from a movie legend, Sleepy Hollow. Following the search for Ichabod Crane ?? played by Johnny Depp, who offers the only bright spot of this sad movie? To the depths of the mystery surrounding the seemingly random and horrifying murders of a people by a legendary headless horseman, the story unfolds as if it were trying to be disgustingly predictable. Conceived as a children's story, the character's introduction is mixed with exciting, unattractive chase scenes that, with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives, produce as much fear and emotion as The Nightmare Before Christmas. <br /> <Br /> Mix in an endless pile of old trees to create a great, big-eyed blonde love (Christina Reechi) and Burton has a movie that takes the legendary legend of Sleepy Hollow and managed to do it. Like a Disney movie without charm or charm. The dialogue was choppy and ridiculous, the severed heads were plentiful, and there were enough revealing monologues of the plot to embarrass people like James Bond. Even with the backing of Emmanuel Lubezki, the most coveted director of photography in Hollywood today, Depp's wonderful performance and Burton's astounding name recognition, Sleepy Hollow is nothing to lose the head.
