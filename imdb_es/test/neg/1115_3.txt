I saw Wicked Little Things as part of "8 Films To Die For" by Horrorfest, and this was the only movie that disappointed me. Namely, a mother, her little daughter and her teenage daughter are settled in an abandoned house in the mountains of Pennsylvania. However, every night, the vengeful spirits of children killed in a coal mine run and kill anyone they find. <br /> <br /> I suppose the director hoped that the spectators would reject that the children would be capable of committing murders. and eating human flesh (of which there are abundant close-ups, like a good homage to George Romero) because the film simply does not scare the contrary. In short, there are too many pictures of the establishment of the evil children who run to their next murder site. If someone is going to get it in the barn, there will be a photo of the children ARRIVING at the barn (oh, the suspense) and then they will move to kill. <br /> <br /> Now that I think about it, why? Do children suddenly walk SO SLOWLY when they corner their prey? And it is not that I have experience in this, but I believe that a shotgun blast will send a child A LOT MORE THAN THIS CONGRATULATION ...? It also does not help that the mother is one of the worst parents I've seen in any movie. "The lock on the front door is broken"? You have an EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER at WOODS with BEARS and MOUNTAIN LIONS! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ARRIBA, MORON !!! Also, mom and her older daughter seem to be very close in terms of age, even for a teenage pregnancy, and there is a pretty incredible death that involves stalking someone who tries to push a car out of the mud with his butt. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 because I tried it. Like a splash film is not bad. But for good scars, go elsewhere.
