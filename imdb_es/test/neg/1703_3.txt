MacBeth, I have always thought, is the most accessible play of Shakespeare's "The Great Period." Compact, focused, with a lot of violence, it should have been the work most open to screen adaptations. However, I am not aware of a really good version of the story: the best effort is the vigorous version of Orson Welles. To the list of MacBotches we must add the effort of Connery / Baxendale. <br /> <br /> (It seems that it was not a 'film adaptation' at all, but a television version that received a theatrical release, published by Romeo de Luhrman + Hamlet by Juliet and Branagh.) That might explain some of its it fails, but it does not justify it.) <br /> <br /> It starts well, with an energetic battle sequence with pleasantly spooky witches. The poor Gray Malkin and Paddock are separated from the initial scene, but they are not alone for long. In quick order, they are joined by the bloody Sargent and his account of the battle, the betrayal of the Thane of Cawdor, the unfortunate master of the Tiger, even the meeting of MacBeth with Duncan when he invests as an agent of Cawdor. All these had virtues that begged, like angels, trumpet, tongue against the dark condemnation of their expulsion, but they are expelled. These are not the only cuts, either. This is MacBeth in a hurry. <br /> <br /> From the initial battle, we jump right into MacBeth's encounter with the witches, which is well done. Brian Blessed, curiously, directed the witch sequences, and has a lot of fun with special effects as MacBeth and Banquo are told their fate. Jason Connery as MacBeth is clumsy, obviously not sure what to do with the verse. Graham MacTavish as Banquo, on the other hand, is capable, making his lines natural and easy. Within minutes of Connery's murmurs, the viewer feels the need to see the inverted roles and MacTavish in the title role. No wonder MacBeth felt he needed to kill him. <br /> <br /> These first minutes mark the highlight of the film. From there we moved to Helen Baxendale receiving news from her husband. She is as lost as Connery, and denied the beard that he can hide behind. His invocation of the evil of "Unsex me here" is shameful, not unsettling. There are some reasonably intelligent touches: "We'll talk more" about MacBeth is not a sign of his hesitation in the face of his wife's evil ambition, but his attempt to silence her as he tosses her onto the bed. <br /> <br /> The performance of the cables is the biggest disappointment. Connery's method is to stare at the screen, while he mutters his monologues through the voiceover. Baxendale looks pinched and neurotic. An attempt to do something interesting with "Is this a dagger" (the fantastic dagger is a shadow projected by a cross on an altar) is deflated due to the mis-distribution and the careless direction of Connery, which spoils the production at all times. We accompany Lady MacBeth to the homicide chamber, where she gets to stab Duncan, but the effect is comical, not dramatic. <br /> <br /> Big scenes are produced: Banquo appears at the party. incomprehensible through attempts to mix the subjective representation of MacBeth's illusion with what those around him see or do not see. The second encounter with the witches is even less coherent, and the prophetic visions are confused. Synchronization seems to be a problem here: Banquoo's banquet is the central point of the work, but the film moves quickly towards its conclusion, which gives it a sense of imbalance and there is no room for the intricacies of the enigmas in which MacBeth is found to be appreciated, or to make his descent into madness convincing. Another crucial cut is the scene in which Malcolm tries MacDuff, and MacDuff finds out about the murder of his family. This takes revenge on most of his emotional strength and character for much of the time on screen. He is a virtual stranger when he appears to kill MacBeth. <br /> <br /> A point to try. The Bank of MacTavish wins another. The first minutes harvest another. But that's it. From then on it's sound and fury, blah, blah, blah.
