Oh, man, this movie was very bad. Bad appearance, horrible story ... the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie. <br /> <br /> Yeah, sure it's supposed to be a comedy and almost everything tells me that this movie was supposed to be the real deal. The movie certainly does not start off as a comedy, but rather as an adventure movie with funny elements. Especially it can be said that they were serious with this for the performance, which was in a serious and not funny, with the exception of a couple of over-the-top sequences obviously. It seemed to me that at first they tried to make a real and serious adventure science movie, maybe even a franchise, but soon they began to notice how bad everything was and simply decided to insert a more and deliberately exaggerated comic sequence, to make the film looks more like a comedy and prevents it from becoming a completely disastrous disaster. <br /> <br /> The movie is a strange attempt to mix pirate adventures with a serious science fiction action. The film was obviously inspired by the films of "Star Wars" and its success. The film is not even so ashamed to copy complete sequences and even the way the story progresses, the scenarios, the characters and the robots show similarities. They tried to hide this by introducing some phishing sequences, but I do not fall. So the film is not even original on its own, despite its original concept. You can say that this movie is "Spaceballs" of a poor man, without even being really a parody. <br /> <br /> The movie is looking bad, with some video game special effects (in some sequences even literally), horrible looking costumes (mail shield and swords in outer space?). The sound is sometimes even laughable. It seems that they recorded some sequences without sound and then forgot to add all the required sounds later in the post-production again. The mixture is also very bad. They tried to hide this by reducing the sound to a minimum and fine tuning Bruce Broughton's musical score. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the movie is so busy trying to make the movie look funny that it's totally fun. He forgets to tell the story. It makes the story of the film seem extremely messy and poorly written, with a main plot almost undeveloped. It also does not help to make the film really flow. Many things are not explained and some are even abandoned after a while. The film begins as a 'pirate' movie, which is constantly looking for and stealing water, as it is scarce and there is only one planet in the entire galaxy left with water (yes, of course!). However, this plot is abandoned soon, especially in the middle part of the film, in which the film seems to become totally different, with different motivations. It is like a strange and bad sequence, silly after the other, without making a click. It also keeps the characters too shallow and uninteresting to worry about. <br /> <br /> It's sad to see that actors like John Carradine, Anjelica Huston and a still young and unknown Ron Perlman joined this disastrous movie. <Br /> <br /> OK I admit that I liked some of the moments, especially because the ending when they went through the Time Warp was original and fun, but in reality, none of this was enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> I did not even like the movie in a camper way. <br /> <br /> 2/10
