Yes, this has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. It is absolutely tasteless, it has no style whatsoever, the story is so thin that you can watch TV through it, and the whole movie has so many holes that you could go through a tanker. <br /> <br /> Sure, I appreciate a good B movie as much as most white male homo sapiens. But this has to be the worst thing I've seen. In fact, it is so B that it lacks everything that makes a B movie interesting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is based on such lovely artifacts as characters that hit each other, various bodily functions and complete lack of sanity for anything on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny. In fact, it's the opposite. I found it even boring at times due to its extreme predictability. <br /> <br /> I do not find anything good to say about this movie. It was a waste of time to look at it, and I hope others do not make the same mistake. If you also pay for it, you should do a serious physical exam.
