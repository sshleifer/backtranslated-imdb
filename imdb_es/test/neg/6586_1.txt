"The Polar Express" was a horrible movie. What makes this film worse is the hypocrisy of presenting itself as an innocent story, sweet and harmless to children about the "true" meaning of Christmas. I never read Chris van Allsburg's book on what was inspired, but the most disappointing is that it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, the same one who did the great "Who cheated on Roger Rabbit?", An excellent film in which he shows that The animation could be appreciated for children and adults alike, while in this film it seems that he was a victim of his own ambition and gives too much importance to create an impressive level of detail that an interesting story. I regret to say this, but "The Polar Express" has as much artistic level as an advertising campaign of a video game or a toy. Everything in this film seems to be so inanimate: the characters may seem human, but they have nothing of life in them, and they have a malicious touch in their eyes. <br /> <br /> But the worst ... is the "message" in this movie. You could see it in some parts of the movie and, believe me, it was vile. Take, for example, a scene where a child refuses to enter the Polar Express. Notice that the character who looks like Tom Hanks makes a gesture that says "you're stupid for not accepting my offering." Second, when the girl says that the toys are so "warm" and things like that. The whole damn movie in which the children are still talking about how big the gifts Santa would give them. There is even a song about gifts! The vagabond is an irrelevant and weak character. And, in the last scene, the character seems to "discover" the true meaning of Christmas: and what would it be? What you think ? gifts ! Many Christmas movies are close to saying something like that, but "The Polar Express" is an ode to materialism and greed. Seriously, I refuse to call it a "children's movie," because if it's what the children would learn, I do not want to think what our future would be like.
