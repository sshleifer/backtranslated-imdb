Both for JUDGE AND JURY, which lives up to its meaningless title. What good is there? The lighting is terribly foggy! Another horror movie that you ask? Well, that's perfectly explainable. David Keith really does quite well disguising clowns, cooks and other scams while he is the killer who escaped death row. But in general, despite some new twists, it is reasonably stupid. Unapix has been releasing some ridiculous productions recently, and this only means a lot. We, the jury, consider this film guilty because of its indecent exposure to many of us who are sitting in the belief that it is a total loss of our time.
