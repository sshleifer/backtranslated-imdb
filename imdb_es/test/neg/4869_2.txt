This movie is bad. It is full of dazzling plot holes, characters that are governed by stupidity, bad acting and, above all, a bad script that has been done before in many, many films, only better. I'm sorry for Donald Sutherland, I just hope he had to do this movie instead of wanting to do it! I miss him.
