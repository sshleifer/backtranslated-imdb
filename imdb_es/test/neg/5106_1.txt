When I first read about "berlin am meer" I did not expect much. But I thought with the right people, the right places, the right music and fashion that you could at least make a trivial movie about modern Berlin that everyone seems to be talking about. but eissler failed, it's ridiculously unreliable. it is a complete misrepresentation of what is happening in the so-called Berlin scene. Of course, it's not just about hippness, but you should expect more from a movie that is being sold as "the ultimate Berlin movie." <br /> <br /> and, apart from everything related to credibility, it really is a bad movie. Mediocre performance and a pretty boring plot. Interestingly, some of the actors have shown in other films that they are actually quite talented. so they really should be bad management skills. <br /> <br /> Do not bother to see "berlin am meer" unless you are 17 years old, come from a small town in western Germany and want to move to the big city after you finish school. then you may find it really nice and totally cool.
