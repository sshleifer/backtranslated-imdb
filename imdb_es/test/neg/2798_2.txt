Dark Harvest is about a group of friends who go to a farm (belongs to one of the relatives of friends or something) for a break. But there are murderous scarecrows lurking there (there was also something about a curse but I forgot what it was about). <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is horrible, I do not know what the director is. I was thinking when I was casting actors and actresses. The script is the same story as the "horrible" performance (this statement is very obvious, but ...) if there was a better performance and a better script, this could have turned out to be "good". <br /> <br /> The management stank too, I see no potential in the future of this type. After all these negative aspects, this movie still maintains a "fun" factor that raises it to two. The last advantage is that they do not use CGI! My general opinion about this film is that it is bad, very bad, but so bad that it is "fun", so it gets a 2/10
