The big one (and we mean a big size) the evil Sebastian Cabot is trying to get the farmers out of the land from their land to get the oil rights. When Sterling Haden's pop is killed, how will Haden end up with TERROR IN A Texas CITY, armed only with a harpoon? <br /> <br /> First of all, this is not a B-western. There are no singing cowboys, no reckless stunts, no interesting action sequences. It's just an independent film, you know, those that use unimportant actors to say "important things" and cover the general lack of budget of events with interesting camera angles. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this film, to avoid compromises (one expects) that would cause the elimination of Trumbo's important statements about justice in the United States, and the rather unhealthy relationship between the head of the Minions and their daughter, IS a really low budget. The main problem it causes is that the acting is really bad. Sterling Haden is decent enough in tough roles, but he's the last guy you want a sensitive Swedish sailor to touch to find his fortune in the West. Sebastian Cabot tries to make a Sydney Greenstreet like (very) bloated plutocrat. It's not a bad idea, but Cabot does not have the skills to act. The guy who plays the contracted weapon with the missing arm and soul (Johnny Crale) has the best role in the movie. He does not do anything with that. <br /> <br /> Third, the script really is not all that. Trumbo investigates that the immigrant is not going to receive a just shake from the sheriff in a corrupt city, and people, when they are against real oppression, tend to retreat. This is a rather old-fashioned movie message from 1958: noon, the bad day at Black Rock, Devil's Doorway, are all Westerners dealing with the evils of Western society with a view to the ills of the 50 United States. Trumbo, in '59, certainly had all the personal reasons to agree with those feelings, but he is not doing anything new or interesting with them. <br /> <br /> So, given all the negative aspects, why does this movie put on a 4? Especially because there are interesting quirks throughout the film. (The relationship between Crale and his girl is, eh, fascinating.) And Trumbo, although he is a mediocre writer when pursuing his political affectations, is very good at creating interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. Just when one is ready to faint over the boredom of the Indy movie, there will be an exchange of dialogues or a simple extravaganza that will make one realize that the guy who wrote the script was not just a hack. Like Trumbo or Westerns, do not miss it. Otherwise, try it. You may like it more than me.
