Just read the cast list and the credits to salivate before this DAVID COPPERFIELD, but, ay!, Ay! The fact that both talent and director and actor of great importance could have turned one of the richest stories of literature into such a monumental BORE, is totally beyond my reach. It is nice to see with a beautiful picture, particularly the Yarmouth sequences, but, ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ No need to continue! Pass it on and check out Selznick or the wonderful BBC miniseries of the 80s.
