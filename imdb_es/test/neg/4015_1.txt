I saw the episode about living with minimum wage. It arrived until the appearance of Oprah Winfrey for that episode. It's bad enough that people have difficulty getting to the weekend to week. Then having this hypocrite exploiting the problem. I did not appreciate the constant complaint of him or his partner. Queston is how anyone has the power to pay their medical bills from the emergency room. sure it shows that the bill is high, but that he paid the remaining balance (out of pocket) after his "heartbreaking" experience. How many poor people have that kind of privilege after 30 days to pay their bills. Instead, they are starving and "stealing Peter to pay Paul." Complaining throughout the episode is not humiliating for him. The scene of the movie and the restaurant is frightening. Another privilege that has is that the poor do not have.
