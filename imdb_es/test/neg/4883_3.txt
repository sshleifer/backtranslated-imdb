This movie is overrated, to say the least. It's not good as a comedy, and it's not good as a "serious" movie either. The pace is too heavy for the first, and there is too much slap for the second. The only laughs come from some of Bud Spencer's reaction shots when he is exasperated by his brother's behavior. The dubbing is excellent, but the full-screen framing is atrocious. (* 1/2)
