The sequel to Slasher (the fourth film by SLUMBER PART MASSACRE) refers to a group of nubile cheerleaders stranded in a hut in the snow, being sacked by a mad assassin. Typical slasher elements for unconditional slasher fans, gore, wonderfully gratuitous female nudity, no argument. Although it eventually wears out, even in its short duration. <br /> <br /> The original star Brinke Stevens makes a cameo, which only seems to be there for the fact of including it in the film.
