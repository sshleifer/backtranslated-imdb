If you have not read Tolkien's masterpiece; Get ready for the best cinematic experience! If you have ... After reading the books several times, for many years, I have come to love the characters and the story and I feel I know it intimately. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the character gallery. So, for me, the movie was a disappointment. Why? Dictate the appearance of the characters (inevitably), change the events, eliminate the important plot, eliminate the not so important plot. The big chunks of what makes Lord of the rings is what it is, are simply ignored. Even the special effects of 2001 can not do justice to Tolkien's imagination (and to you). Peter Jackson has made an honest attempt at the impossible, and I do not think anyone else would have done better! But the fact is that I regret having seen the movie. The next time you read The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson's limited vision will jump forward, not mine.
