Combine a good casting, bad writing, a good orchestral score, a bad dialogue and a good idea of ​​history with a lot of potential, but you never realize that you have Slipstream. <br /> <br /> I just bought the movie for a dollar, it's worth it, but not much more. <br /> <br /> It's good to see Mark Hamill acting again. <br /> <br /> There should be a decent sequel to remedy the damage of the original. Or at least, give him the proper attention he should have received in the first place. <br /> <br /> Berstein's score demanded his attention from the initial credits, however, the long shots of the skid planes and the even longer revelation of interesting plot points silenced his attention. <br /> <br /> It's very easy to shoot a movie like this, after all, it's from the producer of STARWARS and the director of TRON and a tremendous cast, but it is what it is. And that is not much. <br /> <br /> Favorite line: "We'll make it, ha ha! ... (BOOM!)"
