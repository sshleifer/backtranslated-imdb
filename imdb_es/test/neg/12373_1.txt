This is a really terrible science fiction / horror film from 1957. In fact, even though Ed Wood, Jr. and his terrible films get a lot of publicity, this turkey is as bad as Wood's worst. Now the acting is a bit better than you would find in Wood's epics (like PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER), but the special effects were significantly worse than Wood's! However, fans of bad movies will be happy to know that it is so bad that it is still an excellent visualization. Like a Wood movie, it's great to see this crap-fest and laugh with your friends. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a scientist who flies making tests on his plane. However, out of nowhere, a UFO vanishes and your report of this through the radio causes a panic in the Air Force. However, later, they realized that the UFO did not appear on the radio and they think the scientist is crazy! But, shortly after these planes begin to disappear completely, they realize that there must be something in their sight. <br /> <br /> So far, the movie is not great, but it's visible. However, by the time the horrible flying monster appears, you know you are watching a turkey. First, through the horrible use of archival films and shitty models, planes are still changing mid-flight. Some may not mind this, but with aircraft lovers like me, seeing an F-80 turn into an F-86 on an F-102 made me go crazy, especially since airplanes do not look alike. Second, through "smart" cinematography, all you really see of the monster is a fluffball during the middle of the movie! This is frustrating and you hope that when you finally see it clearly, it's worth the wait. Well, there is not so much luck! The "monster" looks less realistic or frightening than the duck of Groucho's "You bet your life" TV show! In fact, it is significantly less realistic than any of the giant Japanese monsters! In fact, Big Bird from "Sesame Street" is even a little more scary and realistic. It is simply terrible in every way and could be the dumbest movie monster in history, just as bad (or worse) as the monsters of ROBOT MONSTER or TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE! The conclusion is that this is an absolutely terrible movie that sensible people will not like. Bad movie fans like me (who are a crazy group) will probably love it! Everyone else ... be afraid, ... be very afraid. <br /> <br /> For your information, you may notice that some clips of this movie are from other science fiction movies !! I am sure that the Washington Monument scene was stolen from EARTH VS. THE FLIGHT TASTERS, but I also saw a couple of other scenes that I swear are from other movies. What a hacking job!
