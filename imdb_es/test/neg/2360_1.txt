Absolutely useless ... having been there, done that with the subject that I have to say, this captures the atmosphere of clubbing in absolute respect. It is possible that he did it if the characters had not only been spokesmen for an incredibly nefarious and unrealistic nonsense. So many criminal scenes that could embarrass The Office (it's not a compliment to this movie). It may also have helped to have a certain appearance of a story, a point, a message, a comment, anything. Seriously, Kevin and Perry Go Large had more to say on the subject than this movie (a term widely used in this case). There should be fewer numbers reserved for movies like this one. -10 (extra turd)
