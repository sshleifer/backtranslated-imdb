This movie has possibly the worst title for a short puppet ever dreamed. Something appropriate, given the actual content of fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> I can do without any of the "Shemp A.D." But I'll admit that I have some LOL moments from the two-man comedy offered by Moe and Larry in some of the new images (and congratulations to those guys for trying to give it their all, considering the position they were forced to even make these dogs ). <br /> <br /> Another bright spot of this and the latest AD disaster "Commotion on the Ocean" is the decided lack of screen time for Joe Palma and the back of his head. No attempt at him talking or waving his arms like a chicken (see "Interesting things") may be worth an additional rating point. <br /> <br /> 2/10
