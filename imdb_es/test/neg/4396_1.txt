This has to be one of the biggest mistakes ever made ... the script was good and could have ended much better. The actors should have played better and maybe then I would have given this movie a slightly better note. maybe Hollywood should remake this movie with some better actors and better director. I'm sorry for the disappointment, but the movie is bad. <br /> <br /> If I had to see her again it would be like torture. I do not want to spoil everyone's opinion with mine, so ... My advice is to watch the movie first ... see if you like it and then vote (do not vote before you see it!) And, by the way ... Have fun watching it! Do not just look, look at it until the end :)))))))))!
