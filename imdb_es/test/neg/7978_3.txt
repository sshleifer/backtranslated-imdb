Geesh, never, never, never thought I would write the four previous words. But, in reality, she is the highlight of this little movie. <br /> <br /> When the film was packaged when I rented it, it is supposedly a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but does not have her medicine, which keeps her stable. It sounded like a nice concept. For years, all we saw of Spelling was like Donna Martin in 90210 and an endless parade of boring and lifeless TV movies. It seemed like an opportunity for her to stretch a little, and considering that with her success on television and her rich dad, I could not have any financial reason to make this movie, I realized that she took the role because this must be very low. budget gem. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the part of Spelling is small, and the part of the kidnapping victim with mental imbalance is just one of several stories. When it is not on the screen, the film creeps so badly that I could have sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes that appeared on the tape. This would have worked much better if the plot of Spelling had dominated, and had become a romantic comedy with her and Phil, the less irritating kidnapper.
