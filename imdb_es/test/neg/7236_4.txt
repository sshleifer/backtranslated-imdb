This is the sequel to Octopus. <br /> <br /> Pff ... OK. Lots of footage, but pretty good. I'm surprised they actually had a giant octopus robot that did not really look that bad! In fact, I was quite surprised. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was just fun. He never explained how the octopus became so big, and it is not linked to the first anyway. But it was still fun. <br /> <br /> The end, my friend and I laugh. Basically, after flying the octopus once, the two main characters launch a bomb, and on the screen appear five explosions, most of the images on file! We joked that they went to the dollar store and bought a toy of 'five missiles in one'! Believe me, you have to see it to believe! In general, just stupid fun. It is worth giving an opportunity, buy if it is cheap.
