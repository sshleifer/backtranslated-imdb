I can not remember a more trivial, numbing and superficial movie, in other words, a movie of the worst type of girls. How can someone watch this movie and recommend it to others? Only if they do not like to admit they made a mistake. It seems to summarize the worst of female aspirations. There is no real substance for everything happy and superficial. Yes, that will please the masses. Well, not this member of the masses. What a trivial load of nonsense. I wanted to leave the cinema 5 minutes after the start. And to think that I paid Â£ 7 to see this! However, I think this represents the fall of cinema as in most media these days. So I like a little reality in my musicals that call me sad or what?
