This is a cheap biography of a star of black and white juggler shows, one Dixie Boy Johnson. If this person ever really existed, I do not know, but considering the cast enumerates certain "Lee Lasses White" and Roscoe Karns interpreting that character as well, I assume that the man did exist and that this is a target (sorry the play on words ) version of his career. The plot, as it is, follows Dixie Boy from the peak of his career to depression at the time of his wife's death during childbirth, his abandonment of the child to his friends and his return to sixteen years of age. her daughter and her stage debut for reconciliation. Another forgotten man, Benny Fields, plays Dixie Boy. The man has a lovely baritone voice but he has no talent for acting and it is a bulky knot on the screen. Gladys George valiantly does everything possible to animate the works in vain. Judy Clark makes the best personification of Betty Hutton that I have seen, although I think she believed that she was being herself. The score replete with many musical numbers for its short execution time of 70 minutes earned a deserved Oscar nominee. Worth a look.
