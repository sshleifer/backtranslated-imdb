Think of a version of "Heathers" of extremely low income and you will have "Pep Squad". That sums up the movie in a few words. However, I must give credit where it is due. The movie has a nice visual appeal. I liked the cinematography, I liked the wild colors, I liked the costume designs. But without a good performance, a movie has no redeeming value. I prefer to watch a movie with little visual appeal, with good actors and a sharp dialogue (that is, "The Brothers McMullen" or any Edward Burns movie). The actors recite their dialogue in monotonous or scream as if they were in a bad soap opera. That's why I do not speak badly of most of the actors in the mainstream. Let's face it, most of the actors that are from the mainstream are the mainstream for a reason. If they are not "big" actors, at least they are competent. People speak ill of Leo DiCaprio, but when was the last time he saw a movie in which he recites the dialogue as if he were reading it from the page? It's a shame, because the director seems to know what he does when it comes to my en scene (sp). At the same time, I can not totally praise Steve Balderson (the director). He wrote the script, which contains a horrible dialogue. It could also be a bit racist, since there is a black director in the film, who lives in the culmination of African-American stereotypes.
