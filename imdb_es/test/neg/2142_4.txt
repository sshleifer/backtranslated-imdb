If I had to rate this movie based solely on acting / script / production, etc., I would give it a star. All these elements are terrible. I can partially forgive this, in light of the $ 250 budget of the movie. The film contains many entertaining scenes, especially those of the variety without funny intent. Some of these include: a 14-year-old boy stealing and driving a bus, teenage hooligans (one of whom wears a Joy Division shirt) scared of harassing the protagonists of the movie by a woman brandishing a gun obviously false, and an encounter with the skull of a plastic bull in the Arizona desert. <br /> <br /> I would have given it 5 stars just for the value of entertainment if it were not for the presence of that morally pontificating and terribly pontificating grandmother. I had to dock a star just for her. Who the * bleep * makes a wedding cake with black frosting, anyway?
