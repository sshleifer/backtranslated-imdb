Of all the directors who have sat behind a camera, Wellman could break his heart faster than anyone else. Even Ford. But this is one of its worst. Even he seemed to know, probably because of his yeyune treatment, not much above Bonanza or Big Valley. <br /> <br /> However, there is a moment, typical Wellman that comes out of nowhere to tear you apart, the death of Gable's Indian wife. She has gone to give some water to her baby and WHAM dies with an arrow instantly. Without warning Nothing <br /> <br /> One of the most shocking, without preparation for the deaths in all the cinema. Especially after having spent an entire hour of love for the lady in what seemed to be a sappy old man. Of course, the treatment of her afterwards is loaded with Wellman's total indifference, it seems, to the movie. Even so, it is a reminder of the power he has always had at his best.
