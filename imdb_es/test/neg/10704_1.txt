I do not think this can legally qualify as "movie". The plot was so fragile, the dialogue so superficial and the lines so terrible that I could not believe that someone actually wrote the lines, said: "Holy! This is a masterpiece" and then threw it to a producer. I, for one, am still stupefied and will always remember this film as the mark of the degeneration of intelligence in the United States: that, and "Crossroads", of course.
