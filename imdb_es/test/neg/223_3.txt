At the heart of almost every major crime thriller is a well-planned and methodically planned super crime, which 9 times out of 10 is committed by a group of gray-haired moral destitute for whom life is not. fair, for whom returning to man is, well, something worthy of encouragement. The screenplay by James V. Simpson, scriptwriter for the first time, for Armored, makes this half good. He made sure that we have nothing but sympathy for the recently orphaned Iraq war veteran, Ty Hackett (Stomp the Yard Columbus Short), who is about to have his house taken to an evil bank ( brother, I've been there). And he gave Ty a good family friend in Mike (Matt Dillon) who is super friendly and gets him a job in the armored car company where he works with Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and a strange French guy (Jean Reno) ). These guys like to have fun and make jokes, but they're also serious about armored cars, so that means they carry guns and they're tough. <br /> <br /> After a short time, one theoretically looks at Armored, one could start thinking like I did, that maybe, just maybe, this is going to be a kind of great, ironic film and with some characterizations in the nose that move the story along its natural course, increasing the personal bets of all those involved with the hope of unveiling a very, very intelligent plan with many potential moments of "holy saints". I mean, only the music is a heist movie textbook: gritty and hard working overtime, since we're dealing with the close-ups of the characters that say things like "Actually, I do" and "Are you crazy? "For about 45 minutes, the film had a serious genre film potential. <br /> <br /> Then things really start to stink. These guys, these idiots, do not have a plan. There is not a scene "Ok, here's what we're going to do ...", neither planes, nor explosives, nor black vans nor ski masks (in spite of its 'test run', as you can see in a trailer ). No, these guys are going to steal $ 42 million dollars from their own trucks (which are only being tracked by the HORARIO contact through the radio, even though they are equipped with some 'GPS technology' of great importance and great offer ), and I'm not even going to sit down and discuss it. Hell, Mike just tells Ty about the plan the night before, which is completely ridiculous. But, of course, Ty has to think about his house, as long as Mike promises that "nobody will be hurt", he is on board. Guess what, though. Someone is hurt. Why? Because, in addition to driving the trucks to an abandoned factory to hide the money, they have no plan. That was it. That was how far things thought. So, naturally, things start to fall apart. These cats deserve everything they get for being so unprepared. <br /> <br /> This script, frankly, feels like the product of a bad improvisation game: "Armored car, stolen by its own guards ... GO!" Despite a decent average buildup that could having taken the film in a few interesting directions, the story falls apart completely, and very soon, NOTHING makes sense, it's not even remotely plausible. <br /> <br /> When the filmmakers do not have a great "hook" for their hold-up, their characters seem stupid and malicious. And when the characters are stupid and malicious, it is difficult for an audience to invest in them and their history. And when that happens, any suspense drains the bottom of the film, leaving a hollow shell laughable. <br /> <br /> Saltala. 3/10
