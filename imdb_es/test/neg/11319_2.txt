This is supposedly a story in which a GROWNMAN tells a story about his youth. However, you see things like personal computers, emails, faxes, etc., which are elements used at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. <br /> <br /> Then, when this guy is supposed to be telling this story, in 2020. Wow, I wonder how advanced we are then. What about telling us that? <br /> <br /> In addition, there are several legal problems that do not make sense either. In the scene of the courtroom, the story is inscribed in the usual situations of surprise evidence, which is inadmissible in any real court of justice in this country. In addition, the grandmother would have to miss at least seven years in most of the states before being officially declared dead. <br /> <br /> Congratulations Elmo Shropshire. Now you are officially a SELLOUT.
