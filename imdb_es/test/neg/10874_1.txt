Because that's what Hell Ride practically is. Larry Bishop and Tarantino celebrate with Weinstein's money with the promise of delivering a movie at some point. I'm in favor of fake boobage and alcohol as much as the next guy, but do we really need the movie? There really is nothing worse than second-hand leftovers overheated from an old trend. And I'm not even talking about the grindhouse cinema of the 70s, because Hell Ride does not have any of the sensations of the time to which he intends to pay tribute. No, this is elegant and brilliant through MTV Hollywood. The old trend I'm talking about is the peculiar kinetic world, consciously pseudo-hip, where Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. The three boys had at least talent and found success for a reason. Hell Ride is just a second-hand copy, capricious and uninspired, polished to the maximum when it should be rough, the "super-cold" aspect is forced and silly. <br /> <br /> There is no reason, for example, why a simple and absolutely insane story should be told in an intricate way, back and forth in time. It's just a post-Tarantino quirk. Nor is there any reason why the dialogues have to be so insensitive, the people who beat their gums while saying NOTHING: at least when Travolta talked about hamburgers with cheese in Pulp Fiction, he felt cool. The dialogues here are little more than pseudo-machista postures. Nor is there any reason why a rock 'n' roll guitar reverberates aimlessly throughout the film. Perhaps the lowest Hell Ride hit is when it tries to be almost existential. There is a hilarious scene of dream / illusion in the desert where the bishop eats peyote and sees colors. I was half expecting an old Indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdom. <br /> <br /> The only salvation of this abysmal turd is the pikeman and the monologue of Vinnie Jones about his wing tattoos (and maybe some of them). The exterior shots of the desert). A lot of boobage and hot girls with little clothes. That's something I can do behind, but a movie that they do not do. Everything else is just an empty shell, an imitation of other infinitely more talented imitators.
