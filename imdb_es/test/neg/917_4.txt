I am usually a fan of "artistic" and "foreign" films, but when I saw this, my reaction was "it should be called experimental because it does not make sense". The "action" is static, while at the same time bouncing from one location to another. There are not enough titles to clarify who is who and what their relationships are. Apparently, the main point was to show that in the face of murder, adultery and generally strange and dissolute behavior, the cure offered by the powers is to banish a totally innocent black man.
