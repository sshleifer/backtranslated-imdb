His embalmed gaze was totally inappropriate for the role. His face remained too white, his hair too combed, his clothes, etc. too clean (and well adjusted, especially the old hat and his father's coat in the scene where Inman comes home) for any sense of precision. One thing would be if the production had allowed all the other actors to stay clean and perfect too, but she was the only one who did not get dirty. There was never a spot on his powdered cheek. Should we believe that she was the only person in the Civil War with a bathtub and a mirror? She certainly looked like the only one who used them. Tweezers, too; I mean, what's with those eyebrows? It seemed absolutely bad! <br /> <br /> The love story was implausible. She just approached the boy because someone told him that he had said that he thought she was cute. Then, she approaches to make fun of him, then flirts with him a couple of times more, and suddenly this is a love on par with Odysseus and Penelope? Please. <br /> <br /> I should have known that I should not expect anything better from the man who brought us "The English Patient". My reaction to that was the same as Elaine's in Seinfeld: "He stunk."
