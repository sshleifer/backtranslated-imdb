A really terrible film, low budget, with a terrible performance, an intricate and absurd plot, a modest modification of the tales of vampires mixed with modern science. <br /> <br /> The result is a total disaster, meaningless for most parties, with very limited and cheap effects. It's not even fun, like several low-budget independent movies of this type. <br /> <br /> A waste of time
