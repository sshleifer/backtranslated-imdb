Well, it was not a complete waste. Armand was, as always, very good in the film. "Everything about the Turks and the Germans was strange because I remember seeing Bulgaria at the beginning of the film ... I did not bother to go back and review ... the subject Central "is about serial killings with all the gang warfare interwoven freely. I never saw a movie where the characters seemed Italian, they were supposed to be Turks, they took English (American accent and euphemisms) with German words. The climax was the most intriguing part and there are parts of it that still did not make sense to me. In any case, if you have nothing better to do, you can watch this movie.
