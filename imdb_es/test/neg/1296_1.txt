I was impressed by the horrible performance and script of this movie. All the characters seem immobilized by personal problems, like deer in the headlights. They entertain themselves in whining and mourn over their emotions when decisive action must be taken. I found myself screaming at the TV screen trying to wake them up to their situation and DO SOMETHING! The plot is implausible. Every time there is a key decision that a main character must make, one of the others has to pose all the problems with the obvious decision so as to make the decision more difficult: it is a proven melodramatic tactic and only wants to make you moan. Clearly, the importance of the decision is obvious: it is not necessary to treat the audience as idiots. In general, there is too much emotional melodrama throughout the film.
