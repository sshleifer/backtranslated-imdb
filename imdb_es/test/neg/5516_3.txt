This hardly compares with the space adventures of his time. Those who are Star Wars and Star Trek. And although I'm not a Star Trek fan, I recognize that this movie pales in comparison to the Trekkies series. In fact, it would put Back to the Future in a better light in terms of space and travel. <br /> <br /> The story is about a child who is captured by space raiders (pirates). In an obviously fake battle with no entertainment, the captured boy befriends the pirates and even helps them. And slowly, one by one, those assailants die. In the end, the boy returns home and the last remaining pirates escape seriously injured. <br /> <br /> The performance was not so good. But what is really obvious is the total lack of dialogue, effects and interesting stories. The way they got 80 minutes of this overcomes me. <br /> <br /> If you want to give it a try because it's about space, go ahead. But be careful. "RE"
