Just like CURSE OF THE KOMODO was for the creatures genre, CHEERLEADER MASSACRE by Jim Wynorski is a parody of slasher movies, like SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. A psychopath, who has escaped from his padded cell, (... he was sent to the insane asylum thanks to killing eleven people) is working in the mountainous countryside of Bobcat County attacking anyone in his reach. A truck full of cheerleaders, his teacher, two team hands and the driver are heading to a competition when their vehicle runs out of fuel while taking a supposed shortcut to avoid having to turn around. Luckily, the group finds a cabin later, but falls prey to an assassin who attacks each victim one by one. The county psychopath could not have killed a girl because she was in the cheerleader's locker room while he was somewhere else, which means that someone guilty is one of their own. Meanwhile, the county sheriff and his assistant seek the whereabouts of their psychopath, while trying to find the location of the missing cheerleader squad. <br /> <br /> Shot in a video, Wynorski does what he can with the limited The budget has to find smart ways to kill characters off the screen without the luxury of special effects properly effective. In other words, many melons were stabbed, the sound effect used to let us know that certain victims dragged into the darkness by a black gloved hand died savagely. Wynorski incorporates a scene from SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE with respect to the character of Brinke Stevens, Linda, who was pursued by a murderer with a simulacrum (... that murderer and Linda ended up dead, but I suppose Wynorski wanted to connect his film to that, although pretty bad) .. it was still nice to see her, even if it was a glorified cameo. Tamie Sheffield, like Mrs. Hendricks, the teacher of troubled students, has a long shower scene showering her naked body and her fake breasts. The girls who make up the cheerleaders are a bit unconvincing, because obviously they are in their twenties. Samantha Philips (... as a police officer who is attacked by the psychopath she is looking for) and Nikki Fritz (... a hiker who is a victim while running across a dangerous bridge) surprisingly do not have to undress. Wynorski reviews Bill Langlois Monroe (... as Sheriff Murdock) and Melissa Brasselle (... as a detective who assists Murdock in his case) contribute to the secondary plot of the search for John Colton's serial killer, McPherson. Quite interesting, McPherson's story serves as a McGuffan since, in truth, the flesh of the film is dedicated to the group of cheerleaders and their dangerous situation. I'm not sure if the slasher fans will embrace this movie because the murders take too long to explode and, when they finally enter the scene, the violence is not powerful enough or powerful enough to satisfy it.
