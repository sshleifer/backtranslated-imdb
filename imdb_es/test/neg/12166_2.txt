Ok, I really like King's things, but this is just terrible. Throughout the film, I'm waiting for the main character to do something deep with his new youth and power. I can tolerate the worst in movies, since anything is better than watching a movie cut with advertisements. But this takes the cake. I gave it a 2, and I would never recommend it to anyone.
