The Girl in Lovers Lane is a strange little low budget movie. On the surface, the film tells the story of a stout bum named Bix (Brett Halsey) who spends his time caring for a boy named Danny (Lowell Brown) and the girl, Carrie (Joyce Meadows), who Bix meets with whom to eat. Take care of him. Nothing too interesting happens (Bix goes out with Carrie, Bix takes Danny out of trouble, Carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) until 10 minutes into the movie when Carrie is murdered. His father blames Bix, takes him out of the jail cell and almost beats him to death. Now their roles are reversed and Danny has to save Bix. <br /> <br /> Until I read the reviews on IMDb, I thought maybe it was just me who was reading more about Bix and Danny's relationship than what was really there, but look now that I'm not alone. For me, it was quite obvious from the start that Bix and Danny had more than one relationship that you usually see in a 1959 film. The homosexual nature of their relationship, although never expressed openly, is still quite obvious. His life and rest arrangements, Bix's reaction to finding Danny in bed with a prostitute, Bix's inability to engage with Carrie, and that phone call at the end when Danny tells his parents he "takes home" to a friend, are some examples of the moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there is more to their relationship than what is initially seen by the naked eye, I am sure they exist, but I can not think of any of the films that I've seen the 50s screaming at homosexuals as loud as this one. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, I do not know any other way to put this? It's boring.As I wrote earlier, nothing happens at all. 90% of the execution time The characters are boring and the actors are not good enough to give The Girl in Lovers Lane a spark The only exception is Jack Elam His crazy Jesse is the only interesting enough character as p It's worth seeing. Elam had a spooky pat! But I guess The biggest problem I had with the movie was with the motivation and logic of the character. Carrie is kille D and Bix is ​​immediately blamed? What about the crazy Jesse who has been harassing Carrie probably all his life? Does anyone think about asking Jesse where he was that night? Has your father seen you bother Carrie in the restaurant, but never considers that Uncle Jesse could have something to do with the death of his daughter? There is not much logic there. And what about Jesse's confession? Danny grabs Jesse by the lapel and this is all it takes to force a confession from Jesse? A really hard guy, huh? Why would he confess so easily? And after he confesses, no one thinks to grab him? It's very nice for Jesse to just sit still and not run away. In any other reality, he would never have spilled his guts and run like a rabbit if he had been accused of murder. The fact that The Girl in Lovers Lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions by the characters is something I'm not willing to do. In general, I give The Girl in Lovers Lane a 4/10.
