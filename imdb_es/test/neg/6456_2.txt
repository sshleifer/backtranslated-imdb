There is something wonderful in a "revenge" movie. Everyone wakes up in the morning believing that he / she is the star of "the movie," and that anyone who interferes with their own personal agenda is somehow the enemy. Films of the plot of revenge work particularly well if a person has low self-esteem. Instead of counterattacking in the moment, the "hero" resorts to accumulated internal anxiety to perform a single act of power in an attempt to restore balance. Naturally, in the "real world" this kind of revenge seldom relieves tension because life is not a movie; After the revenge has been enacted, the actions taken have their own consequences. A good revenge movie helps people ignore this bitter pill. In movies, the final credits unfold and all responsibility is resolved. <br /> <br /> "Swimming With Sharks" is announced as a comedy, no doubt an act by the producers to discover how to sell this rarity. It's dark, but it's not dark comedy ("Company Of Men" and the works of Todd Solondz are much closer). Parts of the film are so brutal that they predate the current "torture-porn" genre with which everyone is so obsessed ("Saw", "Hostel"). There are some laughs. There's also laughter in "Saving Private Ryan," but it's not labeled as comedy. <br /> <br /> The intrinsic problem of this movie is that it has not won its case of revenge. Apparently, it is a young man who is mistreated by his boss and finally takes his boss as a hostage to "pay back" for all the abuse. The hero (appropriately named "Guy") is a "common man" so vague that we literally do not know anything about him ... what does he do with his free time? Do you have friends / family? How did you get where you are? What are your interests? (This becomes a motive to run through the movie, no doubt inspired by the film's own struggle ... "What do you want?", The response to which we are denied by a vague, cheating final) ? It is very difficult to take care of a character like that, even if he acted well (even Tom Hanks becomes an error in the incorrect roll, like "Punchline"). Kevin Spacey as boss, "Buddy", is supposed to be a monster, but he's too charismatic as an actor. The best laughs came when he abused his assistant: he seemed almost as surprised as the audience is probably in what Guy will endure. When Kevin's character is being tortured, the vision taken suddenly turns into empathy for him. Guy is suddenly filmed as an idle monster without rationality. At this point any message the author has had has been lost; there is no "hero" in this movie, ergo, there is no reason to worry at all. <br /> <br /> It is not an exaggeration to suppose that this story is based on the problematic career of the author in the film business. I worked for a similar boss and I can attest that it is not so crazy. At that time I had similar wish fulfillment fantasies and thought it was justified. I thought you could conquer the most beautiful woman in history (in reality, the ONLY woman - there seems to be about four people in the universe of this movie) just for being your avid and naive person, that enthusiasm won the praise and that a boss mistreated you because he was a bad person. Time and tide have revealed the truth that most "monsters" are really the demons of an individual's personal psyche and resentment is generally based on the self. As the movie points out, if Guy was so sad, he just had to leave. The film does not offer any outcome, however, "surprise" that ends. We still do not know anything about the protagonists, we can not even be sure that what they said will be based in fact and everyone can magically have their cake and eat it too. In short, this story had no more meaning than pointing out that (the shock!) The movie business can be quite brutal. <br /> <br /> There are many good movies that tell a solid and satisfying revenge Fantasies of style, both the variety of feeling good ("9-to5", "Working Girl", "The Devil Wears Prada") and no as much ("War Of The Roses", the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes"). This is not one of them. Despite a funny turn of Benicio Del Toro in the role of Emily Blunt of "Prada" and an interesting work by Spacey and Michelle Forbes, this is a frustrating, petty, confusing and a little boring creation. - the indulgence of a director who, as expected, "has already solved everything" for now ...
