After seeing the film version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel like I lost 100 minutes of my life. Although the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed to see how bad Nicolas Roeg portrayed the story. Despite the fact that he omitted many fragments of important information, the cast did not seem to fit into their roles and the whole movie seemed immensely emotionless. The book shows vivid landscapes and details that are completely ignored in the film. <br /> <br /> You would think that a director could fit 76 pages of a book into a movie of at least an hour and a half. The differences completely changed the story for me. For example, when the character of Kurtz's girlfriend is indifferent to the fact that Kurtz has died, he completely modifies the ending that the book gave him. Not to mention that the scenarios and scenarios used in the film were not as beautiful as they were described. Honestly, it feels as if Roeg is filming another story with Heart of Darkness references embedded in it. <br /> <br /> If you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to look like Joseph Conrad's story, you may find it good. Although I thought that the work of the camera was deficient and that the cast was not adequate, it is a captivating story anyway. However, if you are looking for a good cinematic version of the famous classic story, do not look for it in the Roeg movie.
