Tediously long dreary film waffle. I could not believe how bad this movie was. I observed it simply because of the many people who commented on this site. Was I watching the same movie? The whole episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in Garps' past affected his future (or someone else's) and nobody was affected by his past. I think it was Socrates who said about the plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect, then it should not be there. Obviously, the director did not know this rule and, therefore, he filled his "work" with one terrible scene after another. Even the plane that crashed into the house was unexpected, it was not a surprise, but it was unexpected! <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that at the time of this writing (December 1, 2002), although many people say it is one of their favorite movies, no one has bothered to add a memorable quote. The reason is that there simply is not any. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time watching this, look at a plank deformation instead.
