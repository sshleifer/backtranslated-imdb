One of the reviewers here wrote: "Good acting, good special effects, excellent location <br /> <br />. Even better ending." All I can say is "Ugh". This movie was painful to watch. Let me start by saying this: I am a Christian, considered very conservative by many people I know. So, what I am going to say is not biased by the "Christian content" of the film. I'm not going to hit him because he's a Christian. I'm going to give it a 2/10 because it's a horrible movie. Writing is bad, above all, too predicated, and much of the "preaching" is simply irrelevant to the story. It just does wrong to write scripts. If I agree with the screenwriter's beliefs <br /> <br /> it is irrelevant: make a good script that flows well, stays on track and is credible. The performance was amateur at best. But hey, when you throw amateurs, you get <br /> <br /> amateur performances. Dirk Been may have been on "Survivor", but that program requires <br /> <br /> Zero acting ability. Playing with your name and reputation to sell units is in poor taste. He does not know who can act and he will have a much better movie. The effects were HORRIBLE. The scene with the hail and the subsequent fall of the stars was embarrassing to see. And what was so good about the end? It did not make sense. Yes, I know what he was headed for <br /> <br /> Tim Chey, but he missed the mark big time. I bought this movie and expected much more depending on the reviews and the erroneous information <br /> <br /> on its website. And, although I expected more, I got what I always get when I watch "Christian" movies: a piece of low-budget, badly written ka-ka, of pathetic performance, poorly produced. Maybe someday, someone will finally catch up with an end-of-the-times movie that is as well written and as well-made as Gibson's "Passion ...". 2/10 stars.
