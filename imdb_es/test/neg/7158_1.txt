The theater and drama included in the film are fantastic, but the facts and the research are far from solid. In citing Dr. Bovon, where the documentary attempts to establish a connection with Maria Magdalena de Mariamene, Dr. Bovon clarifies that it should be used for literary purposes (ie, fables of that time) not for a historical figure. In fact, he states that he DOES NOT believe that Mariamene's ossuary in Talpiot is Mar√≠a Magdalena. In addition, he comments on his public letter, which was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary but rather to obtain information about Acts of Philip (a literary work in the fourth century). <br /> <br /> So, what? Here we have a director who took a clip for a fantasy of the Acts of Philip of the fourth century and used it specifically to support an ossuary inscription of the first century. A very sad stretch and Dr. Bovon calls the Jesus / Mary Magdalene connection as "science fiction", since this documentary must be correctly labeled.
