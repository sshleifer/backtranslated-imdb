I saw this movie that I really thought it had a promising start but then it just made me feel disappointed in the end. The problem that I think with this movie was that the director was trying to make this rare and original movie. There were too many flashbacks and too many bad "effects" that bothered me through the movie. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes, but they disappointed me in this movie, they could have done much better. This movie seemed promising at first, crawling in the middle and then disappointing in the end. The film could never surpass the genius of Stanley Kubrick when it comes to controversial issues, rarity and originality in the movies.
