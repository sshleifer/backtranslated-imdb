I will repeat: what a stupid scenario. <br /> <br /> Is there anything new inside? I do not know who wrote this. But I think this guy has seen all the Hollywood movies, children, families and many times created ... all the scenes and the images that you can see everywhere. Why do people make these movies? Children as an adult? Do you like gold money cars ... and are they positive? They are lucky ... and emotions, of course ... without being able to do it. or the young actors - wow :-). I like it when the camera focuses on their pretty faces? what the fuck ... there's a 90% better movie for kids than this one! This is not a creative or funny movie. This is simply nothing. <br /> <br /> D.
