Unfortunately, I went to this movie for entertainment reasons based on the limited information I had seen at Fandango. Since I am a fan of science fiction, the idea of ​​a UFO movie interested me. <br /> <br /> Instead, this film quickly revealed itself as an evangelical Christian propaganda film. Suitable for an audience of like-minded people, but very un-Christian, to exploit the mall scene and preach to a confident audience, especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions. What a shame! At least the Da Vinci Code did not stop his wild-eyed madness. <br /> <br /> So, this B-grade film production (and I'm being nice) will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs, probably shown to the youth groups on the afternoon of Wednesday and Sunday. But if you are A Christian of main line or non-Christian, will not feel comfortable.
