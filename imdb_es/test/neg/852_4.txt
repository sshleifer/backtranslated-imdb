This was a mix of a movie that started going nowhere, got lost along the way and suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character was FINALLY presented. There were so many ugly and chopped guys in this movie that I lost track of who was the owner and who the supervisors were. Although I have a theory about casting; all the bad guys were played by ugly actors (and an ugly actress) and all the good / victims were played by beautiful actors. In fact, the actors who played the last victims, the slaves, were beautiful as well as the innocent daughter of the priest, while the owner of the plantation, his minipulative lover and his supervisors were very hard on the eyes. On purpose? You make the call. <br /> <br /> I stayed there until the end and some others could also do it. If you only want to see the naked breasts, there are many of them here and if you have a slave / master fetish, you will love this movie. Otherwise, look at it once, throw up, shower and never talk about it with anyone.
