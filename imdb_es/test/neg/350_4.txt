It's exactly what the title tells you ... an island inhabited by fishermen. The shipwrecked doctor Claudio Cassinelli and the crew disembark on the island, either caught by fishermen or tied up to work for treasure huntsman Richard Johnson. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson, who believes he has found the lost city of Atlantis, has held hostage the dishonest scientist Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach as hostages so that the fishermen can discover a treasure under the sea. Cotten, of course, is a complete madman. Bach and Cassinelli have great chemistry. This madness was directed by Sergio Martino and is not, surprisingly, without merit. It is fast-paced, reasonably well-acted, and fishermen seem quite convincing (although it is unlikely that anyone can prove that these things DO NOT resemble real fishermen). There is an excellent musical score by Luciano Michelini.
