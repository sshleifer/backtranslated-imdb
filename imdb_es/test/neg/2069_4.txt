For those who expect the cover and outline of the story to indicate another entertaining Indian production of Bollywood, be careful: there are no numbers of musical dances or songs of production value to brighten up the atmosphere in this story quite tired of arranged marriages in the British Indian culture, with some variations introduced. As written by Roopesh Parekh, the script addresses issues worthy of discussion only to cover them with routine avoidance tactics. Harmage Singh Kalirai directs as a traffic cop, trying to keep disparate subplots together to the point of Keystone Cop tactics. <br /> <br /> Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical student who is gay and has a lover Jack (Peter Ash) and they live with Aunt Vanessa (Sally Bankes), obese, alcoholic and with little moral of Jack , and with Sally's chubby daughter, Hannah (Katy Clayton). The family of Patel from Delhi visits the family of Jimi, who takes his beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to look for a husband. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and his grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) decide that Simran is the girl of Jimi to get married and organize a commitment and a wedding according to Indian custom, without consulting Jimi. Jimi discovers the plot and is too intricate to disagree, a decision that infuriates Jack and infuriates Vanessa. Hannah tells Simran a 'little lie' (that she is Jimi's daughter) and the wedding is canceled. When Jimi's parents visit Jimi's house, they discover the drunk Vanessa, they are rejected by her, but finally they decide that for Jimi's happiness they will accept the fact that Vanessa has given them a "granddaughter" and they decide to use the preparations for marriage as a wedding. for Jimi and Vanessa. Jimi convinces the very reluctant Vanessa to accept the idea and, in a short time, Vanessa is dressed in a sari, ready for a wedding, and Jimi, terrified by what she is doing to please her parents, includes Jack as her best man. At the wedding, the truth comes to light and, to Jimi's surprise, his family adapts to Jimi's true self and the day is saved simply by being honest. <br /> <br /> The cast faces this silly nonsense fairly well and there are some good performances: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and play their roles well, although without any indication of a loving relationship (the director he seems terrified to show the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men); Sally Bankes provides most of Vanessa's laughs; the rest of the cast repeats the stereotyped roles they have played innumerable times in Indian films. This is not a bad movie, it has its moments, but it is too shallow and tired for us to worry about any of the characters.
