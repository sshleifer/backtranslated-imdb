I used to love the Muppets. The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan were good family movies, cleverly written and fun to watch. I never thought I would see the day they got on the Hollywood car, but here it is: Scooter as a caged rave dancer, Pepe making obscene and suggestive comments every five minutes: they are not your father's Muppets. Neither are Jim Henson's Muppets. <br /> <br /> This themed movie "It's A Wonderful Life" has its moments, but not enough to save it. I cringed as I watched this with my children. I still have hopes for your next movie, but this was certainly a disappointment.
