Every time I watch a movie like this, it makes my stomach sick. When I watch a movie I like to see what I see in everyday life. As the day progresses, I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos, etc. How do you project a movie and do not even think about the possibility of other ethnic groups passing you by? I'm sure they did not do it on purpose, but pay attention. I do not care if it takes place in Kansas or South Central. All I saw was a black chip. This was typical in the 80s. Hey! It's 2007, with all the rappers, singers and athletes who work as actors. The church of Thomas Haden could have paid more attention to its cast. Are not the actors supposed to be more liberal?
