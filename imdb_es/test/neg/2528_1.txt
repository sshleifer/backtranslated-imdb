Man, really? Did you read the book or did you watch this movie? Well, if you did, let me warn you, it's false. Mark Furhman has been looking for a job since losing his job with the LAPD. You remember it, do not you? He was the guy who was lying on the stand and gave the defense of OJ Simpson a foothold they were looking for. Well, he has written three books since then. I have read all three. No, I'm not a fan, they gave them to me. HOWEVER, I will tell you a similarity in the three, which greatly distort the importance of Mark Furhman. He blatantly exaggerates his stature in all three. In "Murder in Spokane," he pretends it had something to do with catching the killer, when it had nothing to do with it. In all the books, he takes great delight in curbing local enforcement efforts. Something like his efforts were exhausted in OJ's trial. In this movie, there are a lot of slow-motion shots of women who look at Furhman and who covet him. Many other shots have him in the spotlight, when in fact, I'm sure the only thing people thought at the time was "hey, is not that the racist that caused OJ to come out?" This was an interesting story from real life, but it was not a good movie about it.
