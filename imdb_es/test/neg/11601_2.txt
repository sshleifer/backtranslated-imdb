I only voted 2/10 mainly because Hitchcock agreed to direct it. He certainly had a free day with predictable story lines, stupid children characters who are desperately trying to be funny. There was a hygienic twee, sanitized, emasculated "scenes at a time when the Hollywood production code was in full force." The lax male characters in the movie who like "soap" characters never do a job I always get irritated when the food is never consumed by actors (an exception was in the food scene in "Tom Jones" (1963), although they consume copious amounts of drink, the actors must leave their mouths free for the next line! Carole Lombard certainly fit Hitchcock's idealized image of "cold blonde" a heroine, but what he always possessed to direct this screenplay without grace and without courage, he should have stuck to his thrillers. He has not looked good in the last 69 years, I could not wait for him to finish, since little by little he irritated me.
