From time to time I like a good horror movie, so I thought it would be a splash and gore movie. but it was a boring and boring movie, maybe because I saw a cut version, because there were only two things that splashed a bit, once where some cut someone's arm and someone shot an arm, but there where the only things. Wismaster, for example, had senes more genial than bad, it's more a boring edition than an evil one. and some actors were terrible.
