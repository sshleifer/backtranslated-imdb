Snake Island is one of those movies that, while you sit down and observe their incredible level of stupidity, makes you wish that the film camera was never invented. The real reason why Plan 9 From Outer Space will retain its honorable title of Worst Movie of All Time for a time is not so much for how bad it is. It's the fact that it's the most entertaining bad movie you'll ever see. Snake Island is the other kind of evil. Snake Island is so bad that it is unbearable. A stupid premise is combined with a script that was written by monkeys by touching one-key typewriters on transparencies that then overlapped to resemble dialogue and make the problems more obvious here. Filmed entirely in South Africa, the environments in which the film is developed are almost the only element that can be considered truly realized. Many shots involving snakes consist of close-ups so surreal in appearance that one begins to wonder if those snakes are CGI, puppets or real snakes that have been fed really hard drugs. <br /> <br /> William Katt stars, if you can call him that, like an author traveling to an island resort on what appears to be a river ferry. Along with him, there is a variety of very generic and ill-defined characters. It's a random screen script about who survives to the end, but Katt certainly seems to be considering firing his agent. The rest of the cast seems to be from the Home And Away acting school, where any contemplation of an unpleasant plot point is accompanied by gaping and throwing eyes in all directions. Foliar effects are often worse, with a memorable scene where a double-barreled shotgun sounds like the rather flat sound effects that used to accompany shots in games like BioForge. Meanwhile, snakes continually explode or jump at random. It would have been more accurate to call the movie Holocaust snake. <br /> <br /> Of course, no Z-grade horror or science fiction movie is complete these days without free scenes of nubile women in a state of nudity. As every woman in the cast, almost, takes off her clothes, the movie begins to become less Snake Island and more Snake Island orgy. But like all the worst batteries, all there really is in this case is a lot of configurations without a real payment. The sex scenes never happen, and the death of the characters is so flat, so uninteresting, that the whole movie becomes useless. Unless you consider seeing William Katt running through a muggy forest using a cricket team that does not fit well and crushing snakes in all directions with a cricket bat in return. For the record, I do not. I used to think that Anaconda was the worst movie ever made about predatory snakes. It was very, very bad. At least Anaconda had a snake that one could fear if he suspended disbelief for quite some time. Some of the snakes that are shown killing the human cast are no larger than the laces of some pairs of combat boots that I have worn. <br /> <br /> Therefore, until now we have the checklist for horror films that work well. The unrecognizable and lame cast is considered, as well as the deficient audio and visual effects. The dialogue is so unfortunate, so inopportune, that I have seen better writing and delivery during some of the school plays in which I have performed on many moons. Unfortunately, where Snake Island falters in this regard is the fatal area for all bad movies. In essence, he forgets to be so bad that it's fun. It's so bad that it stops being good after the initial credits and becomes painful in the second that the cast starts talking. Compared to William Katt's performance on Snake Island, Jon Voight's performance in Anaconda was as Oscar-worthy as Russell Crowe's in Gladiator. It's not that Voight or Katt are necessarily bad actors, but with material like this, it's hard to say a single word naturally. Listening to some of the lines here was like being a victim of a violent crime. One's mind tends to hide experience, mainly as a mechanism of self-defense. <br /> <br /> Because of the failure mentioned above to be entertainingly bad, I gave Snake Island two out of ten. My special score for movies that are so bad that they can not be good, but not enough to entertain. Everything is so boring or useless that one could be observing the test pattern. The correct way to spell "shit" is S-N-A-K-E-I-S-L-A-N-D.
