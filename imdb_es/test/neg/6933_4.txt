An O'Neill play of four and a half hours is reduced to just under two, and much of that execution time is spent on actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read the thoughts of their characters in voice-over. . It may work on stage, but it seems hilariously forced in this telenovela adaptation, which softens the misbehavior of its heroine and never explains why it has captivated so many men. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland, exaggeratedly ridiculous, are overcome by a naturalist Clark Gable: he is the only one who makes the frozen face technique work. It becomes even more fun when the son of Shearer's and Gable, a moppet, becomes enraged. There is also Frank Morgan's brother, Ralph, as an unsuccessful suitor, given to the soliloquization of "poor Charlie." Again and again, and a young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. By the time they appear, the voice-overs have been largely abandoned, and it sounds like a mature soap, with a sentimental melt that actually plays "Silver Threads Among the Gold" as background music. The direction of Robert Leonard is quite heavy and shows little facility to control the hyperactive actors. It's certainly entertaining, there's nothing like it, unless you count Groucho's satirical parody on "Animal Crackers" or an old Mad Magazine satire that portrayed Shirley Booth's comedy "Hazel" to "Strange Interlude." But it is not good.
