The executive producer of the film is none other than the messenger of peace through transcendental meditation, David Lynch, the father of the director. I wonder what the guru of David, His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, would have thought of this production. Hypocrisy here is as disgusting as the movie itself. It's a sure bet that Samuel L. Dieteman, a serial killer in Phoenix and a devotee of recreational violence, would have loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many would blame this film for its cinematic art; at that level it's pretty good. But on a moral level, it's the most daunting movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER COMING <br /> <br /> I guess what saddens me the most is nonsense. The Xers of the morally numb generation learn a trade and a bit of postmodern aesthetic theory in art school or film school and then get involved in the arts and entertainment industry; and here is the result: a film that wallows in human suffering, injustice and killing, largely witnessed by a nine-year-old girl who sees her entire family brutally murdered by a pair of recreational violence killers who, in the end, They ride at sunset. <br /> <br /> NO MORE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> For whom are films produced like this produced? Narurally, the sadists will worship this, why would not they? But who else As I pointed out before, here are some really good movie crafts, but good crafts can be applied to any subject. Why apply it to things like this? In addition, the film is very exciting, but that is not due to the gravity and rudeness of the violence; it is suspense because it is well directed and acted. I'm sure the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock could explain this much better than me. <br /> <br /> So, what has been presented to us here? And above all, why? <br /> <br /> Yes, our world can be an ugly, dirty and even evil place, but should not we disagree when an "artist" is dedicated to rubbing our faces in it? Or even worse, stick it on the faces of those nine-year-olds who, in one way or another, will end up seeing this on the home DVD? <br /> <br /> I hope people make sure that this movie is not seen by their children. Yes, I know, dream, Bernon ...
