Yes, Lifetime has the habit of making male species look stupid. And this telenovela is no joke when they make Perry King, a supposedly famous doctor, can not see the evil that surrounds him. Trust doctors, huh? How can someone not see what is happening? Is he so stupid? And the wicked wife, with a face like a horse, is killing all her family without a trace. How does she acquire all the drugs? That is not explained. How can you stop being a secretary in a hospital without credentials? I guess the director, Don FauntLeRoy asks us to just create it. I did not do it. I kept shouting at the screen King's stupidity with everything in front of his face. If the wife was so attractive, maybe, just maybe, she would accept it. But she is not even that. Shannon Sturges is the perfect wife and I tell you that she has the face of a horse. I would not cross the street for her, but our perfect husband does it quickly. After everyone in the cast was eliminated, I was not satisfied with the pennies that were given to our villain. She deserved more than she had. William Moses plays the doctor's brother who, unfortunately, knows his result from the first day. It is a pleasure to see at least one pretty face in this clinker. That of Lesley Anne Down. She gives the film a count of 2 only in the relief of seeing someone in this mess. Perry King deserved his fate. What an idiot.
