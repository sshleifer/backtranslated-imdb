Well, at least we must recognize that Hollywood's big horror producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive. Instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights to the Asian horror hits and then remake them in the United States, they discovered that they could simply hire Asian directors and assign them the ability to create their new ghost story directly in the states. It's like killing two birds with one stone. Come on guys! "The Messengers" is practically identical to all the other supernatural coolers that left the eastern countries from "Ringu". Translated in general terms, this means that it is a boring film, too extensive and totally free of gore, but it presents a lot of false fears and shamefully weak "Are we scared?" moments The Pang brothers (Danny & Oxide) previously created "The eye" extremely overrated and it is a tradition for them to build a story with clues and clues to a point where it is almost impossible to meet the expectations of the curious. Audiences, however, do not seem anxious to alter their formula in the short term. And they are also unscrupulous enough to recycle the same old and repetitive ghost themes over and over again. Restless spirits of the previous inhabitants trapped in the walls of a remote farm? The protagonist family torn by unprocessed traumas from the past, so first they have to restore faith and mutual trust? Give me a break! Add a videotape and a seven-day curse, why do not you do it? Even attempts to make you jump in your seat are too déjà-vu and will not scare anyone over 7 years old. Doors of blow, growth spots on the dirty and gradually larger walls, ghostly appearances, noises coming from the hold. The endless overuse of cheap tricks like this one is almost becoming insulting to the fanatics of horror. "The Messengers" revolves around a family on their way to a new life in the country as sunflower growers. The family situation is somewhat dysfunctional, since a personal tragedy (which is not revealed until the end of the movie) caused his youngest son to stop talking and parents distrusting his rebellious teenage daughter. Soon after, children experience strange presences on a remote farm, but fail to convince their parents to leave. That's it concludes the whole movie. Little Ben sees things, but he can not talk and Jessica is repeatedly attacked by supernatural forces, but nobody listens to her. The basic premise of "The Messagers" is very derived from the Stanley Kubrick classic immortal, "The Shining", only that it lacks the constantly ominous atmosphere and the disturbing tone. The script is taken too seriously even though it is fairly easy to predict the final outcome and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. At least "The Eye" produced some genuine collisions at the end, while the happy and happy final joy of "The Messengers" is simply pathetic. The only positive elements I can think of are the beautiful rural filming locations, the proper editing work and the promising acting (and beauty) talents Kristen Stewart. And there is an extraordinary supporting role, but sadly underdeveloped for William B. Davis.
