If you are a Catalan nationalist anarcho-socialist with an unscrupulous reverence for the mythologies of the Spanish Republic, this film may be for you. Two brothers, one from real life (one of them is the same Marc Recha), recreate a fictional version of a real life trip they had made through the spectacular Catalan countryside, and history is evoked (pans of walls of bullet, The artillery rumbles on the soundtrack) but it is not shown. There is very little dialogue, and most of it is incidental: the story is told in a third-person voice, being the voice of an actress posing as the real-life sister of the real-life brothers. The images have little to do with the story line there is, which is not much. Many are impressive and brooding pans through mountains and semi-arid rivers (think of Terrence Malick or Gus Van Sant, here there is not a bit of "Gerry" and "Last Days"), interspersed with some still images and motionless frames. . These are best enjoyed within the magnificent natural sound environment of the film and without the ultimately tedious narration or even the occasional background music (some pretty good, some quite strange, but all free). The best of what this movie has to say is said in these sequences, with its occasional inclusion without comments from power plants and dams. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the brothers is left schematic and generic; An important character is a catfish that bites man, never shows. The more suggested the commitments of the director, anarco and any other of Catalano, the more subverted the clearer and unspoken message of the film, and the experience becomes more narcisely irritating. Although the director said in the NYFF projection that the film was conceived from the beginning with his narrative in the third person, I would like to see a version without narrative or music and only with the natural soundtrack and the minimalist dialogue. the result could be more poignant and, in any case, it would not be much less disconcerting. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, it is likely that this is the only movie you will see this year in which a boy moves towards the frame with a cloth object (the swimsuit he was wearing?) hanging from your penis This is one of the few moments in the whole movie where your interest is affected by something that is really happening on the screen (what's that? Why is it hanging there?), But, as usual, it's not answers are provided. Very Warholian, very sixty, and not a little boring.
