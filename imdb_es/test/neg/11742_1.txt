Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece, shot by shot, including some modern facets: a walkman and the nudity of Anne Heche. Unless you have a strong desire to see Mrs. Heche naked, there is absolutely no reason to see this movie instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better and Van Sant does not realize that by hiding nudity and blood, the original shower scene is even more terrifying. Ask Janet Leigh about that. The acting is also much flatter and the technical aspects much less impressive.
