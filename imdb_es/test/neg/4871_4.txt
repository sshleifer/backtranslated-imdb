1st seen 2/25/2002 - 4 of 10 (Dir-George P. Cosmatos): predictable action thriller where any frequent movie viewer could guess what would come next. Charlie Sheen is the good guy of the president, who is not liked by the rest of the presidential staff. Of course, he gets involved in a situation where he is framed over and over again and he has a friend in the White House, played by Sutherland, who, of course, does not stay that way for a long time. His other friend is a reporter played by Linda Hamilton (who has very little to do or say in this meaningless paper) and, of course, his best and best friend is the same President (Sam Waterston), who remains as his friend until the end despite all. but being killed around him. Brain, however, full of action, meaningless, despite a lot of acting talent (all wasted).
