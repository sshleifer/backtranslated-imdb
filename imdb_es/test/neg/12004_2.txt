As a children's movie, it's great. For the family it just sucks. I really expected something like the Goonies, which is a great movie for all ages. This film was aimed too much at children with the silly script and the characters who called themselves little names like booger breath. ??? Alan Cummings was however a delight. And why do people compare Willy Wonka to this movie ... just because there's a song that looks a lot like the Willy Wonka song? This movie does not look like Willy Wonka at all.
