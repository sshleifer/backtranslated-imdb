In trying to build an important mall or complex or something like that, a wealthy landowner ignores the ancient Native American artifacts buried in the earth and unties the Bone Devourer ... a creature that goes and kills people in search of their fallen friends. Something like that. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie had to be an original Sci-Fi Channel. If it was not like that, then the director should never direct anything again. At best, the effects of the movie are ridiculous, and the monster Bone Eater is nothing more than a CGI animation that is added to the pictures at a later date. The actors do not even look so scared when they see it (probably because they really do not, and they're just terrible actors). However, it is a great comedy, even if it is supposed to be pure horror.
