NBC had the opportunity to make a powerful religious epic in the line of "The Ten Commandments" and "The greatest story ever told", and instead chose to make a half-caricature that looked more like "Aquatic World" than to anything else. I do not remember a passage in the Bible where Lot becomes a pirate and attacks the ark, nor do I remember one in which Noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, nor do I remember that Noah is an insane crazy old man who suddenly acts like if it were him. Command a naval fleet and run around shouting nautical terms like "raise the pillar!" This was possibly the worst marketing decision in history. Obviously, most people who saw this would be Jewish and Christian parents with their children, so why on earth do they make the movie so offensive to these people? If they intentionally tried to offend, why not advertise it that way and at least attract the right audience? I hope they make a REAL movie of Noah someday, one done with seriousness and consideration, one that really attracts people and earns money. Until then, do not waste your time with this garbage.
