Throughout this film, I kept thinking why the hell did they do this as a "documentary", but do not they include real images of the people interviewed? Of course, it would have been like any other documentary, but then the filmmakers would have found the meaning that the film would offer. <br /> <br /> Using a series of well-known movie stars (many of whom apparently asked to be in it) to portray "real" people gave me the feeling that there was a predetermined message to be delivered, and the Director was so focused on that you could not trust real people, so actors were used rehearsed scenes. (Yes, I know that this was also a play, but a documentary should be a documentary). I really felt disappointed by the various stars, and I kept waiting for one of them to leave the character for a moment and say "I'm a good person because I'm in this." <br /> <br /> This movie could have had a much more powerful social commentary if it had been more objective or allowed us to see Matthew Shepard and his killers as people instead of symbols. (The much superior "Boys Do not Cry" had an unwavering vision of the involved, good and bad.) Instead, the Laramie Project gives an almost implacable reading that someone's sexuality must be accepted independently and little else.
