Given the issue of drug addiction, Down to the Bone almost can not avoid being a pretty depressing movie. But depressing does not necessarily have to mean bad. Unfortunately in this case it's pretty bad. The film has some good things in its favor, especially the quality performance of Vera Farmiga in the central role of Irene, a working mother who fights against a cocaine addiction. But there is not enough good here to overcome evil. The flaws of the film are mainly in the story, which fails to captivate and really never seems to get going. Irene goes to rehab and returns home with a clueless husband who has no idea how to support her attempt to quit her habit. Irene grows up close to another recovering addict, a nurse from her rehabilitation center. The complications continue. But history really never awakens life. It does not look like the movie is really going anywhere. It can be said that it is a hard and realistic look at the everyday struggles of an addict. Maybe it's like that, but in this case it's not an interesting movie. Everything has a very "blah" feeling. Minimalist cinematography does not help, adding another layer of gray to the incredibly monotonous procedures. And none of the other performances is up to Farmiga. Hugh Dillon is fine as Irene's nurse friend, but no one else in the cast adds anything of value to the process. In general, this movie is a somber, depressing and quite boring ride.
