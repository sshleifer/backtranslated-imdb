I can not believe that someone gave the green light, much less that he did it voluntarily. I will never be able to recover those 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Some movies are so bad that they are good. This has gone so far again that it is somehow so bad that it is terrible. I did not exactly expect much, since it was a low budget, a jump car, a repeat of a B movie, but it was still below my expectation levels. Even television movies have higher production values. <br /> <br /> There were special effects (very) poor, a shocking dialogue, a terrible performance and a completely inexplicable plot. Who cursed it and why, why did the 6-inch snakes become 15-foot snakes, someone has heard of highly poisonous league snakes or pythons? 100 passengers? 3,000 snakes? So many promises, none delivered. <br /> <br /> Some comments would make you think it's worth watching this movie for the last five minutes. It's not even worth renting. Stay and watch a low budget TV movie, you will enjoy it much more. <br /> <br /> Why was this done? Oh, yes, to blatantly charge the Internet phenomenon that is SOAP. What a shame, brothers Mallachi, what a shame.
