My Wife and Kids was cataloged as the Cosby show itself in 00, but unlike the latter, it was not fun and could not be seen. In fact, it is poorly written and some of the jokes revolve around Michael Mickey taking the stupidity of Michael Jr and the fact that he is a loser, which became increasingly tedious and annoying as the show progressed. . <br /> <Br /> What was supposed to have been a promising success, later became a silly and silly show where ideas became so extraordinary and ridiculous. And as for the second Claire, I ended up getting very upset with this character: she became a spoiled, childish and whining teenage girl, in most of the later episodes. <br /> <br /> MWAK was not a trendsetter for Cosby. rather it was just a bad black comedy for the general standards.
