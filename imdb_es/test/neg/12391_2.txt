It seems at least vaguely possible that this film provided some inspiration for "The Sopranos", since its main character, Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a hitman who has so many problems from his past and his profession that he is in therapy. trying to deal with all of this Everything finally reaches a critical point in your 10-year high school reunion. The problem was that when Blank arrived at the meeting, I had stopped worrying. Frankly, I found this movie as an obstacle from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I had potential. There was a reasonably good cast, led by Cusack and Dan Aykroyd, playing Grocer, their big rival in the hired assassin business, along with Minnie Driver as Debi, Blank's high school sweetheart, who stood up the night of graduation, and a limited number. role for Alan Arkin as Dr. Oatman, Blank's psychologist. However, that quite talented cast never seemed to join. The drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humor. What I thought had the most potential to be a comic story was Grocer's proposal for a union of assassins, but apart from becoming a joke, the idea never developed. As for the romance, one wondered why Debi would think about letting this guy return to his life. <br /> <br /> There was a handful of laughs, but nothing really caught me and hugged me and I spent most of my time. movie wondering if this thing is ever going to start clicking. He never did it, at least not for me. 2/10
