If someone at National Lampoon is reading this, PLEASE STOP CRAP YOUR COLLECTION OF YOUR BUM, really now! Why the hell are you making movies like these? They are not fun and seeing it for sexual content is a complete waste of time, really. It's such a horrible movie that you want to film while you're watching it. I'm serious, guys, make Harol and Kumar go to blah, blah, blah, blah, they look like a real good movie (and we all know that H & K is one of the worst movies ever made) It really stinks, REALLY He does it. How bad is it? Well, even the losers who really like National Lampoon will hate this movie ... they will want to assassinate the director, I swear to God. I hate you, National Lampoon, die now. Die.
