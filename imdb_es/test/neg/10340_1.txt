I am currently 22 years old and I remember seeing this movie in theaters when it first came out. You listened to me well, I was 5 years old and, nevertheless, I can still clearly remember what I saw that afternoon so many years ago. Was it a mystical journey through Mark Twain's fantastic world of creativity? ... No, on the other hand, it was a pretty creepy movie about Mark Twain's dark side, depressed and actually suicidal. A scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which Mark Twain plays the organ at his own funeral. <br /> <br /> Would an adult enjoy this movie? Well, this movie possibly presents some interesting insights that a person with a working knowledge of Mark Twain's writing could enjoy; But trust me, "Adventures" is NOT the movie you want to use to introduce Mark Twain to his young children.
