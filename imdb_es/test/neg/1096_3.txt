... And boy, it's smooth <br /> <br /> I saw it on the Bravo cable channel on a Saturday night and here in Britain we often have these "erotic" soft-core movies that appear late at night of the night in Bravo. This follows a WEIRD SCIENCE plot of a couple of university geeks who build a virtual reality helmet that makes you have sexual fantasies. <br /> <br /> When you've seen one of these movies, you've seen them all with a bunch of bimbos that look like ads for silicone implants. Come on, I've actually seen breasts in real life (I'm sure some of us have done that too) and they're reeling unlike here, where they defy the laws of physics, if not physics, that at least gravity . The sex scenes are these tedious issues where a well-polished geezer rubs against his castmate without any dialogue or sound other than some muzak and when they reach the climax it seems that both have a bad attack of constipation. The girls themselves are very nice, especially Brandy Davis and Nikki Fritz, but they are wasted on this kind of soft core movies. <br /> <br /> And if it's fantasy, after that I recommend the trilogy of LORD OF THE RINGS
