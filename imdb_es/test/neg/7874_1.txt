Ugh Stephen Baldwin. I never realized until I got the DVD at home and saw his name in the credits. Double ugh. What is worse, HE IS the NAME in this low budget, meaningless, wandering, who wants to shoot. I mean, where did you find the guy to write this rejection? Driving a caterpillar in the City City Dump, hoping to get into the game of the movie? The whole plot is a ridiculous situation stacked in a ridiculous premise. Baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy for American Gothic, sans pitchfork. All his repertoire of acting seems that he needs the potty and then it seems that he found it. <br /> <br /> So, there are the people: bad script, bad performance by renowned actors, low budget environment and a hero who is as convincing as a scout girl who looks for a cookie client as an action. hero. It's too late for me to get my money back on the DVD, but it can be saved, unless it's one of those who likes to watch dogs to laugh ... frankly, this is too boring to be. funny.
