Playmania is extremely boring. This is the basis of the show. Mel or Shandi ask extremely easy questions that a 2 year old could answer at an extremely slow pace. This program lasts 2 hours and probably only play about 10 games in that period. People may like this program because the hosts are very attractive, but their heat is completely destroyed by the fact that they are so annoying. <br /> <br /> During the program they mention that we need more players per million. times. The 5 main surveys they do probably take approximately 20 minutes outside of the program. This show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made. One of the reasons why they probably do not have callers is because the show is very cheap with the money. The largest amount of money I have seen was $ 210. I would not be surprised if this "game show" is canceled at the end of 2006.
