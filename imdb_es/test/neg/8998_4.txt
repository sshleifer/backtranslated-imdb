This movie is nice if you like the ranks of poverty, public domain movies of the first half of the twentieth century or if you are a fan of amateur films. The film joins public domain thrillers along with newly filmed scenes in which the "actors" (with the only exception that Redfield is almost dead on Lugosi rip, all the "performers" are simply terrible!) They try to interact with The footage. The "New" video is covered with digitally added film scratches, as are some of the older videos that are already below the standard (?? !!). As close as I can understand, the plot has something to do with a group of strangers who meet on an island to read a will (?). This film, with a creative premise like 'Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid', is a technical and creative accident. In a terrible sequence during a long sequence and a wounded sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to 'Fog Island', whatever it may be! The "flashback" then incoherently weaves the old images of totally different times and of a totally disparate movie quality. Unrelated scenes from "The Lost World" (1925), The Most Dangerous Game (1932), White Zombie (1932), Bela Lugosi meets a Brooklyn gorilla (1952) and some other productions of the poverty line. This is done through an incredibly bad voice that seems to have too much space in the echo, as if the audio had been recorded on a cheap home video camera. <br /> <br /> The "filmmakers" seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving the characters the names of famous actors (Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc..etc ..). This tactic was done intelligently, as well as subtly in 'Final Destination', here it is simply unpleasant! Rare and painfully graceless, jokes abound about Spiderman, Dracula and Superman. Even here the reference of the lawyer "Dewey, Cheetam and Howe" is used, which was old and old. This was old and tired when The Three Stooges used it in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The movie and audio, does not relate scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi The final effect is who seems to be getting older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older minute by minute. Interestingly, the film did not use this as a secondary plot of comedy and wasted a good opportunity for comedy. <br /> <br /> However, to tell you the truth, it was really fun to see this late at night in bed. Maybe that's what they wanted to happen!
