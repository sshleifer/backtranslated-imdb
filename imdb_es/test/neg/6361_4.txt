Basically, the first two Critters films were already silly but in a good and entertaining way. This movie is much more of a B movie, which is silly but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This is the first sequel that does not really follow the plot of the first two films. Basically, all the characters are new and this time there are no bounty hunters (well, well like none, since the bounty hunter in this movie appears too late) and the budget for this obviously decreased again. To save even more costs, the film was recorded against each other with part 4, which I think the image will be just as bad, since it follows directly to this film and was made by the same people involved with it. <Br /> <br /> It's just a typical B genre movie, which in reality has no originality or entertainment. It makes "Critters 3" a real redundant sequel, you can easily dispense with it. Granted that things could have been much worse for this movie, but it's not exactly a good one either. The movie simply falls flat like a science fiction / horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> It is also a bit strange to notice how the Critters have suddenly changed in this. This time they have twice their usual size, without giving an explanation for that, and they are even more gremlins like in this movie than in the previous one. <br /> <br /> The film is only interesting because This was the film debut of Leonardo DiCaprio. He was around 17 years old in this film and, of course, has a baby face, as he does now. I like to see actors so well known in their first roles. It's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course, DiCaprio only improved, but he was already doing something like he does these days. <br /> <br /> It really is a too stupid and unconvincing movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
