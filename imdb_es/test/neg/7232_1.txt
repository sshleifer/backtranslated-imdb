An octopus that eats meat, where does that boy Boaz continue to be inspired (what ...?) Davidson? Anyway, even for the low and low standards of both the giant marine animal that kills people and me, this is a bit horrible. Octopus is one of the weakest, laziest and weakest monsters I have ever seen. I think he just ended up in the (ahum) East River because Sea World got tired of him. You can see the actors repeatedly helping the octopus by drowning them. Some idiots, that way they will never learn! You want all the other killer Giant Octopi (that's the right plural, by the way) to laugh at him. Meanies. <br /> <br /> Even to stop the octopus are the wind, shaving razors that are difficult to handle and also the special maritime agent Nick Hartfield and his partner, who will retire in a week, but first he will have to be eaten for the octopus. Hello, the octopus won the fight! A couple more and he's going to evolve (the scars in my mind stay). Sure, of course, try to help him not do a damn thing (does not he have a gun or something?) But no, that does not help magically either. <br /> <br /> All right, it's in the love interest of the marine police, Rachel Starbird. Is this based on a comic book or something? Anyway, together they try to stop the octopus walking in the park. They hope this helps, because it's July 4 in a couple of days and the octopus could join the party. And you do not know how he is when he's drunk. Rachel then takes a school bus out of nowhere to make sure this movie does not end while Nick feeds the octopus with more marine cops. <br /> <br /> But everything is wrong that ends badly, Nick manages to blow the octopus to pieces a couple of times, and a group of children who were there applauding and laughing. You know, in the vision of the abdomen, this would probably get an R. In real life, I would say all ages, but I like all ages, so my final idea is: Adequate for absolutely no one. There is no sex, there is no gore, there is nothing. Now, forget about this movie. Join the club.
