I myself am an animator and a fan of the whole medium, so when I saw this movie in a $ 5 container, I thought it was worth trying it in my collection. Although I never regret having a new addition to my animation library, this movie was definitely disappointing. <br /> <br /> The premise has enough potential. A penguin named Hubie finds the perfect pebble to give to the girl he loves as the penguin equivalent to an engagement ring, but before he can give it to him, he is expelled by an evil rival and lost at sea. Then he befriends another penguin who helps him find his way home. The configuration is not excellent, but it is enough to configure what could be a fun adventure. Unfortunately, the deeds of the duo are never very important and everything becomes quite repetitive. Most of the situations in which they find themselves are really uninspired and lack creativity ... and the linking of those who are among them is cheesy and forced. <br /> <br /> The animation is good but it is not up to Don Bluth as always. This is the guy who gave us The Secret of Nimh, Land Before Time and An American Tale, all of whom had an attention to detail that often surpassed Disney, the grandfather of feature film animation. This does not amount to much beyond the high-end television fair. <br /> <br /> The music is fine, but it's quite forgettable and the actors of the voice are all wasted talent ... Martin Short is particularly wasted here as the main character who, despite being mentioned as a brambo , is practically a heterosexual man throughout the entire film. <br /> <br /> In summary, the film will probably attract very young children, but a good family movie should appeal to all ages and unfortunately it does not have what it takes.
