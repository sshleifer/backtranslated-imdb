I could not agree more. The book is one of Dean Koontz's best novels and this movie is a total farce. I looked around the middle and then threw the tape into the container with disgust. I have no idea what the idiot director was thinking when doing this shit, but I would rather take my eyes out with a sharp stick than watch this useless movie again! Everything about this movie is wrong. First the main character of an ex-Marine is changed to a high school KID. WHY??? Second, the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie. I bet Freud would have something to say about it! Hahaha The dog is cute enough and the best of the movie, and completely despises everyone else! Also a main character who helps them in the book betrays them in the movie. There is really nothing good to say about the movie, except that it is relatively short at least an hour and a half. If someone has not seen the movie, do yourself a favor! READ THE BOOK! It's much better than this useless waste of time!
