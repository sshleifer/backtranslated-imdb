Zoey 101 is such a stupid show. I do not know if that's because the boastful Jamie Lynn Spears is the star of this or what, but I know the show sucks. It's about a girl and her brother who go to a boarding school. The jokes in this program are extremely boring and unpleasant, and I hate all the characters, except Chase and Lola. Hell, the jokes in this show are so funny that they make Jack Black look like Monty Python. This program is undoubtedly one of the worst programs of Nickelodeon, it is down there with Avatar and Danny Phantom in the pit of shame, and if this show were a person with some honor, he would be guilty. <br /> <br /> 1/10
