John Candy was very much a successful or missing comics actor. His death was a tragedy and we all miss him very much, but WAGONS EAST, in which he plays a vague wagon master who accepts taking a group of pioneers from the wild west, is even sadder. I do not understand why he was even released. The story is meaningless and weak, and the jokes are not there. It saddens me even more that Candy's last film is her worst movie of all time. So let's forget about this and remember it in his best movies, such as SUMMER RENTAL, PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES and BUCK UNCLE. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5
