Joe was released for the first time in the United States in the summer of 1970. Despite the notorious respectable, reasonable box office and an Oscar, he disappeared shortly after and remained in oblivion during the 80s, before being revalued with enthusiasm, Something unfairly, in the late 90's. Thanks to this prolonged unavailability, his reputation has been positioned (inexplicably) along with the likes of Michael Winner's original Death Wish. Although revenge is a theme, a film about vigilantism that definitely is not. <br /> <br /> The plot is not worth the synopsis. It is a chilling, extravagant and chilling ramble on an accidental murder and the improbable relationship that arises from it. That relationship and the quirks largely based on the class of its two drivers are exaggerated in a ridiculous caricature; These two, and their situation, have absolutely no relation to reality. <br /> <br /> Almost everything about the film is outdated and reluctantly, which makes everything completely fascinating. Hippies are represented as sarcastic and exclusive misanthropes, hard drugs make you sleep or dance like crazy with lipstick on their faces, and most young women are prepared to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana on a flight . It is much more a movie from the 60 instead of the 70, so the fact that some industry luminaries have begun to include it in retrospective conversations about the beginnings of the Hollywood New Wave is a complete mystery. Martin Scorcese of all the people even got involved, although probably only to make a gesture of assent to the washed and wet nuances of the grim urban cinematography, which almost certainly influenced Taxi Driver four years later. But Joe looks a lot like a furious diatribe against people like Easy Rider and Bonnie And Clyde, rather than a continuation of that same insurgent film spirit. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie that has real artistic meaning. - despite Joe's incontinent fury for everything in his world, it's still a story about absolutely nothing, but its value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented. Shot on and around the streets of New York City during the darkest hours of the Vietnam War, and at a time when the United States (and, significantly, its cinema) was being revolutionized to the horror of the old guard, the film ends in It is completely alien and accidental, and says more about that period of history than many infinitely superior films that tried to capture it directly. <br /> <br /> But like a movie? Despite a surprising and effective crash final, this is basically a Michael Winner movie, but not so well made. How does it tickle your fantasy? ** By the way, if you are, like me, a fan of detecting arbitrary background similarities, then take a look at Harold Steptoe at 1:22:11 at the hippy art gallery.
