In his feature film debut `Yellow ', Chris Chan Lee attempts to illuminate the portrayal of Asian-Americans in Hollywood by moving away from the stereotypes portrayed in the conventional film. However, in doing so, Lee commits a much more egregious crime: he exaggerates the stereotypes of Asian Americans to the point of disbelief. The result? The terribly one-dimensional characters and a scandalously superficial script unleash the cast in a frenzy of excess action, which ultimately results in a movie that is physically painful to watch. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by any of the positive reviews obtained by `Yellow '; each falls into one of the two fields. In a corner (for example, right here on imdb.com), there are Asian Americans who are so happy that an Asian character can be represented on the screen without thick glasses and a math book, which somehow neglect the idiocy of the product end of Lee. On the other hand, you find critics of films that have simply presumed that it would not be good to give 'Amarillo' the full attack it deserves; after all, it is an avant-garde Asian-American film made by an independent Asian-American filmmaker ... territory protected for now. <br /> <br /> Case example: main character Sin Lee (Michael Chung). The writer / director Lee achieves a monumental feat with Sin, editing "Yellow" in such a way that Sin never appears on the screen unless he is frowning or screaming. See Without resenting the support of his friends. Frown. See the sin walking on the beach and breeding. Frown. (Shouts are heard). See Without closing his father's store. Frown. See the sin urinate. Frown. See the breath of sin. Scowl. <br /> <br /> Gee, I wonder if Sin is full of Asian-American anguish. Do you believe? I'm not sure. Frown. Scowl. <br /> <br /> To be conscientious, Lee introduces us to Sin's father, Woon Lee (Soon-tek Oh). Throughout the film, while Sin simply frowns or screams, Mr. Lee frowns * and * screams. In fact, this is Woon's main role in "Yellow": frown and scream simultaneously. <br /> <br /> Wow, I wonder if Woon is an Asian father with a complex of authorities. Do you believe? I'm not sure. Frown. Shouts. <br /> <br /> If Lee's one-dimensional characters do not bother you, his story line will do it. Meet Mina (Mary Chen) and Joey (John Cho), two characters that exist in this film with the sole purpose of including a tangential and totally irrelevant love story in the film. You see, Lee learned in film school that every good movie should include some kind of subtext related to love, and these two characters allow him to fulfill the obligation. The restless dialogue of flirting Mina and Joey consists of insults of a single line that culminate in a kiss: "Nerd!"; `Stupidhead! '; (eyes meet); (understanding smile); (a kiss occurs). <br /> <br /> But rest assured that, somewhere out there, Sin frowns as all this happens. <br /> <br /> That neither Mina nor Joey contribute in any way to the film's plot does not perplex me as much as Lee's insistence on clichés of more beaten movies to achieve his achievements. And believe me, the flirting sequence is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the movie, we find Woon Lee trying to explain his constant frown and screams to Sin's girlfriend, Teri (Mia Suh), in what I'm sure Lee pretended to be a moving moment. What a surprise: when Woon invokes a metaphorical story about the homeland to illustrate his point, taken directly from Reader's Digest, his voice trembles in that very special paternal way. The camera becomes an obligatory shot of Teri's trembling hands. We feel obliged to roll our eyes, except that we realize that Woon's explanation makes no sense. But the lack of substance did not prevent Lee from making the film, so why would he cut this particularly ineffective scene? After all, the world can always use another cliché. <br /> <br /> Well, you say, the movie can be painful, but at least * it * must * be a technical masterpiece, for example, "What dreams? It can come." I'm sorry, on a technical basis, `Yellow 'also disappoints. The editions of Lee are uncomfortable and interrupt the little rhythm that exists in the film, but I'm sure Lee thought they would appear to be up to date. To make matters worse, each frame is underexposed or overexposed. Although the light meter was invented in 1932, somehow the new technology did not reach the 'Yellow' set. <br /> <br /> In light of the film's absolute deficiency, actor Burt Bolos, who plays best friends Alex, performs relatively well. Although Bowles exaggerates a little, you can not blame him when Lee's script consists only in frowning and screaming. Bolos' castmates, on the other hand, show no restrictions in terms of overacting. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a movie as bad as `Yellow 'in a long time. And I really pray that I do not see a movie as bad as `Yellow 'for quite some time, too. Please do not waste it veil; life is already too short Thank you.
