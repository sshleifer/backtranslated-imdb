Poor Jane Austen. This dog of a production DOES NOT do justice to his wonderful ironic novel. Starting at the top ... badly adapted. The screenwriter deserves extra low notes for trying ... now that I think about it, I do not know what she was trying to do, but suffice it to say that the brand was lost for light years! Combining that with all the exaggerated and horrible production values, this is an adaptation that should never have happened. It would have been much better if they had only given all the money they invested in this failure and donated it to a worthy charity. Do yourself a favor, read the book. You will almost certainly enjoy it a thousand times more than trying to sit through this unbearable production!
