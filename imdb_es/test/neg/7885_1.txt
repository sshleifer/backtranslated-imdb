This is one of the rare movies that I did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching it. This was not because I was particularly fascinated or impressed. On the contrary, he had not given me anything at all. <br /> <br /> Why? Because somehow, everything was so exaggerated that I could no longer take this movie seriously. There was so much sex and violence that I had the strong impression that the film was trying to be very, very difficult to be offensive, as if it were superlatives in ugliness, instead of telling a convincing story about two women trapped in a spiral. of the crime. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi had been described as "Thelma & Louise with real sex" for me. Well, it's true that the main idea is similar. There are two women traveling around the country because they have committed crimes and they know that their lives are over, that the police are going to catch them and decide that now that everything is over, anyway, there is no way to contain them. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi had been described as a feminist film in which women, who had suffered male domination in the past, took revenge on the men they met. <br /> <br /> This is something I had never played in this movie, simply because none of these women had been innocent, and because not only do they kill irresponsible and violent men, but also men who seduce themselves , men who show the sensation of wanting to do it. protected sex And they kill women. No, they are not in any way better than the characters they meet and murder in horrible and brutal ways. <br /> <br /> How easily they decide to kill the "heroines" and how much pleasure they receive for them. It is absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way, or even take them seriously. It was too much Too much sex, too much violence. I got the feeling that sex and violence only existed to create a superlative in ugliness, instead of conveying a story or making a point. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi did not leave me any impression, I did not have Do not make me think, because I was very far from any real world. So built, unrealistic and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> There was nothing I could do with this movie, there was simply nothing to think about, other than "Why did you make this terrible movie?" If the intense displeasure that happened in this movie would have been useful, I accepted it easily. But as I did not find anything, since the story of the film seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to squeeze as much and the ugliest sex possible in a movie ... I filed it under "unnecessary torture", I never decided, NEVER, look this movie again, and now I consider this to be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The worst, not only because it really is not my cup of tea to see people raped, raped, have sex in another way and kill each other ... but because whatever it is, the creators I wanted to tell the world with their movie ... if they wanted to say something ... it just did not work. And there is nothing else that can save this film, because it is also filmed in such an ugly style.
