As much as I hated the movie that follows this series, at least I can say that Zangief was fun. The animated series is possibly one of the worst things ever produced. The animation is often inconsistent, although it remains constantly bad. The shape of a character's face is even able to change drastically in the same shot. The script and the voice acting also leave something to be desired, since the majority of the cast seems as talented as the cast of a third grade play. Characters like Cammy and DJ are so forced into the stereotypes of their nationalities that the episodes that contain them are almost physically painful to watch, not that the series is not painful on a regular basis anyway. The episode plots seem to strive to reach new levels of difficulty with each turn and are so full of plot holes that I'm surprised they had time to show ads. In fact, I'm surprised that someone pays to advertise during the show. Besides being a bad series, it's an even worse adaptation of Street Fighter. Many of the characters maintain the failed adaptations of the film. Examples include that Ken and Ryu are idiots (although Ken is supposed to be rich), Blanka is Guiles' friend, Charlie, and Chun Li, a reporter. It takes talent to take something as bad as the movie and make it worse.
