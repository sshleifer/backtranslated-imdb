Thanks to the stupid horror films like "Troll" and the indescribably atrocious cult "Troll 2", it has become practically impossible to take movies with kobolds, gnomes and other types of little green goblins these days. Recently I only saw the movie "Do not be afraid of the dark" made for the television of the 70s, which is basically a pretty scary and serious movie about the little goblin's domestic monsters, and still I could not help thinking. Back on the potato-headed creatures that provoked laughter and dressed in garbage bags that ran crazily in "Troll 2". The same thing happened to me now. As much as I tried to enter "Inhabited" with a clear mindset, I unconsciously kept comparing the supposedly scary and threatening garden fairies with the ill-sculpted elves of Nilbog. Even so, even without all the prejudices, "Inhabited" is an entertaining remotely entertaining though not memorable direct horror film to video. It is a cheesy, smooth and politically correct pastiche of the family drama and mythology of northern Europe. The little annoying and murderous creatures of this movie are not your simple goblins; they are "The Huldre": evil little Norwegian demons who live underground and try to expel happy families from their homes by influencing younger children. This beats the Russell family when they move into the house of their ramshackle dreams in a small remote city. The beloved blonde daughter of MILF actress Megan Gallagher begins to behave strangely every time she spends time in the cute playhouse at the back of the garden. She claims that her friends are fairies, and although the sinister maintenance staff also warns of strange events in the past, Gina's parents simply think that the girl has trouble adjusting to her new neighborhood. When she continues to talk about the fairies, they arrange a date with the acclaimed psychologist Dr. Werner, while "The Huldre" is slowly leaving her botanical refuge. There is not much to mention here. The pace is acceptable and the attempts to create suspense are pretty nice. You understand that this is a horror movie for the whole family, so sequences of bloody murders are not shown graphically here. Hell, even the corpse of the family pet cat stays off the screen. This is the nth nonsense horror movie in which Malcolm McDowell appears and practically always represents an unreliable, greedy and self-centered authority figure.
