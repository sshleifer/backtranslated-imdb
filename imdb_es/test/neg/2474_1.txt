No, * Hitch * is decidedly NOT a romantic comedy about the former leftist (and biblical) pundit pundit turned into a reactionary-pundit Christopher Hitchens, although he sure would have made a movie more fun. A chubby little Englishman, with his teeth stained black by cigarettes and Guinness, barking poignant political advice and comments to men in love: "Look in your EYES when I speak to you, crazy! And remember: call someone 'neo'" Conservative "makes you a de facto anti-Semite, can not you clarify something, liberal pantywaist?" <br /> <br /> Oh, good. Instead, we have Will Smith, whose continued success remains a mystery to me, at least. Apparently I am alone in this regard. Smith is the most powerful man in Hollywood at the time of writing this article: Americans simply can not avoid throwing their money at him. On the other hand, I find his sufficiency unbearable, not mitigated by a scene here (spoiled by the trailer) in which he suffers a drastic allergic reaction to seafood. We know that Smith will recover from his bland and excessively muscular appearance, because there is a fat comedic actor (Kevin James) in his hand making a fool of himself. We're supposed to laugh hysterically every time the slob starts dancing like an asshole (cue "Everybody Dance Now!" From CC Music Factory), but why would a straight arrow counter behave this way? I have worked with several counters of straight arrows for years, and I can tell you that if, in the memorable phrase of Norman Mailer, "the rude boys do not dance", neither do the counters of straight arrows. Am I taking all this too seriously? Or, and here is a bold thought: perhaps the writers could not conceive a character logically drawn to save their lives? <br /> <br /> Speaking of writers, they come up with a bad idea of ​​Smith's love Interest: writer of a tabloid newspaper (Eva Mendes). Since when do tabloids deserve love? In what universe am I, anyway? - everyone here in IMDb is overlooking this gut. Or all of you need to raise the bar, in terms of entertainment value for your money, or I'm just a skunk at the garden party. (Me, and another 150 million boyfriends and husbands who suffered a lot.) In any case, if I can imitate Smith's Hitch and offer my male readers some good advice: when you drag to see * Hitch *, tell Better La half, "Hey, that was pretty good" after the movie ended. Do not be too enthusiastic; Do not say it, she'll know you're lying to her. Praise him in a slightly surprised way, as if the movie was better than you expected and it was not the anguished waste of time it really was. But what am I saying, eh, friends? - The boys know all the movements. <br /> <br /> 1 star of 10.
