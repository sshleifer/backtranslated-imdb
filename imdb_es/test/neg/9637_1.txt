After watching Stop-Loss, I feel disappointed in Hollywood for doing so badly. Gone are the glory days of the films of the 1940s that made one proud of being an American, fighting against the evil that wishes to conquer abroad and death at home. What remains is the drip of foam in the mouths of the rabid anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young people who return home from the war. One descends to madness out of control, culminating in his death. The main character leaves his country in a moment of war and destroys the relationship of his best friends with his boyfriend at the same time. The third is truly the hero of the story, opting to continue the fight that was carried to our shores almost eight years ago. What makes this film bad is not the performance, but the premise behind it. They lead us to believe that the decorated soldiers are, in fact, the ones who hate our country. Desertion is similar to betrayal in times of war, and the main character flirts with her throughout the film. This paradox is designed to weaken the reaction of the public to the central act of the film. We're not supposed to find fault with King, since he uses medals, but his actions not only deserve it, they demand it. He is not an antihero. To accept the film, the public must accept the correction of desertion because the story paints the King as nothing more than a hero. I can not accept that, since it's like asking me to call the yellow sky on a clear blue day. In addition, the mockery by the true hero is piled up, the man who re-enlists and continues to serve his country. I would only recommend this stench to someone who needs to be convinced of the decline of Hollywood, as it is a clear example of this. No wonder he has gone wrong at the box office.
