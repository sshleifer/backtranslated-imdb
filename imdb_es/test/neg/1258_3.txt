For the most part, "Michael" is a disaster? Ten minutes of charm and ninety wrong steps. <br /> <br /> Travolta and MacDowell do their best, often overcoming the insensitively banal Nora Ephron. But the movie moves like a snail. And even within their context of fantasy, the characters behave improbably on a regular basis. (Reporters who routinely leave out of their sight the story of a life? An apparent angel who lives on Earth?) <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell the romantic comedy teacher Ephron that William Hurt, brilliant in so many Other films, it's not Tom Hanks. The "climax" of the film redefines the word devised. Ephron may be filming for Heaven here, but unfortunately "Michael" is a long and long journey through the cinema.
