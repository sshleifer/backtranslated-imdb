Here in Australia, the nights in Rodanthe are promoted in the same class as the notebook. Frankly, how much putrefaction. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a recipe. On paper we have all the right ingredients ... Richard Gere is usually perfect in this genre, Diane Lane, a former favorite of "Under Tuscan Sun" and "Unfithful", location by the sea, solitude and yet the movie stinks. In the session we went to yesterday afternoon, a woman next to my wife fell asleep and, halfway through the movie, got up and left. The main problem is that, in the first place, there is no accumulation or credibility in the relationship. And maybe there are too many long, intense faces if you like the stories that the Gere and Lane characters bring to the movie. There are hours of those balanced with maybe 5 minutes of what we can see ... the romance! There is no warmth in the character of Gere, Lane looks terrible at the beginning of the film and everything fades. Then, as a spectator, we can not connect with the characters. <br /> <br /> Here the others say that the book is great. Well, whether it's the script, the direction or the production, someone here has made a real mess of this movie. It's like the scenes and the accumulation are a deck of cards, except that instead of being in the right order, they have come together everywhere. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ... save your money for when you get to video stores and even then expect a good deal when going to the weekly rate.
