The 'Censored' of Frank Tashlin is a small private Snafu that aims to teach the importance of the Censor to prevent military secrets from leaking. Snafu tries to tell his girlfriend that he is destined in the South Pacific, but the Censor frustrates every attempt he makes to send the letter. These first scenes are the best, with the invisible Censor taking the card from the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially used eagle! The second half of the cartoon, in which Snafu manages to send the letter with the help of Technical Fairy, First Class (which is actually teaching him a lesson), is less fun and climaxes with a disappointing end to just a dream . The main point of interest in this part of the caricature is the appearance of Snafu's extremely dressed bride, who is even seen with her arms crossed, although with strategically placed members at all times! Directed to the military, Snafu's shorts were often characterized by greater indecision, but these scenes, as they can be, are by far the most erotic I have found in any of these shorts so far. Despite all this, I prefer Snafu shorts that go a bit more to the jugular, which usually results in the death of the main character. To see great examples of this, look for 'The Goldbrick' by Tashlin or 'Spies' by Chuck Jones. "Censored" is pretty weak in comparison.
