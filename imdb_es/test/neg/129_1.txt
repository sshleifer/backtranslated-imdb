I can not explain what garbage load this movie is. As I really can not. It's just so bad. <br /> <br /> argument = shit acting = budget shit = so low it's ridiculous <br /> <br /> Jesus, it's like the only good thing about this movie is the fact that the main character was pretty hot . <br /> <br /> The only people who feel that they think this movie is good are those who participated in the film. I am sure that they were not the ones who financed it because money was not invested in this. (HAHAhaha to the point where heads are shaved) <br /> <br /> This movie has already wasted a lot of my life, so I will not waste any more time writing my review.
