SHRIEKER is a full moon production. I knew what to expect (very poor quality) but I did not expect this to be as painful as SHRIEKER was going to see it. <br /> <br /> It's just horrible. Bad performance, confusing script and direction. Annoying characters I wanted to kill. Everything was probably done in a week. I have seen episodes of CHARMED that were more complex and convincing than this model. <br /> <br /> It looks like an orphan episode of an ill-conceived television series that no one has ever seen. It was a difficult task to see and I could feel my mind getting weaker and weaker. Watching a movie should not be so difficult.
