It's hard to ruin this story. GREAT book / GOOD movie version by Fred Zinneman, however, this movie is AMAZING! First the casting was terrible. Richard Gere should have played the Jackal in person, since Edward Fox was a similar type of encryption and they did not have to mess with the original script adding so much worthless fluff (face). This movie reminded me of so many Bruce Willis movies, since you see huge expenses with NADA of cinematic to show it. (It's your "conspiracy theory") You need to do something real to make a movie so bad with such an original good script. EVERY person of Michael Caton Jones must be banned from making films for 10 years; Such is the insult that this film is for the true filmmakers. If Hollywood went to trial for having no idea what they were doing, this movie would be Exhibit A. What a shame!
