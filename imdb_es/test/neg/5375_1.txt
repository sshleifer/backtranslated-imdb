I have to agree with the other two comments. I waited more than a month to see this great new show that A & E had been promoting. What a disappointment!!! The show is pretty much all about Ryan Buell. Their voices are campy, not creepy. It sounds like he's talking in a can. From the second episode, which lasts approximately 30 minutes (if you take the commercials), they chase him or follow him something that he knows is demonic. You can not say the name, every time someone needs to convey that name, write it on paper and give it to someone else. It is not particularly informative or entertaining or credible to the rest of us. Why can not you say the name? ... supposedly give the demon more power. Curious, I always thought that demons wanted to hide their true identities. If you know the exact name of the demon, does not it make it easier to expel them? Now the next episode, which airs in a short time, is entitled "exorcism." So, Ryan needs an exorcism already? It does not mean that it could not happen, but the program so far has not provided any evidence or proof of anything. I can tell Ryan that if I were a small child, hell if I were an adult, and someone gave me a small bottle of holy water to scare away something that terrified me, I would seek help elsewhere! Also, if you do not use holy water and blessings, etc. in the right way, do not you risk further infuriating what is already angry with you? I'll probably see him tonight, but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first, it will probably be the last time I see him!
