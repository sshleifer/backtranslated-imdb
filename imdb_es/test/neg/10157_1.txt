There are many films, mainly from the 80s, that are so terrible that you can not help but love them. The last pajama party is one of those. I hate this movie so much, but it's still one of the most viewed movies in my collection. I've seen it countless times and I get a great laugh every time. It is the best example of how in the 80s, ANY movie could be released. <br /> <br /> The name of our killers is Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?) Randles is a psycho killer who runs away between a doctor's robes and a doctor's gown that cuts people off with a scalpel while he advances. He ends up coming through a house of girls who are having a slumber party. One of the girls is the doctor's daughter who tried to operate at Randle's, and Randle ended up throwing him down in some kind of sexual position. (just watch the movie to know what I'm talking about). Now I know what to think about this point: this must be another low budget trick and a bar movie like Slumber Party Massacre, or Valentine's Day Massacre, right? DO NOT! This movie is HORRIBLE! First, the quality of the film changes from time to time throughout the film. Sometimes it looks like it was filmed this year, but sometimes it's so grainy and fuzzy that you can not even see it. The funny thing is that certain specific camera angles will be fuzzy and grainy, and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect, which is absolutely ridiculous and shows that they did not mind at all. <br /> <br /> The director played the killer (as if that was not funny enough), but because he did not have enough talent to act and direct at the same time, he simply shot a shot of him walking towards the camera with your scalpel, and then play that clip again and again every time someone dies. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are completely ridiculous and unpleasant, and these people who must be between 16 and 18 are more like what they are 25-45. I know that Slasher movies tend to use adults as teenagers, but I have never seen a movie in which it was THIS obvious. My guess is that the reason why none of them is still in the film industry today is because they all died of old age ... Or maybe it was because this movie was so horrible that they never wanted to show their faces again, and that's a good thing because I doubt very much that they could have entered more movies even if they tried. All I can do is wait for Tyler to one day participate in THE LAST SLUMBER PARTY 2: THE FINAL CONFLICT and have all the original actors come back. I'm sure everyone would love it. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by Stephen Tyler, (No, not by the singer) who never directed again, and was released by B & S (which I'm sure means bull and ****) Productions. Bull & S just released one more movie, "Forever Evil", which was pretty horrible, but not as bad as Last Slumber Party. <br /> <br /> A horrible, horrible, horrible movie ... Highly recommended.
