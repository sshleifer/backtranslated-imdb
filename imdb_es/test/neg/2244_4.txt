The first half of this movie was pretty good. It was interesting and suspense. The second half was pretty bad. The story of comic book revenge was completed in a circle and we see many Nazi comic characters and some "good guys" who misbehave. There is a lot of violence in this movie. I'm not apprehensive about violence, but I think at least I should have some purpose in a movie. The violence here had little purpose, except to create a genre film in which we see many people being shot with rifles. It is assumed that, in some way, we should have fun with this. <br /> <br /> I have recently seen Reservoir Dogs. There was a movie where violence was used effectively. The created film was realistic in the world. There was never any exaggerated sound effect. It was a crime movie that played directly. The inglorious Basterds should have played directly but they did not. He was rolling his eyes when he saw how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and additional bullets in the head and face. <br /> <br /> None of the background of any of the Basterds is actually explained either. Simply Nazi hunters. We really do not like any of them either because they are too busy cutting scalps and shooting people in the face. It's about "revenge" and very little else. <br /> <br /> Here there were 2 1/2 hours to work, but few of the Basterds were really examined in depth. This seems like it was simply a revenge movie pure and simple. We saw that in Tarantino's last movie, "Death Proof," which did not matter to me either. He suffered the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The first half again, it was pretty good. I wanted to see the exploits of the Inglorious Basterds throughout Europe. I was presented with a much more relaxed film about the resistance movement that planned revenge against some Nazi comedians when they all attend a movie premiere in France.
