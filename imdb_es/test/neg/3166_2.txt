It's Valentine's Day and we decided to stay, have a good dinner and watch this movie at TCM instead of going out. We are between 40 and 50 years old, we love romance, and we are both "softies" but this movie has just been a bomb for us (it's hard to imagine that it was nominated for the Oscars, etc. but I guess that was then). The cinematography was beautiful, but for the most part the film as a whole is terribly old-fashioned. The character of Jennifer Jones made so many references to her that she was Eurasion that we began to tell and after a while we were laughing every time she said it. Add to that the "musical theme" that was heard incessantly throughout the film and we could not wait for it to end before we could see the news of the night.
