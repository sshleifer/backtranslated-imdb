Okay, one night, I and some friends decided to get high and watch a movie. Unfortunately for us, we chose 'Ernest Goes to Africa'. I have never laughed so much in my whole life. This movie is beyond the bad. I have literally taken better films than "Ernest Goes to Africa". (I poop movies) <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie, at least for me, was the opening sequence, when Ernest is making faces. When they showed him a head the size of a peanut, I lost it. Maybe this seemed very funny because at that time I was the tallest. Maybe you're right. <br /> <br /> If I had to guess what George W. Bush's favorite movie is, I guess 'Ernest Goes to Africa'. Never before had I seen a film rely more on the 1950s stereotypes of people of color. There were moments when the words escaped me and I stared in amazement. <br /> <br /> While I was watching this, I could not help but wonder: is this movie for children? Do literate adults really look at this? How could there be a complete 'Ernest' movie franchise? Is this really my life? Is this real? <br /> <br /> I hated this movie.
