First of all, since I'm one of the people who never saw the cut-out version of MST3K from this movie, I can not comment on that. <br /> <br /> However, I saw the original version of this movie on the science fiction channel and I thought it was as good as anything else on that channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their best deals. <br /> <br /> By observing the comments here, I have noticed that people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a minimum of intelligence, consideration and maturity tend to like at least a few things about this film and rightly so. In its original version, most reasonable people think I would probably rate it with at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10. Five is average for me and I think this movie is about average for a science fiction photo. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the above, I have also noticed that critics who seem immature, bored and turned around and as a result come out as bone heads from where I am, are the same ones who can not find anything good in this film and basically, throw it away without cause, based mainly on seeing it cut and filled in MST3K. Or, if you have seen the two cuts, at first it seems that you were greatly harmed by the display of the MST3K.
