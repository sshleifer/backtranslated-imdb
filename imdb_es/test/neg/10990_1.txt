I had a different experience with this movie: it was never charming, nor charming, nor fun for me. a big clue that this was not his typical film was that the label gave no indication of the language (s) spoken of in the film. another was the lack of options in the subtitles. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that the lack of dialogue was annoying, especially when it was accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions, as it almost always was. The inconsistent development of the weak plot was disconcerting. Were there characters, or just vague gestures? Was there even a plot? <br /> <br /> On a separate issue, they ask me to correct the "dialogue" spelling, with the suggested "dialogue" substitute. maybe this movie in its entirety, including the IMDb section, is designed to confuse or surprise, but I'm more upset than fun.
