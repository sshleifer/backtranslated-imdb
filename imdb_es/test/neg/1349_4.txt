I have never seen the original movie that others have commented, so my perspective is only about this film without comparison. <br /> <br /> I found that the message of the film is: If you only worry about yourself, everything will go well with the world, everything will stay in place, your lovers will love you more, your friends will respect you and will they will like more, their employers will want more, they will pay more and even their own children and parents will love him more. <br /> <br /> I find that this message is reprehensible and totally false. <br /> <br /> Congratulations for the very funny birth scene at the end; There is not a mother out there who does not laugh during that scene. <br /> <br /> In general, a very disappointing movie plot. I did not find myself encouraging anyone in this movie. I thought they were all pathetic and self-absorbed individuals who just did not care what happened to them and that is not a movie that people want to see.
