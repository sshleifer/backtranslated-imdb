Tacky, but a little entertaining in the early 90's, the soft-soft comedy features Xena (Sarah Bellemo), Luna (Tamara Landry) and Sola (Nicole Posey), as three teenagers from outer space. Xena's parents have gone on vacation for a couple of days. Following the persistent persuasion of her friends, Xena agrees to take her father's spaceship for a spin. The end resulted? They end up running out of gas in space, and land on the planet Beta 45, also known as Earth. Meanwhile, teenagers Dave (Michael Todd Davis) and Jerry (Ken Steadman) have come to California to spend the summer with Dave's Uncle Bud (Joe Estevez), a vagabond who lives on the beach. The three of them end up meeting our three space girls who have moved away from the accident without a scratch. Uncle Bud is about to be kicked out of his beach cushion, which will soon be doomed, thanks to Sally (Linnea Quigley), who lives on the hill and used to be in a relationship with Bud. She is also a bikini mogul and is trying to win a bikini design contest worth $ 30,000 ... exactly what Bud would need to fix her property, so the girls decide to try to win the prize for him. And that is all friends. Knowing that their thin paper web was barely enough to hold a feature film, the filmmakers subject us to scene after scene of endless parties on the beach with tons of extras turning their half-naked bodies under the scorching sun. Oh, and let's not forget about sex. There is enough of that. Before continuing, I need to put this movie in context. It was released in 1993, long before the arrival of labels as soft as Surrender Cinema and Seduction Cinema. Compared to these newer, sharper and more explicit films, the soft core films of the 90s seem to be somewhat soft. When Beach Babes From Beyond first came out in 1993 from the Full Moon affiliate, Torchlight Entertainment, it was announced as the debut release of a label that specialized in "mature public" type films. Needless to say, times have changed. This particular film genre has gone from some torrid but brief sex scenes and fleeting glimpses of female frontal nudes to extended sex scenes that sometimes threaten to venture into the realm of hardcore. Looking at Beach Babes From Beyond again after watching it at its 93 'release, it is safe to say that if this same movie were made today, there would be much more emphasis on sex scenes and less time spent on Plot and Dialogue. As for the sex scenes themselves, they tend to be cold and hot. Our three space girls do not waste time in feeling comfortable with the guys that night. So each pair gets a soft core scene, complete with an annoying camera work in slow motion and too dark lighting. They're not really that horrible, and they're surprisingly graphic at some points, especially on the scene between Xena and Jerry that takes place in the back of a trailer. But the one sex scene that REALLY leaves a lasting impression, and causes you to be surprised at its general intensity, occurs very soon in the movie. Sally is attending a topless photo with three of her models posing by a pool. All the actresses in this scene are beautiful, beautiful, but Nikki Fritz stands out from the two due to their huge presence. Remember that at this point in his career he still had to reach the kind of huge popularity that would soon follow. Her nude posture by a pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence in which she shows off her soapy body in a bathtub and then again when she walks away from her bath. Walking towards the bed towards an almost naked boy pumped in the wait, we get a full nude scene with his back almost heart-shaped and his back perfectly fit. It's good that Nikki's back is so muscular since she's about to do a good workout. Nikki spends the following minutes completely naked with a handsome man in a variety of positions in a scene that is filmed completely differently than the other three scenes of love. Here there is no dark light or annoying slow motion ... only two actors in a huge bed, without sheets and blankets that seem to be acting just in time. The ecstatic body language of Nikki serves to demonstrate that a few other actresses like to film sex scenes as much as she does. It really is the only time that Beach Babes From Beyond delivers the products. But even without this spectacular scene, I recommend this film only for the fact that it is quite visible and never boring, not thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive cast, many of which will appear in several direct functions to video in the rest of the decade.
