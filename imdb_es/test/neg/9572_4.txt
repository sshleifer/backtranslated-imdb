I had to lower my rating of this movie to 4 due to the terrible sound track. I'm pretty sure it was not a problem with me or with the tape, because some actors and the soundtrack sounded really good. But most of the voices of the actors were distorted or distorted beyond recognition, especially for non-Britons. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of nice little twists that would make this a nice movie. - but a lot of the humor was lost in the sound.
