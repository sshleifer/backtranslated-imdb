This is possibly the worst documentary I've seen. He looked so amateurish. Chris Hegedus was one of the Directors of The War Room, which was a great movie (albeit a bit one-sided), but it looked beautiful Startup.com looked like it was filmed in a guy's basement. The quality was so pitiful that I could not stand to see it. I saw about 30 minutes or so and had to take it back to Blockbuster and get something else. I can not understand how something so fond of someone like Chris Hegedus. How the hell did this win any prize to start? The War Room definitely deserved a prize, as well as another great documentary called Ameragosa (both won awards). This documentary seemed to have been made by Uncle Joe, who also does weddings on weekends. Unstable lighting, dim, unflattering, bad sound, a 10 year old could make a better movie than that guy.
