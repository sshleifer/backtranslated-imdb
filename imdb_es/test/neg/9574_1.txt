The old bat transforms into a young woman who looks good after drinking a potion. This movie was terrible. The atrocious performance. The camera work made me turn my head. And it presents the longest and extremely boring striptease that has ever been filmed. Piero Vivarelli should be ashamed to direct this. Eduardo Manzanos Brochero should have been included in the black list just for writing something so horrible. Do not rent this movie, the only exception to which I can do this is maybe if you are dying and you have less than 90 minutes to live, watch this movie. It will feel like an eternity and you will be begging Grip Reaper to come a little early. <br /> <br /> My grade: F
