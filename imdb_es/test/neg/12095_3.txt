Consider "I know everything" The action hero is lighting a cigarette in the dark. While trying to hide / seek the bad guys. (Probably to give a signal light to say here that I will come) <br /> <br /> That is one of the 100 scenes that you can laugh at. (I think the movie should be in the Comedy category). <br /> <br /> Directed horribly, horrible script, bad acting, cheap special effects. (They used a tunnel so they could hide acting in the dark) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (that also makes me laugh when I see those pathetic mistakes)
