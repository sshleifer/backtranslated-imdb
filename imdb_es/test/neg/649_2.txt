If you like bad movies, this is a real pleasure. Kaufman and Peters wobble in robes of robots, escape from slavery only to wander aimlessly and find the true love of robots. I think this is the first movie that made me think about going out. I must bear in mind that I was 12 years old, and I could entertain myself with bright objects.
