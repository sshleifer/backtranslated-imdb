Is it possible to give a rating of 0 out of 10? Because he deserves it. While I'm not a big fan of Jane Austen's books, I sat through this with two women who are. Well, at least we laugh a lot about how bad this movie is. Robert Hardy was the only actor with charisma in the whole affair, although he exaggerated it as he usually does (almost as bad as William Shatner). But that was not enough to save this stinking of total suckitude. It is often difficult to separate the dream sequences of the girls from what is "really" happening, and in the story there are many holes that you can barely imagine what is happening. Too many loose ends and the end feels like a climax of "re-tuning next week". The main actress is too stupid and strange looking to be a heroine, the protagonist looks too silly and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like a kind of new and cheap pet project of the director's hippie daughter ( I mean the saxophone? Mixed with some kind of space opera woman who laments?). So, in conclusion, I suggest you ruin the budget and order a DVD of it as soon as possible. Especially if you like disappointment.
