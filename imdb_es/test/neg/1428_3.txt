Strangeland is a terrible horror / technological thriller. Dee Snider plays Carleton Hendricks, a disgusting computer fan who prays to girls through chat rooms. His ridiculous philosophies about pain and suffering are wrong and totally unfounded. There is no link to reality with the ideas presented in this film, it's more as if Dee Snider sits down and tries to think of the strangest possible things to impress horror fans and maybe some of his old ones fanatics, but the end result is just horrible. Unfortunately for me, as a fan of horror, the cover of this movie looks very good and immediately caught my attention, which is the main reason why I was fooled into seeing it. I assure you that this is not a quality horror movie. It is a disturbing but boring attempt to suggest what might happen in the minds of people who treat themselves as Carleton Hendricks did in this film. The sad part is that NO ONE does this by himself. Marilyn Freakin 'Manson does not even get that far, and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the movie was not meant to make fun of his kind of music (that would be a stab to Snider himself.), it's more like Dee Snider trying to get up from the race and introduce himself as a sick-minded individual once again. Dee, it seems that the time has come to let everything die ...
