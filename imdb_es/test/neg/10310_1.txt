Oh boy! Oh boy! On the worn VHS cover there's a picture of Sandra Bullock and her name written on the top. I think the only reason they had the opportunity to sell the movie in the nineties was by the name of Sandra Bullock. Bullock fans do not have to disappoint. Sandra is the only thing that can be seen in this film and her performance is the only one that can be called acting. Rest of the movie? It's fun to see it in the first fifteen minutes because it's bad, but after that it's worse. Much worse. Directing is horrible. Acting is horrible. Script is horrible. The dialogue is horrible. The action is horrible. The music is pretty good actually. Typical score of the action movies of the eighties. This movie is so bad that it comes close to anything Andy Sidaris has produced. It's so bad that there is not a proper word to describe this poor attempt to be a movie. But still, there was Sandra Bullock. And super great (sarcasm) Jake LaMotta who tried to be Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> I think you can now get the movie on DVD. It could be great! And they should write on the cover: WINNER OF THE ACADEMY SANDRA BULLOCK IN HANGMEN PRIZE <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
