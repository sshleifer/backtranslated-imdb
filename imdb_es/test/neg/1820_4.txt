It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it's not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather dark film to my Alan Rickman movie collection. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how the talented Mr. Rickman gets into these mediocre movies? Judas Kiss has several wonderful actors, an interesting plot and intriguing turns, but his strange visual tours and editing cuts ruined what could have been a great criminal drama. Many scenes seem to lack vital information to explain the character's actions: Why did our hero immediately suspect his bosses? Why did he distrust the detective he replaced? There were times when, honestly, I could not tell if the director wanted Judas Kiss to be a legitimate criminal drama or a sarcastic parody. Why else would I do it in a topless / alien / lesbian porn scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me fight over the remote since my kids were playing nearby)? Did he purposely instruct his two distinguished English actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use the terrible accents of New Orleans? As Alan Freak, I confess that I still believed that Mr. Rickman was sexy: in a kind of wrinkled, tired way, "take it home and tuck-him". <br /> <br /> Judas Kiss is not a great movie, but it has some interesting moments, but I do not recommend it unless you're trying to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.
