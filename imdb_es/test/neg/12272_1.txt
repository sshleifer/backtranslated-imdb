Let's face it, a really horrible movie, no ... I mean a "really" horrible movie, it's kind of weird, weird and beautiful to look at. I admit that there is a special place in my heart for films like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Half Caste, Species, etc. And even though I give this film a 1, I urge everyone who enjoys a bad movie for what it really is (a bad movie) to find a friend, snacks, something to drink and make the special occasion it deserves: Aussie Park Boyz. <br /> <br /> From the first moments of the side by side of the main actor, the play of the eyes while trying to inject intensity directly into the film without looking at a camera (a slice of ham taken out of silent images (removing the heart to Rudolph Valentino) to the sudden conclusion that we are out of the movie, you ... will not ... stop laughing. <br /> <br /> To summarize the movie, you are a warrior of poor men, complete - and that single description should be enough, but then come the wonders of "the spaghetti scene," "the" We have your tickets, they will not leave the city scene now, "" It's the Asians! ! "and more, the only really objectionable part is a rape filmed for free, and outside of this, I encourage you to watch this movie, and I dare to find evidence of acting, or lines, or direction, or any of those other boring elements. and superfluous that the so-called critical icos say that a movie should be judged as good. <br /> <br /> If this movie does not cause fits of uncontrollable laughter before it ends, all I can do is roll my eyes in a threatening way and shout: "Dog, dog! Dog!"
