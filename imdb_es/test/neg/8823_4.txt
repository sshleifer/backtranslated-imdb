"I have not laughed so much since Grandma got trapped in the drainer," says one of the bored in this hilarious quasi-parody of all those undead films of Val Lewton and George A. Romero that we have come to love (or dislike , depending on your personal taste) through the years. <br /> <br /> In this story, a couple of young actors play a macabre joke about the rest of their company after a spooky night, they visit a cemetery island. Alan, its artistic director, tries to make the dead come back to life by performing a very stylized ritual. <br /> <br /> Too much screen time is badly invested; Amateur dialogue includes ingenuity, melodrama and other unnecessary filler comments (and Alan can not stop that irritating laugh ... too much!). Once the action starts (approaching the end of this movie), it's worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> I saw it on a TV show from a local night station that showed movies very similar to this one ... it just scared me at the age of 13 ... but again, I could laugh in its way, to the bitter end ... ... which is probably the reason, at present, for which very few people still use those who are tied to the hip.
