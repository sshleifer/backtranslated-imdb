If you have just seen All Dogs Go To Heaven and you learn that there is a sequel, do not look at it. It is awful. It is absolutely horrible. The characters hurry to develop. Sasha, for example, begins to sing about how you can tell her for love. And in the end, this looks more like a dramatic romantic movie than a comedy and adventure movie. They remove Charlie from his character and replace him with a version of himself, suffocating, but still rebellious. <br /> <br /> The humor behind Carface's character is completely lost. It is a totally different dog. He no longer has a good voice, he is no longer that villain you love to hate, he is just a weakling with the voice of Spongebob's Mermaid Man. Speaking of voice actors ... <br /> <br /> Charlie has a completely different voice. And while it's not horrible, I do not like it. It's terrible compared to the excellent work that Burt Reynolds did for the character in the first movie. Dom DeLuise is wonderful as always, like Itchy. That character stays true, and that's why this movie gets a 3/10. Purely because Dom DeLuise was still expressing Itchy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and my last complaint. I know that Ann-Marie's movie was already ready, that now she has parents, etc., but Charlie forgot completely about her or what? I do not mention it to ALL in the second movie. I mean, even a small mention of Itchy would have been acceptable. (ex "Charlie, we have to go back in. You can not take care of all the children who need to be rescued.) Or something like that, I mean, he died living with her, she deserves some kind of mention. <br /> < Do not look at this if you're looking for a wonderful sequel.
