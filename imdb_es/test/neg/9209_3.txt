The movie begins with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a businessman who has just finished his lunch at a neighborhood grocery store. It seems he does not have enough money to cover the check. Instead of looking for your plastic, look around to see if the coast is clear and away from the place without paying. Unbeknownst to Charlie, "Lulu" (Melanie Griffith) had been watching him from the other side of the store. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" is adorned with what happened to the fresco in the 1980s with a brunette page - Boy Cut. She follows him to let him know that he saw what he did. He tries to deny it, but he can not escape his accusation. Thinking that he is in that, Charlie is surprised when "Lulu" says that he does not work for the store and then offers him a trip back to work. <br /> <br /> When she goes in the opposite direction, she starts her way. throughout the Mid-Atlantic coastline. <br /> <br /> We're supposed to be thrilled when the completely modern "Lulu" puts Charlie in a humiliating situation. It's fine when the two consenting adults get a little perverted in a motel room, but they feel upset when they get out of paying the check in a family-style restaurant. Stealing the work of hardworking people is not my idea of ​​"wild". Charlie is an idiot. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" is a crazy fool. She begins to move Charlie as her husband. First with his mother (who gladly tolerates the farce) and then at his 10-year high school reunion (an event later used by another movie "Grosse Pointe Blank", too cool for his own good). br /> <br /> The "marriage" is a surprise to the true husband of "Lulu" (Ray Liotta), who has just been released from prison for armed robbery. Ray welcomes them both and shows them how unpleasant the crime really is. <br /> <br /> I can not add any irony to writing that I first saw it when stepping into the cinema. No, I do not do that kind of thing. I recorded it on cable television and I assure you that I see it strictly in the privacy of my own home. <br /> <br /> So I started thinking about why I recorded it when I do not like it very much and I conclude. that 20 years ago was in a reggae kick and the soundtrack of "Something Wild" has a prominent role in reggae. The final credits begin with the treatment of Sister Carol interpreting her version of "Wild Thing".
