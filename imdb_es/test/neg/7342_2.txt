I am surprised by all the good reviews on the cover of this film and in IMDb. It belongs to the $ 2 bin in your local video store. To say that this is a B film is extremely generous. <br /> <br /> Besides lacking a single redeemable character, just a little better than the average performance, and the image quality of the ugly 80s style, the script of this movie is boring and lifeless. This movie is not only boring, it's pathetic. (It is true that occasionally there is a slightly interesting chemistry between the two main characters). Even the final spin of the plot, rather, the only spin of the plot, does not save this movie. <br /> <br /> Rent "Diamond Men" if you must, but do not hesitate to turn it off once you have appreciated its uselessness. 2 out of 10
