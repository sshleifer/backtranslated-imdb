I can not understand how this image was allowed to be made. It is mostly, if not completely, so inaccurate that the main character does not even look like how the story makes him physically see. This movie made me go online and check my books to make sure I remember Nero's personality correctly. For God's sake, I have a book that mentions Nero as one of the most evil people in the world and the movie made me feel bad for him. I must say that Aggrapina's character seemed to be close to my understanding of her, both physically and psychologically. Although, all the actors did a good job, the movie was terrible and I'm sure that I will not see any other fact for this sorry team.
