How can anyone even begin to like this movie is really beyond me? <br /> <br /> The idea? It has none. "A boy fell apart." That's the idea. Wow. An environment was killing him slowly ... now THAT is original and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This is Fasbinder's first film I've seen ... I've heard he's a genius of staging. scene, but I've seen student films with more attention, inspiration, idea and art than this ... this ... this nothing. It has nothing! <br /> <br /> Each shot is too long. There is so much emptiness in them ... The acting is horrible. You can see that the actors did not have any preparation at all, they did not understand their roles, not even an attempt to show emotions ... it's so ... superficial ... The lines are so explanatory that you could eliminate 90% of them and They still have the same fucking movie. Tempo? Who cares. Atmosphere, dynamic, that's for pussies! One shot per scene, 80% of the time people look in an unrealistic way, having no idea how to represent emotions and the importance of the moment, in addition to empty looks to the camera or to each other ... Editing? All the editing rules have been ignored without payments of any kind ... Photograph? Half of the shots are reflected in them, and a horrible lighting without styling of any kind. Shadows, shadow play ... who needs that? We need a man urinating, drinking, beating his wife as if he were ... as if he were acting. We need a lot of close-ups of a not-so-beautiful woman ... we need an amateur climax from her capture by an unconvincing Arab torturer ... This movie has so many mistakes that it's not worth the budget. I had it. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I have not seen such a bad movie since American Pie 5. Yes. That's wrong. <br /> <br /> I just started watching your movie "Veronica Foss", which looks a lot better, based on the first 15 minutes (since it has a touch of direction and artistic idea, unlike this crap), so I'm not going to argue that Fasbinder has no idea ... but this ... this movie sucks!
