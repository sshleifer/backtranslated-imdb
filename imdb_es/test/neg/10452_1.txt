The science fiction channel thinks that this is science fiction; It is a pity. Big bugs, snakes, mythical beasts, again and again, persist. <br /> <br /> Someone at Universal had the brains to include BattleStar Galactica (the new and good one) and Firefly for a brief moment in their line up. I know they know they make a difference between total trash and science fiction of very high quality. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, they started talking about how they were becoming great and powerful, making productions that were not just for us. Simple, lick-o Trekkies. Thank you very much, Sci-Fi! You know, you make movies so bad that even Trekkies will not see them, so you achieved your goal! The fire snake, the ice spiders, Manticore, Larva, etc. and a huge garbage storm later, and they are still happening faster than the last flu virus! How they do it is beyond my knowledge. Why they do it, I just do not know. How can you ignore these comments, comments, blogs and emails, I do not know either, but it is clear that they are not very interested in your audience or care about our opinions. They seem to think that this is what science fiction fans want! One would think that one or two good productions with a certain sense would slip when the green light of this garbage is on vacation. At least they are using the Misfit Toys collection; Many of the actors in the science fiction film of the week were in science fiction programs once and now they need money. I love you, and I hope you have a better job!
