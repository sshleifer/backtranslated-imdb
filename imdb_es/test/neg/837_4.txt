The film begins with an excellent shootout, where three bandits are quickly killed by a bounty hunter: a bounty hunter who has more than a superficial appearance of the nameless Man of the Clint Eastwood trilogy (FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR FEW DOLLARS MORE and GOOD BAD AND ELOJOSO. <br /> <br /> Immediately after, you see this man in a gold train full of Union soldiers, Naturally, the shipment is attacked and all the soldiers fight like blind people, so they are quickly neutralized, however, in one turn, one of the bandits cheats the leader of the band (Gilbert Roland) and moves away with the gold.Rather, Roland catches up and is about to discover where the gold is hidden. But, just at that moment, the army appears and kills the traitor ... annoyance, however, the aspiring Man without a name believes that Roland knows about the treasure and perhaps a medallion that Roland gave to the traitor has the key. strange banker, It is also thrown into the mix. The three of them want the gold and the three of them seem quite macho. <br /> <br /> In general, this is not a particularly distinguished Western. Much is the plot, another part is that George Hilton (a Uruguayan despite the name that sounds in the United States) is not as interesting as Eastwood or some of the other main stars of Spaghetti Western, but most is because the soundtrack it just sucks. Very often the music does not even come close to the interpretation and it seems that it is added almost randomly. Also, it's just not very good too. Clearly, this is not the work of Ennio Morricone, master of Spaghetti music. <br /> <br /> In general, just a time passer, and it's not particularly good to boot.
