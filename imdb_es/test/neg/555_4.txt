I can accept the fact that this was the NEXT child of karate, so Ralph Macchio can happily retire from the series, and although Hillary Swank is great for the role ... the plot of the film is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Mr. Miyagi's old friend from World War II dies, leaving his widow to look after her rebellious granddaughter when her parents die in an accident. The girl still has no discipline, she is the hero because the local ROTC ... which I will explain in a minute, she has to catch it. You know the exercise ... Miyagi takes it under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and they all live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> It's great, it's corny, it's from the 90s ... but that is not even long and short. My first case of "huh?" Why is there a "military division" in high school? I thought things came out in the 1960s, especially in a public school. As much as Michael Ironside kicks the booty in his role as the main heel, since when is a soldier involved in a high school? My next complaint is that during the prom scene, the militants jump by force to scare people ... why? What I noticed throughout the 4 films was that in the end, the heels suddenly turned up after all the nonsense with which the main character put (Billy in part 1, Sato in part 2, Kreese in part 3). This movie is not different. After Ned and his friends basically sabotage the prom, they blow up Eric's car and threaten Hillary Swank the whole movie ... Ironside tells them to hit her and they're like "um ... no". If you go pathetic turns to the face, at least make sure the characters have not done anything too much at the top, like flying a hot rod. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the love story between Eric and Hillary Swank. ... cheesy, but nothing melodramatic, which is a breath of fresh air from the trash that Ralph Macchio took out in the first 3 movies. <br /> <br /> I'll say it for your own movie, after watching the first 3 movies. I can accept that it's more or less a turn ... but I can not accept the whole military issue, too weird for him to take it seriously. Now, if Ironside and the crew were a fighting / soccer team and he was the coach, THAT would have been more credible. <br /> <br /> Ironside and Morita deliver the goods, Swank is fine ... the rest is the same In any case, the highlight is when they blow up the hot rod, THAT was great 4 of 10
