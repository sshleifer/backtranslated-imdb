While it would be easy and accurate to explain why 'Reba' is, in the end, indicative of many 'family-oriented comedies' by the way it emerges from other better comedies, the truth is that the program is repetitive, full of stereotypes of more fun and innovative shows, and the leading star is completely out of its element. Although I am sure that Mrs. McIntire can sing and has a fan base that supports her, being in a sitcom and calling the next Lucille Ball is far from the truth. <br /> <br /> Reba herself does not have the presence that is needed here to establish the fact that she is chosen as the woman her entire family is focused on. However, after watching some episodes there is no real connection with the character. I could not care less about his adventures because his whole character seems to be MIA. Reba McIntire has no presence on the screen, and making a show around her seems short-sighted and indicative of most "family-oriented" programs: pushing a comedy full of stereotypes of stupid men / women doing all that They do not attract anyone. But those who can not pay for the cable. <br /> <br /> The show is a waste of time. The only good thing is that at least he has better production values ​​than his standard PAX scam ... alone.
