Opulent sets and sumptuous costumes well photographed by Theodor Sparkuhl, and a good (not excellent) performance by Jannings since Henry can not overcome poor writing and static camera work. Henny Porten chews the landscape like Anne. <br /> <br /> Everything is very beautiful; But everything is surface and there is no depth. The melodramatic story of an offended woman was a success in the United States where the Expressionist "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" failed in the same year (1920), showing that what is popular is not what lasts. Lubitsch would be remembered for his funny comedies, not for sterile shows like this.
