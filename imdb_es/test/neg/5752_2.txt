For many months I expected this release. The previews looked good, the first reports on the network were encouraging, and Golden eye and Timesplitters were excellent shooters (from the same people). It turns out that I was very deceived! Haze had the potential to be up to date with Call of Duty 4 and other next generation shooters, however, it looks, plays and feels like something from 5 years ago. I played Haze on a 1080 TV and at first I was disappointed that the developers of the game had limited the graphics to 720. Haze's universe lacks details and atmosphere, the feeling that "they must have rushed to finish this" is always there. <Br /> <br /> The controls are slow and cumbersome, and I still have to find an adjustment for the sensitivity of the x / y axis. There are many parts of the game for a single player that are very dark (visually), to the point where you can not really see where you are going. Why not add a torch function like in Halo? Or even better, night vision? The use of the "nectar" of drugs that improves performance is interesting, however, just as you get used to it, you change sides and do not use it again! Why bother? I could go on with many more Haze faults, but instead I'll just say NO BETTER! Wait for killzone 2 or play call of duty 4 and try to unlock the golden AK!
