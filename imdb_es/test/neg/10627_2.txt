In what tries to be a positive story, Dolph Lundgren leads a group of mercenaries to take over a tropical island that looks a lot like paradise, so that the men who hired his team can exploit it for ... excrement birds. Actually, the nitrogen gas that emanates from the dirt on this island is what they are looking for. <br /> <br /> There was only one good thing about this movie: the location of the island where it was filmed was beautiful. Otherwise, the story drowns leaving the actors with nothing to work with. Result: A lot of violence, a lot of language, lots of blood and some photos of topless women. If you want senseless violence (sorry, the story can not even give a point to the violence, even if it tries), then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Parents: be careful that this movie is full of Violence and blood, driving the R qualification
