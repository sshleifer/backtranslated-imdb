At my local video rental store, they have a special place for Two Girls and a Guy. It's a really long joke. The employee lets people rent it for free. They value their clients too much to allow them to lose the money they have struggled so hard to earn. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised to see that people gave this movie a good review. Maybe someone will explain it to me. (Or maybe the positive comments were jokes? Did the people involved with the film write them? Maybe the director's mother / writer?) <br /> <br /> Maybe I just saw so many good movies that this one fails compared.
