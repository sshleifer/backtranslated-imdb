Abderrahmane Sissako may have known what he was doing when he did "Bamako", but the rest of us can just sit in mystification and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have been. <br /> <br /> The nominal The "plot" involves a young African singer who is planning to leave her husband unemployed to look for work in the city. But much more screen time is devoted to what the film's publicists describe as "a mock trial against key financial institutions" that deal with "the overwhelming economic difficulties of Africa." That's all good, I suppose, but when the arguments and ideas are presented in an uncharacteristic and pedantic way as they are here, they lose strength and impact. In other words, if the director had found the means to really incorporate issues such as the detrimental effect of colonialism on the African people and the problem of the African debt on something remotely resembling a compelling story, the film could have reached the intellectual and emotional level. The resonance now clearly lacks. <br /> <br /> The issues the film deals with can be relevant and important, but try to spend what amounts to two hours of apologizing as a true, honest God. It is not likely that the film will get a great audience for the message.
