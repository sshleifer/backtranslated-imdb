This shows how terrible the WB Network was in the last years of its existence. As a student at home, of course I regret this show for its ridiculous fantasy land, dark and unfunny stereotypes about children being "weird hippies who are so smart that they are away from the super cool high school students". Sorry, TV writers, the world seen from inside your ass (which contains your heads apparently when you wrote this program) is NOT the world that talented people see with our eyes while we live in a small thing called reality. As for those who really liked this show ... please, dear sweet Jesus PLEASE, reconsider the claim that you really liked this shit on a very long walk. The performance is even more hollow, fake and wooden than the stereotypes on which the whole show was built. Thank you, WB, for doing the right thing and getting this horse out of its misery from beginning to end. This program never, should not even have had the privilege of being done, let alone eight horrible episodes. I really hope that these actors finally have a clue and stop playing roles in television trash shows like this as soon as this program ended.
