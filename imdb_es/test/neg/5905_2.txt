This film begins with the main character in a coma in a hospital room, attended by two ordinances. The unconscious main character is heard in a voice-over, saying that the ordinances are homosexual. The trainers kiss. I saw it in a DVD version and I suspect that it's supposed to be fun. He said "comedy" in the DVD case, after all, and so on. If I had seen it in a movie theater, I probably would have heard a part of the audience roar with laughter, because it is very funny and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy. While it is fascinating to think what is fun and what is not, this film unfortunately only offers arguments about what it is not. <br /> <br /> Bright brains can DO Anything funny, people like Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have shown it. But you have to know the mechanics, "I suppose, the director and co-screenwriter Dani Levy does not care about those mechanisms, thinks that certain things are just funny, the fact that two ordinances are homosexual and kiss a man in a coma Do not get me wrong, some people can MAKE IT funny, Dani Levy can not, not for me, anyway. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with this movie is that I can not see One reason Behind the road the main characters behave I could not understand why the two brothers, one of them an orthodox Jew from West Germany and a third class copy of Fast Eddie Felson from the former East Germany, were so upset with each other Both are pretty dull characters, their children are boring, apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other (well, one is a lesbian now but raising the daughter she has with her cousin). incestuous ones? If something is embarrassing, just come as an excuse because the writers could not find anything better. <br /> <br /> The performance is not bad, I really liked Udo Semel although I remembered more of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl (a lighter version) than a venerable Orthodox Jew. The direction itself is not very bad either, but maybe Levy should continue directing the films, leaving the writing to someone else. Now I heard that he did a comedy about Hitler. Oi, Vai!
