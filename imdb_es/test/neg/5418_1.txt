One of the worst movies I saw in the 90s. I often use it as a point of reference when watching other movies; "At least it was not as bad as Caro Diario." Three absolutely useless segments, all with the director playing himself, and it's not that interesting. A whole segment about this hypochondriac goes to the doctor. Another that presents him walking through the countryside on his scooter. For three interesting minutes and another fifteen tortuous ones. <br /> <br /> The only redemption factor was that the scooter scene fit the 'Cologne Concert' of Keith Jarrett. He encouraged me to go home and rediscover that wonderful album. The best thing you can say about the director / actor / egotist is that he has a great musical taste.
