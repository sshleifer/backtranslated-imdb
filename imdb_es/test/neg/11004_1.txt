Yes, it is a classic of SBIF (So Bad It's Funny). With a budget of tens of dollars, some of the most abysmal performances I've ever seen, and ANY time, not even remotely frightening, not even a nanosecond! The camera work was at the elementary school level: one that was still filmed outside a house was obviously manual and moved wildly. The blood looked like a watery Koolaid cherry, someone made a trip to the local butcher shop to find the "human" bones, and Miss Witch had the cheapest mask Wal-Mart could provide. In the final cut and realize how messy this was? Most of the names in the credits HAVE to be pseudonyms, it would be a suicide in your career to have THIS on your resume. Do yourself a favor and watch Ebert's video of his colonoscopy!
