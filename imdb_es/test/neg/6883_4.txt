It is difficult to comment on this movie. It's one of the few movies that Dimension has not really left out (it's hard to find a reason why) and was rushed to an impressive 500 theaters on the day of its opening. Perhaps Dimension feared how people would respond to a swamp creature using their tow truck to separate a house piece by piece. <br /> <br /> Ray Sawyer is just a tow truck driver, until he rescues a voodoo priestess from a bad car accident and, in return, is attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowned. In the morgue, Ray comes back to life and stalks a group of teenagers who witnessed the terrible accident. <br /> <br /> What reduces this film is its paper in thin characters. I did not care for any of them one moment. Also, the dialogue was less than boring. Also, it was very predictable. The characters did things typical of the stupid horror movie character, such as checking for squeaking noises, invoking names of people and tripping over a rock while being chased. I could also immediately choose who would be the final girl. And why did the camera have those quick white flashes every time someone died or when the killer was shown? <br /> <br /> What is good? Well, there is an impressive suspense scene where the killer walks under the swamp waters to reach his victims and a tense sequence in which the final girl must camouflage herself with a bunch of other corpses while the killer watches. <br /> <br /> But other than that, it's another August / September disappointment. I was waiting for it, but I did not get what I expected.
