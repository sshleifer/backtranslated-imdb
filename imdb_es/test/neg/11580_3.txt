A team of amateur journalists and tree robbers discover a secret government project, the Carnivore Project, on a remote island in the South Pacific. Scientists are producing giant-sized corn, but the genes are spreading to other species, creating abnormally large Komodo dragons and a cobra (one that is bulletproof and swims underwater). With the help of the scientist's daughter, can they escape from the island and tell the world? Even if I had not seen this movie on the science fiction channel (which, unfortunately, I did), I would shout "Science Fiction Channel" with its low production value, weak acting and some of the worst special effects in history. The effects here are comparable to another creature's movie, "Island Raptor," though not so bad. I suspect that there must be at least a handful of people who worked on both films, but I have not bothered to confirm it and probably will not. It will be a sad day when I go back to see some of the movies. <br /> <br /> Which does not mean it's not pleasant. I saw him at two in the morning with my sister's boyfriend and I can not speak for him, but I thought it was a good use of time. The downside is that it's a fun picture if you like to make fun of the movies and the daughter of the scientist is attractive enough to take the film (I think the name of the actress is Michelle Borth). Michael Pare also appears as a ship captain, and his bad choice of roles here makes his work in "Furnace" look respectable (even if that movie is intolerably bad). <br /> <br /> I can not be too much. difficult in this movie simply because it was more or less exactly what I thought it would be. Bad effects? Low budget? Actors without a name? I did not have much hope. However, this does not mean it is impressive, either. Arriving at par is nothing to be proud of and it will slowly fade into the distant memory department. For the fan who likes this movie (and calls it "KvC"), save your copy because it will cost you a lot to get a replacement.
