Computer expert John Light (like John Elias) moves from Stanford's school dropout to the successful young tycoon of the Dotcom era. But Mr. Light's mocking success could be short-lived, with partners like the ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (like Robert Jennings). Mr. Donovan used to sleep with Light's girlfriend, Megan Dodds (as Lisa Forrester). Donovan wants Light to know that excessive drinking and casual sex do not have to end in college. After reading a sex session on the Internet, Mrs. Dodds illuminates the light. You may also lose the Internet empire "Digital dreams"! Veterans who try unsuccessfully to deliver dramatic gravitas include Mia Farrow (like Anna Simmons) who sucks red popsicles and Hol Holbrook (like Tom Walker), who hates computers quickly. Mrs. Farrow looks sweet with her paddles. <br /> <br /> *** Purpose (2/21/02) Alan Lazar ~ John Light, Jeffrey Donovan, Mia Farrow
