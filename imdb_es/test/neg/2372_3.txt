This is a comedy version of "Strangers in a Train". It works pretty well I am a hard student, so the grade 3 is mainly reflected in the characters and the plot. The performances are extremely good, all of them. Of course, the two stars, DeVito and Crystal, are the brightest. Each interpreter acts well enough to play. The comedy works at a level just below slapstick. The DeVito characters work best when they are depraved. Your character, represented as a writing hack, would probably be more real if published and praised as much as most hackers. His character would have, in real life, a great agent and multiple requests. The characters are one-dimensional, which is fine in comedy. But the character of Crystals is not written very well. His desire to kill the "mom" suddenly does not make any sense. It seems an unfortunate attempt at humor. Unfortunate attempts are not very frequent, and the film flows quite well.
