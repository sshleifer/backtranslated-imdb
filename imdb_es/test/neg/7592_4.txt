"House of the Damned" (also known as "Specter") is one of his horror films of low-budget haunted houses, full of mediocre performances and economic effects. It is a family that inherits an old Irish mansion, and after moving out begins to experience strange phenomena and ghostly apparitions, including the ghost of a young woman who was murdered and buried inside a wall in the basement of the mansion. The young daughter of the couple is then taken to another dimension and seek help from a group of paranormal investigators in search of help. <br /> <br /> The ideas that this film took from the film "Poltergeist" of the haunted house of 1982 are obvious. I'll say that this movie has some slightly creepy sequences, but sometimes it's very, very boring. The performance here is nothing special, the mood is good, the score (which was mainly the dramatic music of the Irish opera) was annoying, and CGI's special effects are really horrible. I mean, it was 1996, you'd think they could have done a little better than them. The end where the house was on fire was the poorest special effect I've seen, very, very cheap. But hey, this was a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> Also, the translucent monster wolf thing your daughter sees looks horribly false. And what was its meaning in the movie anyway? What the hell does a wolf-monster have to do with a haunted house? The special effects here are what really ruined this movie. The acting was pretty bad too. I usually enjoy a lot of low budget horror movies, but it is not. "House of the Damned" is nothing special, just consider seeing it if you have nothing better to do. But you probably want to transmit it. 4/10.
