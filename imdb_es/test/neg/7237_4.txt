I hated that the first movie was really boring and we only got to see Octopus at the end. <br /> <br /> The plot They are finding bodies in the port of New York. The police have no clues or suspects until Nick and his colleague realize that the killer is a giant octopus. Everyone, especially the police captain, refuses to believe Nick's story, and soon the port will be filled with boats for the celebrations of July 4 ... <br /> <br /> In this film we can see more of the giant The octopus and the special effects for this movie are really good for their moment. <br /> <br /> The performance is that this movie is not bad, but not excellent either, but it's fine and you can see it. <br /> <br /> There are some really cheese scenes in the movie, but if you can overcome that, you should enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5/10
