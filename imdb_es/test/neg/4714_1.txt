Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It is so well filmed, the focus is not even on this alleged "real mestizo", but on the team that comes from Hollywood to make the film. I do not have any cinematographic importance, and if I could recover the almost 1 1/2 hours that I spent watching this movie, I would feel much better. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, it starts by giving you the impression that it will be filmed in a somewhat generic way, like a real Hollywood production. However, they then enter into the narrative of the story, and it is filmed in a tremendously terrible way. It's supposed to be a version of the "Blair Witch Project" actually, since they use a lot of what you think is "real camera images", it's not like that, do not kid yourself. have you ever seen . . . On the positive side, it has as a semi-terrifying scene, and the images of the mestiza were not so bad at all. NO RENT
