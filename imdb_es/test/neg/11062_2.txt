A virtual copy of The Cave saves for lesser budget effects and a slightly different plot. I knew the movie was going downhill when I saw the false lights of the campfire that were clearly reflected in the face of one of the actors. The conflicts between the characters and the subplots seemed to be useless, and they added nothing to the movie, except for less moments of silence. The acting was not as bad as the typical B movie, and there was some credibility in his fear, but as professional cavers, they seem to be too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession. In general it's not worth losing $ 4.50 to rent.
