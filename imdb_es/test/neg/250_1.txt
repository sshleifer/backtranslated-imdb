Despite having a very pretty lady (Rosita Arenas, one of my girlfriends), acting and directing are examples of what NOT to do when making a movie. <br /> <br /> Located in southern Mexico, Popoca La Mam√° Azteca (the true Aztecs, by the way, was NOT made mummies) has been awakened by the main characters and begins to create problems in the suburbs of the City of Mexico, during the first movie (The Aztec Mummy). In this second part, the main man and woman want to find the mummy and put it in its final resting place (a fireplace would have been my first choice ...) <br /> <br /> In this the bat appears, a stereotype of a criminal master who does not take into account a criminal genius who creates a "human robot" (an idiot inside a robot SUIT) to control Popoca and (obtain this) take over the world. The final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious, some of the worst choreography ever witnessed. The funniest part is that this movie was made and premiered by a serious Mexican film studio! <br /> <br /> The acting is as horrible as listening to the movie in Spanish as well as in English (they called the excess of action!). You should see this movie through MST: 3000. The comments are even funnier.
