I just watched this movie on DVD late in the morning and it disappointed me so much that I even thought it was a good joke for the audience. In other words, the creators planned to do comedy, not drama. However, in the end I realized that Mr. Tony Giglio was very interested in this movie. It's a shame because: the dialogue is ridiculous, the performance is poor and lifeless, the story is a fish story! Poor Ryan Phillippe: Despite his efforts, his character in the film is still probably his worst performance. What to say about Jason Statham: lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role that is an imaginary fiction ... For these reasons, vote: 3/10
