Audio: <br /> <br /> Seriously, I've never seen a movie with worse audio. There are scenes in which people walk through the grass and you can hardly hear them in their footsteps. They must be doing mike on their feet. <br /> <br /> You know, in some movies that forget a line, so you have to copy it into a photo on the back of someone's head. Here the editors were not so smart. In fact, there is a scene in which Shannon Tweed's character says his line without moving his lips at all! <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that because of their background sound they played live effect loops while they were filming, because in many scenes the sound effects will be different or they will be absent when the camera changes angle. <br /> <br /> I could write a lot more about how bad the audio is in this movie. <br /> <br /> Other Nuggets: <br /> <br /> In this movie, you probably think that opening credits are special effects because they seemed very difficult to produce. The main title and the first names of the opening credits are in white text on a white sky, and they wobble as if they were carefully painted by hand in each frame. <br /> <br /> The reuse of extras in this movie is incredible. There are about 15 rebels in the cast, and yet, in a given battle, thirty or more of them will be killed. If the film was high enough to distinguish which ones died again and again. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that rebels are usually killed by explosions that are always at a distance of between 30 and 200 feet. There is a scene a scene in which some of the rebels are leaving their huts in the rebel base, and a shack trembles when the rebel goes out the door. It makes you wonder if the cabin will last long enough to face the inevitable explosion. <br /> <br /> There is a blue helicopter that looks as threatening as a pair of running shorts, but is somehow equipped with an infinite supply of missiles when they show that the missiles are launched from the missile bays of the helicopter, shots often in unpredictable directions look a lot like rockets from large bottles. They still manage to reach their goals with ease, which, as noted above, is always at a safe distance from the rebels they kill. Observe the recycled images of the pilot pressing the LIVE button to fire the missiles (because it was printed vertically, the first times we saw it, we read it as the "BAD" button). <br /> <br /> Notice how the grenade launcher they use produces explosions identical to those created by helicopter missiles. It is also funny in many scenes how the actor in the foreground is shooting in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers that he is killing. And often, the characters shoot a disproportionate amount of bullets at the soldiers who die (as when a short burst fire kills a large group of enemies). <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is very, very bad. The plot was thought almost as well as the football game of a 5-year-old boy, and the edition is the worst I've ever seen. But, honestly, it's sometimes fun to spend 90 minutes laughing at a group of adults who sincerely participated in such a terrible movie.
