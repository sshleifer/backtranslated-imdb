It seems that Dee Snyder ran out of ideas in the middle of the script. The second half of the movie is basically a replay of the first, which makes the movie very boring. To summarize: Cop's daughter is harassed at a party through the chat room where she is sexually abused / tortured by a psychopath (played by Snider). The police rescue her, the psychopath is put into therapy / jail. Psychopath is released four years later and everything goes back out. Within all of this there are many unexplained plot elements: Why was "Captain Howdy" a psychopath in the first place? What about the only personality deviation to Bitter-Thumper? How does he kidnap all adults and he manages to close his mouth without a fight? And perhaps the biggest unsolved mystery of all ... how does a 6'2 "man with pink hair hide behind an average 5'6" woman? These are just some of the questions I had when watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that Snyder was trying to make some kind of comment on a) the "dangers" of online chat rooms, b) the hypocrisy of Christian sexual customs, and c) the effect that our twisted Puritan society has over us as individuals. If that is the case, it failed. The film is too badly made to entertain, it does not matter to transmit social messages. The scenes of torture are stupid and boring, almost confusing (especially when Snyder enters one of his monologues of "pain and death"), and everything else is simply silly. The "call tracking" scene is really boring ... when the cops will get the caller ID and * 69? The young partner of the main police character is particularly horrible ... he should not be working as an actor, basically. And the audio in the scene of the final showdown is really poor. I guess you could not afford two boom microphones? <br /> <br /> The rest of the performance is not horrible, but it's not good either. The policeman is quite a note, and his individual quality is not entirely credible. Dee Snyder is not really that bad, but he growls and mocks too much. Robert Englund (who deserves much better) presents a somewhat funny performance of a hypocritical jerk. If you're a huge Robert Englund fan, the movie is probably worth seeing just for him. All others are forgettable. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, we have seen all these elements of the plot made before and under better conditions, in films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HELLRAISER and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASACRE. I suggest you rent one of those instead of looking at this turkey. 3/10. <br /> <br />
