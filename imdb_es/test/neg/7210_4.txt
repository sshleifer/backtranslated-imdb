This exclusive sequel to the classic ROADHOUSE has a DEA agent (John Schaech) who comes to the rescue of his uncle (Will Patton) when the uncle is brutally beaten by a local drug gang, led by the wooden Indian of an actor Jake Busey. The gang wants to take over the poor man's bar for nefarious reasons. Patrick Swayze is very missed here. Schaech is an indifferent actor and he is not convincing as a man of the law who kicks his ass. The fights here are intermittent and not as powerful or vicious as the fights in ROADHOUSE. The end is equally weak. Some attractive women keep things afloat for a while. There is a tremendous fight between a Duke-type Daisy that turns out to be useful with fists and weapons, and an unpleasant-looking Busey baby who is skilled with sharp implements. There is also a girl with little clothes at first who is an agent of Schaech, but unfortunately he never appears again in the film. Too. She does a brief lap dance for Schaech that had my full attention. If nothing else, ROADHOUSE 2 starts with a strip club scene that comes very close to what appears to be a real strip club, a rare circumstance in any movie. The rest is time to doze.
