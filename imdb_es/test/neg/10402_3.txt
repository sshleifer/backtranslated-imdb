Fear and desire are of interest primarily to Kubrick's obsessives, who can plumb this pretentious trap for signs of its greatness to come. Kubrick was right in trying to make sure the film was not screened or available in a legitimate video. He considered it shameful and amateur, and he was right in his evaluation. This is a weak and tedious movie: at 68 minutes it still seems longer than "Barry Lyndon"! However, it is of historical interest and has its genuinely absorbing moments. It is a difficult movie to find (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), although this may change if Kubrick's legacy gives way and is published on video. Recommended only for Kubrick enthusiasts.
