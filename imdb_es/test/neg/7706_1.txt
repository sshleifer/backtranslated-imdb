Many of these types of movies these days. This movie of zombies falls into the main category of "cheese", unlike the much more polished dawn of the dead and the day of the dead. To be fair, those 2 films were important studio releases with big budgets behind them. But they were also good movies. A low budget movie can still be good if you just stop accepting and using the worst scripts. Whoever wrote this movie must have been drunk all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie had very special effects and a very irregular plot. The only important difference from other movies of its kind is the time it takes for people to become zombies. In this case, it seems that it only takes a few seconds to die and then become a zombie. However, with the ease with which this "infection" spreads, you can have zombie blood on you and it does not even seem that you are at risk of getting an infection, and believe me that the people in this case are covered in blood. <br /> <br /> The main problem I had was that our 2 main stars sometimes walked around dozens of zombies and did not bite. When all the others become zombies in an amazingly fast way, these 2 were attacked by zombies when they were unarmed and could get out of it without any problem. Our chicken star even survived a missile attack on the building he was in. I was laughing at the load at that moment. Disarmed, having like 10 zombies in it and a missile hits the building, but manages to leave without a scratch? Okay, sure ... <br /> <br /> Also, whoever has advised these people on how special forces behave, obviously never spent time in the military. They should have seen a movie like Blackhawk first to have at least an idea of ​​how they behave in combat situations. <br /> <br /> A soldier was a special forces soldier with overweight. LOL that was a good one. Another continued to approach the zombies thinking they were survivors, even lowering their weapon at any given time. These guys are there to fight against zombies and act like the soldiers in the movie Stripes. Special forces, hahaha ... <br /> <br /> Then they get to the point where they try to explain to the zombie girl in the rubber room and everything becomes very confusing. The explanation is confusing and does not even follow the first movie. It did not make any sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the jokes against Bush. At first, the military lady told them that the order went down from the vice president to the president and in the end it was the vice president of an "undisclosed location" who gave the orders. That was the best part of the movie for me.
