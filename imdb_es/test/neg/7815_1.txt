This is by far the most horrible movie I've ever seen. I have never rated a 1 out of 10 film before. My advice is to not see it. This is not even classified as a movie. <br /> <br /> It would be better to sit on the bored couch instead of watching this movie. Acting was terrible, but what was worse was the story. Highly unlikely sequence of events that are not even fun. Actually they are very lame and stupid. The very silly choice of Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid to act in this film. It could even alter their careers a bit. <br /> <br /> When I entered Blockbuster, the main focus was on this movie, so I decided to rent it. I sincerely regret it. <br /> <br /> Once you've gone 10 or 20 minutes into the movie, you could basically predict what was going to happen. I expected it to improve, but instead it got worse. <br /> <br /> I'm not exaggerating this. The movie is terrible. Do not look at it. I hope this helps.
