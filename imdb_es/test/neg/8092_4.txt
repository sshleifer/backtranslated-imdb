At that moment. This film is totally extravagant, puerile, has gags from other movies, has songs from other movies ("Mutt" by Blink 182, "We Luv U" by Grand Theft Audio), an unpleasant protagonist, a ridiculous plot and parodies of films. like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty. Redeeming characteristics? Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly. Enough talk.
