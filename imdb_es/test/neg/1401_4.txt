A little funny how the comments for this movie were consistently downhill, now add mine. I think that the script could have been saved better by acting, and the performance of a better script. Together, it was hard to see, and I do not shudder at that subject. <br /> <br /> Sigourney was the best part (I thought that the relationship between her and her surviving son was practically the only new thing) This movie offered her genre) but even she was delayed. I can not blame her, who knows what shots were left on the floor of the cutting room by the director and / or the editor. The whole movie had a "good, that's good enough, let's continue", when I know there were more things I would draw from the actors and the script, that they had some good lines and some interesting topics. <Br /> <br /> I do not think this counts as a spoiler, but a perfect example is the scene in which Sigourney approaches the house of the alleged torturer of his son and has this look on his face and I thought "that is the face of someone who is overacting what it is to see someone living in a mobile home "and, indeed, the next shot, which aims to surprise us, I'm sure, the bully lives in a trailer instead of a nice house, like the her. <br /> <br /> As many other posters have pointed out, there are MANY better films with equally broad scripts about disordered families that hit the notes better - "Celebration" is probably the last example I've seen.
