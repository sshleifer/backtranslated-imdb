After his success with A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984, director Wes Craven, for some reason, decided that his next project would be this film for television. I'm not a big fan of this director in general; the early film of exploitation The Last House on the left, as well as his modern slasher Scream, suits me, but the rest of his work is very unpredictable and I would hesitate to call him the master to whom others have qualified him. The main issue here is cryogenic freezing, although it is more a springboard for the plot than an important part of the film. The main influence here is, obviously, the excellent zombie movie, Deathdream, from 1974, and we focused on Miles Creighton; A businessman frozen cryogenically for ten years before an accident which means that it must be thawed immediately. Miles is part of a project for people who are sick; they pay to be frozen in the hope that they will be revived in the future when their illnesses can be cured. Miles has successfully revived and it looks like a miracle ... but the person who wakes up is not the person who was frozen, as Miles returns without a soul. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been pretty decent judging by the idea behind it, but instead, they give us a plot that really does not have much to do and it has to be said that Craven does not make the most of it the potential of the movie. The "soul" is the main focal point, but it seems that not having a soul and simply having a murderous intention / without compassion is the same thing, which feels a little without imagination. The film was made for television, so it is not particularly unpleasant and it is obvious that not much money was spent on it, since all the production feels very cheap. Michael Beck never became a very popular actor and that's not surprising judging by his performance here; While it is passable, it largely lacks charisma and is not formidable in the central role. The plot does not flow so badly, but there is a real lack of suspense and / or tension and things slow down too often, which makes the film quite boring sometimes. Everything comes down to a predictable ending too. In general, I must admit that this film did not impress me at all and in regards to the filmography of Craven, Chiller would have to face Shocker, the sequels of Scream and The Hills Have Eyes II.
