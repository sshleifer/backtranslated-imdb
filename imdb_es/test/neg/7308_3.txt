Actually, that happened: the real mother-in-law and the father-in-law had lunch with the couple the day after the wedding and they gave him the money in public. This young Elisabeth worried so much that she never forgot the problem. We must remember that he was only 16 years old. She was so embarrassed that she kept the fear of sex all her life. Maybe this started to appear as a trauma. Also the constant intrusion of his aunt and mother-in-law. As you say, she kept all her children away from her, criticized her teeth and her manners (which she considered inappropriate for an Empress), and when Sissi finally went to Venice with her husband and children, her eldest daughter died and the mother in La Law blamed her for that unfortunate and untimely death. She never recovered.
