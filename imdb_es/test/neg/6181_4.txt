Ok, so I saw this movie at Sundance this year, and it did not impress me much. It took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the script with the fist in a tank gave way to a work pattern that did not depend on a close of Ryan Gosling's smile or artificial moralization. However, after the first 45 minutes, the script became a watch able to see, although it is not completely entertaining or stimulating. Highlights include the performance of Gosling and Morse, Gosling is a promising star and Morse is an extremely well-established character actor with a good feeling of disparate emotions. As a side note, after the screening, I talked a bit about the movie to some of my friends when David Morse walked right behind me. He looks like the nicest guy in the world, but he's a solid 6'2 "and probably weighs me 50. I took my foot out of my mouth and changed the subject quickly.
