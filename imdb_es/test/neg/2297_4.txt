The glorious Edward can rise in the world when his supervisor tells him he can leave those filthy Swedish dramatic movies and climb the stairs to the department of splashes and gore. Excited along with his great anticipations for the new type of films that will soon be released, he asks all sorts of questions about salary, his work space and the lunch break. Well, not really. Edward is maybe the opposite. Calm, stuttering, besides that, he has glasses. With the exception when he is crazy. I guess that created a much more spooky atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed is, quite rightly, a Swedish movie, but somehow a magical force met the good actors and turned their lovely Swedish accents into stereotypical American voices. I guess that's the experience that an actor needs these days. The performance is very wooden, since they are inflexible, not flexible (well, hey, what did you really expect?). In addition to that, the film has a techno-themed song of interference, sounds like its E-Type. In any case, this only makes the movie experience worse. Since I'm pretty hard with this movie so far, there will usually be a breaking point in which I raise the level of happiness. But there really is not much to say. The plans look good, but somehow 'Hanz' spelled coffee and partially destroyed it. This is how I see this movie. If the film ends where Edward is taken to a mental institute and they re-furnish the parts where he goes crazy and kills people, the result would have been much better, but that's just my radical vision. I would also like to see more images of lost limb movies. <br /> <br /> There are also illogical things to discover in this piece of film. Let's say the actors are really American, they live in the United States, why would they work on a Swedish film, like Edward did? And also, that delivery guy, why do not you ever use the bell that is located directly next to you? Instead, it is tapping gently on the door. Good old Edward really had a good ear to hear all that while he's editing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie had its moments, it's a pity that there are not so many. But that does not mean I would not recommend it. It's a fairly cheap movie, go and buy. It's almost as if I saw a pattern for the price and the movie. On the other hand; If you like to watch dubbed movies that are getting more and more difficult, this could be you. My verdict would then be a solid rock 4.
