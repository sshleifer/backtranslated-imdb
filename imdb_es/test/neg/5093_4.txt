I really wanted to see this movie but, unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. <br /> <br /> A good movie has the audience that identifies / sympathizes / sympathizes with the main actor. Unfortunately, this was very difficult to do with Samantha Morton. <br /> <br /> The story seemed very disjointed and did not flow as it should / could have done. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland seemed to be little more than showcase and made me wonder why he agreed to play what seemed to be a small part. The beautiful scenery and the performance of Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis was the only advantage. <br /> <br /> Maybe being a kiwi, I set the bar higher for local movies. Maybe the director change / supposedly difficult to work with the main actor has influenced my opinion. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just trying to make excuses for a movie that could have been great. <br /> <br /> A lot of maybes that still do not explain why this movie lacked something special. <br /> <br /> It could have been great, it was not.
