The reason why I gave this movie a 4 was for a couple of reasons, but this movie was not so bad. In the first place, the edition that I found was also quite poor at times, the script (or what they had of one) was not very good, and if it was not for Nunzio La Bianca, the performance would have been shit. but other than that (ha ha, I know it's like the whole movie) is not so bad for an extremely low ind. , low budget movie. If they had won more money, a little better actors (but these were intimidating, so it was good) and a little more detailed script, this movie would be great. Someone has to tell me that this guy was very influenced by Walter Hill's warriors. I want to say that this movie is exactly the same. Anyone who has seen both films will agree with me.
