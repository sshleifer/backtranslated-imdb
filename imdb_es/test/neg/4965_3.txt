I read about this movie online and after seeing the generally positive reviews it received, and seeing the trailer, I decided to check it out for myself. What a disappointment! It starts pretty good. The initial scene was quite tense, but from there everything is downhill. I can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie, but in doing so, they took all the pleasure of seeing it. Those choices combined with the "C.S.I" edition, the use of music and editing, the lack of suspense, fear or humor really drag this film. There is too much foreshadowing and many "subtle" clues, so when the first turn comes early, you'll know how the movie will end. I gave the movie three stars because I think the cast did a good job, apart from that I can not recommend this movie.
