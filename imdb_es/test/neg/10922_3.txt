This movie was extremely boring. I just laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed the name of William Shatner on the cover. It is about this little boy who is chosen by his peers all the time. As he wanders the streets looking for old women to help, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called Playground, where he befriends several pimps. When Mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the business of pimps, Lil 'Pimp must establish friendships. <br /> <br /> The animation is not very good at this. It looks like it was made with Macromedia, which I'm sure it was. It does not stink, it's just the kind of choppy flash animation that people have grown accustomed to over the years. The humor in this is not very good, I did not find it funny.
