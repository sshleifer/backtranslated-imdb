We saw it in a basket of bargains at the Asda store: £ 1.50 for the DVD. When reading all the hype stuck in the whole cover saying that it is "hilarious", and that also had a really good and established cast, we thought that this should be a great movie. <br /> <br /> So we bought it, we took it at home, put it in the DVD player, reclined and waited for the fun to begin ........ He waited ....... He waited ... and waited a little longer. <br /> <br /> About 90 minutes later, although it seemed like more than 3 hours, the credits accumulated, and that was the end of that. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment, even paying £ 1.50 seemed like a scam. God knows what Caine, Richardson and Gambon were thinking when they said "yes" to this tosh. And as for Moran: well, although I enjoyed Black Books, Shaun of the dead and his comedy tours, I felt that I was out of his depth in this movie. He tried to play too hard to laugh, probably thinking that if he retained the characteristics of his character in the Black Books, it would work here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he backed down. The gags deflated after a while, and then it became an irritation. Which is a shame because I think that, given the right part, it could be a very good film actor and characters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to summarize: the actors in The Actors, they did not act! <br /> <br /> ** / *****
