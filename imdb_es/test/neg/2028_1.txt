Wind. Easily one of the worst movies ever made. The only good thing about this kind of meaningless nonsense, is the fact that when watching movies like this one getting distribution, indy horror filmmakers like me trust that my next movie will also come out ahead. I mean, if this represents the Indy horror market, I could make a fortune by taping myself out of the garbage for 83 minutes. <br /> <br /> A complete list of what is missing in this film would take too much time to write it. But, the highlights are: no history, terrible acting, horrible cinematography and virtually no editing. That last one bothered me more. As an editor, this movie made me completely crazy because I had almost no editing. Each scene was shot in a master. They had no coverage at all. For anyone who does not know ... "coverage" is filming a scene from multiple angles to have cutting options when editing to achieve a desirable viewing experience. Yes, this movie did not have any of that. I'm talking about even the simplest scenes. Example: a normal conversation scene between two people sitting at a table would usually start with a teacher who establishes who is at the scene and where they are. Then, as the conversation progresses, it will go from one side to the other to take over the shoulder as the conversation continues. You can even throw a shot or two of something on the table, or in someone's hand. Anything. These are guys from the "movie 101". It seems that these people had no idea that this is how movies work. Each shot was a camera lock. Without movement, without cutting, without anything. If I were teaching a film course, this would be the visual aid for my lesson "What not to do". <br /> <br /> To finish, do not waste time, friends. The only surprising thing about this movie is that it once obtained a distribution. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
