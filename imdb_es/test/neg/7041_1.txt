I am an Indian who resides in the United States. Why India continues, like a silly animal, emulating everything that the United States surpasses me !! The main problems with the film are not so much the insane plot and the silly comedy. Is that this movie has a lot of sex, touching, women dressed as dungeons in the streets, and many curses that do not belong anywhere on television. <br /> <br /> To the producers and directors of this film. I have this message: you continue to weaken the strong family values ​​of our nation by making this type of garbage. You're still letting young women think it's okay to have a feminist attitude and not have morals. You continue doing dance songs that belong to the clubs and bars for lower adults. I'm ashamed to be an Indian after watching movies like this. <br /> <br /> In 2003, the government of the United States suggested that the best way to destroy Iran is to "send miniskirts" there. There is no need to do that for India. We will destroy ourselves with this garbage.
