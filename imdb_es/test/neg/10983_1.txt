This woman is a terrible comedian. She can not make a joke. She does not have a real character. This is another example of the typical American garbage, from which people laugh, because they have no idea how to react, so they say to themselves: "well, it's a comedy show", so I'll laugh, I suppose. <Br /> <br /> I can not stand this miserable woman, and her bad reason for comedy. She deserves nothing more than booing. <br /> <br /> Why can not America get rid of this kind of Turkish delight and look for something that really contains humor? <br /> <br /> It's not funny. No way. Why, oh, why does only one person like this idiot?
