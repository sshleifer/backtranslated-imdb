Whoa! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, did I mention terrible? It can be said just by the cover of the DVD that I did not get this movie, but unfortunately that was not the case for me. , and when I looked at it, I just wanted to strangle the person, because they used my money. I will certainly return it soon, but it is better to tell it while I have it in my memory, because I definitely want to forget it. This movie does not even deserve to be called horrible. It is beyond horrible. Possibly, the worst movie in history. The acting was so, so, so horribly disgusting, as well as the deaths being so TOTALLY lame. and predictable. I did not even laugh at how bad this movie was, which scares me a little. I do not see this movie, it's a shame that you embarrass me if you look at the page of this movie, and I have EXTREME grief. for you if you are watching this page of the movie, because you think it will be DECENT. Final word: YUCK !!!!!!!!!!
