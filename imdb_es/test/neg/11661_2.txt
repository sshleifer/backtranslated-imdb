The Hindi remake of Mrs Doubtfire, starring and directed by Kamal Hassan, is a somewhat sordid version, and not as good as expected. <br /> <br /> Kamal Hassan clearly struggles with dialogues in Hindi, even after all these years, and can not handle even a scene without effort. The boy has aged and should give him a break. Hassan brings nothing new to the role or the character, as Dustin Hoffman tells Tootsie, or Marathi actor Macchindranath Kambli to the character of Mavshi (aunt) in "Moruchi Mavshi" (Aunt of Moru, comedy). <Br /> <br /> What was the child doing playing with firecrackers when he was not Diwali? Most of the romantic "cross connections" of Chachi, Vs Amrish, Paresh and then Johny Walker, seem redundant from the main story. Tabu's bath scene was unnecessary. The family is from North India, but Karva Chauth night must be remembered for a 'Maharashtrian' Chachi. Yes to the right. <br /> <br /> The excellent interpretive skills of not one but four actors, namely Tabu, Om Puri, the late Amrish Puri and Paresh Rawal have been wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> See the original Mrs Doubtfire: clean, crispy and full of fun, unlike the Chachi 420.
