I'm a big fan of the comedy show. Racial humor is always a bit risky, but the great ones like George Lopez, Dave Chapelle, Lisa Lampanelli, etc. they achieve it perfectly. <br /> <br /> They do not exaggerate, they make the audience feel uncomfortable or cough * STEAL JOKES! But I will not insist on that. <br /> <br /> Carlos makes racial humor totally unpleasant. His jokes continually shout racial humor to the point where it is neither funny nor intelligent, but it is insulting. I am not one to become cold towards racial humor. But his execution of these jokes is neglected, which causes people to recoil from his comedy. <br /> <br /> His humor is only surpassed by his stage presence in the nuisance. I feel like he's constantly screaming at me! And he runs around the stage like a maniac. It only comes out as annoying!
