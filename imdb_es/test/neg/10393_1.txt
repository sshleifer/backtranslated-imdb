I'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but I found it quite funny. Isobel is possessed by the devil. Somehow, a perverted priest and the gardener are going to fix that. Partly exorcism and part soap opera, at least you'll get some laughs. There is the paranoid jealous father, the satanic sister, the mother of the Valley of the Dolls and then the cowboy groom; all there to help the skirt that persecutes the priest to fight against the demons of his beloved Isobel. Sometimes it felt like an episode of Jerry Springer, but I actually paid to see this. Instead of the cold twists of the head, the curses of the sailors and the crucifix caresses that Regan did in The Exorcist; you have a lot of Isobel jumping in her bed like a trampoline, hiding in her closet and jumping out of a haystack. Yes, it's crazed Chuck E. Cheese. So, if you want to see a horror movie in quotes that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending ... this is your movie.
