A stupid show in the vein of the rest of them with terrible music and a song of laughter that must be I Love Lucy. I got rid of the television because of shows like this, but I bought the first season in large batches for $ 3.00. I should buy the Van Damme movie instead. <br /> <br /> If I were a conspiracy theorist, I believed that a small group of people is working against real families and continues to present this deception / propaganda to undermine the family. Values ​​that I would point out to this program, Married with children, Father of family, etc., but I am not, so I will not. <br /> <br /> By the way, I'm not a Christian, I love the Simpsons and Peep Show. I watched two episodes and I thought that if shows like this one are popular, who are they popular with? Then I remembered all those photos of Walmart people that have been circulating on the web and I thought that ah! No wonder our culture is a joke around the world when this is the best time.
