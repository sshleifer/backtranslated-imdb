Unfortunately, this movie represents approximately 1% of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, bookworms and movie fans, nothing is more disappointing than a movie based on an original concept (either on paper or on a game console) that is not offered. And not only that, it goes well below the brand. Far Cry, the video game released in 2004, created such a cult, that making a movie from the content should have been easy and that many players had gathered to watch the movie. If you are a player who has played Far Cry; Do not watch this movie. Anyone who has not played the game; It will still look like a directed B-grade film performed / B. Uwe Boll, duck your head in shame ... this should have been easy to turn into a blockbuster. The story of the game was amazing (I think Jurassic Park meets Alien) and still you could take it and mold it into your own terrible recreation of an instant classic. It warns the video game companies: if Uwe Boll hits, close the door. Oh & Til Schweiger ... I hope to see you put on Inglourious Basterds. What were you thinking about taking this? Sigh.
