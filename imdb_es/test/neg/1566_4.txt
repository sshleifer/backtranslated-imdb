GEORGE AND MILDRED were unveiled in the mid-1970s, WE ARE FROM THE COMPANY ABOUT THE HOUSE. Although I have not seen the series since it was aired for the last time, I do remember that it was quite funny with most of the comedy derived from the couple of the same name who was going to live next to the Fourmile family snob, a kind of LOVE THY NEIGHBOR without the cynical racist gags. <br /> <br /> Having seen this "big screen version of the program" I wonder what a big screen version is about? Certainly, it is not a popular comedy from the mid-70s of the same name. For some reason, the film abandons all the interaction of television characters by having George and Mildred leave the street where they live and be caught in a plot involving some serious gang members who want something that George has inadvertently captured and It leads to some shaking. situations and lines such as: <br /> <br /> "He gave it to you" <br /> <br /> "No, it's the first time a man has resisted my charms" <br /> <br / > "I mean the envelope" <br /> <br /> It has the impression that screenwriter Dick Sharples (who never wrote an episode for the original sit-com) has never seen an episode of the source material and has the program Confused with the CARRY ON movie series. In many ways it resembles the same mistakes of the last LOST IN SPACE movie, since it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that generated it.
