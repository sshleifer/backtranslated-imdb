Zarkorr is a bad movie. This does not even qualify in the category as bad its good. It's just bad From the (lack of) setup of the set to the acting and special effects, everything about this movie stinks. For starters, the movie seems to be filmed in empty rooms with a couple of accessories to make it look good. Then we have a performance that is so bad that it makes a high school play like an Oscar nominee. And to top it off, there are special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur who stopped them in their garage. The cities that the monster supposedly crushes resemble my nephew's train. So obviously false that they shout at the viewer. The only good thing about the movie is the monster costume. It's a shame they spent all their budget on that and left nothing for the rest of the movie. And maybe a decent script would have helped too.
