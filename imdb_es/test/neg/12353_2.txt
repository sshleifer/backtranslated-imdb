Rabbit Fever is a fake collection of sketches, each one focusing on a female personal device that became popular for a single episode of Sex and the City in 1998 (the second half of 1998, instead of the first episodes that were directed per woman). From the initial statistics that make Rabbit Fever sound like a soft porn movie, we invite ourselves to a sea of ​​predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a world gone mad with the addiction of women to solitary pleasure. <br /> <br /> Men, As Germaine Greer arrogantly explains, invented a gadget for women that makes men superfluous in the bedroom. The rabbit vibrator (which, according to some statistics suggest, represents about a quarter of all sales of vibrators) is named for its small rabbit ears that vibrate to stimulate the clitoris, while the pearls that rotate inside the shaft stimulate the inside of the vagina. The film interviews characters attending Rabbits Anonymous to help them overcome their "addiction", as well as people known as Tom Conti, who pose as a teacher or Richard Branson (in the midst of scenes of rabbits on airplanes) saying that they They would like to provide free rabbits to their first class passengers on air travel and, ultimately, to all. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the film is that the idea is not enough to sustain 85 minutes of film, the sketches do not have the writing. skills, for example, a church in Charlotte or Ricky Gervais to be funny enough and, while it may be a nightly television, does not have a hook to make people queue in public in multiplexes to see jokes about masturbation . <br /> <br /> Lines like, "It's been almost a week since you used your rabbit, how do you manage?" use pretty thin after five minutes. The film is based on the idea that the mere mention of the word 'rabbit' will make you laugh. . . and another, and another. The frantic midnight tours to buy batteries can be fun in real life, but here they seem quite laborious, and the special emergency delivery service stands out to your welcome. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the BBFC gave her a certificate of 18 despite zero violence, almost no explicit sex, and sexual references that are less "perverted" than any early-morning comedy show. The company protested the decision, but the BBFC did not yield. At first glance, this seems excessive on his part and his advice to the consumer now simply says: "It contains frequent strong sexual references". One might think that young people would find jokes about masturbation more fun than the most desperate bachelorette parties, and the subject worthy of debate; but Rabbit Fever does not even have the salvation of a balanced approach to his subject. <br /> <br /> The best part is probably The Rabbit Song by Ruocco (who plays a band called Thumper in the movie). For those who have fallen asleep and have woken up at the end of the credits, there is an extra scene at the end of them to assure them that nothing has been lost.
