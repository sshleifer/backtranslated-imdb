It was hard for me to worry about these characters, who were annoying or insipid, all living their fabulously fun and urban lives. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was sometimes excruciating, and other times the narrative seemed difficult to follow - was it me or were complete scenes eliminated? <br /> <br /> It felt like a bad comedy somehow turned into a movie. The stereotypes and jokes about "men's groups" might have been fun in the early 90's. As it is, this is where a lot of the film's humor comes from, and it's getting old fast. <br /> <br /> Apart from the attractive Irish man, this movie was a failure. And not even in a way "so bad that good". The last 20 minutes were particularly painful. Maybe if you've never met gay people or never thought about homosexuality, this movie could have something meaningful to say. Otherwise, dear ones, it would still be better to rent the Boys in The Band or Beautiful Thing.
