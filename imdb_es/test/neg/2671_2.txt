Most of this movie was fine, for a sequel to a sequel to a continuation ... <br /> <br /> I was impressed by how much suspense there was; Actually, I had expected him to throw himself out the window in favor of gore, gore, gore. It was not, but there are some pretty ridiculous deaths. <br /> <br /> What I did not like, however, were all the complications of the plot. Those could have been fine, if the writers had taken the time to explain them all. But what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution, specifically? Why were they protected from Michael's damage to some extent? What exactly were they going to do with the baby? How did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant? Why lock her in for 20 years so she can get pregnant too? Why did Michael kill all his co-conspirators in the end? Why were there fetuses in the laboratory? The actors seemed to have "solved everything" once they saw the fetuses ... But it was never explained to the audience. <br /> <br /> If you're just going to watch this movie to see how people are killed. , then this will be fine for you ... However, if you can not stand a plot that is being thrown at you and that remains unresolved at the time the credits accumulate, you should go see something else.
