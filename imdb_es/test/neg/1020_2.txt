It's the only reason to see this movie. It gives a very good performance, much better than this shit deserves. He is very handsome and has a lot of talent, he deserves something better than this. Also depressing is to see Malcolm McDowell in this. He is another talented actor who deserves something better, but, like Esai, he has a very good performance. So, if you're a fan of any of them, you'll want to look. Otherwise, stay away. One more complaint: could not we have had more scenes of Esai without a shirt?
