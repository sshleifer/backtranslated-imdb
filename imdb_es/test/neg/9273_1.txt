This was touted as a sequel to Crash Dive, which was a very good movie in the low budget category. I assumed that this movie would also be good, but I was wrong. First of all, this movie has nothing to do with Crash Dive, apart from that both take place in submarines. Second, the plot can be slow, tedious and, in some cases, totally absurd. <br /> <br /> This movie will not attract the attention of most people. (I remember reading a book during the slow and boring scenes). There will be scenes that are supposed to be used to achieve a dramatic effect that will make the viewer laugh out loud. The corkscrew scene is definitely one. Once I overcame my initial surprise that someone would swallow this and not know that people would not only believe it, but also laugh at the simple stupidity, I could find humor in it. If you want to see MD in a good high school movie, watch Crash Dive and leave this movie on the shelf.
