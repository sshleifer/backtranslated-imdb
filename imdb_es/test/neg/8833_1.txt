I'm sorry, but I honestly can not see why someone would really like this. It is stereotyped and REAL home educators are NOT ANYTHING like they are in this program! Personally I'm glad that it was canceled after the first episodes. I mean, this kind of program would certainly be fine if everyone knew that home educators really were not like that, and the whole story was just for the program, but unfortunately not everyone knows it. If someone who saw this really believed that this is what happens in the life of an educator in the home, I honestly feel sorry for them. This reminds me of the kind of representation they have of children raised at home in "Mean Girls." It's sad, really, that people think this way. This is complete garbage, IMHO.
