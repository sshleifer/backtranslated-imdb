Wow, what an overrated movie it turned out to be! It was supposed to be "an extremely suspenseful tale of a crazed murderer who has a woman hostage and is terrified at home." Well, I doubt it would terrify audiences in the early 1950s and I know it would put today's audiences asleep. <br /> <br /> "Send shivers down the spine," proclaims the New York Times. No, the only chill I get is that there is someone on the planet who believes what the NY Times prints on anything. <br /> <br /> Well, it was a crazy man who held a woman hostage for a short time in his house plus man. "Howard Wilton" (Robert Ryan) was actually harmless and friendly. In fact, this was one of the nicest roles Ryan has played! Yes, "Wilton" was crazy, but he never hurt the woman and just wanted a friend to trust him. <br /> <br /> The movie became boring after a while with very little, except a lot of barking. <br /> <br /> Careful, my reader ... this sucks.
