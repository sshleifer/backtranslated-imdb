This movie wasted my time. I saw only a part and I cried for the lost time that I could devote to doing something productive and useful for this land. For all those who have seen this movie more than once, I blame them for global warming, since the number of black balloons that entered the Earth from this garbage was not necessary and if they came from a different movie, it would. I have forgiven them. Robin Williams lowered his standards to actually participate for more than 10 seconds in this film and Tim Robbins, how he went from this movie to the redemption of shawhsank, I have no idea. Please, do not watch this movie for the safety of the earth. Stop throwing black balloons to the ground of a movie that you should never have funded or released. Please burn all the copies before someone else has to see this shit.
