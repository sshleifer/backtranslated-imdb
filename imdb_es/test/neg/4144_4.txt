I did not want to write this film about criticism and criticism in the Western world, I mean, how wrong have they been with Asian cinema that has now become a staple diet of the Hollywood remake monster? In addition, Jet L is pretty cool, and has made some interesting films in Asia. So with an open mind, this movie surprised me in a surprising way. <br /> <br /> There are good points. The story is very intelligent, using Theory M as a basis to present the plot that there are several universes, each with its own versions of worlds, and most likely you. Each time one of you is destroyed, the rest share the energy and power between them. The idea that someone could deliberately try and become the only version of themselves in all the Universes to discover if they become a God. <br /> <br /> There is also Jet Li, and he is not a bad actor and he is quite agile. a martial artist, in addition to Jason Statham, who is a good actor in all aspects. As for the special effects, some of them are really great, a mixture of bullet time and slow motion at normal speed, very cool to see in places. <br /> <br /> The negative points? Well, Statham's accent is frightening, and some of the effects are not as comparable as others, so it's evident that the money was spent on some of the main shots and not on others that were probably considered too short on the screen or I simply ran out of budget. <br /> <br /> A big touchy point for me is the clipped camera action that Hollywood has always favored, something Jackie Chan has often talked about. Shooting close-up fights has two purposes. It gives more emphasis to a single stroke or movement, making it look harder and more real than it really is, and it also hides what is happening around the lens of the camera. For example, people holding a false arm or the face of a double, etc. <br /> <br /> What Chan always said was that he tried to open the camera and show the audience what was going on, let them see the people fight properly instead of approaching a face and a fist, cutting someone that falls in the frame. Showing the whole picture is more effective and more impressive. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the clipped shots were more annoying than anything else, you did not see how impressive Li's fighting skills were and it was difficult for you. See some of the action. Slow down the cuts and take the camera out of the Hollywood directors! However, the biggest problem was the story, despite having such a strong base on which to build, they seemed to lose the sense of the plot and concentrate on the action scenes. There are some serious plot buildings and explanatory moments that are only overlooked and covered in the space of a few sentences, however, they could have formed an excellent and complex character development. <br /> <br /> They just stayed together too weakly, and not enough of the story was made. All in all, it is not a great movie and its potential was very deteriorated.
