I really do not know why so many people love this movie: maybe it's funny, it's fine, but it has completely ruined one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself said, this film has betrayed the book: not only the story is cut violently to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost in a fantasy / adventure movie for children of the 80s . Today we have effects, directors, a new attention to books: I hope that someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki ...) will one day direct the true story of Neverending. A great dead writer, a wonderful book and many lovers of literature deserve it.
