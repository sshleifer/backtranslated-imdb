The positive reviews on this page are planted by the filmmakers and their friends. This film is amateur in terms of direction, acting, in fact in all aspects. If the IMDb is going to allow the filmmakers to dictate what is written about their films, then that is very sad. This movie has a commercial premise, but it's absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> The film is subjective, so everyone has their own opinion. But this movie is on par with Ed Wood's work, but without the charm. To think otherwise shows a bad taste of the highest order. <br /> <br /> This is not something personal. I do not know anyone associated with the movie. I'm just a movie lover who feels that the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate and, therefore, I felt the need to address the balance and give a more accurate view of the film. It is very badly done and the address is below the movies even by the numbers. The performance is the worst committed to the cinema. The best thing about this movie is the poster and the cover of the DVD. Beyond that, it's not worth the time.
