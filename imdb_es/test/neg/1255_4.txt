Wow, I just witnessed one of the biggest poker tragedies and I'm not talking about the untimely death of the great stu ungar. I'm sorry to say that this movie was terrible. Absolutely terrible. A true tragedy in the history of cinema. Well, maybe I'm being a bit hard, but unless you have some interest in the life of your ungar, then do not even consider approaching this. And those who do have an interest in their life will find that most of the parts were trivialized and created as great novel scenes. I saw him by Stu UNgar, but I almost wanted to end up with myself as he did while watching this movie 4 stars for effort but unpleasant pain
