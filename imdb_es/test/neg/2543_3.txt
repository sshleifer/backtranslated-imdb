Due to the dubious plate tectonics, Japan begins to slide under the sea. Initial predictions say it will be some 40 years before the country is submerged, but a dishonest scientist adds some even more dubious science and determines that it will actually take less than 1 year! The government believes he is an imbecile, but the evidence soon begins to show his theory. <br /> <br /> This great budget disaster film follows the formula set by any number of Hollywood films of the late 90s (I suppose I have not seen any of them), with the scale of the disaster and the tragedy that they highlight the nobility of the human spirit (well, Japanese) in acts of heroism and sacrifice, and demonstrate the power of love or something like that. that is, he is as naive in his psychology as in his geology ... we all know that half the population would be raping and looting at the time they thought the police had turned their backs, and that the other half would only enter panic and it would be useless. /> <br /> The film has some very nice special effects, but it is not as elegant or as expensive as an equivalent Hollywood production would be. However, she is at least as nationalistic, without humor and without self-consciousness as would be that Hollywood movie, and probably has a worse performance. He has the hot evil girl from Battle Royale as one of the protagonists ... but she is not a bit evil, and therefore much less hot. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long in 132 minutes, and it gets worse and worse as it moves towards a conclusion that put me in danger of vomiting. It certainly did not matter to me in the least if Japan sank or not at the midpoint, and long before the end, I was trying to think of ways to speed up the process if I ever found myself in that situation. <Br /> <br /> But, it has good special effects, and Kou Shibasaki is still quite hot, so I give it magnanimously ... 3/10.
