I saw this in the video store and I thought about trying it. It sounded like a good story and the cover looked good. That was it. The characters looked good, and the actor who played "Noel" was the most convincing, although he did not have much time in the film. I find it very difficult to give a bad grade to a movie, but this is one, in a minute number, what my book gives me. As the film progressed, I still wanted it to improve, but to no avail. Asthetically, it was good. The sound and lighting were good, but the acting in this movie killed me. It was like watching a low-quality telenovela. I kept saying: "I can not believe that they have launched this movement in this way". I stopped several times out of sheer disbelief that the performance was so bad. There's so much I want to say, but I'll just say this, everything else, for the most part, it was good, it was the performance, like a final cut, that really made this movie.
