I only gave this movie a 4 because I saw it in 3-d. If you do not see it in 3-d, I give it a 2. This movie is so bad that it's not funny. Anyone can make a movie like this for a week's pay. Bad acting, effects and history! But it was great to see it in 3d. Why can not they make good movies in 3D format?
