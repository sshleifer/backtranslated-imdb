Having grown up in westerns and considering the current shortage of westerns on television and in the theater, I really wanted to see Commanche moon. <br /> <br /> After seeing two nights, and not another, it seems that I have been shot on a tight budget. The level stars of Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are notably absent. There's Val Kilmer, but what the hell is going on with him? Four or five buildings on each side of the street plus the Scull mansion make up the entire city of Austin. The capitol is never seen, only the interior of the governor's office. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is often very entertaining, meaningless, rambling. The line of the plot separated. In total, completely forgettable.
