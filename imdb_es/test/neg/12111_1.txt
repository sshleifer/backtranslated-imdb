This thing, directed by the French sensation Patrick Sebastien, is worse than all the turkeys you've seen. Forget the Independence Day, Kazaam, the patriot, etc ... you get the image, this is the worst. Sebastien is a television celebrity in France (if you need an equivalent, let's say it's Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 13), this is your first film, hopefully it's the last one. I hope that Troma or someone distribute this movie in the United States, so that you can experience the French stench at its worst. Let's cut this, this is S ** t's masterpiece.
