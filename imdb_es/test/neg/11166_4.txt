Korea's response to "I know what you did last summer" follows a route similar to that of its US counterpart: a year after a group of friends from high school accidentally killed a classmate, a masked assassin begins to attack them one by one. Who could have seen them that night, or was their "victim" still alive when they threw him into the sea? <br /> <br /> The originality of the teen slasher genre can no longer be expected, but an effort can still be made to ensure that the films of this ilke are entertaining and terrifying. RECORD is neither, producing very repeated scenes of "I Know ...", "The House On Sorority Row" and "The Faculty" (among many others) and did not achieve a decent impact during the 95 minutes. <Br /> <br /> Acting is decent on the part of the cast who, as seems to be the norm in Korean cinema, approaches an uninspiring script with enthusiasm and an undeserved enthusiasm. However, the management is mediocre at best; a strange choice of camera angles and the disguise of the worst murderer * NEVER * contributing to the fall of RECORD. The most disappointing thing is the end of the movie, where the two 'surprise turns' are so obvious that they were previously ruled out for being too cheeky. <br /> <br /> RECORD's only salvation is its brilliant start. The first act is actually excellent and shows the American counterparts how the character's development and mood are supposed to be done, but, apart from that, this is a very poor movie. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
