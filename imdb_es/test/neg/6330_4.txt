I do not understand the people here. The movie is not as good as some say here. With the exception of De Kok, the performance is fine. The problem with the movie is mainly the script. The characters are not credible. Sex is fine, but the psychology behind people makes very little sense. The movie does not look good, but what do you expect? The film was filmed for very little money on video. Of course, then it does not look as good as a normal movie, duh! The only thing I agree on is that the music is bad. It sounds like a soft and cheap erotic movie from the 80s. The movie is not good, it's okay, but you have to give a little credit for taking this out without money.
