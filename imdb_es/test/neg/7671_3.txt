My opinion: the most stupid of the AIRPORT films, and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the 70s. <br /> <br /> As if we wanted to take advantage of the franchise with all its benefits, the producers of this Third sequel to AIRPORT are released In more action, silly subplots, free star appearances and more fun elements. In its attempt to be the largest AIRPORT so far, CONCORDE: AIRPORT '79 is the worst so far, and probably one of the worst disaster films of the seventies. With its bad box office results, it is not surprising that the genre has surpassed its welcome. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a rather catchy Lalo Schifrin score backed by some impressive shots of the titular plane in its former glory (the same plane used in this film would be involved in an accident in July 2000). But then the credits appear, and we can glimpse the cast of "stars," which is not composed only of faded Hollywood stars, television actors, and not-so-popular B actors. The plot is stupider than ever: George Kennedy is back in the role of Joe Patroni, now pilot of the Concorde (co-pilot piloted by co-pilot Alain Delon) en route to France after the Summer Olympics. On board is reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely), who has just discovered that her boyfriend, the famous gun maker Kevin Harrison (Robert Wagner), is selling his weapons to the terrorist. To prevent him from revealing the news to the world, Harrison sends his most advanced missiles and his best saboteurs to prevent the Concorde from landing. <br /> <br /> The cast / subplot is dumber than ever, even more foolish than an alcoholic Myrna Loy or a singing nun. We have Cicely Tyson transporting a living human heart in a cooler place (!), Martha Raye as a woman with a bladder condition (and the character does not go beyond that), J.J. Walker, a saxophonist who smoked marijuana (possibly the most annoying character in the movie), Eddie Albert married the "old" wife Sybil Danning, Avery Schreiber as a Russian coach with a deaf daughter and, finally, a love story between the reporter Jon Davidson and gymnast Andrea. Marcovici (for the eyes of coach Mercedes McCambidge). In addition, the film is much closer to the episode of LOVE BOAT than ever with the dumbest cameos of Charo (and his Chihuahua pet) and Bibi Anderson. Camp lovers will certainly get a real kick in the balls in this stupid entry in a long series of disaster films of the 70s. This is, in more than the meaning of the word, a real disaster. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 out of 5.
