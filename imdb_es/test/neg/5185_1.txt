What makes this movie so bad? Is the juvenile humor lame sub-par? Could it be the horrible music "sucked" in fashion? Maybe the uninspired go nowhere in history? Or maybe even the fact that Traci Lords offers his worst performance as an actor and, to add insult to injury, keeps all his clothes on this steamed peat sandwich. Regardless of the reason why this movie sucks, the fact is that it really does. I have never wanted to see a movie with Dean Cameron instead of what I was seeing in my life, but "Ski School" is a masterpiece of comic book genius compared to this parody. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nikol Nesbitt, Buffy Tyler and Suzanne Stokes all unleashed their tits Tupperware <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
