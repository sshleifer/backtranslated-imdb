Eastenders has gone from a complete circle of inescapable in 1985 to totally abysmal now. It is a bad reflection of the nation that this shit exceeds the ratings. <br /> <br /> The ideas for the plot can consist of nothing more trivial than putting the name of each character in a hat. The first two (regardless of sex) will sleep with each other, the third and fourth will have a fight in Vic, the fifth will be arrested, the sixth will develop an addiction, the seventh will become pregnant, etc. /> <br /> Although the producers are smart. The 30 minute program only consists of 3 lines. <br /> <br /> 1) Someone will walk in the Vic and say "What is going on?" 2) Someone else will stand up and say "leave it aht" (outside) 3) Then a woman will say: "Doan choo come in eere 'n' insult mah fam'ly" <br /> <br /> That's it . That is all show. Apart from the occasional "Get it sort-id / Is-kind-id?" <br /> <br /> The show was once a realistic portrait of the East End people and their way of life. The buffers were removed when 1) They extended it two nights a week and 2) The Slater family showed up. How they attract viewers is beyond me. The character of Kat symbolizes everything that has gone wrong in society, treating any other person as something that has been removed from the shoe. <br /> <br /> The people who vote for it as the best character, in these polls, should be the same as those who vote for Jamie Redknapp "Best Athlete", even though he has not played a game for 3 years . <br /> <br /> What I can never understand is if the program is the pinnacle of British television, why? Are the biggest names going? Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, the list is endless. <br /> <br /> How long has the marriage of the longest couple lasted, being faithful to each other? Yes, people leave, but until the writers realize that the characters, the couple can be interesting and pleasant without sleeping around the show, will continue to deteriorate. An episode last week had 3 separate plots of exactly that. And Zoe and the doctor surpass even Lofty & 'Shell' as 'The most unconvincing couple that has appeared on television'. <br /> <br /> Yes, Eastenders is the most watched program, that is indisputable. But many external factors contribute to that. 19.30 / 20.00 is the perfect time of day to get the most viewers, it has a general edition for 2 hours, and more than that, millions of viewers see it, out of habit, but if they are completely honest to themselves, they would admit that (in 2002, more than ever), it can be absolutely regrettable.
