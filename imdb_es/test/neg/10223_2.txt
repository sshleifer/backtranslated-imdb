Walt was particularly fond of quality. So, how is it possible that the producers of Disney released a mess of film so edited, so misunderstood (even for the family)? The big green had a good concept. And, since it's Disney, you know how the movie will turn out, obviously. But THE GREEN GREEN is horrible. The jokes are lame. And Steve Guttenburg, still alive, presents another terrible performance on his resume. <br /> <br /> Children who have too much time on their hands in the small town of Elma are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play football. However, children do not know anything. And, thanks to us, we can see Steve Guttenburg try to hit the teacher from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The speed at work of the camera does not work. THE BIG GREEN is full of accelerating the rhythm of the characters to move the movie. Children are not idiots. They will find out if you give them enough clue without showing all that garbage. Guttenburg, for once in his life, should have rejected an offer to join this movie. Also the beautiful Olivia d'Abo should have called this one too. THE GREEN GREEN can be known as 'The Big Bomb'.
