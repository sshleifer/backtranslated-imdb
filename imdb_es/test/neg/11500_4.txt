Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so I'm happy to see any of their films. Ollie is recovering from a fractured leg in the hospital and, with nothing else to do, Stan decides to visit him and bring him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. The chaos begins with Stan curiously pulling Ollie's string for the leg, and he manages to push The Doctor (Billy Gilbert) out the window, clinging to it, placing Ollie up to the ceiling. When the situation calms down, Stan gets Ollie's clothes, since the Doctor wants them both to leave, and also manages to sit in a syringe, accidentally left by the nurse, full of a sleeping drug, which goes into effect while driving . (What can be said is done with a car in front of a big screen.) Filled with a nice slapstick and a classic comedy not too bad (although repetitive and a little predictable), it's not great, but it's a black and white movie It's worth seeing Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were at number 7 in The Comedians' Comedian.
