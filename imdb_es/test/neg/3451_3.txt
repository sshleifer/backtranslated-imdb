I managed to see this in what I think was the second screening in the world, a few days after its opening at the Dublin International Film Festival. While attending another movie two nights later in the same theater, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier and the rest of the cast and crew in another promotional projection of Studs. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was very disappointed with the film, I did not expect a masterpiece at all, but what they presented to me, I think, lacked all the crucial elements of the genre in which they had gotten. Before continuing, two things, I accept that some filmmakers like to subvert generic expectations, here simply is not like that. Secondly, I know that it was based on a play (which I have not read but I have been informed that it is not a piece of brilliant literature), but this does not justify the massive narrative problems that permeate the film. <Br /> <br /> My main problem with the film is the script, forget that it was based on a play, like a sports comedy that just does not work, the team below and outside is trying to win a glass of soccer, few games are shown (when they are, it is very short) and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sporting achievements. Having read so far, I could assume that it is not a strict sports film but a psychological study of the relationship between a "charlatan" of a manager and his team desperate. He certainly does not achieve this, I'm not even sure if he was aiming. Any attempt to throw light on the history of any of the characters is trite and peripheral. In general, I found that the script lacked many aspects. <br /> <br /> I think the performances and the music were good and, technically, the film was well done. But aside from those points, which should be expected from any Irish film at this stage, I left the theater very disappointed. <br /> <br /> My opinion may seem hard, but I think there is some hope for a strong Irish national cinema in the near future and this simply does not support that argument. As Studs has become a recommended movie of Dublin Cineworld (I was part of the audience in that screening), most people seem to disagree with me, so that means you should probably take your own judgment of the movie.
