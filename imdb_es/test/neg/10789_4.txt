I'll have to admit that I'm at a disadvantage here; When I learned more about a film from other critics than from seeing it myself, then that is a problem. Although the plot of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" in general seems simple, the film allows many cryptic elements to stand in what could have been a satisfying mystery. When we arrived at the scene in which a woman with the appearance of a witch establishes the secret of "the first degree of the ray of seven folds", I did not know whether to laugh or to go back to see if I missed something. <br /> <In retrospect, the cryptic note retrieved by Mr. Lawrence (Leslie Banks) from the handle of a shaving brush was a cleverly written message, which led to a dentist named Barbor and, finally, Albert Hall, a place, not a Person indicated by "A. Hall". But for all the intrigue, it was never made clear why the murder objective was eliminated. Well, then Louis Bernard was killed because he knew of a plot to kill a diplomat named Ropa, but why was Ropa a target? Now that I think about it, why was the note even written and secured with the shaving brush? Did Bernard have to refer to him from time to time to remind himself what was going to happen? <br /> <br /> With their unconnected scenes, "The man who knew too much" is hard to follow and a bit disorienting. however, I will give credit to Alfred Hitchcock for this initial effort. To have a perspective, I will have to see some of his other works from the same period, although this film certainly can not show his later works as "Psycho" or "North by Northwest".
