Bad, bad, movie, so bad that it's worth seeing. As long as you see this movie knowing it's bad and you'll spend 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. The special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad, but seeing the faces of the actors while trying to look scared is very funny. If your sister is about to be devoured by a giant komodo dragon, would not you? something to try to save her? If they had eaten it, would not you fall to your knees crying with all your heart? This guy sat on a chair and ran his fingers through his hair. How anti-climate is that? Maybe he was supposed to be in shock or something. He joins his sister in the belly of the komodo - oh he did not want to spoil it for you.
