The sound is terrible, the image is worse than worse, the performance is horrible, the main actress is chubby and the story is ... wait a minute ... There is no story ...! The plot is really bad and the title of the movie is deceptive. If you expect to see piranhas, you may be disappointed. This movie has nothing to do with the Piranha movies of 1978 and 1981. Actually, I can only think of a scene involving Piranhas. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I liked about this movie, besides the fact that Run only for about 85 minutes, is the song at the end. It is written and sung by Jim Stein and is called "Love all things that love the sun". <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie. It's so bad that it's not even fun to see it. I fell asleep after the first 20 minutes and I am the kind of person who looks at anything.
