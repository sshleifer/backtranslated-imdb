Predictable, clich√©, incredible, boring ... what else can I say? It's just the caliber of the cast that saves the redeeming qualities of this bloated mess. Oh, yes, and the entertaining pranks in the end zone. <br /> <br /> But wait for the highlights of eleven o'clock, because the result is as predictable as who will win the duel Globetrotters / Washington Generals. <Br /> <br /> I was fine in the second act before I realized that these were supposed to be PRO teams we were seeing (all dressed in old brown parents). And the imitation of the Cameron Diaz character of a young Georgia Frontiere was misconceived on the page. (It's not your fault, Cameron, would you like to go to dinner?) <br /> <br /> Enough of this: I'm just in a rant because I expected this movie. Rent the longest patio in its place. <br /> <br />
