The story is derived from "King Lear"; The scenario is a farm in Iowa. Here is a test for this kind of thing: if you ask yourself: "Why did such and such," and the answer is "because that's what happened in 'King Lear '", you know That the movie has failed. Well, that's what happens here. The father figure in this story is not living his own life, he is imitating a fictional one. But there are more errors in the movie than this. <br /> <br /> Jocelyn Moorhouse is ambitious, much more ambitious than I think she believes. She is trying to take the story of King Lear and completely change the scenario. This is a task in itself. The most likely outcome is that the transplanted story will die, and no one will understand why (although there are enough successful transplants, such as "West Side Story," to make it worth trying). But she is also trying to retell a revisionist. In the version of "King Lear" that you want to create, Reagan and Goneril dominate our sympathy, and Cordelia is a villain. This is a task in itself, too. <br /> <br /> Succeeding in any of the tasks is difficult; Being successful at the same time is impossible. In fact, being successful in one moment as much as trying the other is impossible. If we are going to see the same events from a different moral perspective, then the events must be the same events, which means that the configuration can not be altered. If the story is going to be transplanted, alive, to a different environment, your moral heart must keep beating all the time, which means that there can be no alteration of the ethical perspective. Moorhouse was destined to fail not only in one but in his two efforts. And so he did. ... Naturally, it is possible to try both tasks, to fail in both tasks, however, by some chance hit a work of art that is good for independent reasons. I mention this because I have not read the Jane Smiley novel, which, as far as I know, is good for independent reasons. But the movie is not. If there was nothing wrong with it, there would still be no way to avoid the fact that it is so complete, unbearably TOTAL. The corn fields are even more boring than they would be in real life, which does not have to be that way, since I can think of four movies ("The Wizard of Oz", "North by Northwest", "The Straight Story "," Kikujiro ") in which corn fields are not boring at all.
