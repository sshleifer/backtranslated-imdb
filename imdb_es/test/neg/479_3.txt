Written by, directed and starred by the camp champion Bruce Campbell. Easy to understand, this is a budget for a matter of few resources; Filmed independently in Bulgaria. All I can say for sure is that being silly is not always fun. Campbell plays a famous American businessman with an unfaithful wife (Antoinette Byron) and tries to close a commercial transaction before he is murdered. He hires a taxi driver to take him through a strange little town; Not knowing that his wife is 'continuing' with the taxi driver. In moments of Campbell being hit; The taxi driver is killed in the same place. A mad scientist (Stacy Keach) continues with an experiment that puts the taxi driver's brain inside the American's head. With massive points on his forehead, Campbell frees himself and wanders the streets looking for his wife; all the time he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over-sized head. Campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions while arguing with himself. Therefore, Bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be happy. I have the impression that this must have been written as a direct comedy. Rounding out the cast are Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev. Watch this on the science fiction channel.
