Like the two previous films of 'Mad Max', 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' is no exception to the violence and weird plot. Mad Max is in a post-war society in which he must destroy Master Blaster and get the children "to come to earth tomorrow." This is usually a distorted movie with references from Peter Pan and Tina Turner, methane pigs and strange characters. I got bored seeing everything, and he did not offer me anything. I did not feel inspired after seeing this movie; The only decent thing about this movie were the extremely strange characters that were selected in various ways throughout the film. It's too weird for me, and it was too boring.
