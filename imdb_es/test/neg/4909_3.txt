This film is a third level attempt in a convincing and moody thriller, and fails miserably in all three aspects. I almost managed to keep my attention since the protagonist was seen in a slow and predictable way, breaking all the rules of life that he had conveniently established at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> But it is in the last 25 minutes approximately. that things really start to spin. A vaguely plausible plot (and that is being generous) becomes completely ridiculous, as new characters suddenly appear out of nowhere and random events and bizzarre are never explained. It's so cheesy, the acting is very tough (despite a strong British cast) and the direction is so uninspiring. This is not an example of a good British film making, nor should it make Tarantino a blink of an eye, at least not in comparison to his previous work. <br /> <br /> My advice in this case, if it is difficult to control. Of, do not waste the effort. If you're British like me and you're in your local video store, stay clear. Maybe head over to the video titled "American Beauty", now it's an example of the great British direction.
