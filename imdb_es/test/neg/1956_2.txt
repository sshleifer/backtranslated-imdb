Jack Frost 2 is out of the question, I'm really surprised that people are allowed to make these kinds of movies. <br /> <br /> While Sam and his wife travel to Tropicana for a relaxing Christmas, Jack returns to kill. Forget the fun and take revenge with the inbreeding ... <br /> <br /> Do not pass anything For this movie, most people say it's a laugh with your classmates, but frankly it's a waste of time. If the people who made this movie can get a job doing what they do, they can at least spend time and effort writing a better story, especially the names of the cheesy characters.
