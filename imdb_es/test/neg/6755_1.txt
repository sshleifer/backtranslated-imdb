The comments on this movie completely deceived me, mainly by someone who said they saw her at a film festival and loved every minute of her. Hoping this is a good career of the American pie style, I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the work of the camera is horrible, I do not think the director knows that the cameras can move around the scenes instead of being still and that the actors move near and far themselves. <br /> <br /> Second, the stage! My God, I've seen more furniture in a bird's nest. The club was not very convincing with around 3 extras dancing in the background at the same time. The floors were bare and lacked personality. <br /> <br /> Thirdly the actors. Wow. Obviously, the director opted for the typical configuration of the character "Reaper", a weak main character with a rough character from "I don a f ** k" who makes boat shots at the main one. Everything that the main character said and did was a task, so much that it made me shudder. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot, the supposedly big theme of revenge, lasted about 30 seconds and lacked real motivation. The characters acted irrationally and did not seem to have any real relationship with anyone else. No character had depth, they could have been cardboard cutouts that passed in front of the static camera. <br /> <br /> A truly horrible piece, worse than the freshmen who are missing 2 minutes for YouTube. Advice to the director? Change your name and deny any association with the movie that will likely sell a copy at a garage sale in Ohio.
