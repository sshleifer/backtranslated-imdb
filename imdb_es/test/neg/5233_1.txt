When reading the book, I was once again attracted to Castle Rock (the final part of the Rock trilogy is that of Needful Things), and the plot was a variant of the story of type "the devil comes to a small peasant village "That King likes to tell. All the characters were described with loving detail, which made a good psychological and bloody horror. The movie on the other hand is horrible. The interactions of the characters and the intelligent plot are over, and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting but is lost by a mile. If you have not read the book, then you can enjoy it, or avoid it at all costs, as with most of King's books.
