It is sad to have to say that a movie is really horrible and one tries to find ways to say this. However, this is a terrible movie. Gene Hackman wastes his time (and one suspects, many dollars) in re-interpreting his most famous and, often, recreated role, as "Gene Hackman". Otherwise, television actors have the opportunity to become movie stars and successfully resist temptation. Patrick Swayze has a minor part and moved on to more important things, so he must be eternally grateful. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as a result of someone else's review and I felt that another point of view was deserved. You may not agree with my opinion, but now, at least, you have been warned.
