I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad. I'm surprised that someone took it seriously. The characters are one-dimensional, even the good ones and especially the bad ones. The only merit here is that it's so boring that it's fun. Actually, for me, there is the added benefit that it was filmed in a state park not far from where I live, so seeing some local attractions on the big screen is a big advantage. <br /> <br /> The main character is an off-duty cop, and has the great interest of teaching a good guy that the vigilante judge is not just a bad idea, but is against the law. Imagine how long it takes ... <br /> <br /> Most of the characters in the movie in Northern California are fire-dried Hollywood cheese balls, which seem to have never been in a fight. The story line is totally predictable. This movie is ripe for a lampooning MST-3K. Only the value of CAMP. I am quite indulgent with movies in general, but seeing the old positive reviews I had to talk. This is a dog. I give it a 3 out of 10, and then just for laughs.
