Why did they have to make such a terrible adaptation? The entire "Complete Jane Austin" series as part of Masterpiece Classics seems like a big disappointment. The characters are totally wrong and there is no chemistry on the screen. Everything feels hurried. The release of the 1999 film based on the same novel seems like a masterpiece compared to this. I really want to forget it. However, I'm really happy that "Pride and Prejudice" is not done again as part of this project and we will see the emblematic and magnificent Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as protagonists. If you skipped this production of "Mansfield Park", consider yourself lucky.
