The Midnight Hour AKA: Tell me there are no lies (as found in some video stores) you can judge in two different ways. One for Merritt as a movie, complete with a plot (no holes), a good story and a credible conclusion, and the other is for the movie of the skin he is trying to be. This is certainly nothing more than a B-Movie, whose sole purpose is to show all the girls in the movie in a sex scene that is too long at least once. <br /> <br /> If you try to qualify this as a normal movie, then this is the bottom of the driva line. The huge holes in the plot ruin whatever plot you have in your favor. For example, if a co-worker is killed, would you call the police or go home and hit the hot tub? Judging this movie by its skin content, it is visible ... barely. The girls, for the most part, are all beautiful, but obviously improved. However, the sex scenes were long and exaggerated, and that made their quality a bit boring. <br /> <br /> Amber Smith could probably be a decent actress if she wanted to. She was not as horrible as you can imagine or maybe next to the rest of the cast, she seemed much better than her. <br /> <br /> Zoe Anderson, who played Detective Arraya, should not even be watching a movie, much less acting in one. Although it looked good, so we know why it was there. <br /> <br /> In general, I would not really recommend this to anyone. Even if you're looking for a good movie for your skin, there are many better ones out there. I rate this 4 out of 10
