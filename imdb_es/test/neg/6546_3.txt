This movie has some good performances in its favor, and that's all it has. Cables, especially Pauley Perrette, are attractive. (Although some of the bit players seem to be acting from a teleprompter.) The material, that's the problem. I feel as if the scriptwriter / director watched Felicity's entire career in one session, then sat down to write a script without sleeping. It really reminded me of Felicity, a thoughtful young woman who finds herself, finds love, with a focus on the characters and their relationships that shake them and see them. Except that although I usually enjoyed watching Felicity, this movie left me cold. The writing is just horrible. It's amazing that the cast could go as well as they did, since the dialogue is boring at best. In the worst case, it becomes trite, forced and amateur. There is nothing original here, with elements of the plot recycled from tricks that were not so bright to begin with. (Angels and fortune tellers? Come on.) For the first half of the movie, I became interested in the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience. For the second half, I just wanted it to end already. My sympathies for the cast, who deserved a better vehicle for their talents.
