While everyone does a decent job in this movie, I agree with the other comment: it's too loose and scattered, much like an unscripted experiment with really talented actors. As such, it is not enough to maintain your attention. Having said that, there are some really funny moments, one about Dylan McDermott and a shot glass on fire that I think anyone who has been so drunk would find it as funny as I am; the other is a fraction of a second with an inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover does his usual twitch-fest wacko and does it well, Harry Dean Stanton does his usual wacko patriarch (Repo Man, anyone?) Etc. Good deal, not enough to keep it going. Only a few gems, seconds in length.
