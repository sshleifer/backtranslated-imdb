First, let me say that I rarely review movies, I only comment if I am impressed or disappointed by something that I thought was going to be good. Killshot was a big disappointment on many levels. The script was horrible, the performance was sub-par (especially from heavyweights like Rourke and Lane) and the editing and effects were comical, (exploding cars, etc.) Rosario Dawson had a horrible role, I can not believe I would even accept it, it was a misuse of his talent that I can not even express with words. I should have known it after watching the trailer of this movie 3 years ago and it remained on the shelf that there was a serious problem with this movie .......... Film B until the end ... ... .. do not bother unless you're really bored ........
