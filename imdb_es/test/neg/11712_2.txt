I'm not a fan of the original book, but I expected to see a better adaptation than Natalie Portman's film, which I found horrible. This version is even worse. <br /> <br /> First, there is very little of Mrs. Gregory's book in this script. The whole secondary plot of George Boleyn's sexuality is completely eliminated and, in this version, George is nothing more than a simple change of course between his duty to the Boleyn family and his duty to the King. I thought that the title of the book referred to Mary as the least known of the Boleyn sisters, but here it is used to refer to Anne. <br /> <br /> Second, the script causes the characters to address the audience periodically as if in confession. Apparently, this is intended to give a bit of history and explain their motives, but it is of amateur execution. <br /> <br /> Besides the bad script, the address is surprisingly bad. There are too many takes made with a circular camera that is not very stable at best and in the worst case is unstable. Several of the speeches are provisionally pronounced, as in a first essay. The production values ​​of Henry's extravagant court are minimal. The costumes vary: some are copies of historical portraits and others are from the feverish imagination of a costume designer. And the King, the source of all power and favors, is often shown ONLY. There are no flattering courtiers, no servants in the background, where are all the people? I'm used to Hollywood turning history into fantasy, but I expected something better from a BBC production. Even based on a faulty book, this production is BAD.
