I'm sorry to say this but I did not enjoy this movie at all. It was too boring. So boring that I could not see the rest. It is not as interesting as the Lion King or Aladdin. That's why I hate these stupid days because these days are not what they used to be. The movies that Disney has released lately really sucks! I miss the old days when they used to produce good films like the Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Cinderella, The Aristocats and Robin Hood. This movie is really horrible. I really did everything possible to be interested in this movie, but I could not. I do not think I can recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend the ones that I just mentioned.
