With the little respect it deserves, I would like to say that this movie was horrible. The filmmakers had good intentions, but the overall quality of the direction and the production value obviously lacked a lot. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good laugh and then lose two more hours of their life enduring a truly painful experience. I'm surprised that I even found this movie in the $ 1 DVD rack where it was placed correctly. I thought maybe it was going to be good and that I could discover some incredible independent film, I was wrong. I wish I had never seen this movie. My 3-year-old cousin could not make a movie worse. I'm glad I saw the movie because I can finally tell people that I've seen the worst movie ever made, and be sure of it.
