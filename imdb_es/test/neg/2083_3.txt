Mirable but quite terrible. How amazing that this was Gregory La Cava's last credit address! Even in his best known roles, I do not care about Gene Kelly. It seems to me that he is presumptuous, hostile and involved. Here, along with a minor actress like Marie Wilson, she seems to show those characteristics with flying colors. <br /> <br /> Marie Wilson, playing an heiress who falls in love with a soldier, is exceptionally tough and unfriendly. The actors seem to be working hard to overcome the difficult and unpleasant core of the image and do it well. <br /> <br /> The wise-guy butler seems to be funny, but it seems like an extensive Riff in the prissy bits for which Franklin Pangborn was famous (and in which, despite his stereotypes, it was generally fun, unlike of this boy). Phyllis Thaxter is, as always, very attractive in an underdeveloped secondary plot.
