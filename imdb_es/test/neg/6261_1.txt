A film like this makes me appreciate the work that professional actors do. I think that, in general, film goers are too hard on professional actors and are ready to hit them for the most minuscule reasons. Just watch a couple of minutes of the "Cheerlader Massacre" and trust me, change your mind. A razzie would be almost a compliment for these actors without talent. But, again, it's a Jim Wynorski movie. Wynorski is a popular director of these very low budget B movies (he has worked with Roger Corman on many occasions). The problem with this film is that it really tries to develop a plot. And when there are actors who share lines as if they were reading letters from an eye chart, how am I supposed to care? In "Bare Wench 2" by Wynorski, he did not try to develop a plot. He just tried to make a smooth takeoff / soft porn in the "Blair Witch Project". It was fun and exciting. "Cheerleader Masscare" is not fun. There are a couple of compulsory female nudity scenes, but they are few and far between. So it's not even worth enjoying on an erotic level. I must say that the worst scene is the one in which Nikki Fritz crosses a bridge that is about to collapse. First, his character did not have to cross that bridge. Secondly, when the bridge begins to creak, instead of doing everything possible to cross, she stays there and acts impotent. And to make matters worse, we do not really see the collapse of the bridge because the filmmakers did this for a budget of 2 dollars! Unlike many B-horror movies, this one is really boring. And that's what makes it the worst of all bad movies. One of the few bright spots was Lunk Johnson, who is probably the most natural actor in the film (although he is certainly only half decent). It was fun in "Bare Wench 2" and also had some funny scenes in this movie.
