I tried. God knows I tried to like this Swiss cheese from a movie, but the story was too full of holes, some big enough to get through a horse-drawn carriage. The performance in general was even and the characters were attractive enough to regret that they died like the newly fumigated cockroaches, dispersing to die for their own gruesome deaths. In general, however, it was not really very scary. After all, we have seen creepy figures that move quickly in the background from "The Brood", why he backed off when / and was scary then only briefly. This movie never solved the basic points of the plot and that is the work of the writer. Naturally, one would expect the director to realize that the story did not make sense. Like who was the secret room behind the closet, why did not the blood-hungry ghost die when he received the nails as prescribed by the book they read before? Why did the computer say "game over" for Frankie's character even though he lived? The list goes on and on. I really do not feel comfortable recommending this movie, since it makes you feel like you wasted your time and there was not enough reward in really scary moments.
