This is not a great cinema. The film is surrounded by clichés and in many places it is a copy of the original Carrie. The parallelisms with the original film are surprising, but with an additional improbability that telekinetic powers are congenital. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I did not like the movie because at least a couple of hours went by ... but these were approved as if one were reading an undemanding book on a long train trip. That book would not be a great literature, but would absorb one for a while and be forgotten soon after, as it would be mixed with the numerous other books laden with clichés. Also, the movie was fine while it lasted, but it may be forgettable. At least I think it is. I can not remember much about that now!
