Who wrote the script of this film, the staff of Disney studios? This is the most inaccurate adaptation of any story! I wanted to laugh at a few scenes and cry at others, and that was only because of how unfortunate it was. I'll have to give it credit, I had some funny scenes, but I could have had a better time with my night. Very rarely do I turn off a movie after only a quarter of the way.
