another eli roth in the making. self-promotion, bad script writing for a horror director. Victor is as far from the new horror icon as Mary Poppins (reference to the Disney score). What's going on here? you have marilyn manson opening and closing this piece of shit and chitty chitty bang bang along all this. Can this even be called horror? horrible, yes, but the horror is a stretch. David Lynch should sue them for stealing elephant man prostheses. Please, stop these fanatics want to be directors now. Video directors already have enough competition to enter the film industry. Connecting to the Internet and talking about how great your film is does not make it happen. stop the madness I work in the industry and yes, it's fun to work in these movies, but it's rarely really entertaining to watch them.
