This is a horror movie starring Richard Crenna and Joanna Pettet as a duo of psychologists who buy an old mansion and invite a small group of friends and patients to help clean up the place. Without knowing it, the mansion houses the door of a basement, the gateway to hell. If you're in the mood for a cliche horror movie, look no further, but if you want something inventive, this little movie will not appeal to you. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (Rather moderate, although in the scene where a man cuts his hand with a saw, you get pretty creepy.) Fanatics of inventive death scenes do not they will like this since all the characters seem to be electrocuted in some way). : $ (Nothing to talk about, Mary Louise Weller adds good looks, but her character was underdeveloped). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (Cliched, but worthy of a view, though.) This does not offer anything new to the genre, but Victor Buono's casting, which is as menacing as a Santa's department store , seems to have attracted some viewers). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (The best performances are from Crenna and Pettet with the other actors just "phone" their roles.) The screenwriter does not develop any character outside of Pettet's character and seems to have forgotten about Mary Louise Weller (Animal House) that disappears for about twenty minutes and only reappears to be electrocuted like everyone else in a boring way.
