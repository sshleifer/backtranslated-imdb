Good music, but these people are not pathetic? A true vintage piece from The Trippy Sixties, and it left me depressed. The director paints the wrong side of the jetset's life and stings like a nest of wasps. If the culture of the time led people to do these things, it seems to me that everything was a trip without discovery, only despair. I tried, I really tried, I like this movie, but these people are nowhere on my page. Yes, it would be good to see the world, to disappear for a while, but I always plan to return. Drugs are not the cause of the fall of these characters, they are their bad attitudes. These guys drink their cup of poison passionately. They cheapen their lives, and in the end, they cheapen the journey that is life. Has the romance been so dark? <br /> <br /> Greetings: interesting landscapes. Wonderful soundtrack of Pink Floyd. <br /> <br /> Warnings: Dated. Depressing drugs. Totally unpleasant characters; They are not flower children. <br /> <br /> Just for the curious, since most of the packages fade the Pink Floyd connection. (Rare Floyd tracks that many have never heard, since FM is not what it was). <br /> <br /> Rating: Two stars.
