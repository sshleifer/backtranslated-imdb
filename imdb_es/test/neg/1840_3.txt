Doll Master is an example of a terrible horror movie, falling somewhere in space with two genres not so well established, a horror movie and an emotional drama movie. It seems that The Doll Master tries to be a terrifying horror movie, but it fails. The noise of the dolls as they move is like taken from the croak of Kayako in Ju-On, and the tracks are like sadako esquire. The killer dolls will remind you of a nice version of "Chucky". But compared to the children's game, this movie is more excellent. But the story seems a nothing, the bright camera shots and the brilliance of the action were eliminated by the plot. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this if you expect big hits.
