Humor does not exist in this loser of a movie. Carrot Top plays a surfer inventor who constantly blows the rent money on his useless useless. Then he helps a broken old man on the side of the road, and voila, he inherited a large corporation. And again and again and beyond the jealous relatives, humanizing the corporation, hostile takes, the obligatory love interest ... aargh ... let's say that this movie is practically impossible to see. What Carrot Top has achieved is to convince me never to go to their theatrical shows.
