Usually, I loved the Carry on movie, but this one is really pretty horrible. There are very few laughs because everything is very forced. There is a lot of talent on the screen and some come out better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are fine, but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is in bad taste. Joan Sims goes well, but in the case of the wonderful Charles Hawtrey it's just sad. When you think about the sad end of his career, the movie is too depressing to watch. The homophobia of the film is unpleasant and it is a very unpleasant experience. The set seems cheap and, unlike other films in the series, the film is very clearly set in England. The side of the sea looks cold and there are few attempts to create illusions here. It seems like a cheap production. You will be surprised how miserable you are, especially if you loved the series.
