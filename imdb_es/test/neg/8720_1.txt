This is a total piece of shit. It is an insult to the impressive book by Frank Herbert. They have destroyed the story and the characters. The performance is medium to bad. The only character well done and played well is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he died quite early in the story and then everything is downhill from there (it's not a very high hill to begin with). <br /> <br /> The 1984 film was directed by the legendary David Lynch. I was not too impressed by the film, but given the technological limitations of the time, they did everything possible. Surprisingly, the mini-series of shit makes it look much better in comparison. He was at least somewhat faithful to the book, which I really love. <br /> <br /> They had the opportunity to do it right this time, unfortunately it was not taken.
