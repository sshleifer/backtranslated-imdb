Supercraptastica meal, which seems too long at 80 minutes. A few years ago, a group of "gypsies" who lived in the caves of a mountain, were burned in a forest fire. Years later, campers disappear from the fire area. A group of horny children, of course, are heading to this area for an unbridled camping trip. Despite the ominous welcome of the ranger (Jackson Bostwick), children climb the mountain anyway. In a short time, the children begin to be trapped by the monster, which remains invisible until the end of the movie, probably because the makeup was so shamefully bad. There are no surprises to talk about: they kill them in the exact order that dictates the formula of these films, leaving the "final girl" to fend for herself, although in a refreshing and throbbing ending, the final girl ends up prey and impregnated for the monster. <br /> <br /> The story itself could not contain the weight of the length of the show, so it was completed with endless shots of animals and insects, which were obviously filmed for another film and inserted here from randomly as a means of making the film long enough for a video premiere. On the positive side, the images of wildlife are quite nice. They also highlight Bostwick talking to a baby deer, a decent death sequence of climbing, OK Gore and Great Jackie Coogan in his final role in the film, as the clumsy local sheriff. This is very far from Charlie Chaplin, but it was still nice to see him. This is only for the slasher finalists.
