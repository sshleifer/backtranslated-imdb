The idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes, Camp Blood (or if you want a horrible word game, bad rather than bad that suits a movie worse than bad, "Camp Bloody horrible" ), it's so bad that it's actually quite depressing to watch. And it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad movie ... <br /> <br /> Great performance control. Bad script checking Sticky effects: check that there is no originality at all, double check. <br /> <br /> It does not even try to be different, and it is riddled with all the imaginable predicted clich√©s. For example, the film opens to a couple who have sex in the forest, so, of course, they end up dead. <br /> <br /> One of the most disturbing things is that this movie actually generated two sequels, how and why it only baffles the mind. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this one.
