I went through the movies on demand and saw Underdog for free and it only lasted 82 minutes, so I decided to watch it. I did not expect much, but it exceeded my expectations of being horrible. Everything about the movie was worth shuddering. The dialogue was atrocious, including many terrible word games. The jokes were terrible too. I found myself screaming and turning off my TV screen while suffering from this garbage. He hit his target audience very well, but I do not see how anyone else could enjoy this movie. I got very angry and almost cried for everything terrible that this movie had in its favor. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing about this movie was being able to give it 1/10 after seeing it. I beg you to avoid it at all costs. I understand the fact that it is made for children, but there is nothing pleasant about it.
