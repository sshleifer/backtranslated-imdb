Crazy disoriented, evil, turbid and endless, given the MGM A-budget high budget treatment. Kate Hepburn plays a girlfriend who suspects that her rich and handsome husband (Robert Taylor) is not the dream ship she married, but a psychotic killer. MGM's attempt to make a Hitchcock thriller is condemned from the start by a turgid, confusing and ridiculous script, and by Hepburn's idiocy as a woman in danger who fears for her life (who could possibly imagine Hepburn scared of something?) To tell Vincent Minnelli that he was directing a thriller, not a musical. Taylor is embarrassing. Only Robert Mitchum, also type against man as a good guy, retains his dignity in a quiet and discreet performance. The dazzling cinematography of Karl Freund creates images of a spooky beauty and is wasted in the wrong film. Final result: "Parnell" Metro of the 1940s.
