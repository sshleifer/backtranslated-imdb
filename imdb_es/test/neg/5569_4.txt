I really wanted to like this movie, because it is refreshingly different from the hordes of horror movie clones of every day, and I appreciate that the filmmakers are trying something original. Unfortunately, the plot just did not stay together and none of the characters was nice enough for me to really care about them or their destinies. <br /> <br /> Visually, the Toybox was quite interesting. The director took many risky moves, such as adding small pieces of animation (with the appearance of Flash) in parts and really reinforcing some of the special effects (like the light of a certain amulet). Sometimes this worked and sometimes it did not, but it deserves congratulations for the attempt, and the cinematography was generally of high quality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when this same approach of throwing many things to the wall See which clubs were applied to the plot, the results were not very good. The film never finds a tone that it likes, going schizophrenically from the black comedy to the family soap opera to the witchcraft movie of the 80s to the nostalgia of childhood to family laughter. Taken by themselves, the fragments of each of these elements work quite well, but nothing becomes a satisfactory whole. Besides that, the great fragments of the plot are never really explained. I'm not one of those who like to put everything on the table, and I like movies that let things be decided by the public, but the parts that are outside The Toybox seem to have run out of money before they could explain them or really did not think about things to begin with. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the director's next project, as I think there is a lot of talent lurking below the surface here, but I can not really recommend The Toybox on its own merits.
