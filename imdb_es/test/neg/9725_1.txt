From the beginning of this film, with the opening sequence of "The Lost Boys", to the bad work and even worse the end of the dialogue, this film advanced at a snail's pace. "The Covenant" was highly recommended by some of my co-workers, who I am completely convinced that they were making a joke on me. At least I hope that is the intention and that its taste is not so bad! This movie did not last much longer than an hour and a half, but he felt much more than that. The story was so basic that it could have been summarized in about 15 minutes, at most. At least they could have filled the rest of the movie with some entertaining magic or fight scenes, however, someone decided (maybe the director, but I do not know if someone really "directed" this movie) that was going to be filled with some shots of "artistic" cameras poorly executed, and meaningless scenes of the "children" swimming and getting into bar fights. Halfway through the movie, I thought that maybe hitting my head against a wall would be more entertaining and, in part, free me from this horrible and dirty feeling I had to keep seeing it. . So I hit my head against a wall, and I enjoyed it more than the movie! I watched him all the way to the bitter end, hoping he would eventually offer me more fun. No, my efforts were rewarded with "How about I make you my Whee-aytch?" I vomited, and then I felt shame for the writer of the screen and pity for the poor actor who had to deliver this feeling. The acting really was not as bad as other critics seemed to think, but even the most talented actor could not save this job, and the work he did, on my nerves! I give the movies a chance, even the bad ones because they usually offer some kind of entertainment, and this was not really the worst movie I've ever seen. Once it was over, I felt like watching the movie "Stealth" again and WOW, this time it was much better! Oh yes, in this case, do not bother with this movie, seriously, do not do it. Watch some episodes of "Charmed", and watch "The Lost Boys" after consuming a good amount of alcohol, and you will be a much better person. If you fall into the same trap I did and look at "The Covenant", be sure to keep all sharp objects away, away from you, you will thank me.
