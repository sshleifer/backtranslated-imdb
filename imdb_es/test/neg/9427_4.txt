An anonymous movie that could have been directed by anyone. Where is Anthony Mann, the director of classics like "El Cid", "El espol√≥n desnuda" or "La hombre de Laramie"? <br /> <br /> There are wonderful shots of planes in the clouds, filmed with love. The story is very trite and almost without dramatizations. The couple lives an almost routine life and the user who complains about June Allyson's choice for wife, IMHO, totally loses the point. With her less than attractive appearance, her husky voice, she was the perfect housewife who I needed the script. At that time, the women were barefoot and pregnant: there is not a single woman among the staff at the base, not even at the desk. jobs -. All they had to do was worry about their supporters, who fought for democracy and against an Enemy whose name we never heard, but in 1955, it was not difficult to guess. <br /> <br /> One wonders why a young person who has never seen a Mann movie should choose this among all the great movies he made.
