... I have no choice but to use it at least once during my review of Respiro. Among other things, what defines the claim is, in my opinion, a lack of emotional sincerity on the part of the author. Respite seems to be done with an artificial and self-conscious attempt to be artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, metaphorical ... even mythical. But fortunately for all true artists, there is no formula predisposed to achieve beauty and artistic depth. Amazing natural places (yes, these remote parts of southern Italy seem exotic even to most other Italians), beautiful actors and some fun, bold and spontaneous performances by a handful of attractive kids will not elevate an unimportant movie beyond a beautiful succession of images. However, this insincere and vain, and ultimately hollow, film seems to be art, and has very limited success, perhaps in some cases by accident. I admit that the conceptually pompous ending has some visual poetry. However, I believe that this was achieved in a way that had more to do with the beauty of the sea of ​​Lampedusa and the strong symbolic power of the bath and water (connecting it with something so mythical, mystical, religious, archetypal, etc.) that With the talent of Crialese. <br /> <br /> Valeria Golino is terribly histrionic and is affected in her performance as Grazia. For a mentally unstable woman of a humble and provincial origin, she has a modern wardrobe. Her lustrous floating floral dresses and sexy sun-drenched beach hair could have adorned the pages of any summer edition of Vogue. The fact that she was a "crazy woman" could have been, in some way, nothing more than a fashionable addition to her modern attitude and style. That's how his "condition" seemed to me. Golino's two-dimensional stereotype of the innocent natural girl, misunderstood and oppressed by her backward community, was exhausting and irritating in the worst case, while leaving me immobile and indifferent at best. I agree with the London critic who wrote that mental illnesses are very badly attended to by cinema: in the course of the whole film we never realize Grazia's disease and we have no idea what is really wrong with it (aside from its being a boring stereotype of a "free spirit"). We do not know why he was given injections and he is required to see a specialist in Milan. This generic form of writing mental illness is one of the main telltale signs of the general superficiality of the film. <br /> <br /> Another quite insulting aspect of Respiro is the singularization of its location. I struggled to find out whether this film should be set in the present or in the past, since it was intended to make even a part of Italian backward (in comparison) seem a dozen times more picturesque and conveniently primitive than it really is. . is. Again, this smells at a shallow depth and a complete lack of sincerity on the part of Crialese. Some non-Italian spectators will happily enjoy the picturesque backwardness, the cliché of the Italian possessive and macho man, as if it were a commonplace, and they will be so willing to continue seeing my country as a country culturally stranded at some point in the 1950s ( The question I would like to ask David Ferguson, the critic of Dallas, Texas, is this: is the mentality of YOUR country stuck in the 1950s? No, why should it be mine?). Unfortunately for anyone who wants to see Italy in such an anachronistic way, that aspect of Respiro is really ridiculous and false even in the eyes of THIS Italian viewer. The subtly incestuous tension between Grazia and her eldest son was as boring and predictable as Fabrizio Bentivoglio's routine of sexist but loving husband. She especially detested the scene in which Grazia joins her husband and male friend in a man-to-man joke about a beer bottle, in the face of her husband's shame and chauvinistic disgust. According to this movie, it is not the place of a woman to participate in a man's conversations. Ah, but our "adorable" free spirit is too good for this place and does not understand the oppressive and unwritten rules of Lampedusan patriarchy! This scene not only represents something so false, but it should also be enough to discredit the credibility of the entire film. He is also wrong at the end of the culture he strives to represent, which clearly shows that it was written without a clear understanding of the location or its population. I would challenge anyone who knows contemporary Italy to say otherwise. <br /> <br /> For a highly successful contemporary Italian filmmaker, one that, in my opinion, deserves to be included among the greats of Italy's glorious cinematic past (which, unfortunately, is not). In the shadow of your old self!), Look no further, Gianni Amelio, especially Lamerica, Così Ridevano and his latest, La Stella Che Non C'è. Unlike most contemporary Italian cinema, sadly derived and stagnant, Amelio is a fresh and independently creative voice. Despite my biting criticism of Respiro, I am now more than willing to believe that Crialese's last Nuovomondo, now on display in Italian theaters, will be worth it. Therefore, I hope to enjoy it, although it will not be too shocking to me if I do not (considering my feelings for Respite!).
