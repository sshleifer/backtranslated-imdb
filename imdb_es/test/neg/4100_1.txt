This is a sad movie. What makes it even more regrettable is the time, effort and money in a super predictable script and action. <br /> <br /> It is some kind of monster, by the way, and some kind of insect. Do not expect an explanation of the plot. There are none. That could work, if there was something of interest, or characters that we could worry about. There is not Everything that happens to anyone is as predictable as the other movies that the science fiction channel does. <br /> <br /> Do not try to understand what some of the characters say. They talk nonsense, especially the annoying lead woman, whose accent is a kind of thick British that is harder to understand than any other old British movie she may have seen. She is unintelligible. <br /> <br /> A lot of money is spent on some great scenarios and scenarios, and that's the biggest crime in this movie, because it's just not worth it.
