I just got back from "AGS". After watching it, I am convinced that no matter how much it is written how he thoroughly researched the movie, Stone has NEVER seen an NFL game in his life. Great cinematography? Give me a break. Game montages were almost inaccessible and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. Was there ANYTHING in this movie that was not mentioned in "North Dallas Forty"? <br /> <br /> Star player of aging ... check. Hot young shot ... check. Analgesics .... check. Owner who does not "get it" .... check. Crazy behavior off the field .... check <br /> <br /> Also, it's the playoffs in Dallas (that is, in December or January) at an outdoor stadium, but there are people sitting there on t-shirts without sleeves and shorts! And what about those lights? Were they playing in a Japanese Kabuki theater or a sports stadium? <br /> <br /> And the strategy shown in the game was ridiculous. He is fourth and 1 in the "Sharks" 30. Dallas leads 35-31. Kick the field goal. This would not only make sense from the football point of view, but you would also have an even better final sequence in which they could have scored and have to go through the conversion of two points. Hell, tie the game with the extra point and Stone could have done it even 3 hours with overtime. <br /> <br /> They were the assemblies of the "old-time" soccer players that were supposed to be a tribute to the game. ? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> And the script ... ugh. More cliches than you can shake a stick in ... oops, there is another. <br /> <br /> "Slapshot" was better than this movie. From far. <br /> <br /> 1/10. <br /> <br /> Ignore this at all costs. <br /> <br />
