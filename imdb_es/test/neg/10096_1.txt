The worst movie ever seen. The worst performance too. I can not imagine a movie worse than this one. Nothing to see Do not act at all. The (actors) should look for another job. I can not understand who was stupid enough to put money in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Eric Roberts. It must be difficult ... I can not imagine how BIG your mortgage should be to justify taking the job! <br /> <br /> The ladies of the movie ... maybe it's better to continue with XXX. <br /> <br /> As for the LEADING MAN ... what an advantage! You'd better put on a leash and stay there! I can see him being more successful in barking than in acting. <br /> <br /> General evaluation: Do not rent ... DO NOT BUY!
