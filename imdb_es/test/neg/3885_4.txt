Well, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (England spine). She was killed in the first scene, that's right, friends; This show has no backbone! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Ol 'Colonel Cricket from The First War and now the lord of the manor decked out. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered lady of the mansion, 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years beyond her best, but still glamorous (British spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy boy on the side. Okay, they have the full knowledge and consent of Colonel Cricket (even uncle comes for Christmas!) However, he is considered colonel enough to have said a toy boy his age (what a girl!) <Br / > <br /> David McCallum as the toy-boy said, as uselessly glamorous as his squeeze. Pilcher could not find any coverage for him inside the story, so he gave him a secret job at Circus. <br /> <br /> and finally: <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, venerable director of Venerable Girls' Boarding School, who serves tea in her office with a hint of deep and poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. His best advice: "I've only been to Nancherrow once (Stately Home of England), I thought it was very beautiful but, somehow, it's not part of the real world." Well, we can not say they did not warn us. <br /> <br /> Oh, Susan, the time was that your character would have been directing the whole show. They no longer write them like that. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So, with a cast and a scenario like this, you have the "Brideshead Revisited" modifications, right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took these one-dimensional support roles because they paid very well. After all, acting is one of the oldest temporary jobs that exist (YOU name someone else!) <br /> <br /> First warning sign: lots and lots of background light. They manage to shoot outdoors. "Hello, it's only sunlight!" <br /> <br /> Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. When he does not cry, his eyes are wet. That's the law of romantic novels: Leading Lady is a "dew eye". <br /> <br /> From here on, Leading Lady will be known as LL <br /> <br /> Third warning sign: LL actually has stars in her eyes when she is in love. Still, I will give her a prize Emily Mortimer just for having to act with the focus in her eyes (I wonder if they used contacts?) <br /> <br /> And, finally, the fourth warning sign: does not appear on the screen female character is " Mrs. "She is" Miss "or" Lady ". <br /> <br /> When everything was said and done, I still could not tell you who was chasing whom and why. I could not even tell you what was said and done. <br /> <br /> In summary: everyone is going through World War II without anything happening to them. <br /> <br /> All right, in the end, LL discovers that he has lost his parents in the Japanese prison camps and the little sister returns home catatonic. Meanwhile (there is always a "meanwhile"), a young man with whom LL was in love (when, I do not know) comes home after some difficult time of the war and finds himself living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be a bit on the street, if SHE is going to find you there.) The two victims of the war are eliminated to recover in Nancherrow (SOMEBODY has to be "eliminated" in SOME PLACES of these romantic stories!) <br /> <br /> Great drama.
