It is disconcerting to see so many people who give exaggeratedly high ratings to this film. Some of the praises use such twisted reasoning (and transparent agendas that reveal a simple love for anything critical of the United States) that approaches hysteria. <br /> <br /> Heaven's Gate is a bad movie, it is fundamentally horrible Endless scenes that use elaborate shots that are useless, muddy dialogues, naive shady, no sense of any subject other than excess ... <br / > <br /> The high rating of this disaster is a product of revisionist history and temporary changes. in perception. <br /> <br /> For some perspective, look at Lawrence of Arabia before looking at Heaven's Gate. You will see how useless and lost this movie really is. The "problems" you may have been trying to deal with are lost in a miasma. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with the films that are critical of the United States per se, but when a terrible movie receives so many undeserved praises. just for that element ... it's worth challenging. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing for two reasons; curiosity, and as a warning to young filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I saw it for free at home, imagine the torture of being in a theater and sitting ... for 4 sinuous hours!
