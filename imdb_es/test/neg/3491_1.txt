Crash is supposed to be a film about racism in Los Angeles. But, in fact, they are just a bunch of coincidences between several characters that connect with each other during a day in one of the biggest cities in the world. Who the hell is going to believe that? There are unrealistic situations, one after the other. On the other hand, this film aims to show racism among Asians, Iranians, Latinos, blacks and whites. But the big mistake is based on a pre-established racism that comes from the writer. Mainly because the white characters in this film are usually portraits as people with a better socioeconomic status than the rest of the other races. The Iranians are poor, as are the Asians. And Latinos, as always, are portraits like housewives, police officers or with a very low profile job like a locksmith. Jesus!!! Do not you think it's time to change these stereotypes? The same goes for blacks, portrayal as gang members, with the exception of a Black TV Director, who was the only new character for me. This movie stinks so much that I'm very disappointed by the kind of movies that come out of Hollywood these days. Always with stereotyped characters. There is no realism. Nothing to identify with. It's just a big waste because this could have been a great opportunity to show Latinos, Koreans, Iranians and blacks from a different perspective.
