I have seen this movie. I can say that this is really a bad movie. The director has gone crazy ... of course ... he knows a lot about the army, but he's certainly a cheap guy. There are also many technical flaws in the movies ... <br /> <br /> Well ... here I have my doubts: in the end, when they rescue the family (including a girl who has just been raped) ... Why do they leave them out of their place? I did not see any ambulances around! There are many aspects in the film that are real ... but I just wish the Commander had narrated / helped / helped some other good director in the movie. <br /> <br /> Mohanlal surely deserves a better director
