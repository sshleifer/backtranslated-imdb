I got this movie for fifty cents in a sale that went out of business. I want my fifty cents back. Bad acting, bad script writing, bad direction, historically inaccurate, even the sound of the movie is horrible. It is not the issue that offends. I am one of the many who find very interesting crime movies and thrillers. The issue could have been treated more seriously, paying much more attention to details and precision, and the lack of respect shown by the victims and their devastated friends and family is enough to confuse anyone. In addition, little or no attention is paid to what might have caused someone to begin the strange behavior that Ed Gein was showing in depicting these horrible crimes. <br /> <br /> Save time and sanity. Do not look at this horrible movie. If you bought it, you have my sympathy. However, it is not a total waste ... you can discard the disc and use the plastic box!
