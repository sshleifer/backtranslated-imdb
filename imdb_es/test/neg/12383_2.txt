This is almost the territory of Ed Wood. Yes, that ridiculous accident of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey vulture and a bad day at the dentist's office. And that screech sound effect makes the nails on a blackboard sound like Mozart. And why the giant claw when the clumsy creature swallows its victims with a mechanical jaw? We have large close-ups of the ugly chicken foot, but nothing more. I guess the producers thought that a more appropriate Big Mouth might suggest a Jerry Lewis comedy. And speaking of comedies, everything that "antimatter" of fools is more fun than anything in a Lewis movie. I suppose the writers were stuck for a reason why an ordinary duck hunter could not take charge of a flying threat from the 1950s, so they invented a real nonsense: the antimatter of another galaxy. Yes, this KFC fugitive is supposed to have flown from another galaxy behind an antimatter shield as explained in unbearable detail by one of the film's resident geniuses. In this case, it's Jeff Morrow, a pilot he met in his spare time, who advises Einstein on the secrets of the universe. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is also Morrow who maintains the ridiculous process of the poor quality film Hall of Shame, since he actually presents his lines with a serious face. Moreover, it even sounds as if he believed them. This is a triumph movie in first-rate functions. To hell with the Oscars, Morrow deserves a combat medal for acting beyond his duty in the most extreme circumstances of the bad movie. Look at the first lady Corday, then you can measure her strength under fire. It seems that he just woke up in a bad dream and maybe if he stays still, nobody will notice. I just did it. Oh, well, the first time I saw this disaster was through a haze in the last row of what is now a housing development. I should have learned my lesson and broken another pack of 12 this second time.
