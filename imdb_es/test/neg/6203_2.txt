David Dhawan copied HITCH and an unofficial copy. The film is not half as fun or funny as the original, it's boring, with forced stories like Lara's track of having a child and no husband. In addition, there is an unwanted stupid Chota DON and David tries to drown the drama too, but the movie looks disjointed, boring <br /> <br /> The songs just show up, the same goes for the romance and all, except for a few scenes Fun of Govinda, the dance before the interval, it is not worth mentioning the last scenes. they are quite funny, but they tend to be too long <br /> <br /> David's address is as bad as that of MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA, he needs to change his style or try something good. Music saves grace, some songs are good, but situations seem forced <br /> <br /> Govinda looks overweight and seems too noisy and screams his lines on the initial reels, but gets into the slot and gives the best of himself in the office and the scene with Salman in his cabin and towards the end <br /> <br /> Salman only plays himself and his nasal tone plus his false style of acting is a headache < br /> <br /> Lara is avoidable, Katrina is fake as usual <br /> <br /> The child overreacts
