If you've ever heard the saying, "the book is always better than the movie," Heart of Darkness is no exception to the rule. I think it was much easier for me to understand the details of the novel about the film because I read the book aloud with my English class. We discussed each paragraph in great detail, so I understood the concept rather quickly. I really could not understand the plot while watching the movie. This may be because there were no discussions in class, but I suppose it is also because I could not paint my own images in the mind of the events in the novel. If you are the type of person who believes in that famous saying, then leave the movie Heart of Darkness off your to-do list.
