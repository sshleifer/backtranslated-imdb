I see absolutely nothing funny, not even remotely funny, in this stupid movie. An unrealistic, ridiculous and ridiculous idea, completely ridiculous. It is hard to believe that the main character, who seems so articulate, intelligent and imaginative, is not accepted in any university. Even harder to believe is that nobody closes the place. The actors portrayed characters directly from Characterville. We have seen them many times in many movies. Nothing new here. I found it on television late at night, and since there was nothing else on, I saw the whole movie boring and stupid. What a total waste. Maybe if you're a teenager, you might find it fun. The movies are made for an immature mind, so teenagers, go for it. The rest, by no means.
