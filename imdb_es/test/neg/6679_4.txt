STAR QUALIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> When I was a child Mark Goddard (C Thomas Howell) was impotent as his family, including his father hero cop (Jeff Fahey), were brutally murdered by cruel criminals he had tried to bring down. With an inner desire to punish the evildoers who become infected with him as he grew up as a result of this, Mark employs rigorous means when he brings the suspects he is pursuing and gets into many problems with his superiors because of this. But then he finds out about 'Justice Incorporated', a secret group of men and women led by a mysterious man (Ed Lauter) that serves to distribute punishments that fit with crime outside the law. But things get out of hand and they go crazy. Getting out alive can be more difficult than he thought. <br /> <br /> The Sweeper has problems with the game, because we have seen this same plot just before (and better) in films like The Star Chamber with Michael Douglas and Magnum Force with Clint Eastwood. The title does not make sense either. But we also have to deal with the absolute ridiculousness of the film, including a scene in which a daughter's headphones manage to drown out the sound of her family being murdered, an ending that involves a chase with a bad guy that starts on the highway and ends in a Wright. Brothers plane, as well as some of the most ridiculous performances ever put on screen and a very clich√© and pretentious script. But there are some great action sequences here and there, and the film's involuntary laugh factor certainly keeps it alive with a pulse. **
