This movie is so stupid that I want to recover my $ 2.99 for what I paid! First, this movie begins with a group of talented wooden actors geeks to fill, as if they had been chosen somewhere on the street because the "real" actors did not appear due to the ridiculous script or they just could not make anyone else Desperate enough. to make this movie! The music in this movie is enough to make you fall asleep, the flute music made for the fairy who dances in the desert would not even be good enough for this movie! And the guy disguised as Satan looks like he's all dressed up in a special K-Mart Halloween costume! There are no dead scenes except a few lame scenes. When I saw what the terrible killers looked like in those bathrobes with Nosferatu faces, I just laughed! This is what the whole city is supposed to be fleeing once a year! This movie is one of the worst demonic movies I've seen in my life. Avoid this one!
