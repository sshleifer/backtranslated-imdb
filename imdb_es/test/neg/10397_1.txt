Dante would have been mortified, if he knew that his masterpiece was being UPDATED FOR CACHUPADAS. Also the actors who played the puppets are sold. Due to the fact that touching a puppet is not acting, it simply does not do anything. Nobody will really care who the puppet was. People only care who played an important role in a real movie. This is just annoying because of the way you can make fun of such an incredible man and his belief, with this silly little movie. This should be a crime and ... I can not believe you would ruin such a book. I thought the movie was absolutely ridiculous and should be destroyed !!!! Completely ruin what you're supposed to get when you read it. You're just making a big joke
