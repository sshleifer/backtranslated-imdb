The movie is nothing extraordinary. In fact, it is an insult to the horror genre. None of that borders on fear ... not even close to the threshold of fear ... <br /> <br /> It's just another case of "another horror movie for teenagers": seen one and you've seen them all. First minutes in the movie and you will know what will happen next. The worst part is that the script is clearer than the latest installment of the horror movie. It would have been better if it's written in Spanish. And do not make me start with the internal jokes and the boxing lines. <br /> <br /> Although I will give a little credit for the special effects. But trust me, as in any other horror movie made in Hollywood, special effects and CGI special effects have little or no effect on the scary ability of a horror movie. In fact, it makes it worse. <br /> <br /> Between Anita Briem's ​​fresh face and the spooky place, there's not much to see in this movie.
