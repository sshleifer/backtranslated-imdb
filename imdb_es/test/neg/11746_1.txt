Okay, first of all, who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second, who would shoot him? I admit that I had no intention of seeing this movie for the same reason. The original Psycho is one of my favorite movies of all time and I thought it was a degrading photocopy. I saw it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed in less than five minutes on this shit that was horrible. First, as mentioned, they did it shot by shot. Where is the originality? Why redo a film that is almost perfect EXACTLY as it was the first time? Why redo a movie to start? If YOU are going to redo something, redo something that does not work and do it BETTER! <br /> <br /> Second, they used exactly the same script as the 1960 version. The dialogue no longer works. It works well and sounds perfect for the 1960 version, but it seems strange and forced coming out of modern actors. Why not update the dialogue? Hitch did not write the script, you could have rewritten it. <br /> <br /> This movie had a very good talent and was wasted by imitation of the original actors. The actor who played the car salesman looked like he was only playing John Anderson's performance as a car salesman in the original. All the actors seemed that the only direction they had was to be the characters in the original movie. Vince Vaughn may have seemed a little more creepy than Anthony Perkins, but in doing so, you lose the sympathy you're supposed to have for Norman. The fact that Norman masturbated while watching Marion get undressed went too far and lost the innocence of the character that I think Tony Perkins captured so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen's accent was annoying and Rita Wilson was too old to play Caroline. His lines came out as someone desperate instead of young and fun as the performance of Patricia Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I saw about the film was that Gus Van Sant was able to open the film with the shot that Hitch had imagined. Hitch wanted to open with a long shot over Phoenix, but he could not at that moment, so he had to settle for a series of cross-fire shots together. This film fulfilled that vision with a helicopter shot that came through the hotel window. After that, although the film became a useless waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful movie, look at this, but DO NOT under any circumstances see it BEFORE viewing the original. This is a photocopy of the original and should never have been illuminated in green. Adhere to the teacher's film, not imitation.
