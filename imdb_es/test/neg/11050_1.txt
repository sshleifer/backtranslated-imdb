This movie was horrible, plain and simple. He will probably be revered by those who only see "movies" and not "movies" and, therefore, will feel sorry for me for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film, but I am confident enough in my intellect to To say that This boring, self-aggrandizing and painfully crafted film was a waste of two hours and nine dollars. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see the inexplicable good reviews he had received and left the theater. The theater thought that these criticisms should have been written by over-enthusiastic film students and by the aforementioned group of people who reject normal films , perhaps for fear that they can really enjoy one day. <br /> <br /> The story is quite Promising: a man is imprisoned for 15 years, without knowing either his captor or his crime. He is then released abruptly and given only five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. However, the big concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke when Oh Dae-Su runs around hitting people, trying to have sex with a girl who is trying to go to the bathroom and eating a live and wriggling squid (probably because dramatic effect, as there is absolutely no other reason for this). Meanwhile, he is trying to decipher this horrible thing he did to earn fifteen years in prison, and when he finally discovers that it is ridiculous and a great disappointment. His nemesis, a man who supposedly went to school with him when he was young, looks like a Banana Republic model twenty years younger than him. Hey, I know prison has been difficult for Oh Dae-Su, but is it too much to ask for an actor who looks more like his age? Of all the bad things about this movie, this seems to be the easiest to fix. <br /> <br /> And the big secret: the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when I could have been doing it. something productive - it's a joke of a plot related to incest and a rumor that started in high school. Come on! Throw us a bone here, was it really the best they could do? Did I sit through stupid dialogues, overreactions, grim scenes and gratuitous violence for this? (By the way, I'm not against violence in a movie if it seems to fit into the story, but in this case it seems I was forced to watch our hero tear someone's teeth and cut their tongues with a scissors to distract me and realizing that I was wasting the afternoon watching a piece of pretentious trash). <br /> <br /> Take my advice: do something else with your time and money. Or take your nine dollars and go see a humble "movie", one that you could really enjoy.
