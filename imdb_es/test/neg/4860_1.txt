I clicked on the Encore Mystery channel to wait for the movie I wanted to see, Island of Dr. Moreau. I caught only a few minutes of Shadow Conspiracy. An old man runs to meet Charlie and grabs him by the arm. Suddenly, an Assassin with a bright rain coat hits the old man on the head (with a sidearm) from the other side of the street. After waiting for "C" to turn and look, the "A" tries to shoot "C" and clearly fails. "C" was a much easier goal, the old man could not have gone very far. Duh! There is a chase and "C" is on an elevator "A" is on the roof, so try to shoot the cable, which is parallel to the "A". He hits and cuts the cable, impossible. Later, this time with a specialized rifle, the "A" lines up in "C" from about 50 meters, but it's stupid to notice a motorcycle approaching and hitting the driver instead. How does Charlie get his parts? Dad goes to the producers and says: "Look, my son needs work ..." He reminds me of his stupid Sit - Com. All the actors are good, except, yes ... you have it. Normally I have to wait 2 or 3 minutes of that waiting for C.S.I. come. Let's see, what can I do for the next hour? I know, I'm going to trim my toenails! Much better use of my time.
