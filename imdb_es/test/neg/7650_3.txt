John Sayles, what have you done? <br /> <br /> "Silver City" had moments in which I could see the bright hope of a good story, well-drawn characters, dialogues that make you think. And then those moments would be quickly covered by layers of poor writing, clumsy direction and abysmal acting. I really love almost all of John Sayles' work, but "Silver City" is scary. <br /> <br /> I have the feeling that Sayles may have been working on the beginnings of a good story related to illegal and industrial work. corruption plot lines, but then hurried and stuck the secondary plot that satirized the Bush administration about it. The two stories do not really connect with each other, and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first 3/4 of the film, which makes me lose patience with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The other major flaw is the performance of Danny Huston. His dialogue in each scene is delivered with a gaping smile, regardless of its appropriateness to the mood. I hated this guy at the end of the movie, having reminded me of all the bad actors in all the high school plays I've seen. Not having seen Huston in anything else, I do not know whether to blame him or blame Sayles more on him. In any case, it is the unfortunate focal point of a very unfortunate movie. <br /> <br /> Until the last final scene with a hammer, I was disappointed "Silver City". Sayles at their best, or even, even Sayles in mediocre, can be much better than this movie. See any of his other works in his place. This is not even worth renting.
