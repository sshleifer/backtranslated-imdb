Bad movie! Bad! Go standing in a discount bucket. Carrot Top really should stick to low-light comedy clubs. It's movies like this that make old Jerry Lewis movies look like Shakespeare and John Agar like John Barrymore. Coutney Thorne-Smith (a good talent) is absolutely lost. His purpose seems to be mainly beautiful and alien. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing about the film is to see Raquel Welch playing Alexis Carrington and Estelle Harris as a harridan of a landlady. The only way I can imagine someone thinking that it would be a good idea to make this movie (beyond the second year), is if the fourth-grade child of the producers was allowed to choose the script. Well, maybe your third grade student. What this film really needs is to be rubbed in the noses of its creators.
