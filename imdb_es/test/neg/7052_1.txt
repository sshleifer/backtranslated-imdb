AZN TV, from the USA UU., He bought the rights to this film and the network shows it with the English title THE PICKPOCKET. <br /> <br /> THE PICKPOCKET of 1997 takes the creation of amateur films to the home cinema to incredible levels of displeasure. The film shows a long series of boring adventures of a disinterested and confused boy. This main character, Xiao Wu, is not limited to walking aimlessly. Sadly, viewers will soon realize that Xiao Wu has an unsurpassed talent to look for, and will remain inactive near the most unpleasant noises found in China. Hitting empty tin buckets by being hit with a stick - he is there. All the old engines in China are agitated in agony, he is there. A crying baby? Yes, you guessed it, he is there! According to THE PICKPOCKET, China is the most unpleasant and irritating place on planet Earth. <br /> <br /> The only element worse than the sound of THE PICKPOCKET is photography. The camera shakes, shakes and shakes a little more. Finally, the camera stops, but then falls on the knees of the actor and simply remains there until someone in the team realizes the error and begins to shake the camera again. Most of the trembling film is framed in distant shots, long, long, long. The few times the camera gets a little closer, nothing convincing happens to connect the viewer with what is happening. <br /> <br /> Photography is cloudy, discolored and often blurred. The use of color is ... well, there is no sign of intelligence that controls the use of color. The majority of each shot is carried out 20 times too long. Few films are so painful to sit on. This movie is painful to watch and painful to listen to. And then it just ends. <br /> <br /> John Woo fans could enjoy listening to part of the DIE XUE SHUANG XIONG (THE KILLER) soundtrack as the main character is hanging out of the video store for many minutes. Anyway, be careful, THE PICKPOCKET will steal the good time.
