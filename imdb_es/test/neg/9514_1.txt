It's so depressing when the filmmakers try to be cool and it's so obvious here. This has a below-average performance, a laughable dialogue, split screens that are hard to see and many mistakes in their attempt to be a period and autobiographical film. This film should be avoided at all costs. They told me not to go see this movie. I wish I had listened.
