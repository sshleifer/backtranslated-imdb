I have never seen a movie more unreal than this disgusting piece of dung. The performance was exaggerated. The address was sticky and amateurish. The script was just a joke. The story seemed written by a person who has never been near a high school football game, let alone a professional game. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to be in this film as an actor? It was terrible, playing the most unrealistic announcer of all time. He could not even be hired to participate in professional wrestling contests. Then you have Jamie Foxx, who shoots like a girl. But, he is a little more athletic than the elderly Dennis Quaid. Seriously, Stone wanted to direct this movie to 16-year-old men with ADD. That's why we listen to loud music, fast cuts and numerous editions. It just became a bad MTV video. Shame on Al Pacino for doing this shit. Cameron diaz Devils, that non-talent assumes any role that falls on the pike. When Lawrence Taylor is the best "actor" you left, well, your movie sucks! And this he does.
