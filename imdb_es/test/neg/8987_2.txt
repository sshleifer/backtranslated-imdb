First, let me say that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is. Maybe the book was great, but the movie was not. <br /> <br /> I have spent my entire life living in the Peidmont region, North Carolina. I've never heard southern accents as ridiculous as those in this movie. I have lived in two small cities in North Carolina and Charlotte and Raleigh. Occasionally, you will meet people with a strong Southern accent, but I have never found a city where everyone speaks as a bad imitation of Gone with the Wind. <br /> <br /> In response to Gore_Won from the atheist community. His comments reveal more about his deformed psyche than about the movie. If we had to expand our imagination and pretend that there is something realistic about this movie, that it does not exist, the truth is that bad people like Tory's father will always find some justification for their actions. The author chose religion to counteract Tory's supernatural abilities. Your assumption that "the true character of the Gospels" directs a man to beat his daughter is the most perverse and ill-informed interpretation I have ever heard. Before you start talking about the Gospels, maybe you should read them first. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie. The dialogue is flat, unnatural and incredible most of the time. In particular, many of the things that Kade told Tory are inappropriate and do not match the mood, context or the way they are said. <br /> <br /> The "exciting turn" at the end of the movie is scarce. , predictable, and lacks credibility. Some have also claimed that Jacqueline Bisset does a wonderful job in this film, but the truth is that the character of a bitter mother is also a one-dimensional, predictable and antiquated character. Is it Bisset's fault? I do not know. <br /> <br /> If you have the option of watching this movie and a twenty-year replay of the Muppet Show, I recommend the Muppet Show.
