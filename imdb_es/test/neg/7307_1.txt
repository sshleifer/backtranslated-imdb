Really a great leap forward in the perfection of painful cinema. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is bad. Act (if you can call it that), lighting, sound, script (if there was one), editing, direction, work of the camera, everything is atrocious. There is not a single element that is done well. If I thought that this was intentional, then I could give the movie a bit of credit, but I can not believe that people intended to make such a frightening movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth buying and projecting it to your worst enemies. .
