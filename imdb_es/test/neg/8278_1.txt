For me, reviewing films is an extension of my love for movies, and in particular horror movies. The criticisms I have written so far have been for films that I love, respect and admire, and I have rewarded them with enthusiasm with perfect praise and qualifications. As a lifelong horror movie fan, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to share with others my thoughts and ideas about the great horror movies and, hopefully, have a hand to expose people to movies that Otherwise they would not search. . I recently started reviewing films for the IMDB, and my initial intention was to focus only on my personal favorites, examining those that I think are important and of lasting value for the horror genre. However, the existence of films like "Graduation Day" is, without a word game, a thorn in my side. Completely lacking in any merit, this collection of unformed ideas of 1981 is directed in an amateurish, ill-acted way and, in every way, an absolute shame for horror films. During the brief couple of years before and after the release of this film, we saw the emergence of national (and Canadian) films such as "Halloween II", "Prom Night", "Terror Train", "Madman", "My Bloody Valentine, "" The Prowler "," Just Before Dawn "," Final Exam "and" Hell Night ", among others. These films, although of varying degrees of quality, clearly strived to achieve something in terms of story, plot, performance, direction and overall tone. Not all films released during this abundant season of the Slasher Era would be of artistic merit or commercial success of the original "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th," but these films were well made and clearly contributed to the continued development of horror films. "Graduation Day," an abysmal farce about a masked assassin who harasses members of a high school athletic team, was directed by Herb Freed, who can only be expected to never again attempt to defile the horror genre. with a similar parody. The task of creating worthwhile horror films is best left to those who have a genuine love and respect for the genre. This film fails miserably at all possible levels, including frighteningly wooden performances, special effects of the ten-cent shop, an irritating musical score and, above all, a story that lacks the slightest hint of tension or suspense . A useless exercise in how to waste a movie, the "Graduation Day" is an absolute shame for horror movies.
