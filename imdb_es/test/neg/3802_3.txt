Perhaps here, in Sydney, we are all blind and, as a result, we can accumulate floats like this s-eek! -Un in theaters with class. Launched here in 1980, this hilarious all-tar drama was greeted with howls of joy at the session I attended. In fact, the public was so interested in the ridiculous screen pranks that it played like a Rocky Horror session. At 5 minutes, we all knew it was a real disaster: the tugboat scene where you can see the buckets of water thrown from the resting place. After that, all the patterns for himself and the cinema sounded with advice, cheering for the bad acting and the unpleasant reactions. The shooting in the cellar between the boxes is especially idiotic and allows drunken spectators with friends in altered states to also see to contribute appropriately. I call these films Michael Caine his films of holiday homes because I always consider that he accepts to do them because he has seen a house that he likes and does not want to spend his savings. Like Jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it's called.
