Would it be too trite on my part to create a review of just saying the word "STUPID" over and over again? Probably. <br /> <br /> This is possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life. Seriously. There are better movies in Mystery Science Theater 3000. I watched this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party when I was still in theaters. Although it was really * with friends * and on one of his * birthday parties, * I had to leave. Actually I had to leave. I apologized and left. Fortunately, some of the parents were doing the same thing, so I did not see myself as a total idiot ... Anyway, this movie is horrible. There's nothing I like about it. It is painful (as in the fact of causing physical pain) slow and sickly (literally induces vomiting) without grace. You almost feel sorry for Tom Arnold, but you do not because you remember that he was actually IN the movie. It really hurts even what you THINK. <br /> <br /> I was on TV a few months ago, and I decided that I had to watch it all the time, just once. I remembered then why I came out in the first place, and I felt guilty for raising their grades even for a spectator. The gags are not funny, the characters are not interesting. It is just a senseless problem and stupidity. <br /> <br /> There is a small crowd of eight-year-old children who watched the movie when it came out and considered it "brilliant". If you think that the piece is removed by pece with a spoonful of ice cream is great, then, of course, fix them. But if you have dignity, avoid this great STUPID disaster. SCORE: 0/10 ... maybe a negative 1, actually.
