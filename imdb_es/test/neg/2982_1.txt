The ABC people forgot to do their biographical research ... so many scenes were just wrong! The actor who plays JPII was very rigid, there was no personality there. It is very obvious that this movie was at the bottom of the programming totem poll, the movement is such a low budget. The script is terrible. Conversations like: "You must follow the rules" "No, people are dying of hunger". Lame. In addition, the film jumped like crazy from one event to another to fit in two hours. Terrible! A better use of your time would be to watch a PBS documentary on JPII. In addition, CBS published a miniseries on JPII that is much better than ABC by far. JPII was a wonderful man, and it bothers me to think that my grandchildren could get this ABC movie and think that THAT is what it really was.
