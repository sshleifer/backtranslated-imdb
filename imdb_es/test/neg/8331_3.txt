The world now seems to be in a strange stage of downsizing, in which objects such as DVD and CD players are constantly decreasing in size. Obviously, it's much cooler to have an iPod smaller than a bigger one. This is not the case with theater screens, as in the case of the IMAX, the huge, widely known theater system that has surprised the public since its launch and to this day. While the material is well. <br /> <br /> The main problem with 'Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D' is that it uses the giant screen as its main advantage. It's boring, uninformative and unforgiving. to please us and amaze us with its special effects and inspiring quotes from famous names like Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Another problem with the movie is that he does not even take the time to sit down and interview the lucky few who have had such an extraordinary experience as having been on the moon. Instead, the writers simply pressed COPY and PASTE and hired famous voices like Morgan Freeman, Bill Paxton and Matt Damon to imitate their famous quotes. This tactic is relentlessly repetitive and tedious. . <br /> <br /> I would say without hesitation a moment that I did not learn a part of the information from the movie that I did not know anymore. <br /> <br /> And he repeatedly insisted on irritating the shit out of me with his insistent sentimentality. in three minutes there seems to be a signal for the voice of Tom Hanks to say something like "Without the contributions of these brave men and women ..." Watching the film is like seeing a bad ad. For forty agonizing minutes. <br /> <br /> 1/4
