Choose a stereotype, any stereotype (be it racial, sexual, cultural, etc.), and I bet you'll find it in Wassup Rockers. Do you think that all Hispanic teenagers are stupid, hairy, disjointed and dirty rioters? Are Hispanic girls crazy, are they easy and naked foxes? Do all blacks want to start fights and carry weapons? Do all gays do themed parties with pink drinks and ask young people to make models for them? Are all white teenagers rich and wrinkled princesses who are bored with white teenagers and are looking for something a little more dangerous? If you answered "yes" to any of the above questions, you, my friend, are a fan, and will LOVE the Wassup Rockers. <br /> <br /> Director Larry Clark likes to surprise his audience (he was 15 years old) The first time I saw Kids and I think that's why I'm still a virgin, but Wassup Rockers is not surprising? It's just bad. Try to be nervous and realistic with your minimal dialogue and your hair close-ups, but these characters and this story are completely unreal. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, Wassup Rockers is a teenager's fantasy. What 14 year old does not want to be a skater who gets into trouble, crashes at parties, takes 40 years and the hot and rich white girl tells him that his uncircumcised penis "seems dangerous?" Besides that demographic, I really do not know who is going to enjoy this movie.
