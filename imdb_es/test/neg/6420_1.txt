Years ago, Sara, a young woman, witnessed that her parents were murdered, now as an adult she suffers from several mental illnesses (did I mention that she has an imaginary friend?) This film numbs the viewer, not in a sense of tension, of course. , but rather a feeling of drowsiness. Bored with death, I found it difficult to sit down, as I could feel my eyelids getting heavier with each endless minute of meaningless chatter and supposed "mysteries". Is Sara going crazy? Or is it the paranormal? A better question would be, who cares? And the answer to that, nobody. No one. Skip this movie, save yourself a more adequate time to perform other tasks that are worthwhile. <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
