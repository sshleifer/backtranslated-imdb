I can not believe that this movie has 6 stars in IMDb. This is one of the worst movies I've seen that was not an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The plot is predictable. I could not worry about any of the characters. The dialogue is corny. Several moments in the movie actually made me moan loudly (including the crazy neighbor of Kiefer Southerland and the incredibly boring joke that ends the movie). The accent of Jeff Bridges is ridiculous, I can not say what country he is supposed to be. It has to be one of the least exciting thrillers I've ever seen ... after the character of Sandra Bullock disappears, absolutely nothing happens to advance the story in about 45 minutes. I would give this movie a negative amount of stars if I could.
