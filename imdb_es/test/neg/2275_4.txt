Okay, if you discount the production value, the ugly suits and the long hair, this adaptation is still very inferior to the 90's version. First Ann Firbank (playing Anne Elliot), is literally ten years too old to play this paper and its performance leaves much to be desired. Amanda Root (who plays the same role in the 90s version) can express more in her big brown eyes than Firbank with her entire face in a four-hour production. Anne becomes an annoying, complaining and boring character (and what happened to the scene during the "long walk" in which she stops to talk about poetry?). Henrietta and Louisa were so similar that the only time I could tell them apart was when they were standing side by side (Henrietta was taller). And Louisa! There was never a more detestable character! It was ridiculous to think that Wentworth was supposed to be interested in her. She is supposed to be cheerful and pretty and charming, not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh that is like nails on a blackboard. When she begins to sing, `to Lyme, to Lyme, to Lyme, 'I began to shout:` shut up, shut up, shut up!' The best part of the movie was when Louisa drops those three feet in the cobb because she knew she would not have to see her in the movie again. Speaking of the fall in the cobb scene; It was the scene badly acted, misdirected and edited throughout the film. How does a person fall three feet down, land and still unconscious? <br /> <br /> On the positive size, Elizabeth's character was much closer to the book than in the 90s version. They also put many more scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end. <br /> <br /> I'll admit, I bought this movie, even though I knew how bad it was, but I'm a huge Austen Fan, so I'll buy any movie adapted from one of his novels. Observe this movement if you are morbidly curious, or if you want to appreciate the 90's version even more. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that this version can follow the letter of the novel, but the version of the 90s follows the spirit.
