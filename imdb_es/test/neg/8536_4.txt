After having problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farm to start over, but their attempts at an idyllic farm life are interrupted when their teenage daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her brother Ben 3 years begin to see and be attacked by supernatural beings that will not allow them to live in peace. <br /> <br /> The Messengers begin decently, although they eventually become a generic horror movie that is much more humorous than terrifying. After reading the premise, I thought that this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and had potential. Unfortunately, the movie did not live up to its potential, although I should have expected it since the trailer was horrible. The script was probably the worst part of it. It was full of silly sequences and a smooth dialogue. The characters did not develop at all and most of them acted like a group of idiots, so it was difficult to feel sympathy for them. <br /> <br /> The directors did a horrible job in creating suspense. They were based mainly on cheap fears like loud noises and random jumps. The music was really exaggerated and it only made it easier for the viewer to telegraph the next "scary" moment. I also did not like how they practically used a single place for the whole movie. The house was the centerpiece of the story and that's where most of the filming took place, so after a while it became a bit boring to see the same area. Also, I did not like the close-ups of the actors. During a conversation, the camera continually shook from one character to another within five seconds and became really annoying. The directors created a decent atmosphere and got some points for making their film with style. However, since we've come a long way in terms of style and effects, it's not that hard to make your movie look good, especially if you're working on a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The performance was atrocious and if this movie had been released in December, I'm sure it would have received several Razzie nominations. Kristen Stewart showed some talent in the Panic Room, but you would not know what talent she has in seeing her performance in The Messengers. She was fine acting scared and that's it. The rest of the time it was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anne Miller was horrible when it came to everything. It seemed that he was reading his lines and had some of the worst facial expressions I have seen in my life. Dylan McDermott was very wooden and had almost no emotion. John Corbett gave the best performance and had a couple of good scenes. The twins who played Ben were also decent and managed to represent many of the adult actors. In general, this horror movie is not worth seeing because of its foolishness and the laziness of making movies. Rating 4/10
