I just watched this movie with some friends, they said I had to see it but from the beginning I knew it was going to go from bad to worse. So I can only give 1 to this movie because the effects that were used were used so badly and it was thought that anyone can see that there were no "real" ghosts. I feel that the worst part was that the so-called "haunted house" contained a lot of new items and some "conveniently placed items". I could have thought of effects that would have been much better than a chair invested by an invisible one. ghost (or should I say wire). Then, later, when they check the tape of the chair, it flips it in a different way. Uh Oh, that's a big continuity error. If this was a really good movie, then they would have captured that and all the other things about the "old house." This film is like a scam of the house on the haunted hill and the project of the witch Blair, all in a badly planned and assembled movie. I would feel embarrassed to get something out of the acting bad, the effects and the cheap video shots of the girls' chests and how convenient the camera is when something "paranormal" happens. This movie is an insult to the people who are out there looking for ghosts and making recordings of real ghosts on tape.
