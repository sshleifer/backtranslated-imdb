The movie started o.k. A couple of tourists who are on vacation in Mexico having a good time decide that they should go on a trip. Discover some hidden trails and end in this huge temple as a fortress. The angry villagers appear and try to dissuade them from climbing, but due to the language barrier, people are shot and tourists end up climbing stupidity. It turns out that the plants are evil and bloodthirsty things that the villagers do not approach, so they protect the temple so that the tourists can not get off. There are a couple of fears in this movie, but nothing really makes sense. I mean, they are PLANTS! Do not bother buying or renting the d.v.d. Wait until it goes cable.
