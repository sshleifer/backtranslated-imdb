Like many, this pile of manure caught my attention as I navigated the canal. It's a horror movie, set in the woods, it has a stupid title, but hey "Michael Rooker" is in it, and he's been part of some great horror movies, I know he would not cheat me ... Ugh! The most insulting part of this is that I actually saw it. I see that the director Johnny Martin is a specialist, well, this trick just sucks, and how he got some of the actors to do this bowel movement is the biggest mystery of all ... I can understand Casper Van Dien, but it's a sorry for you, Mr.. Your good name in the terror community has been forever tarnished, and your agent must be fired immediately. I'm sure this nugget of fecal matter is available on DVD, but if you enjoy the .99 cents menu at McDonalds, you'll get more for your money there.
