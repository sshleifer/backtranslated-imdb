In 1984, The Karate Kid had some charm, even if it was little more than Rocky from a poor man. Unfortunately, producer Jerry Weintraub did not realize that it was better to leave the story at the point where it had ended, and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to go the extra mile to turn the film into a trilogy. Part III was the final minimum in the franchise, however, someone must have thought that the series still has some potential. What other explanation could there be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid? <br /> <br /> Wait a moment. Following? Yes, Macchio is gone (at least he was smart enough to stop eventually), and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!), Playing a teenager with problems (what else?) Call Julie Pierce. Now, the girl has family problems. She also gets into trouble at school. Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). However, it turns out that one of his students is really a good guy and Julie falls in love with him. This puts her in bigger problems than before, of course. Luckily for her, she currently lives with Mr. Miyagi (Morita), an old friend of his grandfather who knows how to get back to the bad guys. <br /> <br /> All those factors and up to seven clich√©s, and that's just a generic summary of the plot - imagine how detailed scenes should be! From start to finish, The Next Karate Kid is a tired, flat and boring marathon of lines and idiotic configurations. Swank, fortunately, has children like Boys Do not Cry and Million Dollar Baby to redeem this disaster, but why did Morita accept to return? It is possible that he received an Oscar nomination for the first film, and was quite pleasant in the aftermath, but he has nothing to speak for him here, even the revival of the "waxed, waxed" gag has been born dead. As for Ironside, it's a bit better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III, but that's not a stretch. <br /> <br /> So, is this image really that horrible? Not quite. There is a sequence that manages to reach a strange beauty, but when the best part of the film involves a group of Asian monks who dance while listening to pop music for the first time in their lives, it does not qualify as a recommendation to see the rest
