This movie, which I just discovered in the video store, has apparently been sitting for a couple of years without a distributor. Is easy to see why. The story of two friends who live in New York in search of their friend from high school who now lives homeless on the boardwalk of Coney Island, has flashes of being a very good movie, but ultimately, the story is focused in Stan and Daniel. , instead of his homeless friend Richie. Cryer is, as always, very good and the film looks austere, with the ghostly images of Coney Island. However, writer Cryer and director Richard Schenkman are too busy dealing with the uninteresting lives of Stan and Daniel instead of focusing on Richie. A flashback at a music store, where Richie is in love with an employee, stands out and really shows the viewer where this movie might have gone. But in the end, not much. Two many strange scenes of annoyance, like inside the Skeeball building. QUALIFICATION 4 OF 10.
