This western / musical / comedy is not one of the best of the genre I've seen. I found it too slow. I just stepped on the inevitable ending. I also found it disconnected. I could not wait for it to go. Randolph Scott is the protagonist here, and Lloyd Bridges also stars. But for my money, Edgar Buchanan is the best in the group. Buchanan appeared in many westerns in his day, often providing comic relief, as he does in this photo. I also liked Ann Dvorak as Rita. Otherwise, I can not think of recommending this movie very much. The film is based on a novel by Ernest Haycock, who also wrote the novel Stagecoach, which was crazy about a movie of the same name in 1939, and remade in 1966 and again in 1986. The 1939 version of Stagecoach is, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made. Anyway, like in Abilene, my vote is a 3/10
