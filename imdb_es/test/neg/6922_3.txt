Seeing that this had a theatrical premiere anywhere in the world, it only serves as a reminder of the careers of the untalented ladies Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich. It is also a particular type of grid movie, the kind of people who think they are smart, funny and original while being poor in all aspects. The total fault can go to Brian Burns, who wrote and directed this potboiler. His script takes a rather unoriginal situation and goes exactly nowhere with it. Situations develop completely without any internal logic, in addition to that of a desperate screenwriter. The characters are thinner than the cardboard cutouts, they behave stupidly and without any real motivation. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of Ms. Richards. We do not believe his relationship with the character of David Krumholtz for a minute and the way they return to play after the hour mark is particularly unfortunate. Why does someone fall in love with a self-centered person, obsessed with himself and arrogant like this in the first place, much less a second time? Especially after having supposedly found his ... And if any of these things is not enough to completely sink this movie, then the central couple is. The coupling of Krumholtz and Jovovich is just a little more credible or developed than that of Richards-one, but to no avail. There is no chemistry, no spark, nothing that we can accept as a credible couple. Worse yet, these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating, doing annoying and irritating things that the viewer finally has no interest at all. <br /> <br /> In general, a very poor sample. Even fans of romantic comedies may want to convey this, as there are dozens of movies made with more skill or more charm.
