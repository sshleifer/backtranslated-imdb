Right now I'm watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful landscapes, beautiful sets of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful colors, beautiful Gina. Great climatic scene when God destroys the idol of Sheban and much more with the rays of Millean at the moment when Yul and Gina are about to consummate their love. Yul does a pretty decent job in delivering his lines, although it sounds a lot like Yul delivering his lines like Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders playing George Sanders. Given the limited range of performances that she is asked to show on this role, Gina does a good job, although by the time the film ends, she becomes completely a demure and compunctioning girl and it seems she might be playing in a biography of Mother Teresa I guess the rays will do that to you, but it's almost amazing how quickly you give up your own beliefs for your new religion. Secondary players are mostly horrible, lack credible emotion and time. The usual big battle scenes, what happened for lewd dances in 1959, and an orchestra throwing a bunch of trumpets behind a big choir singing a lot of "Ah's", but none of them is top-notch. The final sword fight between Brynner and Sanders is at the laughingly low skill level of a high school play. The movie is a great piece of candy, but not much more.
