If you like The Three Stooges, you will definitely like this 17 minute short. Certainly there were some funny moments, but like all the work of the Stooges, this revolves around their particular style of slapstick comedy, and I must confess that somehow the Stooges never did it for me. His slapstick always seemed angry instead of funny, and although it was obviously false, his antics always seemed more likely to cause pain than to laugh. In this brief summary, the slapstick revolves around attempts to find a wife for Shemp (who is a music teacher), because he has just inherited half a million dollars on condition that he marries within 48 hours of reading the will. One of his students is interested, but once the news of the inheritance comes out, suddenly there is a long list of possible brides, and among them a pretty good catfight emerges. Fans of the Stooges will enjoy. For me, it has all the elements that drive me crazy. 4/10
