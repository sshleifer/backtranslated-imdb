Following the star of Dylan Moran from the charming owner of the misanthropic bookshop in the surrealist comedy Black Books, I was able to see his comic potential by asking to be used in the theater or on larger movie avenues. This first big-screen appearance in a leading role (he had a cameo like Rufus, the thief in Notting Hill) had lots of promises, but like Steve Coogan's tense vehicle, The Parole Officer, it has too many folds that should have been resolved. preproduction. <br /> <br /> The plot is so complicated that I will not bother to repeat the finer details (the script makes each character do that for us), and the laughter comes from the jokes of show business. Michael Caine is a pompous man who has been directing a production of Richard III, updated for the Nazi occupation (one of the few genuine laughs, a satirical hit on Ian McKellen), in which everyone is always making Hitler's salute every time They go on stage. . Convincing Dylan that acting should be a conceptual act in and of itself, the two conspire to steal money from some fairly harmless gangsters through their acting skills. Follow the confusion (both on the screen and in the audience), there is a romantic side story between Dylan and the daughter of one of the mobsters blah, blah, blah, and Dylan wears strange clothes and makes funny accents. Michael Caine offers some lines of choice, and Dylan's comedic moment is related to money, why is not it good? It has a certain charm that you would expect from Film 4, but it also has a precocious girl who acts as a compass in a confusing and irrelevant plot: a no-no in 101 screen writing. The exhibition outshines everything else. You just want to see Moran and Caine acting as comedians with each other as they were at the beginning, but when they are together towards the end, the couple has lost their charisma. <br /> <br /> The Actors is a fun, but disappointing, endeavor. If you arrive on TV during a rainy Tuesday afternoon, then go to you. Otherwise, it would be better to look at your old Black Books videos or rent Withnail & I.
