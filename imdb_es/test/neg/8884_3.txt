I made here this movie was good from several people. Also, I like Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem, as well as director Milos Forman. However, after watching this movie, I really had nothing to admire about it. <br /> <br /> First, the performance was well below average. The performances were not powerful enough to be really shocked by what the inquisition did. Javier Bardem gave a solid performance and was probably the only one who really had a Spanish accent. It is quite obvious why this Bardem was the only one. Natalie Portman, who I think is a very good actress, did not make me feel sorry for her torture. As in the movie, there was nothing to admire about his performance. Stellan Skarsgaard, who I like, gave a very average performance, like the other actors who give a boring performance. This movie was essentially about him as he plays Goya. However, it did not become what I needed to make this film good. What about Randy Quaid? You just have to be kidding. He playing King Charles IV. Look, he's great in comedies, but he plays a King who simply describes the whole movie for you. <br /> <br /> The direction was simply horrible in this movie. When a movie is a disaster, there are usually two people to blame for that: the director and the writer. I have the feeling that Milos Forman really did not want his actors to put a Spanish accent. Of the very few battle scenes here, they all showed up horribly. Also as a director, he has to give you the shock of what the inquisition did. After this movie I felt I could neglect the event. In short, he filmed the scenes badly and diverted the actors. <br /> <br /> The writing that Milos Forman also did was as bad or even worse than the address. There really was nothing memorable about the film, except for one seen where Bardem receives the same treatment as the Portman character. Apart from that, the movie did not give you the feeling of the period of time and at least I could have compensated with one or two appointments. <br /> <br /> After finishing this movie, I was just watching TV. thinking well, why should I care about this? I care and I am very interested in the story, but when movies like this appear, it seems that the producers stole something good that could have been removed from the movie. When movies are so bad, we highlight many technical flaws in a movie that were good. As the accents. I'm not sure that people would have emphasized the lack of an accent in Spanish if this movie was good. <br /> <br /> The important thing about this criticism is to say that they do not see it.
