My parents can enjoy this show, but I can not find humor in it. What's so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the eldest daughter becoming impregnated with the captain of the high school football team? Absolutely nothing! Sometimes I get shocked by what people think is humor today. The fault lies with programs such as "The Dating Game" and "The Newlywed Game", which put the theme of sex at the forefront in the mid-sixties. Sure, the series has its moving moments, but that's not an excuse for the content that otherwise entered into this series. This is nothing like the family-oriented days of "I Love Lucy" some five decades earlier. <br /> <br /> One answer that would have to explain why this series is played on the Lifetime cable channel is because the channels on that channel believe that women can relate to the character of Reba. I do not like the character of Reba Hart's daughter, Kyra. She is better described as a ditsy and bitter teenager! Curious, I wonder if the actress who played Kyra; Scarlett Pomers, it's like that in real life far from acting. Whoever plays ex-husband's former dentist, Christopher Rich, is not much better. Barbara Jean, played by Melissa Peterman, is ditsy in herself! The characters of Van and Cheyenne are also very annoying. <br /> <br /> Another thing that baffles me is the reason why the creator of the dingbat-of-a-series, Allison M. Gibson, decided to place the series in the place where I live. 25 miles away from; Houston Texas! Reba McEntire is not even from this state, she is an Oklahoman! Why, during a season or more, did they decide to make the incidental music sound like a snorting pig? What I mean by this is when we listen to this baritone saxophone played with drums that accompany it, but the melodies are basically syntonic!
