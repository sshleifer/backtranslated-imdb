I love documentaries. They are among my favorite genres of cinema. Before watching this movie I had not seen one that I would not have liked. <br /> <br /> The premise for this movie is excellent. The execution is well done. There were some times early when I laughed and smiled. However, as the film progressed, more tedious and irritating it became. This could have been something special if the subject had not been so inarticulate, childish, inept. I appreciate his passion for cinema, but I stopped whining. If you lack funds, maybe you should not have as many children or spend so much money on alcohol. Maybe you should have gone to film school, or at least graduated from high school. Maybe I should have lived life and gained perspectives and experiences that could be added to his vision. <br /> <br /> There are so many people out there with stories that are interesting, funny and moving. Seeing this chosen guy over any of them is nothing short of rude. If you want to make a documentary about a filmmaker, why not make one with someone from China or Iran, a filmmaker with REAL problems? <br /> <br /> Two final questions: <br /> <br /> Who takes a small child to see Apocalypse Now? <br /> <br /> How many times did this guy say "man"?
