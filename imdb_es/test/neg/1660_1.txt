Did you ever think, like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends: "Wow, this is great! We have to make a horror movie a little bit soon. I bet it's not as hard as it seems"? Well, this must have been what went through the minds of the young Campbell brothers in 2003, probably after seeing Sam Raimi's "The Evil Dead" or a similar independent horror classic. This "Demon Summer", however, is so bad that it is shameful! These young amateur filmmakers obviously love the horror genre and know their classics, but that almost does not make them talented. I've seen a lot of bad series movies in my years as a horror fan, but honestly, it's one of the biggest pieces of junk ever made. And it's very sad to be so sincere, because the entire cast and crew clearly have good intentions. There is practically no script at all. A duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a tramp and, while reading some passages, one of them becomes a frightful demon that begins to kill members of all the different groups of teenagers: fools, catholic girls, drug addicts and troublemakers That's it, except of course for all the obligatory clich√©s, like the hot girl who falls in love with the biggest fool, etc., etc. The performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry! They remain motionless until the script says it is their turn to interact. I hate that! Some of the makeup effects are remotely decent, but they're still not spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most horrible punk songs in history. This movie should never have been released ... I can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be part of the production, but it is absolutely imbecile and does not present the slightest redeeming element. Not even a little amateur nudity, damn!
