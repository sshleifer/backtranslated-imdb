There is a growing tendency in the media to vilify and ridicule men. You see it in television commercials and program plots. The cheats are a good example, they could find a lot of female cheats, but the vast majority shown are men, why? The main threat to the power of any government resides in the male population, are less likely to abide by authority and are more a threat of physical combat. One way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society through the media. Other examples of psychological propaganda are the crime dramas filled with honest cops that include aggressive, jaw-dropping women who accuse all who question trampling on their rights and make those men feel like scum. In Australia, many of the top male sports stars have recently been arrested for dubious assaults and drinking charges, another example of the government that controls populous men by arresting their heroes and asserting dominance. The cheaters, apart from the political machinations, are an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights, in addition, most of these women assault men! If it was around the other way, men would be in jail! If it were an honest show, they would find traps for women, because they are usually not caught due to the fact that their male lovers are very happy not to get involved and leave without moving the boat. The lovers of men want men for themselves and want to own and control men and, therefore, catch men anyway.
