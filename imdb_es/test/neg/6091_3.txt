What the hell is this? Kelly (Jennifer) seems to abandon all moral behavior as soon as he arrives on the island. She finds this existent and exotic Juan P (Manuel), although she witnessed when she slapped her ex, which also justifies later in the film, right or wrong? These two guys are the first to meet on the island. Kelly is totally lost in every way and the great John P can fish and build a house. Mr. handyman. They seem to have a good time. Then there's Billy Zane (Jack's husband, Kellys) and, of course, two days without knowing what his wife has been doing with this beautiful John P, he's a little jealous. Billy Z is the stereotype-rich guy and maybe he's not the nicest man in the world. He does not like Juan P (for beating his girlfriend on the dock, who can blame him?) He is also arrogant, but he paid a lot of money to rent that boat and Juan P, who is the waiter, can not bring him a pinch of beer ). 20 min. Would not you be upset? However, Billy is probably the guy you want to hit in the face if you know him. But, at the same time, he is, not to be blamed, suspicious of the diving glasses that Manuel has. Kelly and Billy have just lost some dear friends! How convenient that you have them, no matter what!). However, for some strange reason, Kelly likes this girl who hits Manuel and starts to hate Billy for being jealous. Okay, Billy is exaggerating, that's for sure, but Kelly is not doing much to convince him either. He spends more time with Juan P and even wants to sleep with them since he has been so kind (and even though Manuel shouted at him and said things for asking some intimate questions, but Kelly is SO forgiving ...). Yeah sure. And then he starts having sex with this John P. It should be said that Kelly and Billy seem to have a working relationship before this incident on the island, at least, they have intimate relationships on the boat and they talk like people when they like it . other. Now, you may think that this scenario is possible. But really, right? Are you tricking your husband after two days on a coconut island just because he is jealous and acts like a drunkard at the bar? (I would not disagree if the relationship was really bad, but the director does not give many clues if that is the case). For the love of God, Juan P has not really shown himself to be a good person. Grab some fish and build a wooden house to get into someone's panties, is that a good side? I'm not trying to make friends with Kelly's husband in any way (which would be very simple if I allowed them to be alone most of the time on the island, just respect each other). He does not care about their relationship (and Kelly can not figure that out), I just want to have sex with Kelly. Kelly's character is simply not reliable (if she were trapped with Billy and another attractive girl, would not she be upset or what?). Or maybe she is? Billy Zane plays a not very nice person, and Juan P is not really much better if you really think about it. And poor Kelly is so confused and thinks that having sex with Juan P will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive to poor Juan P? So ... for all of you who read this ... What do you think about it? If you were the character of Kelly, would you consider cheating on your husband, knowing that one day you will return to real life and, suddenly, Billys may not be that horrible person after all? He is too jealous. And if you are the character of Billys, what do you say, is he totally wrong in his behavior? And the character of Juan P, what do you really think of him? One thing is for sure. Manuels exists! Pd ... The voodoo thing is totally wrong here! What the hell was that? Seriously! Someone tell me?
