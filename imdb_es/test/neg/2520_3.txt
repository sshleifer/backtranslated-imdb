The first time I heard about this movie was when Patton Oswalt talked about it on his CD "Hombres lobo y lolluletas". He said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. Being a terrible movie lover, I knew that a gift was waiting for me. <br /> <br /> This movie is, without a doubt, one of the strangest I've seen in my life. Without doubt one of the rarest movies shlock. Basically, a demon took human form years ago for a woman, the woman died or something, the demon cried blood, blood fell on the bed, the bed is now possessed and now eats. Along with fruits, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. People can vary between horny teens, mayors, gangsters, servants or pitchers of professional orgies. There is also a sick guy who ate in bed but put his soul behind an image in the room. <br /> <br /> Most movies allow you to discover the plot through an exciting action. Death Bed takes another path: it basically tells you through the narrative exactly what is happening while slow and boring scenes of murders take place. Also, I must say that everyone who has eaten by the bed is surprisingly calm. I would think that if a bed is eating you through the experiments of a fifth grade science fair, it would hurt a bit. I suppose that the nerve endings were not invented until 1981, approximately. <br /> <br /> The story is extravagant, the direction is slow and quite horrible, the sets are scarce, the fact that it is quite painful and the brother is one of the most ugly unwitting actors I have ever seen. It would probably be a great partying movie if alcohol and smart asses are involved. Certainly one that should not be lost.
