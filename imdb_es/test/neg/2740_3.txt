I just saw Descent. Gawds what a horrible movie. From the beginning, they represent a lava geyser and a note says it is well below the surface of the state of Washington. People, there are no geysers in the depths of the Earth. They thought it looked clean and in the typical Hollywood style they threw it. And then there is that well that threw lava. He dropped a stone and I heard a splash. Steam would have sprouted from that well before a lava explosion could, if it had ever done so. <br /> <br /> And the acting was also pretty bad. Micheal Dorn has sunk to a new minimum of jobs. <br /> <br /> What a dog in a movie. I bet the vote is not higher than a 3.5 <br /> <br /> It does not look like SciFi Channel has spent much more than having pretty guy Perry as a tie attempt.
