First of all, even IMDb is loosening up with this movie, since the list of actors is VERY "gappy". Even major characters are missing, such as Buddy. <br /> <br /> Now let's go back to the movie. I love watching movies, but this tortured me throughout the 82 minutes or for many minutes. It was horrible. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And the reason why it bothers me so much, is because I was very excited to see it in advance. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is good. It could have been a great movie if done correctly and with careful casting. Golden Brooks was a big disappointment. Now I see that the only role in which it can be good is the noisy, energetic, sexy and sexy girl who plays with Girlfriends. Melodramatic roles are not for her at all. Basically, she killed her character, Rachel. <br /> <br /> I love some of the actors, like Deborah Cox, Mel Jackson and Darrin Dewitt Henson, but even they could not save this catastrophic movie. Of course, it's just my personal opinion that I can not stand Hill Harper as a man, and he did not help me like him either. <br /> <br /> The voice of Golden Brooks bothered me so much that I actually had to force myself to finish watching the movie. It seemed that she whispered throughout the whole. The director in which I will not even waste the space of the board, did such a bad job. The editing, photography / focus of the camera and almost everything about this movie was SAD. Not to mention the dialogues! Absolutely unreal and often directly hilarious (when it was supposed to make you cry and search deep inside of you). <br /> <br /> As I said, it could have been a very nice movie, but it was very messy. I would NOT recommend it to anyone, unless they have a specialization in cinematography and want to see an example of 'What not to do' for their future work. <br /> <br /> Have an excellent day, everyone!
