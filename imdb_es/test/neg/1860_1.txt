Woohoo! This movie is almost too bad for words. Obviously, the writers wanted to link this in some way with the Ghoulies franchise, so they got Pete Liapis from the first to repeat his role as Jonathan ... only he is now a policeman and has no character traits similar to those that I had in the first one. . The ghoulies in this are not the ghoulies of the past. The cheap looking puppets have been replaced by small people disguised as even cheaper looking. Instead of being any main antagonist or being evil, they are more like comedic characters in relief that appeared out of nowhere for no reason. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing this movie for the first time, I felt as if I had seen it before. Why was this? Because everything in this was stolen from another movie. All police lines and cheesy action scenes were from Lethal Weapon. The ghoulies looked a lot like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, except they were not fun at all. Even scenes from the original Ghoulies movie were scattered throughout this film. <br /> <br /> I think the target audience was supposed to be adults, but the mix of black magic, cartoon slapstick, police drama and bad acting does not. work at all I hope you do not do a Ghoulies V, because I do not want a movie studio to lose its money. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 78 minutes. R for violence.
