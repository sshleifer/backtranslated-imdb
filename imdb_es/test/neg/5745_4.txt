Slayer is a meaningless vampire movie with some twists in an old plot. The special operations team is sent to South America to hunt the blood sucking natives. Your leader is a true old man who has aged well. There is an environmental twist since vampires are attacking villages because their rainforest and ancient diet of wild animals is disappearing due to greedy corporations and farmers. Lost to fight and so much blood, they never bothered to clean the cast of the whole movie. It seems that they slept in their bloody clothes and soaked in blood. While each cast member brought their own talents, not all of them actually clicked like a movie. The effects were fine, except for the vampires that hung from the buildings in the cables. If you are looking for a lot of blood and violence, this is for you.
