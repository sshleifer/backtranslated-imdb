FREDDY FORSYTH has developed a plot that will adapt to the mood of Western suspicions about Putin's Russia. Forsyth installs an unpleasant guy like Ruski's president who wants to return to the country, not so much to Stalin's communism but rather to Hitler's fascism. In fact, his political Manifesto could have come directly from Mein Kampf instead of Marx. And, the rascal has the last weapons of biological destruction to achieve the pogrom of ethnic cleansing of the Russian Federation. The American mercenaries conspire with the Russian Prez to realize their genocidal and fanatical dream, but then they enter Pat Swayze from Dirty Dancing ... and, yes, things get really ugly and dirty. Jason Monk, a former US agent turned vagabond, is recruited by the British government to see what the Russians do. Like a corny sidebar, the character of Swayze who is not Monk (!) Begot a beautiful Russian Elena (played by the beautiful Marta Kondova) in her previous missions to the previous state of Commie. Hardman Swayze does an acceptable job to defeat the evil Russians. But the young and unknown actress Marta Kondova steals the film as her nubile 18-year-old Russian daughter, Elena, who helps dad eradicate the terror that threatens his beloved Mother Russia.
