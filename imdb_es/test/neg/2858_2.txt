I felt really disappointed after seeing Pinocchio's Revenge the other night. I had a good inclination that it was going to be a bad idea, but I did not think it would be as bad as it turned out to be. A wooden puppet of a murdered child falls into the hands of the eight-year-old daughter of a lawyer. From there, it is a murderous road for anyone who comes between the puppet and the girl. We have already seen movies like this before, that is, the series Child's Play, which by the way is much better. However, it was good to see actors like James W. Quinn and Todd Allen. Both of whom have worked under Kevin Tenney before. In any case, I encourage viewers to see "The Night of the Demons" and the original "Witches' Board". These are titles that tend to bring out the best in Kevin S. Tenney.
