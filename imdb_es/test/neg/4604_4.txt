In Los Angeles, the alcoholic and lazy Hank Chinaski (Matt Dillon) performs a wide range of unqualified functions to get enough money to drink and bet on horse races. Its main and only objective is to write and have sex with dirty women. <br /> <br /> "Factotum" is an uninteresting, pointless and extremely boring movie about a vague, irresponsible drunkard who works a couple of days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and gamble, being fired immediately to his reckless behavior. According to IMDb, this character would be the fictional alter ego of author Charles Bukowski, and based on this story, I will certainly never read any of his novels. Honestly, if the viewer likes this topic of alcoholic couples, it is better to observe the poignant and heartbreaking "Ironweed" by Hector Babencoo or "Storie di Ordinaria Follia" by Marco Ferreri, which is based on the life of the same writer. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Factotum ?? Sem Destino" ("Factotum ?? Without Destiny")
