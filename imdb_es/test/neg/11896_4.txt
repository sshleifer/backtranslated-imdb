In this follow-up to The Naked Civil Servant we see the last years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York. John Hurt is again Crisp (come on, who else could play the role?) And it's a role that lives to the point of disappearing. For me, Hurt is Crisp and it has always been hard for me to take the man because Hurt was more him than himself. His masterful acting. His equal is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, friend and confidant of Crisp. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, outside of the presentations, the film has little to recommend. To be sure that the movie has the correct details. Filmed in New York and its surroundings, the film looks and feels like New York and its surroundings, but it is dramatically inert. It is Crisp to talk to people who are ingenious, trying to reach an agreement with the world as it is (he ended up regretting some words poorly chosen in relation to AIDS) and dealing with the diseases that the elders threw him. Quentin the man is always interesting, but his life as the one portrayed really is not. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed in the movie. I have always admired the man and his unique point of view. I just wish this movie would better serve her about her life.
