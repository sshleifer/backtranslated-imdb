This is simply terrible. I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this rain. I think it's supposed to be a comedy, but I do not remember laughing a lot, except for some flagrant inconsistencies and flagrant mistakes. <br /> <br /> An unattractive middle-aged man named Lester finds himself with a rich unattractive. middle-aged women through advertisements of lonely hearts, and then kill them for the money they need to feed their addiction to the game. That's the whole plot, and that's all that happens. On the way, there is an attempt at intrigue when Lester begins receiving phone calls from a mysterious stranger who mocks him for knowing his secret, but is so poorly implemented that he may not realize what he is really supposed to it's happening. The sequences in which Lester kills rich widows are quite brutal but also apparently disguised as comedies. A sequence has a woman beaten with a wooden stick and then put in an oven. He is very cruelly represented, but he plays against the big band waltz music at full volume, with Lester making faces and adopting comedy poses at all times. Another scene is the murdered victim while constantly singing strident opera songs ... you have to see this to believe it! Actually, you do not have to see it at all, in fact I recommend you avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there is no evidence of any of the talents seen in his previous career. One sequence stood out as particularly miserable: the revelation when Lester suddenly realizes he has no shade. Fulci seems unable to think of a visual representation of this phenomenon on the screen, so from this moment on, he simply films the actor as normal, in the shadow and all! And so the whole angle blows completely. Either he had no budget for the effects, or he just did not care enough to think of any way to prove it. Whatever it is, that should give you an idea of ​​how scarce this whole project is. I could not even understand most of the movie, and there was certainly nothing on the screen that I deserved half the time. Even the end was as flat as a pancake. A true failure.
