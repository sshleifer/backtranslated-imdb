I bought this DVD from Chuck Norris, knowing it was one of his first movies, and it shows. We all know that he will never win an Oscar for his performance, but that is not what we are looking for. Although there have been some earthquakes in California since this movie was made, there was never a desert or hills between Highway 99 and I 5. Billy supposedly crossed from 99 to 5 over 120, a distance of less than 15 miles. I want the writers, producers and directors of these films, at least, to see a map. As a truck driver who spends a lot of time in California, from the beginning I could see that the geography was wrong. However, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. So take your Doritos and a drink for adults and enjoy a trip back in time.
