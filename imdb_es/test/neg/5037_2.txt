From the epicenter of the cultural world, four working class adolescents tried to change the world through music and fashion. It was the last attempt to do it in the last century, and they failed. Before the dust cleared, Malcolm McLaren, the band's manager and owner of the SEXO store, spent the money the Sex Pistols had earned to make a "fake documentary" about his own role in his success. The film was called The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle (catch the track) and consists of very few pictures of The Sex Pistols playing music, and a lot of McLaren images that call the idiots of the public. <br /> <br /> Surreal co-stars nonsense in which guitarist Steve Jones is a detective in McLaren's queue, soon dissolves so that he and drummer Paul Cook can fly to Rio and spend time with the "big thief" of trains "Ronnie Biggs. Get ready for the show of three very unattractive men dancing naked before a horrible version without irony of "Belsen was a Gas" (a song about killing Jews for gold in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp), and another song sung in Ronnie's dull tone. whine that includes the letter "God save Myra Hindley, God save Ian Brady" (lyrics that Johnny Rotten would have considered unpleasant). The scenes of Sid Vicious are few and idiots. Jumping off the bed in a thong with a swastika on the testicles to sing some song of a bad boy of the 50s. Playing with the theme "Punk is a joke" of the film, in an attempt to turn Sid into James Dean . I'm surprised that McLaren does not take credit for Siddy's death too. The redeeming scenes are those of Sid in Paris and the famous interpretation of My Way. The punk rock zeitgeist right there. Mocking an audience of worship before shooting them all. You do not need a full movie, just watch that clip on YouTube. <br /> <br /> From the very superior (and more enjoyable) documentary tracking of Julien Temple in 2001, The Filth and the Fury, they gave us a more balanced and honest image. View of what happened in 78. But there was also a series of scenes that I would have liked to see in Swindle (since Fury was basically a reissue of the same material). One was a full animated Sid with the performance of Sid's voice; "F, cken betta wat'ch out, it's fine, or I'll cut you open", an image of which appeared on the cover of Something Over 7 inches - a fragment was shown in Fury, but I do not know In what context it originally appeared. Was it in original copies, but was it deleted after Sid's death? Was there more? Fury also shed light on the movie Who Killed Bambi, which would have been the simulated Hard Day's Night movie that McLaren originally intended to make. It was starring Sting (!) As a member of a group of gay New Romantics, and had a much more entertaining look than Swindle. <br /> <br /> Sod Swindle, this is a scam. If necessary, rent The Filth and The Fury and enjoy the failure of music as a controversy that changes the world.
