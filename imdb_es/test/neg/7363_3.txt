As a Canadian history student, the first thing I should say is: THE HISTORICAL FACTS ARE NOT ACCURATE! How can a producer do that? The deportation of the Acadian was not in 1759 when we see Franklin in London, but in 1755! How can that happen in the movie? The scenes in Londo were also useless. Then, for the story to anyone who reads "Les Anciens Canadians", it has the story line right there. It's the story of La Coriveau, that "witch." It also adds a love story and a tragic relationship between the end of mother and daughter. Sure, it brought tears to my eyes. But that's it. Then there is the fact that apparently it is installed in the city of Quebec, but it is mostly filmed in the Forteresse de Louisbourg. Of course it is a historical and accurate site for the time, but it was obvious that the scenes were not all set in Quebec City. In general, if you are looking for a New France documentary, go find Candad: A People's History, a true documentary about the history of Canda and NEw France. If you want a love story that makes you cry, a story set in a wonderful forest, look at New France.
