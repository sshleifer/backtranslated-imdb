I have rarely seen a work of literature translated so badly on the screen. The hysterical cast of b-movie and sitcom extras simply makes the characters look like bad Jewish stereotypes. The worst of all is Melissa Gilbert, whom you hate from scene one and for whom you never develop any sympathy. Actions like this should be noted and used against actors who want to work again. In short, a film of poor quality, made for television, the kind that gives movies made for television a bad name.
