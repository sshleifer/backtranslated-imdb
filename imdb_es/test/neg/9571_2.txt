This very forced attempt to merge Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino (which has been overestimated too much) is neither informative nor entertaining. The development of the character is arbitrary and incredible, especially in the final scene of the bullies and the little boy, as other critics have pointed out. In addition, apart from a couple of comic moments, the film is not as fun (black humor or otherwise) as the director seems to think.
