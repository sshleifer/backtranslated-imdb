With Matthias Hues on the cover and only $ 3.00, I had to buy it. I enjoyed some moments, like the annoyance of the Hawks with the pleasure droids, but I only watched the scenes of Matthias Hues. I especially enjoyed the confrontation at the end. It was a cross between "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" by Clint Eastwood and "For a Few Dollars More" (a 3-man showdown with a musical pocket watch used as the countdown timer). Apart from that, there is nothing more I can add. The actors gave good performances, (all except the "Assassin Droid", whose performance was nothing out of the comic) but the film really lacked depth and purpose; It's just not enough to fill up 1.5 hours of standard movie time, so we get stuck aimlessly from the main characters for an hour or more, until the ball starts up. For example, the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times, occupying two fifths of the movie. <br /> <br /> The stage really lacked depth and creativity, probably due to the budget of the films. I do not think we've ever been able to see this "perfect city" of New Angeles that was always talked about, in fact, when the main characters finally arrived in New Angeles, it's located in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and corridors; hardly the kind of "kingdom" in which the owner / creator of an entire city would live. There was also talk of the "super high security" of New Angeles, but only a total of 15, maybe 20, security guards were counted, even when the alarm went off; not even close to Matthias's approach of "at least a hundred men out there". <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of any of the actors / actresses in this movie, then you may want to watch it. simply to "add it to the list". However, if you value 1 hour and a half of your time, or $ 3.00 of your money, you may want to let it go.
