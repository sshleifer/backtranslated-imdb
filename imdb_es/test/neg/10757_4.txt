Without saying how it ended, it is enough to say that everything degenerated about five minutes before the end. If the norm had been maintained throughout, the film would be worth seven. <br /> <br /> One wonders, in some way, why a woman was added to the cast. (Well, not really!) The premise is good. The situation in which the victims find themselves is quite frightening and quite well done, but it gives the impression that the creators of the film lost interest towards the end, or as a previous contributor. That said, they changed the writers and gave them to someone else.
