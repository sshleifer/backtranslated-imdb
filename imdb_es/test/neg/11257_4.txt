I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It was announced as the "world premiere" of the film by the presenter (although it seems that people have seen it before). I must say that I still do not know what to do with the movie. I'm not familiar with the book, I bought the ticket only two hours before and I had limited knowledge of the plot. It's not enough, as it seems, since I had trouble getting into the movie. The movie is sometimes being narrated by the Jones character, but somehow that perspective did not fit for me. And I really can not tell if some of the laughter the movie got was calculated or not. The cuts were abrupt and disruptive, the scenes seemed somehow united and the narration did not always make sense immediately (even leaving aside the supernatural parts); the actors were really good but they really could not save the movie in any way. It was entertaining, but sometimes just in the sense that I sat there thinking about the technical details of making movies and what went wrong with it. I still do not know what kind of humor the director wanted for the movie. It was a strange mixture of light, darkness, supernatural. Unfortunately it did not appeal to me at all and I looked at it with a technical eye. But thinking about what is wrong with a movie while watching it is the best sign that a movie has somehow failed. I would definitely have expected something more with these actors involved ... what a shame!
