(Spoilers) Pretty horrifying, I've seen the movie that this horrible movie was a sequel to. His name was Ator the Fighting Eagle and I saw him when he was only 8 years old. It impressed me so much that I never forgot it. I've been a fan of MST3K for a long time, so when Cavedwellers came out on a tape I bought it. I was horrified to realize that it was a sequel to the miserable Ator movie I had seen so long ago. Ator's suit, somehow, has become more scarce than the last time I saw him. How can you wear that tiny bikini? Do not you mind showing the fact that you do not have the package ... errr ...? And poor Tanga ... he has no lines or girl, and he has to follow that clumsy and tormented sorcerer Ator all the time. Has anyone else noticed that Miles O'Keefe walks like a woman? No wonder he is not interested in the beautiful, if somewhat lackluster, Meela. The evil but expensive bad guy Zor is more to his liking, I'm sure. I loved the swan helmet painted with cardboard spray from Zor, and the way he spent all his time trying to touch a part of Ator. The fight scenes are so badly choreographed that it's a wonder that the swords manage to connect. The bored old man spends all his time depressed. Ator drinks from a cup given to him by a boy who hates him, and then seems surprised that he has been drugged. However, he must be quite intelligent: he invented a paraglider in space for five minutes, then threw it into a crack in the space / time continuum to briefly travel to seventeenth-century Bulgaria. That was after he stabbed the giant snake puppet, of course, and saved Meela while she was sitting doing absolutely nothing. The real hero of the movie was Thong, who saved Ator several times from his limitless stupidity, and killed the evil Zor in the deal. Congratulations to Thong, the only competent person in the whole movie.
