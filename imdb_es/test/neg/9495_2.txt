I do not really know much about the Marquis de Sade, I did not read any of his books, but I never imagined him as a burning queen. Carson Kressley of Queer Eye For Straight Guy, or Jack of Will and Grace would have easily fit into the role Nick Mancuso gave us. <br /> <br /> The film itself was quite thin and seemed more like a parody - or an excuse to show the Paris brothel several times with men and women who have a good time in the lounge chairs. What? Can not afford a room? It seemed nice to me that the lady (Irina Malysheva) felt that she was fulfilling her patriotic duty by taking care of the needs of the soldier. <br /> <br /> The movie was just an excuse to show many breasts, and I mean a lot! Fans of Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) may be interested in seeing him in a different role as Inspector Marais.
