There can not be a worse criticism for a movie than the word NORMATIVA. <br /> <br /> Some "bad" movies are very funny, some "fun" movies are really bad, but being BORING means no one will buy the DVD to watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> It seemed to be a movie that used the Antartic drama class, they were all too busy running to stay warm instead of acting. The main actor, who spoke, is a close whisper, a hoarse-voiced voice, damn it, it seemed like he was going to seduce someone, and he did not care who. <br /> <br /> The film can not make money if it is Boring, I hope that it dies a quick death, so that it will never be seen again.
