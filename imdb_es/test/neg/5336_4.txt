Before "Miracle on 34th Street", Maureen O'Hara and John Payne did this, this, this movie. I was going to describe it, but I can not find the words of how bad this movie was. The issue of the adoption of a child and Maureen's disease are very serious and sensitive issues, but despite this, this could have been done much better than it was. It was so extreme in its representation that it did not look at all real. Probably his problem started with a weak script. <br /> <br /> Another example of a screenwriter taking a novel and writing a weak movie. (See my review of "A stranger in my arms"). The beautiful O'Hara used to have stories like this, and another was Forbidden Street (Britannica Mews), which I can review eventually. <br /> <br /> If you have an emotional connection to this since childhood, you'll be kinder to this rather lifeless, colorless and dull film. But for something like this, maybe you can find your remake of movies for television. It has to be better. Must be.
