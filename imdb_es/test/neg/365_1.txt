I say "movie" because this does not deserve the name "movie", and certainly not "movie". I regret having paid the rent, and although I have never left a movie before, it would have been like that, if I had seen it in a theater. A society that lives underground in the future (oooh, which is original), a lot of barrel drums in flames, unexplained ambient light shining through the windows, an ungrateful woman and her dumb son ... the list goes on and on follow. C. Thomas Howell affects the husky voice of the stereotyped solitary; You know that Eastwood has been killed. He needs special sunglasses to remember his wife and son, however, in the flashbacks, he is the same age! Talk about a bad memory! I stared in disbelief as the boy Abe randomly enters a code on a door and opens it. Without tension, religious (what religion?) Bass / harmonics ... the saddest thing of all: I expected something better from Roddy Piper; <br /> <br /> It's possibly the worst movie experience of my life.
