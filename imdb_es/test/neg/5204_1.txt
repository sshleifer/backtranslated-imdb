**** SOME SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> There's nothing in this movie that you have not seen surfing the net. Nothing is shocking about this movie. In the movie, a man sodomizes a goat, there is a decapitation of an excavator and the face of a lesbian is burned. All these scenes of "extreme violence" are so false that one wonders why someone would want to re-emerge this piece of garbage. I just can not believe I spent hard earned money on what must certainly be the worst movie ever made. Do not let the critics fool you, this movie would be a shame for ANYONE who owns it ... except maybe the prisons that want to torture the inmates. For a classic of REAL exploitation, look at Bloodsucking Freaks or even the latest Doom generation. The Island of Death sinks to the bottom of the toilet of the film and needs to be expelled from existence.
