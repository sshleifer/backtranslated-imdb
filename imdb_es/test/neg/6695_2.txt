<br /> <br /> I connected to this movie not because I am a basketball fan of the US high school. UU (In fact, I rarely watch NBA games), but because I'm a fan of Gene Hackman, who usually manages to bring an impressive depth to his performances. In this case, however, I was deeply disappointed. This was not one of the bright stars of Hackman's career. <br /> <br /> To be fair to him, I did not have much to work with. Like Norman Dale, the new coach of a basketball team at a small high school in Indiana, he was not asked to act much. Basically, his performance consisted of walking from one side of the basketball to the other, ranting at the referees. I did not find him particularly credible on paper to be honest. Nor was I impressed by the necessary romance between Dale and Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). Honestly, there was no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey. The romance never caught my attention, nor did the "action" of basketball, which was too predictable. <br /> <br /> There were too many problems with this movie to make it worthwhile. I never understood the depth of hatred that so many people in the town had for Dale, almost before he arrived. The development of the character was poor and the story itself was poorly developed. Too much basketball and little human interaction, in my opinion. How many pictures of children shooting baskets we need to see to understand that this is a basketball movie? There was no suspense: is it even possible to doubt that Hickory will win the big one? I realize that this is based on a true story, but I think it proves that not all true stories should be a movie. Frankly, it was not a very interesting movie. Definitely a movie that Gene Hackman would like to forget. <br /> <br /> It's not better than a 2/10 in my opinion.
