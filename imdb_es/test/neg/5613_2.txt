This film was made because the concept translates well into a summary of two sentences that can be used to attract investors. That is, the premise is interesting and salable. I mean, I rented it based on the synopsis. The problem is that there is nothing beyond the initial concept. There is no coherent plot, no full-fledged character, no real comedy, no interesting scenery, no surprise and no good acting (except Jon Herder, he does something with very little). It is as if the people who illuminated this thing never read the script but only the synopsis. And if there were enough people like me, I could have even made money. <br /> <br /> For the possible spectator: do not waste your time, there is nothing funny or interesting to see here. For the creators of the movie: hey, you made your movie, so, what if it's not that great? Most people never see themselves or their work on the screen.
