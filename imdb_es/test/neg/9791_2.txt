Apparently, SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last film in which Julius Harris played a role. I have not seen all of his films, but Julius Harris was in many good movies, and I remember him better from "Live and Let Die", where he played Tee Hee and that was full of voodoo references, something that is common here in the south from Florida! I always thought that LIVE AND LET DIE was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystique, unlike most of the 007 films. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris is back in his Voodoo character! It has a great style for the mystery and the occult, and its role in this film is excellent. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is a comedy. SPOILERS: three children who appear to have been fired from the cast of THE LITTLE RASCALS are killed by a neighborhood bully who looks like he was fired from the cast of FAME! or as a dancer in the American band of Dick Clark. In other words, these children give LOW BUDGET another dimension. Julius Harris goes to the funeral parlor, cuts off the heads of the three children (and no one notices) and then takes them to his Condo Unit, where he has a giant cauldron of boiling liquids. The three heads are thrown, along with some herbs, spices and voodoo elements. At some point, Mr. Harris has ugly heads on a table and he spills his blood on them, and they come alive as talking heads! They can fly, make jokes, roll their eyes and take revenge on those who do evil. Usually, they look pretty funny flying, but the effects are not bad. For some reason, one of the children always has a blade in his mouth, and he uses it to cut people's necks and make holes in the tires. This movie is funny and weird, but only the first time you see it. Meg Foster is in this movie and looks fatter than Rosie O'Donnell and Meg plays a male leader of local mobsters. Strange movie
