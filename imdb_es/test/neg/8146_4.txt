Froggie is upset because he never makes a big party like all the other kids. Spanky and the gang seek to remedy that by giving him a surprise party. Unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him, Froggy sabotages everything only to discover too late that the party is for him. <br /> <br /> Well, our gang comedy works in shape. The bits work but I do not think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and, because so much of the humor needs to have some kind of surprise to make it work, everything collapses. I think that in a strange way the film is lost. It's the kind of thing they had really thought could have been something other than a misfire. It is worth trying if you lower your expectations.
