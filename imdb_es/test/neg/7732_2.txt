My God, this movie was just a movie of numbers. The seller with problems can not move forward in New York, a mentor with a heart of gold takes it under his wing, the seller with problems moves to California and makes it big, then loses it big, then recovers with the simple life, then hit bottom of rock trying to get back to the top. I do not think I can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds to develop. Case in question (spoiler?): When the character of John Kapelos calls to say that he and his girlfriend were going to visit Santa Cruz, and James Woods says that there is virtually no chance of him coming, you knew with 100% Certainty that the next scene or two would enter. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Sean Young looked good.
