Douglas Sirk's inaugural "woman's picture" was crying for Universal, based on a dogmatic, didactic, and didactic novel by the intolerable Lloyd C. Douglas (author of that other beloved piece of garbage, * The Robe *). Rock Hudson, in the role that catapulted him to stardom, plays Bob Merrick, a drunken playboy who is worth telling to millions of people who are more interested in chasing skirts and racing speedboats than in finishing his medical degree. In the first scene, he ruins his boat in a sumptuously photographed lake. The accident almost killed Merrick and, therefore, requires a rather mysterious "resuscitation machine" to keep him alive. . . Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, the beloved surgeon Dr. Phillips is finally killed by a heart condition. Since the local hospital can only hold one resuscitator at a time, Phillips dies so the lice can live. When Merrick finds out about this, he tries to make apology objections to Phillips' family, especially the widow (Jane Wyman, combed and dressed in matrimonial hauteur), but in fact anyone and everyone who knew that the surgeon spits Merrick on a cobras corset. A doctor at the hospital staff even calls it "a total waste" that the playboy lived in place of the Christ-like surgeon. Hippocrates could have had something to say about it! <br /> <br /> These early scenes are where the typical Sirkian iconoclasm is: the director rubs our faces so much in the unpleasantness of the middle class, in the middle of the 20th century. America, that one finds himself encouraging the playboy villain to put whoopee cushions under the braggarts of these moral hypocrites. But, alas, no: the laughable plot of the novel must continue, and Merrick soon converts himself by becoming God, on the pretext of Otto Kruger, an artist who claims that Phillips made him a better and even better man. painter. (Why do not we see anything of this amazing art?) We learned that Dr. Phillips, intolerably ubiquitous, would often reject payment for medical services rendered (although it is never clear who exactly qualifies for these "magnificent exemptions") . This is supposed to give our hero a new perspective on life and an example of personal behavior. Kruger even tries to make everything sound very illicitly exciting: "Once you start this, there's no way out of this! It's an obsession ... a magnificent obsession!" So Merrick tries AGAIN bothering the widow with apology proposals, but somehow causes her to run into a car. She loses her sight. Apparently, Merrick will have to go through several more stations of the cross before he can be considered a decent man. <br /> <br /> But Sirk continues to infiltrate his revenge even as the movie grows more and more. preachy. The most obvious thing must be the presence of Agnes Moorehead as head nurse of the hospital and friend of Wyman and unrequited lesbian lover. Notice the disappointment in Moorehead's face when Merrick, finally redeemed as a doctor, appears to save Wyman's life near the end. Hudson's own homosexuality, an open secret in Hollywood at the time, is also used for a great ironic effect. He and Wyman, fools and fifteen years older, generate an absolutely erotic heat in their scenes, which, by the way, are intentionally few, presumably because more scenes among the stars would inevitably expose this entire company. (Of something we're sure of: if Rock Hudson was obsessed with something, it certainly was not Jane Wyman). It is a chronic case of * Tea and Sympathy *. Sirk seemed to enjoy manipulating the noses of all by having this gay actor, who was attractive to the innocent ladies of the time, adrift of these "pictures of women" of exquisite colors. In fact, the director worked with Hudson 6 or 7 times more, to achieve the best effect in following this movie, * All That Heaven Allows *, which was rejoined Hudson with Wyman, but was also accompanied by a plot realistic. Meanwhile, in * Obsession *, we must endure that God / Kruger look fondly from an observation window at Merrick and his medical team as they prepare to save Wyman's life, along with a score of musical voices from a Hollywood choir. <br /> <br /> But to see why Sirk considers himself an author, check out the scene where Wyman explains to his adult daughter that, in fact, he can tell the difference between night and day . The entire frame is blackened, here: the daughter is barely visible, and Wyman's face is slightly slanted against a dim light. She goes on to say that she hates the night because "I know Dawn will never come back." A great chilling moment that deserves a much better movie than "Magnificent Obsession". <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10.
