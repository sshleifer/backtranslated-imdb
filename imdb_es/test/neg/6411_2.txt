The Good <br /> <br /> Carrey is a good actor and he showed it in "Man on the Moon" and in "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". But hey, what can an actor do without a good story and an appropriate address? You can do the "Number 23". <br /> <br /> The Bad <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is a poor and overrated director, and he showed it in almost every movie he made. What he did with Batman is just a mess, but probably the Batman movies look good. Well, they did not. Instead of Gothic and macabre we have Disneyland. Of course "Falling Down" was great, but can you ruin the film with Robert Duvall and Michael Douglas Y with an excellent script? Not you can not <br /> <br /> And so the good actor and the poor director finally met and made the "Number 23" ... <br /> <br /> The Ugly (23) <br /> <br /> I know To begin with, it's stupid but ... Fingerling's secondary plot (almost half of this movie) looks exactly like the introduction to another chapter of Max Payne2. VoiceOvers, the quality of the detective story, the quality of the characters, even the colors, the mood and the music, the editing and the sound mixing too. Maybe it works for the game, but surely not in the movies. <br /> <br /> The staging is so bad that it becomes fun. It is not even annoying. Carrey reads walking down the stairs in the park? Why? It's natural? No, but it looks good. Why did Suicide Blond cover the walls of her apartment with white paper? If she only wanted to commit suicide? There's no logic in that, but it still looks good. Guess what, it does not look good at all. It seems unnatural in its place. <br /> <br /> All the female characters are flat. Why is it like that? Who cares, let's continue with the story. <br /> <br /> Who is this Devil? Private eye on suicide? Hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which Walter Sparrow is arguing with his wife about the climate book is that it really could be the best part of this movie. Instead we have the Moulder / Scully routine. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> The interiors have no trace of people living in them, except for significant objects (shoes, photos, etc.). Strong luck. <br /> <br /> The dialogues are not so bad. But what about V.O.? Well, that's another story. "There is no such thing as destiny, there are only different options." Captain obvious to the rescue! "The number came after Fingerling, and now it was after me." Cliche. And so on. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that an average housewife would enter a public building in the middle of the night. Successfully and without interruptions. <br /> <br /> The secondary plot of the dog that drags the main character to the cemetery. This is a trick so old and so comfortable for the writer, and that it should have been banned. I'm serious. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks and the edition similar to "what happened in the last episode of X-files" is not the best way to present the most interesting part of the film. It is? <br /> <br /> I would like to be able to say that this story deserves a better destiny, but it is not like that. Has no sense. Said in chronological order is weak and incredible. All the time we have trapped undeveloped characters is a chain of situations that are nothing more than a poorly written fiction. This could be fun, but since the whole movie is very serious, it is not. For many coincidences, it is bad for each story. And the "mystery"? It is predictable and easy to guess. <br /> <br /> Losing contact with reality is a great theme for a good movie, but I never saw any of that in Hollywood productions. If you're interested in the subject, just look at "Repulsion" by Polanski or something by David Cronenberg, "Spider" or "A History of Violence", both films deal with similar problems that "Number 23" wanted to show. Wanted, but fails.
