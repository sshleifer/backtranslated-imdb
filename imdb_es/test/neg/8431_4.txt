GINGKO BED is a strange movie. It is very complicated, as if he had many ideas but lacked the ability to bring them together in a coherent story. Instead, we get several arguments that are separated into their own separate small movies. Oh, sure, in the end they meet, but everything seems pretty ... superfluous. It is worth noting the bride and her problems in the hospital. Was this ... interesting? Then there were the elements "we are spirits, therefore we have no physicality", which leads us to the same problem that people had with GHOST, namely: if the characters do not have physicality (that is, they have no corporeal form) and can go through walls and walls. What not, exactly how do they prevent them from falling on the floor or floating on the roof? <br /> <br /> GINGKO BED was highly touted as a new generation of films from South Korea. There are many special effects, but the film itself is hollow and its false melodrama will only "touch" those who are easy to play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (visit www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this film and reviews of other foreign films)
