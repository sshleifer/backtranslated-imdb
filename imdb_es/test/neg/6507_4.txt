This (supposedly) television movie based on a true story concerns a woman who runs away from the FBI and is a * stupid * type * seriously. <br /> <br /> First, we have Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson), a kind of "normal guy" with a numbing job of the mind, an ex-wife, a child who almost never sees and some cats. <br /> <br /> Next up is "Elaine-Lisa-whatever" (Tracy Pollan), a smart, sexy, good-looking woman whose tongue would burst into flames if she ever told the truth. <br /> <br /> Roger and Lisa meet when they respond to an ad for lonely hearts Roger is one of these poor sages who seems unable to bear to live alone, so after his wife left him, he places his ad. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for Roger to realize that Lisa * is * not * a good person, but he has no idea how to get rid of her .. He does not even have enough sense to change the locks of the door to your apartment after you throw it in. <br /> <br /> Go ahead and look at this if you have nothing else to do. <br /> <br />
