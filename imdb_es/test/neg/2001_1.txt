According to Coolio, I should have known better. But Noooooooo. <br /> <br /> In 3 minutes you have found 5 bites from other movies and TV shows ... <br /> <br /> 8 minutes that Casper Van Dien should have already learned! <br /> <br /> 10 minutes you feel bad for Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr. who has been reduced to making movies like this one. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes Erika Eleniak looks like Zena. <br /> <br /> 20 minutes you're ready to shoot yourself ... <br /> <br /> How these films get funded is something that beats me! And I did see everything. The end has no price! Just stay away!
