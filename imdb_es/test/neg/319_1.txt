If you are looking for a masochistic emotion, rent this movie and show it to a group of sober friends. This movie is just a lame plane, but not completely worthless. Brief tits are nice, and there is a victim's death that is as funny as hell. Apart from that, this is straight trash. But it's still better than "Grim" or "Spookies"
