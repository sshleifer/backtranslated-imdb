The girls can be prettier if you are their companion or a spectator with the face $ #! +. What I am saying is that special circumstances will be needed so that there are no reactions to this effort. The delivery of many lines seems to be an unnatural distraction for some actors. Lighting also seems to be a problem, although the lack of vision may have been the cause of my frequent crouching. And if you watch this movie, be open enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject: they are the creatures above and below the earth that delighted with dozens of campers near an empty Louisiana mansion. That is the discovery of a trio that is sent from their print media to investigate the deaths. Then, two of THEM disappear, and the survivor is part of another trio that assumes the hunt. Eureka! I just realized what one of those "special circumstances" mentioned above would be: unconsciousness.
