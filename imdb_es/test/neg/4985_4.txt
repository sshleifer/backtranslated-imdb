Jason Lee does well to pledge this dog movie briefly, but it's not enough to distinguish it from any other bland family comedy. <br /> <br /> This real action adventure, enhanced by a personal computer (CG) sees a dog embarrassed police officer (Jason Lee) transformed into a super-dog through an accident in the laboratory of the simulator scientist Dr. Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). Underdog is committed to saving the city while trying to keep its identity a secret, a challenge that can speak and fly. <br /> <br /> The strange gag gives a smile, but the Underdog human companions (James Belushi and Alex Neuberger as father and son) are as boring as the predictable story. One for children too young to have seen Superman. Or Spider-Man. Or even Shaggy Dog?
