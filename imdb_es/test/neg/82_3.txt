STMD! It's not a terrible movie, but it's pretty forgettable. Lighting is intentionally deficient in many scenes and is not intentionally bad in the rest, so you are likely to leave a show with a headache or eyestrain. The special effects are imaginative, but obvious. The essential free nudity for teen slasher movies is there, of course, along with the archetypal teenagers, but the whole movie simply does not go to sleep. What was needed was a more agile dialogue and more ironic humor. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend that you use your time to watch this movie. I often give a nod to a movie based only on a scene or two that shows imagination or humor, but unfortunately missing in this film.
