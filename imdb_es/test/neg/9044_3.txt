Why is it that in the 50s and 60s, the Italians made the best movies and then, during the 70s and 80s, they did nothing but movies of zombies and cannibals? Probably because art films did not earn money. , The Cannibal Movie, unlike Zombie Movie, which was created by Americans and "exploited" by Italians, is a purely Italian creation, designed as a showcase for the exploitation of Mondo, and to earn as much money as possible (without integrity artistic, road here). Eaten Alive arrived during the heyday of the film Cannibal. The director, Umberto Lenzi, had not yet reached his rhythm; his genre classic, Cannibal Ferox, was still a year away. <br /> <br /> In a plot similar to (read: swindled from) the classic seminal cannibal of Ruggero Deodato, Cannibal Holocaust, a woman (Janet Agren) receives news from Police that they have received an 8 mm film from his sister. She disappeared in Africa and it is suspected that the tribal ritual shown in the film may have something to do with that. Mel Ferrer, as a professor of something else, tells him that a man named Jonas (Ivan Rassimov) has started a cult similar to Jonestown in New Guinea, and that's where the sister is. The woman hires a guide (Robert Kerman) to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister. And, if you did not know, the jungle is full of cannibals. <br /> <br /> A phrase should summarize: if you've seen in Cannibal Movie, you've seen them all, mainly because these movies are blatantly stealing each other (Lenzi copied Cannibal Holocaust to make this movie, and I checked this to make Cannibal Ferox; Deodato copied parts of this for Hit and Run). And since they all share the same material, they all have the same features: horrible photography, boring landscapes, terrible dubbing, overacting and exploitation, exploitation, exploitation. Fans of the genre will have fun as all the members are veterans of the genre. Rassimov and Kerman have a contest to eat landscapes. Agren exists only to be naked, raped or in danger. A lot of blood for all the sick. The cannibals, who in reality seem to be native cannibals, have lunch and disguise themselves as human flesh. And, in the great tradition of Cannibal Movies, any live animal that is shown on screen usually kills shortly after. In general, it really is not a good experience, but I'm sure there are psychopaths who find this excrement entertaining. I know I did it.
