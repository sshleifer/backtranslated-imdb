Some movies are just ?? unlucky. These are the films that obviously thrived thanks to a lot of goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas, but they simply did not have the budgetary means and / or the professional cast and crew members at their disposal to make it happen . "The strangeness" definitely belongs to this category. You really want to like it, but even the most tolerant and demanding 80s horror fans will have to admit that the film barely reaches the level of mediocrity due to its cheap environment, clumsy stop-motion effects and impenetrably dark cinematography. "The Strangeness" has a quite original plot and environment (well, it's similar to "The Boogens", but I sincerely doubt that director David Michael Hillman intentionally cheats an insignificant fellow from the 80's movie B) and the players offer Enthusiastic performances even though we are all wrong. An assembly of amateur cavers goes on an expedition to explore the infamous Gold Spike mine. Many years ago, several miners died mysteriously there and the place has since abandoned, but it is assumed that there is much gold hidden there to remain closed forever. Shortly after descending to the mine, the members of the group, one by one, meet the viscous ruler of the Gold Spike mine; a Lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly cheesy way to advance. Throughout most of its execution time, "The Strangeness" is a boring and incompetent mess that is difficult to follow due to the total lack of lighting. The characters are not interesting and the mine is still a mystery because the only effects of lighting come from the helmets of cavers. You can experience very little action or horror in the first hour, but director Hillman intelligently captures the attention of viewers by showing fragments and pieces of the monster at regular intervals. As soon as you see the monster's tentacle for the first time, you will be condemned to continue watching until the end. The creature is made with stop-motion effects, which I generally adore and adore, but here in this case they look extremely weak and unfortunate. The person responsible for the special effects should have paid more attention to the work of Ray Harryhousen. The sequences of death occur largely outside the screen and there is very little suspense throughout the film. A horror movie with a scenario like this should benefit from the claustrophobic atmosphere and the unidentifiable sound effects, but "The Strangeness" lacks all this. The biggest triumph of the film is, undoubtedly, the beautiful appearance of the blonde actress Terri Berland. She looks like a speleologist as much as Mother Teresa, but she probably looks good in her tight white top and beige pants.
