I saw this movie when it premiered for the first time in 1986. At that time I was young and enjoyed all the normal comedy available, that is; Monty Python, Jim Belushi and SNL, Steve Martin, Cheech & Chong, so I believe that my judgment represents the majority of "healthy" individuals. <br /> <br /> The best absolute part of this movie was the trailer that was played at the beginning. of the movie for the new movie "My Little Pony" that was coming out. <br /> <br /> This movie was so outrageous that it was actually ripped from most of the theaters before the initial week was completed. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that someone wasted the company's money to duplicate this smoldering pile of human waste. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money to rent or watch this "movie".
