The only reason to see this little-known Irish film was the question of whether Mike Myers played a dramatic and normal character. Well, he could and his performance was pretty good, but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing I can say about this movie. At first, the film follows the life of orphan Mickey, aged twelve, who lives with his brother and sister with his rather eccentric grandmother. Despite a strong language, it looks like a family movie, but after a while it becomes clear that Pete's Meteor is a drama not suitable for young audiences. And the worst thing is that it is a drama with a plot that is so ridiculous and even totally implausible. An absurd story line becomes another and all the time does not make much sense in the events on the screen. I suppose that when a drama of life needs a meteor or, even more, something that seems an even more ridiculous spiritual content, it is a very bad sign. The characters are not much better than a story. Despite all his problems, the young Mickey is by no means a pleasant character, but it is clear that somehow we were supposed to worry about him and even feel a strong compassion for him. It does not work the same with other characters. They are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character (although it was not the main character) as the only bright spot. Towards the end of the film I still had a great hope that there is something behind all that improbability and absurdity. Unfortunately, even if the writer of the story had such intentions (and I am sure he did) in the film, they are hidden and practically imperceptible under such a strange script. <br /> <br /> Grade: 3 of 10. Those of you who are interested in seeing Mike Myers as a drama actor can see Pete's Meteor for that reason, but the rest of the viewers will probably be disappointed.
