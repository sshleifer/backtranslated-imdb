After Matt Dillon's phenomenal performance in CRASH, most will probably rush to pick up a copy of FACTOTUM to see if Dillon is real or just received a lucky bounce from a great script. its moments, but the simplicity of ... everything most likely discourages the spectators. However, nothing should be taken away from Dillon. His performance is wonderful and full of excellent expressionless humor, which shows that he is a solid actor with significant abilities; it's a shame the address and the script. <br /> <br /> The story is about Henry "Hank" Chinaski (Dillon) and his refusal to conform to anything that resembles normality. He resigns or is dismissed from his work in a matter of minutes, only to find himself in a dismal pub that meets even sadder women while trying to write a nonconformist novel. We never really know what the novel is about, except that it involves "everything" (cancer, movies, you, me). <br /> <br /> Jump from one workplace to another and constantly return to Jan (Lili Taylor, THE HAUNTING), a losing girlfriend who is as daunting as himself, Hank tries in vain to discover what is supposed to be his life has for him. If you ever find out what that is, it's about interpretation. Some may say that he never does, while others may argue that his life is simply a path to darkness. <br /> <br /> In any case, there is not much substance in Factotum, even with the excellent performance of Matt Dillon. The story winds through Hank's life without thinking much about where to take the audience. And that is a pity. Dillon's performance would have shone even more if a decent script had been given.
