I would like to say something different about this movie. I saw comments on how beautiful Russia is and the views from Russia have been excellent. Hi guys, this is not Russia, it's more specific Bulgaria the capital Sofia. So this is not Russia, it's my country. About the movie, well in Bulgaria, maybe except in the Gray Zone, all the films of American directors are as horrible as this one, of course. It's a shame that Patrick Swayze has to play in such low budget films. Most of the actors are Bulgarians, but in reality this movie has no plot. It has no energy. What can I say? The weak and boring movie is a clich√©, no more. Hello, people remember that it is not Russia, it is really Bulgaria.
