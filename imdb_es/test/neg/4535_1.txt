It is sad what they are leaving at film festivals these days. I had to sit for more than twenty minutes of this sad short film that I did not find funny enough to get a good seat for a movie I wanted to see at a local film festival. The festival planners combined this horrible short with a great feature. I'm glad the show was good, otherwise I would not have been a very happy camper! <br /> <br /> For a comedy short film, there were no laughs. The title says it all.
