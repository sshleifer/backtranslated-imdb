In fact, I own this movie, which is the MST3K version called "Cave Dwellers", which is really the only way someone could actually watch a movie like this one. If it were not for Joel, Crow and Tom Servo constantly making jokes, it would not be possible to sit through this shit. You have a hero named Ator who looks a lot like Jeff Spigoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and seems to be a little smarter, just without being drugged. He confronts cavemen (cave dwellers?), A giant snake (with a group of anal retentive snakes that like to align all skulls to face each other in the same way), invents a wing delta that suspiciously looks like a modern aluminum. one with some cheap vines wrapped around him, and then fight with the evil type of John Saxon. Then he goes on his horse through the tracks of the tires where someone has driven on four wheels. <br /> <br /> Yes, I got most of that from MST3K, which, as I said, is the only way to see this bird turkey. movie. If it were not for that, I would get zero stars.
