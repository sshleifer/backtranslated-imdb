Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. The rival Ben Turpin arrives at the same studio, obviously another unemployed comedian! Turpin tries to get into Chaplin's action after the studio boss shouts: "Next!" Chaplin manages to walk on Turpin, however. Charlie manages amusingly to ruin jobs as an actor and carpenter. In the end, he manages to get a great opportunity, but will a star be born? <br /> <br /> There are many jokes about the buttocks. The initial scene with Chaplin and Turpin slapstick is a relative highlight. Note that Gloria Swanson is the typist in the far background that remains on the screen, at the opening of the movie. Agnes Ayres also appears. <br /> <br /> *** Your new job (2/1/15) Charles Chaplin ~ Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Charlotte Mineau
