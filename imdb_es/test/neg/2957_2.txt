This movie is too long. I lost interest about an hour in the story. Saratoga Trunk tells the story of Ingrid Bergman, who is the daughter of a prominent New Orleans man and his lover. After his mother dies in Paris, Bergman returns to New Orleans to scandalize his father's "legitimate" family and blackmail her. She meets Gary Cooper, who is also seeking revenge against the railroad tycoons who cheated his father off his land in Texas. She attracts him to her plans, and the movie reaches its climax at a Saratoga resort. Long and boring, but worth seeing if you are a fan of Bergman or Cooper. The Cupidon dwarf provides the only bright spot in this serpentine story.
