I was in this film as an extra in the filming of Dallas in July 1975. Some of the things that you see today, and are taken for granted in making films, were implemented in this movie. The premise of the film, the costumes, special effects, acting. Everything was ahead of its time. It opened the door to films like "Star Wars", "Terminator", "Matrix" and "X-Men". Now people look at it and say: "Well, this does not add to this new special effects story ..." I did not have any computer graphics and, as new movies do these days. He had a story, a wonderful cast, and a great director! The places where it was filmed as the World Trade Center of Dallas, and the Zale Building, and the Ft. Worth Water Gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic stage for filming. Director Michael Anderson was very creative and tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and frailty. It was my first cinematic experience, the first of the six films I've been to. The fact that it was filmed in Texas does not make it a wonderful piece of the art of filmmakers. Look at it again and appreciate it more. This movie was the basis that set the standard for many of the great movies we now enjoy. Well, my hand is blinking ... I have to run. Sanctuary waits ...
