Low budget, but still spooky enough to keep his interest in another take off from Frankenstein's family history. This movie is also known as LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The seductive Tania Frankenstein (Sara Bay), recently arrived from medical school, arrives at her father's property to discover that she is still living up to her old tricks. Baron Frankenstein (Joseph Cotten) is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to continue with the family tradition by creating a lover. This is closer to being a mysterious melodrama than a horror movie. The cast includes Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux. A rainy night could amplify the atmosphere. It's still a fun watch.
