I have heard that Novo was compared to Memento for the simple fact that both depend on the main characters who suffer from short-term memory loss. Well, that's like comparing the silence of the lambs and Friday the 13th, since both involved a character who killed several people. They could not be further apart in ideas. <br /> <br /> Novo deals with a copier in a company that has a short-term memory loss. He is followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office. Enter a person who is also involved with him and can / can not use him to have sex. It goes without saying that he has a lot of sex on the screen. <br /> <br /> Wait, there's more. There is a boy who encounters male amnesia with problems and it is obvious that there is more to this boy who meets him. And there is a notebook that man keeps to try to remember important clues. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am not one for films made abroad. I do not mind reading the subtitles, but I do care that sometimes that takes me away from one of my favorite aspects of a movie: a great dialogue. Since they have to translate, or I could not understand for the most part, I really think they simplify what the characters have to say. This movie was no exception; The dialogue was fair, well, blah. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was interesting enough to keep me close for 98 minutes. Rare, yes, but, again, I do not live in France, so I'm not so familiar with their likes / dislikes or lifestyles. (For example, I think it is acceptable for a father to lie down and have fun with his son on the beach, that must be something cultural.) Fortunately, it did not take more than two hours to see this man recover. His past and progressively progress towards his healing. Because, when you learn the "secret", I was like, really? Well, it's fine, then. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend it for a somewhat decent performance, beautiful people and soft sexual situations (like every 2-4 minutes). However, if you do not like that kind of In this scene, I would skip this slow motion movie and memory recovery.
