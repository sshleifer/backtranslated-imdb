I saw this movie because every review I read said it was one of the most terrifying films of the new millennium. I really do not understand what the whole hype was about. On the one hand, the dialogue in this film was ridiculously bad ("What happens if something strange is happening?" ... What ????). The performance did not take my socks off either. It could have been because the script just gave the actors something to work with ... the characters are purely two-dimensional for me and I did not like anything about them. Another thing is that the movie is extremely boring. Extremely. Sure, there are a couple of "shakes" here and there, but for the 112 minutes of the movie, I'm sure you did not use your time wisely. Most of the film contains characters that talk about things that had little to do with the plot. What was the point of that? <br /> <br /> To top it off, the movie does not make sense. Yes, I think I understood the intentions of the ghosts, but how that fits the events that really happen in the film surpasses me. In addition, much of the film is played in small vignettes, which makes the story difficult to follow at times. And do not even make me start with the ending. What exactly happened there? <br /> <br /> I can give Kurosawa credit for placing some really terrifying images throughout the film. There are very spooky images of ghosts and other disturbing images. If they reflected more on these images and elaborated them, it would have made the film much stronger. But they did not, and instead elaborated more on social commentary, which was interesting, but again, it was portrayed in an extremely boring way. Yes, it is a message film. Good fun I just received the message of my review here in light: find a better way to spend your free time than watching this.
