It is difficult to delve into this kind of thing, since there is absolutely no trace of a partial reason to see it, let alone express an opinion about it. I do not know anything about this, I looked at him for a laugh and I stayed for the fake breasts. Apparently, it's an unofficial sequel to "Slumber Party Massacre" from 1982, which I enjoyed as a fun slasher. "Cheerleader Massacre" looks like a late soft-core Cinemax pornography. And it's no wonder that girls like Nikki Fritz and Samantha Phillips (prolific T & A actresses) are in this. A lot of nekkid hooters and not much else ... A group of cheerleaders in their twenties, two random guys, and the fat and stupid comic relief slob are left stranded in the country and find a house where they plan to spend the night. The murderer recently escaped from "Slumber Party" is in the area and begins to kill them. There is no gore or originality and I would not say that nudity is a true "point of sale", since this is almost as boring as a slasher movie can be. Absolutely terrible ...
