This movie simply does not have redeeming features. The story is incomprehensible, and the script is crude, sadistic and stupid. The sex scenes are a joke, as is the inevitable pursuit of cars. The music is horrible. The performance is largely limited to grunting and smiling. A doubtful half star. Shame on DirecTV for putting it on pay-per-view. In a theater, people could have thrown refreshments on the screen.
