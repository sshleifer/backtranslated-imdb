I'm a big fan of the "Vacation" franchise, and I love Randy Quaid as Primo Eddie, and at least a couple of the names behind the scenes were involved in this project (in particular, Matty Simmons, producer or executive -produced the 4 of theater premieres, as well as "Animal House"). For those reasons, I thought it was worth taking a look at this spin-off made for TV, even without Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> For the record, I did not expect it to be very good; I just thought it could be fun fun. Therefore, my high level of disappointment shows how bad this movie really was. It was insensitive, amazing, moving, tremendously terrible. However, somehow, I could not stop seeing it. It is a disease that I have; It seems I can not get out of a movie or give up a television show before it ends. Nothing has made me want to return two hours of my life more than this movie.
