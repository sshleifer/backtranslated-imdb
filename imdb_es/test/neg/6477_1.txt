I guess there are two ways to make a movie with children as the desired audience. You can say to yourself a) "Let's make a movie that kids today will love!" or b) "Let's make a movie that I would have loved when I was a kid!" The second approach explains why Steven Spielberg often makes films that appeal to a younger audience. The main examples are E.T., The Goonies or Indiana Jones. That Darn Cat is an example of the first approach. You see these incredibly flat characters who say things that are supposed to be fun but are not. The plot itself is enough for a short ten minutes, but instead it goes on and on. And although I am not a child, I do not understand well what is supposed to be fun for children in this film. The clumsy cops chased by a dog, the old woman with a tweety bird or the sarcastic oneliners of Christina Ricci? An actor showed a spark of talent with his very acrobatic humor: Doug E. Doug playing the FBI agent.
