Andy Milligan, the independent filmmaker from New York, directs this little "gift" as his version of the legend of Sweeney Todd. Sweeney cuts the throats of customers in her barber shop and her cohort, Mrs. Lovett turns them into meat pies. Grateful, I was well informed of the plot before seeing this farcical movie. Milligan, for my money, has to be in charge of the worst race directors of all time. Ed Wood looks like Orson Welles in comparison. This movie is so bad in so many ways. Let's take Milligan's address to start. The quality of the film is grainy. The sound quality is grainy. Many scenes seem as if Milligan was using a camcorder to film. The credits say "Photographed and directed by Andy Milligan." Do you want to take credit for the ceilings that appear after a death scene? What about the atrocious musical score selected for the film? The film is cut with one bad transition after another. Little logic is used in the creation of the frame. The story has little to do with the real legend of Todd. The scenes of murder are plentiful but not horrifying in any way. The hands, legs and other appendages are cut with the skill in which the editing was done: minced! And let's take the chest in the cake scene. Yes, it's there inside. Did not the baker know that a whole breast with a nipple filled a pie crust? Later, we listen to our characters who "have been careful not to be caught" for the more than 200 murders they committed. Obviously they are a pair of tits that can not keep up with what is happening (sorry, it was too tempting). The actors are not too terribly bad to be honest. Some even have flashes of talent, and they all seem to be genuine articles in English. Many non-erotic nude scenes are forced along. Milligan apparently has some problems regarding sex. The threads of the plot are left untied. The end is almost inadmissible due to the bad work of the camera. I could go on and on. Did I like something about the movie? There is not much to be honest. I have a high level of acceptance for films of this kind in terms of low budgets and marginal talent, but this movie lacks a real purpose other than being rude and sick.
