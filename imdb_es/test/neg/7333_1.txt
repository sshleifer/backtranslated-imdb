A man asks if his co-worker is gay. At a garage sale, he finds a lightning gun called "Gaydar". You point it at a person, you pull the trigger and it tells you how happy they are. He tries, it works and he starts to find out if his co-worker is gay like him ... <br /> <br /> A promising idea ruined by an ungraceful script (after a promising start) and a performance terrible. All the cast overreacts and basically SCREAM their lines to each other constantly. It becomes annoying and really embarrassing after a while. The saving grace is that it is brief, there is a scene that steals a cat (loves to fall out of the kitten's bed) and Charles Nelson Reilly is hysterical in his brief part. But none of this saves the movie. I can not recommend this at all.
