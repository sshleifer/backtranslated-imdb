I am a fifth grade language arts teacher, and after reading this book (which the students loved), then we watched the movie. They laughed aloud! Unfortunately, it is NOT a comedy! The acting was so horrible, I felt like I was watching a group of children in the neighborhood doing a play. My students imitated the lines and mocked at all times. I have to agree with them, sometimes, it was bad enough. Still, I would show it to the students again, just for fun, and to compare the film with the book. We did a Venn Diagram (teachers know what that is) later, to show what was the same in both and what the differences were, so there is an educational value in showing it. I noticed that another adaptation is being filmed for 2005, so we can only expect the performance to be better!
