I'm really at a loss as to how someone could give this movie a 10 (or even more than a 2). It is full of bad lines, bad acting, bad slapstick, etc. I never thought I could see a performance worse than the scenes purposely badly performed at the beginning of the UHF, but this was it. And just when you think it can not be worse, it does! And again! Could you have seen this in a theater? It was not worth it for free on TV! My 4 year old son and 1 year old liked it a little, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never on.
