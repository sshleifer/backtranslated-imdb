While I've seen and enjoyed films similar to this, which were silent films about the Russian Revolution, such as POTEMKIN and TEN DAYS THAT LOOK THE WORLD, I did not particularly enjoy this one. This was mainly due to the annoying and "artistic" way that the director chose to shoot the film. While POTEMKIN excelled in its editing style, this film used similar techniques with much less delicacy; In some places, the edition seemed very choppy and unprofessional. Also, and this was really annoying, the use of zombies during the beginning of the movie and at the end of the movie was really exaggerated. What I mean by "zombies" is that, to illustrate how depressed and oppressed the Ukrainian peasants were, people remain as mannequins in many scenes. And, they remain that way, immobile, for a VERY long period of time, while the "evil" capitalists and the exploiters of the masses pass by. Give me a break! This movie is a wonderful example of style over substance, and it's just a movie for those who enjoy or can overlook the overindulgent direction. <br /> <br /> By the way, the DVD for this movie has improved a bit. If you leave the audio comment on. This makes the movie easier to follow and provides some interesting ideas.
