This movie has to be the worst movie I've seen. There is a reason why it was made to be a MOW (Movie of the week). The continuity was totally wrong (palm trees on a Chicago stage, although it was filmed in Toronto, Canada), the effects were left for the year of 2004. HELLO. "The Lord of the Rings" had better CGI than that. But I guess they also had the money for it. The budget will surely affect the outcome, but anyone who calls this MOW more than a 2 needs to go back to film and TV school. Next time, remember that care and time make a classic not rush for a tornado box office or a great television hit. <br /> <br /> In addition, I know that networks can reuse images from old or affiliated networks, but do they use images from the 1980s for 2004? I have a hard time buying that.
