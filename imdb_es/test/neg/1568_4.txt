George and Mildred is a truly ungraceful movie. This attempt to translate the successful television series to the big screen was a total failure, as is often the case. <br /> <br /> The ingenuity and clever phrases of television programs have disappeared. The plot is a typical English farce of confused characters and mistaken identities, which is neither funny enough nor strange enough to provoke a lot of decent laughs. <br /> <br /> George and Mildred fans may want to watch this final episode of the couple's production (Mildred died of hepatitis before the movie was released), but others should invest their time more wisely .
