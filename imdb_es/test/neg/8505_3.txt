I like gay-themed movies where the characters are not stereotypically gay and that's what attracted me to this movie, that and the main actor, which is the only reason why I give this movie one more star of the that he deserves (although not because of his performance in the movie, let me tell you). Many people complain about the cinematography, but the feeling of the camcorder with respect to the film added certain quality "underground" to me and there are a couple of scenes, usually around sunset or sunrise and between trains that would make any screen of cinema will blush. <br /> <br /> But the performance is cardboard, the music is repetitive (I went through the last part of the movie listening to a soundtrack from another movie), you have to wait almost twenty minutes for any dialogue and then it's uncomfortable and amateur The subject of graffiti could have made this film great if it had been exploited with grace and the art itself would have been more intriguing, but it is not. <br /> <br /> Worst of all is that there is no climax; There really was not a plot to begin with. The film simply creeps back to its husk of silence and dies. A forgettable movie.
