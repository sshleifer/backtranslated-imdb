You have to see this movie, it's a great footnote in the history of cinema. When this movie was made, the American film industry reached the bottom of the suction. Watch this movie, laugh and feel bad for losing the last 2 hours of your life. It's the worst performance I've seen and even worse the address. The villains laugh as if they were taken out of a circus of clowns and if the guys who made "Scary Movie" want to make a parody in superhero movies, they just have to take the script of this movie and make a remake, called Black Scorpion III : The threat of really bad movies that in some way manage to attract the production companies to suicide.
