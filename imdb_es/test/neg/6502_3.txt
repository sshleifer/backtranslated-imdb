Let me say from the beginning that I am not a very artistic person and that I do not "understand" new art. That said, this movie is absolutely crazy and, in my opinion, it's not crazy at all. Filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very little connected stories, Avida is a film for those who can see modern art and say "wow, I feel the energy and passion of this painting". The only reason I give this movie a 3 out of 10 is because I could really laugh at some parts, although I mainly laughed at the madness of the movie. Two of the characters that throw chairs on the lawn, to do what these characters were doing, I have no idea. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
