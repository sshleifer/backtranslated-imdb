This movie starts every gangster / gangster movie ever made. MP Da Last Don has a reference to each movie. The performance was, by far, the worst I've seen. Who the hell is John Mario anyway? His performance was, by far, the worst I've ever seen. He makes the bad actors look good. As far as Master P is concerned, it is selling faster than an N * sync concert. I would really like to be there to tell the entire production company: WHAT HELL WAS THINKING WHEN ORDERING THE SCRUTCHER? "Obviously, these people are so obsessed with the image of the gangsters who decided to make a movie and live their lives as real gangsters in their minds." One thing I do know is that there was no one who wanted to distribute this movie, so it seems (and how predictable) that the NO LIMIT guys had to start, there are NO LIMITS OF LIMITS, I've said enough! This movie is terrible and does not deserve to be called a movie!
