I watched this Hallmark TV movie when it was originally broadcast. I lost interest in the story because it was said that a character was a witch. I just was not in the right frame of mind to watch this movie. But Hallmark represents the best quality films. Now, there is a reason to give this movie a second look. Clive Owen, who plays "Damon Wildeve," may have the chance to be selected as the next James Bond 007 when Pierce Brosnan broadcasts it. Clive Owen might have to wait until the year 2008. The other reason is that the female lead is that Catherine Zeta-Jones is now a celebrity (she was a stranger at the time) and became an Academy Award winner for the Best Actress of Cast in 2003. Plowright as "Mrs. Yeobright" is also in this film. I like the opening line in this film: "Deliver my heart from this fearful and lonely place, send me a great love from somewhere or else I will die, I will really die."
