It seems an exciting prospect, a modern dress "Othello" with Christopher Eccleston, who was so terribly good in "Shallow Grave" and (especially) "Jude", and Eamonn Walker, who took so much intensity and introspection to its pivotal role. in "Oz". One might think that both are natural Shakespearers, but both interpreters fail: Walker's Othello is a fairly simple version, with a whispered delivery that does not have much impact; and Eccleston criticizes it horribly while Iago, winking at the camera in almost an outrageous parody of the paper. It is likely that its director has convinced him, whose florid approach could have worked better with Elizabethan language, but that seems a pretentious and discordant choice for this modernized script. And the script itself is less disappointing in being modern than in being obvious? It's as if Andrew Davies draws the famous argument and then simply writes any dialogue that comes to mind. In short, a failure. 4 out of 10
