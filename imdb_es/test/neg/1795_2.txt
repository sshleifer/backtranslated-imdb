Heart of Darkness, a short novel written by Joseph Conrad about greed, corruption and travel in Africa was, to say the least, a tedious reading. The narrator follows Marlow, a sailor who travels to the depths of Africa to rescue Kurtz, a prodigy of the ivory merchant who supposedly went mad, this conclusion arose when the ivory stopped entering the main port. The basis of the story is that Conrad writes profusely about the surroundings, sets the scene in a wonderful way, but possibly a little extensive. The story was more like a water color painting, as it relates to the slow and slow action story that Conrad might have tried to make. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it happens that after reading a book, you may see the function. The film could help to match some thoughts with those of the book, or vice versa. Not so with Heart of Darkness, even with the supporting role of the main actor John Malkovich, the film just confused me more, there seemed to be no real main characters in the film, no one stood out to others, none of the extensive symbolism was explained. It was rather insipid and monotonous, to say the least. <br /> <br /> As far as the author is concerned, The Heart of Darkness is a true short novel masterpiece, which touches some very serious themes, the lies of Marlow. , and Kurtz's greed. It is not a book to be taken lightly, and it will put you in a rather gloomy way. A book like this I think could be very heavy for many people. However, I would recommend this book to those who crave a sad story of pseudo action without a happy ending of textbook.
