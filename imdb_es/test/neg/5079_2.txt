I went to see this because of snipes / statham, but honestly, Chaos is terrible. This movie has absolutely nothing in its favor, it should not have been done. <br /> <br /> Do not read this review if you do not want to read spoilers, because I will tackle a lot of Here the plot holes. <br /> <br /> First, the initial scene. It is the great event that caused the two semi-main characters (Statham and Snipes) to twist. But it's boring and mundane. Only at the end can we see what really happened and when you no longer care. In addition, all this event, where a bad guy and his hostage are killed, is not a story big enough to fill hundreds of newspaper articles, as mentioned in the film. <br /> <br /> Then, the work of the bank - it does not take off from the ground for a second The bank robber makes some unnecessary references to the theory of chaos (which, by the way, has NOTHING to do with the whole story). The way Statham is summoned is very 'Die Hard With A Vengeance', but more boring. So the things that happen at the bank are strange and meaningless. -What's wrong with the safe deposit box? It seems that there is a plot unfolding there, but then, it is not like that. - Why go through the trouble of tying two people, when it does not lead to anything? It involves a lot of preparation and is not used at all. -Why does the SWAT leader not listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to leave? <br /> <br /> And this is only the first 10 minutes. It keeps getting worse and getting worse. <br /> <br /> - The whole story of romantic / amorous interest (with the comment 'he was not just a better cop, he was a better man' to finish) is painful to watch. It is simply useless. Why does the Statham character point to the change in camera position in the bank's revised images? This essentially leads to finding the 'virus' that will give you all the money. - Why go through the trouble of falsifying the signature of some guys and kill him, but then DO NOT kill the guy who can identify you. <br /> <br /> I could continue for a long time (really), but it's as if this movie was ... meaningless. The whole script is a mess. The "smart" references to chaos theory are really ridiculous and quite pathetic. The 'turns' of the plot can be seen from miles away and the main characters seem to be making mistakes all the time. It is really painful to see a movie like this, where the public is taken for granted as silly people and crushes people, of which the director hopes not to see all the holes in the plot and the ridiculous script in general. The 'explanation scene' at the end only adds to the insult. It really is not a good movie. Either way. <br /> <br /> People who come to watch an action movie do not get what they want. The people who come to see a movie of friends of the police do not understand it. People who come to watch a smart thriller do not understand that. In essence, everyone gets the same: a great disappointment and a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
