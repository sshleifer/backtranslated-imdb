Surprisingly, this film by Kieslowski is disappointing for me because of the sometimes strange script and sometimes cliche that also seems to be a work of a bad observation sometimes. There is an isolated child. He lives with one of his relatives, but he feels lonely and every night he observes a woman who lives in the building. It seems! that he wants her. He's one of the young people who are not good at communicating with the opposite sex. However, he likes that woman, when the woman comes home with a man, Tomek feels pain. So, we understand that Kieslowski tells us a story about an isolated child who needs a woman to flirt or who falls in love with a mature woman. He does not do anything else, because he may know that it is his salvation. One day, he stops that woman, suddenly, he looks like a shy boy, but he proves he is not, so he explains almost everything. She gives him classes and rejects him. Everything is as realistic as the other Kieslowski films, no problem. The problems begin when Tomek visits, the story of a lonely young man who falls in love with a mature woman (but an unrequited love) becomes the story of a lonely young man who falls in love with a mature woman. The woman refuses, but after a short time, she begins to change her mind. This U-turn makes the clich√© of the movie in the first place. The personality of Tomek is rare? Or the result of a bad observation? I was disappointed with this character, this is my opinion and I will try to explain why. When he goes home, Magda treats him very kindly. She asks what do you want from me? To kiss me? to make love with me? go out with me At this point, I remember people who say that she is a fatal woman. Watch? Returning to the scene, Tomek rejects all proposals. Why? Why is he shy? I do not think so, but his communication is strong, it's fine. After the leg scene at home, some events make the film lose its purpose. I think the objective of the film is (I should have agreed with the story) to show that there are people who suffer from lack of affection and to save from this situation is not easy due to lack of communication and being distant especially for men . I want to say that at this point, what does the movie say? It is blurry and disappointing. It is seen that he is not hungry for love or for a woman or sex. And that? And the scene of the suicide attempt supports this weakness. For him to touch his legs, he wants to commit suicide! By the way, as I mentioned before, some say that Magda is a fatal woman. Totally no. She tries hard to make Tomek happy. Does she avoid having contact with him? No. Does she insult him? No. Does she have fun? No. And she cheats on him? No. She has some problems with her (ex) lover, so it's not O.K. However, she does not take revenge for it from Tomek. She is not an angel, but she is not a fatal woman either.
