Franco Nero plays Cole, a ninja who comes to the rescue of his war friend Frank Landers (Alex Courtney) and his wife (Susan George) to protect them from a mobster (Christopher George) who wants the land. Things get even more complicated when the gangster hires Cole's old nemesis (Sho Kosugi), who is also a ninja. The inept martial arts expert, although he has better production values ​​than most ninja movies, does not manage to inject life into the environment or, otherwise, into the action scenes. A poor effort everywhere.
