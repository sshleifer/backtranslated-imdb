"Milo" is one more answer to a question that nobody asked. Do we really need more killers? I think we have more than enough. I think that the top professional men charged too much, so in this case we are faced with a murderous child who is also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it. A long time ago, he drowned, but that did not bother him and he continues to kill people ("Friday the 13th", what is that?). One day, his survivors have a big meeting and as a surprise, Milo comes to visit them. Through some really bad shots that show everything, except the murders, the cast is diluted until only the last girl is left to discover the bored Milo, I mean the dark secret. She and her friends have been dying to know it. Once she found out, Milo continues with another murderous racket (is not it time to go to sleep?) And the girl, well, screams a lot. The performance is not even the bottom of the barrel, the barrel refuses to associate with him. Milo can be a creepy bastard from time to time I give him that, but some movies You just can not save without a great script or a free nudity.
