To enjoy 'Fur - an imaginary portrait of Diane Arbus', Stephen Shainberg needs the viewer to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of the American photographer, Diane Arbus. Paradoxically, it is the very use of the name and knowledge of Diane Arbus in her life and work, which causes this film to fail on a large scale. <br /> <br /> What is evident very soon with the casting of the beautiful WASPish and the glamorous Nicole Kidman as the anti-glamorous Jewess Diane Arbus, is that Shainberg did not get Arbus or what his work (not sentimental realism) and it seems that she is only attracted to Arbus on a superficial level through her photographs of circus phenomena. <br /> <br /> What follows is a kind of pretty and trivial fantasy biopic of Bella and Beast with Robert Downey JR as Kidman's furry fictional love. However, it is not the banality of history that is the main flaw of this film, but the director's misogynistic stance that Diane Arbus, one of the most unique and original photographers in the art world, was unable to form her own ideas about her work. While her previous film 'Secretary' was a study on female masochism, her continued representation of women as submissive ruins this film completely - and flies in the face of real life. The courage, the tenacity and the audacity of Diane Arbus explore by themselves the <br /> <br /> Imagine an imaginary biographical film about the life of the pop star Madonna with Guy Richie as his Svengali, the man behind his career, and you'll get an idea of ​​how badly flawed and imaginary this film is: it can only work if you do not have any knowledge of the subject, or just ignore all the facts. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because once you have removed all reference to Diane Arbus, this film could have stood alone as an interesting study on fetishism and a good complementary piece for the secretary. 4/10
