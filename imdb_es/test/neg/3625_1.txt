I do not like this show very much. I mean, basically, everyone at school is perfect and rich, and I doubt that a boarding school looks as good as that. And why do they suddenly allow girls to enter school? Is not that a bit weird? Anyway, Jamie Lynn Spears CAN NOT act. She always has the same facial expression, which really bothers me. Basically, she has no emotions, and it seems that all the guys like her. <br /> <br /> And should not Chase tell her that she likes her? it is not so difficult! Really! None of this program is real life, and she is not "a girl like me" because most normal girls do NOT go to boarding school, do not have designer clothes and do NOT live on the beach. <br /> <br /> fake false fake.
