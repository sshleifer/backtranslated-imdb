After a good start, it turned out to be the worst piece of holier than the propaganda I've seen. This movie is an open insult designed to make you feel bad for not reading the "Holy Bible." <br /> <br /> To resume the ... Okay, let's call it a plot ... Basically, do not kidnap it. People (who we already know ..). No, in fact, his demonic forces kidnap people who are in the matter of the new age or witchcraft, or read a porn magazine (as a protagonist does). <br /> <br /> It is completed with the little emotional music of the piano when the main character realizes. he must blindly follow Christ to be saved. <br /> <br /> a quote sums it all up, imagine a subtle piano music in the background: "You can not let others, even those you love, keep you from following the Lord ..." <br /> < br /> and we're supposed to live in an enlightened age ... we still have to work. Boycott this piece of garbage.
