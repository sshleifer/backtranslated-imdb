This movie tried, but in the end it was a waste of talent. He tried to be tough to be "sexy". I will not leave aside the works of actresses like Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson (who will find something besides the television "Le Femme Nikita" worthy of her talent). I just did not find it, even in the so-called almost seduction scene with Ms. Barkin, any real emotion, although I know that the actors made a great effort to make the scene work. If the sexual elements of the disturbed sexual victim of Wilson did not touch our hearts (that even by an end did not deserve), neither did the murder element of the plot. Maybe it was the script or the direction, but I did not feel anything for anyone in this movie, and without this feeling, a movie does not work for me. If you are interested in a film about lesbianism, there are at least two films on each side of the spectrum to see: 1.) The pleasure of the "Bound" gulity that works well in a black environment; and 2.) The most honest and moving story of a lesbian who grew up in Hell's Kitchen called "All Over Me". It is a well-defined indie from the mid-90s that deals with the problem of coming of age with feelings, not with forced sexuality. Both would be a better rent than "Mercy", which has almost nothing.
