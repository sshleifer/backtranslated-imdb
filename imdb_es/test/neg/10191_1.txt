I just stumbled upon this movie and checked IMDb for more information: score 6.7, well ... it's not too bad. Genre: scifi ... well I like the scifi. So I got the movie and I wanted to have a relaxed Sunday afternoon watching it. But but ... NO. <br /> <br /> As a summary, this is not a movie at all. It is a religious announcement, which includes: information about Jesus, god, devil, end of the world, etc. The film begins with an epic story of abduction: Driving at night, stopping a car, bright light and more ... Well, actually that was it. the movie. The last of this ... ummm ... frankly I do not know what to call it ... it was the dialogue about the end of the world and the final judgment. More or less the same as these TV preachers tell you, but they are "good" at that. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if you do not want to see a science fiction movie or something with a UFO, stay away. of this "thing". It has nothing to do with them. If you want to hear the opinion of a cuckoo boss, what the bible has to say and what you should do. Then go and look at this "thing", but I still prefer to go to church on Sunday. <br /> <br /> This is a complete bull. (and evangelical Christian propaganda, as other users said = Well ... I should have sent other user comments before I got the movie. <br /> <br /> (27% of voters rated this "thing" as 10. Yes, of course, please go to another place to do your propaganda.
