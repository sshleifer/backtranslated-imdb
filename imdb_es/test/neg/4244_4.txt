Throughout the 1950s and in the 60s, 70s and even the 1980s, a large number of war movies were produced in the former Yugoslavia, which glorified the heroism of the "partisans". Civilians that resulted in a guerrilla war against the German invading forces. Hajrudin Krvavac, who is generally only known in Eastern Europe, directed several of these "partisan" stories; unfortunately, only a handful of them were exported to the rest of Europe and the United States. "Battle of the Eagles" is a rare and low-budget aspect of the formation and exploits of the Partisan Air Force. <br /> <br /> Marshal Tito decrees that a Partisan Air Force must be formed to combat the German Luftwaffe in The Heavens over Yugoslavia. A group of former pilots joins forces with two small biplanes and begins to assault enemy bases and convoys; Over the course of several months, more pilots and planes joined the ranks, eventually forming a formidable air force. Maybe it's history, or maybe it's a fable? Whatever it is, it's not convincing, but a cast of great actors will try to make it work. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a well-shot German air attack on defenseless partisans. The nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost immediately, and for a short time the audience is treated with a series of quite patriotic scenes. Then the action begins, and this title quickly becomes another low-budget, number-one adventure. All the characters are familiar clich√©s: Commander Dragan (played by a well-meaning Bekim Fehmiu) is our typical patriotic and heroic man. Shoot the aircraft with a machine gun and even have an aerial duel with the villain Klauberg (Radko Polic), a completely predictable and cheesy climax with an equally predictable result. The rest of the partisans are familiar: Ljubisa Samardzic ("The Battle of Neretva") is a Zare, a playboy hotshot; Bata Zivojinovic ("Hell River") is Voss, a veteran aviator who leaves the carpentry shop now that his country needs it; and Rados Bajic ("The day that shook the world") is Dalibor, a young messenger who moves through the ranks, and eventually becomes an experienced fighter pilot. The characters and their stories are familiar to any fan of the war, and Krvavac does not try to build on these stereotypes. The cast does a fair job and, despite the two-dimensional script, each player is attractive and fun to watch. Bajic, in particular, has some great moments ?? when he will take his first flight as an artilleryman, and later, when he is forced to land an airplane after the pilot dies. The plot simply consists of a series of air strikes against the Germans and subsequent acts of reprisal. <br /> <br /> Krvavac handles action sequences competently with a combination of real images and miniature effects. Unfortunately, the miniatures are so cheap and fake-looking that the transitions between real aerial photography and toy planes are discordant and ridiculous. Some of the bombing and bombing scenes seem surprisingly real, while dogfights with scale models, complete with action figure pilots, are simply pathetic. Sometimes, the puffs of smoke from the "machine guns" are so large that the smoke envelops the entire model plane. Worse yet, editors often overlay fighter shots on real images. Although airplanes usually have an adequate perspective, they are surrounded by a distracting glow that makes any attempt at realism difficult. All this action fits an incredibly familiar and annoying score by Bojan Adamic. <br /> <br /> "Battle of the Eagles" also suffers from a poorly edited English release. For starters, 28 minutes of images are missing ?? cutting the 130-minute film to just 102. The missing segments were cut without care and the cut looks very neglected. The musical signals are cut off abruptly and the scenes are abandoned before they are resolved. In the last third of the film, the story falls apart, and only some so necessary action scenes can try to save it from total incomprehensibility. So, there is the dubbing? all the scenes that revolve around the partisans are dubbed in English (though quite badly, though), however, several long scenes remain in German, without the benefit of the subtitles. The film could have made much more sense if the German-language sequences had been removed instead of the crucial scenes that revolved around the partisans. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Krvavac handles images outdoors well enough. There is never a time when the audience feels as if they are in a sound scene. In particular, the bases of the German Luftwaffe are expansive, with dozens of Messerschmitt fighter jets and extras disguised in leather jackets. The landscape is fresh and green, and Krvavac is not afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or from far away simply to convey the scope of a battle or a long walk. A German ambush of a partisan unit at the beginning of the image stands out, as does a sequence in which Zare and Dalibor escape from an enemy base. <br /> <br /> As it appears in the home video, "Battle of the Eagles" is just another of the many stories about the Yugoslav partisan movement. There is nothing that differentiates it from the rest of the cut, and the terrible special effects and drastic editing place it at an acceptable lower level. Try to avoid this unless you can find a full copy.
