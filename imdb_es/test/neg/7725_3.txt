I saw the first Casa de los Muertos and I hoped it would be more pleasant to attend a root canal, so when it was not so bad, I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I got my I hope the second one is also fine ... and I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Apparently, I am one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I see it again and force myself to see what all the people who gave it good reviews saw, or I wonder if I saw the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> Ed Quinn as Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra 'Nightingale' Morgan did a great job in roles that were way below them. They deserve to be in better movies. <br /> <br /> The special effects were fine and some of the characters are nice / obnoxious and that became a tolerable watch, but for the most part, this movie was just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have to ask this because I found myself asking it out loud ALL the way through the movie ... Did not somebody know how to close the doors behind themselves so the zombies would not Did they do it? just wander around the rooms? Only once did it happen, (the zombies wandered) and I discovered it was a little convenient ... the soldiers enter a room, leave the door open, pay little or no attention to the same door so that the zombies can enter if it gives them he wins it (with the unfortunate "lives" that are cornered and have no way to escape) and yet, only once did the zombies follow. <br /> <br /> Nitpicky? Maybe, but honestly ... if I was fighting for my life, the last thing I would do would be to enter a room and leave the door open so that the zombies could enter and eat me. <br /> <br /> That's really the only thing * that bothered me * throughout the movie, and only the movie for the most part was a bad sequel to an original not totally abominable.
