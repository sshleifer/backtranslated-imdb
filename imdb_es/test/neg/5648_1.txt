Words fail me because of this frightening loss of two hours of anyone's life. The story is devised to the point of complete disbelief. <br /> <br /> The acting is important and much of this is ridiculously terrible. Vinnie Jones, so wonderful in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, is unbearably horrible and incredible as Mike Sullivan, journalist. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do not remember seeing a worse movie. It's just worth looking through the frightful lapses of continuity. After Jones takes a big beating, he emerges without scratches. His girlfriend gives him a drink over and he pursues her, leaving the pub dry. It is quite terrible, made worse by the talented actors that appear in it.
