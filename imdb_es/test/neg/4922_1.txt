Movies just do not get worse than this. A horrible plot, terribly timed, characters and pathetic effects and yes, this is using the "B" standards. <br /> <br /> And for the guys: nothing, this movie is a terrible disappointment, scenes in couple that could have been great but you get nothing but accumulate without delivery. <br /> <br /> This movie does not attract anyone, horrible movie, had bad; Plot, performance, taste "B", special effects and everything else. In addition there is no nudity or eroticism for boys or girls.
