My guess would be that originally it was going to be at least two parts and, therefore, at least a quarter more, because otherwise, how can you explain its confusing and abbreviated history? I was never completely lost, but I was often partially lost and, in general, I was not clear about the character's motivation. The film feels as if uniting points of the plot fell to put it in its time slot. <br /> <br /> If it were longer, it might make more sense, but even then it would not be very good. The most interesting idea of ​​the film is that the war between Zeus and Hera is a war between men and women, but the film drops the ball on this, making the followers of Hera are quite horrible and not clear what they believe or believe the followers of Zeus. The film is also interesting because you do not see the gods and there is no real certainty that they exist. So he has a couple of intriguing ideas, but he does not do anything useful with them. <br /> <br /> Bad dialogue, cardboard characters and an interesting scene that involves Hercules and his three antagonistic children. It is not unrecoverable but it is not worth seeing either.
