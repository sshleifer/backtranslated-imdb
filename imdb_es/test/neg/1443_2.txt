Amazing. Great cast, fair acting, interesting plot. <br /> <br /> But this movie has graphic cruelties that are not tense or exciting, just pure disturbing. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Everyone could see that the phenomenon was returning to their habits. And that Robert Englund was acting (was he?) Like an idiot; Forbid your daughter to sleep with a soccer player, but he's trying to kill an idiot and like Kiddypr0n okay? <br /> <br /> The policeman who kidnapped the daughter, did anyone feel that he was a policeman and not an actor? I do not. This film is prolonged again and again with an ending that we see in other horror films: if the results were correct, it could be a part 2. Bad, really bad. I could give you some inspiration ...
