I saw this movie, and I like horror movies. <br /> <br /> I did not know what to expect, but as soon as the movie was on the way, it was nice to see it. The idea was quite original and the performance was nice. Especially Jenna Dewan as the exciting / evil Tamara. <br /> <br /> The hardest thing about horror films is to make a good ending. But there the film failed. For a change, a final scene in a hospital, where suddenly all the employees have left. First go to the doctors and nurses running, but then everyone went home. <br /> <br /> They do not ask for help while being chased by Tamara, escape to the roof (it's also a smart move ... no) and disappear Of course, a kind of open end. <br /> <br /> No ... the movie started very well, the main part was nice to watch, but it really ruined the ending using all the bad movie horror clichés. Jeffrey Reddick failed in my eyes with this film, after making some great quality films like Final Destination 1 and 2. <br /> <br /> If you like a good horror full of cliché endings, Tamara is a good movie to see. For me, I like the movies that surprise me.
