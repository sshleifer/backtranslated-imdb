Well, where do I start? I can not even imagine understanding this preadolescent pathetic excuse of a show. Imagine this: a boarding school, where children whose parents are accumulating money simply throw them there to fly around the world. It could not be more diabolical than this. <br /> <br /> If you taught these children, you will not even update them to the term teenagers, because they almost do not act like healthy homosexuals, they were egocentric, think again. . About 23 minutes they choked on their supposed problems, children's problems and things like that. <br /> <br /> The heroine of the series, of course, Mademoiselle Zoey, played by Britney's Polly Pocket Little Miss I'm All That sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, obviously has a lot to learn about acting. However, I will give it a little face, because its superficial, one-dimensional character does not allow much space for depth. She plays the sun, the moon and the stars of Pacific Coast Academy, fighter crossed by the difficult situation of all women, equality of all genres. <br /> <br /> Perfect in every way, always with your two loyal companions, Nicole, the silly bimbo. who obviously has too much cash from dad, and the tough girl, Dana, who proves to be a nut hard to break. Both left the show in seasons 2 and 1 respectively, it's not that I blame that. But the horror of horrors comes to Lola, who considers herself the best actress since Natalie Wood, with green feathers in her hair and fake tan. She's even more rude than Zoey herself, if that's possible, and even more foolish than Nicole, and damn, we know that's not possible. <br /> <br /> This program, like all the regrettable excuses of television. The programs that Nickelodeon has been launching since the 2000s, is one of the main victims of stereotypes. Get the girl next door and dense to the feelings of his best friend for his Zoey, a great novelty, sometimes the best friend, Chase, a cold and arrogant woman, Logan, a boy and a crazy girl clothes, which He's not very smart, Nicole. , the one everyone thinks is weird just because he's extremely intelligent, the nerd, Quinn, the exaggerated, annoying but super thin, the perfect Malibu model, Lola, and the hard but soft woman inside her, Dana. Now, where have I heard these characters before? I'm sorry, but what's wrong with having a personality? Just because Quinn is passionate about science and really cares about her future and is doing well academically, in which the rest should also worry, she is "weird" and a "nerd"? Lola at the beginning of the series, proved to be a great potential character with his cheeky ways and different perspectives in life, Zoey just had to go, take the gallows, burn her at the stake, return to Weird Town and all that jazz. Women rights. Unfortunately, Lola simply became nothing more than another clone of OC, in all of her anorexic glory. Probably so as not to eclipse her Mistress. <br /> <br /> But hey, the 2000 generation of MySpace whores seem to love the typical Chase / Zoey fairytale romance, the tension between adamant, "hot" Logan and "kick ass" Zoey or Dana, whatever your liking, and beautiful people. Please, this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism, prefer a pretentious, superficial and tasteless lifestyle. I'm sorry to tell you, dear ones, that will not happen, unless you have an important trust fund and parents to protect you.
