Absolutely the worst experience I've had. I think my eyes started to bleed. I actually got sick the night after seeing this. I do not even consider this a movie. Movies are supposed to be worthwhile and entertaining. This fails horribly. I could not go through the whole movie, so because the ending could be the biggest phenomenon in the history of the movie, this has a 1 for that small possibility. Otherwise, it would be a flat 0. <br /> <br /> I can not see how National Lampoon, or not to mention any organization, could sponsor this atrocity. Renting this DVD is currently one of the worst mistakes of my life. Just look at this if you want any other movie you see to look great. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, this is the worst movie I've seen.
