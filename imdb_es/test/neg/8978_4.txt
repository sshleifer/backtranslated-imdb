Although this was the first documentary of Hunter S. Thompson, I have seen it at best, despite the participation of great stars like Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey and others. I was disappointed in this and yet it was still a bit interesting. What kept me watching was some of the old Fear and Loathing clips in Las Vegas and Where the Buffalo Roam. It's not so good, mainly because of the old games and things that any fan would already know. I still think that they were milking it because it could have been compressed at least in half. Still, if you're a fan, you'd like anything that has to do with Hunter. attentively
