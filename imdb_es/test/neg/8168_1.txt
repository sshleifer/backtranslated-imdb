This is a film that reminds me of an avatar starring Rajesh Khanna of the 80s. The theme of the parent-child division is interesting, but it was handled in an unoriginal way. The characters did not fully develop and the children seemed to go from being extremely loving (in the first 15mts of the movie) to being totally carefree about the parents, this transformation was not credible to say the least ... they have only explored this a bit plus. amitabh and jaya got confused like this old helpless couple ... first of all, amit was not too convincing in this role, because he did not look like he should be helpless, I mean, why not go back to work where he wants it instead to be? w / children who did not want them ... hema was not convincing at 60 either ... she did not seem to have a day over 50 ... then the whole baghban book thing that won the booker prize beg credibility ... in general, a film that handles an important theme but cld has been improved, I give it 5/10
