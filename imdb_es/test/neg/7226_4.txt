It has very good music and performances; Kid Creole and the Coconuts, James White and the Blacks, DNA, Tuxedo Moon, Plastics, Mel Mel, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch ... etc, but apart from this there is not much more than that. The dialogue, especially the narration (by Saul Williams), is actually pretty good, but the performances are pretty dull or totally bad, no matter how many hipsters are thrown; Debbie Harry and Jean Micheal Basquit (the latter is the leading role) do not yet have enough cultural credentials to prevent this film from being a novel element. It applies to the style of Jack Kerouac in his itinerant spontaneity, but he does not have the idea of ​​keeping it moving, which is where the band's performances come in. I enjoyed it, but I expected more. Although it has a fairy tale ending.
