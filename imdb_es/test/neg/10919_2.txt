I'm writing this with 10 minutes before the movie ends. I feel comfortable writing it now, because, unfortunately, I know exactly how this movie will end. <br /> <br /> The premise is quite simple: the rabid dog that runs loose in a small town kills people. Great - a simple plot for a fun horror camp of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Uhh ... no. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that it is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can say that it should not have been really adapted for filming, at least not with the same plot. Why? Cuz is boring! The first 45 minutes try to build depth to their main characters and create suspense. However, it lasts too long (half the movie!): The characters are unpleasant and, anyway, we never care, and almost does not create suspense. The easiest film (according to the plot and the time) to compare it with the classic Jaws. Everything that Jaws does well, Cujo does wrong. Jaws created good characters and a genuine sense of fear. Cujo does neither one nor the other. The jaws effectively create a frightening and spooky villain in your shark. Cujo has a dirty San Bernardo running around snarling and jumping, and not much else. The jaws are exciting and unpredictable. Cujo is a tireless hole that remains predictable until the end. <br /> <br /> It is also confusing the plethora of subplots that only act as boring red herrings in the main plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Yes This movie was rewritten for the big screen and had a better director. This could have been good. But it was not like that. It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> People here are saying that this is one of King's best adaptations. I'm sorry you could not be more wrong. The Mist is a hundred times better, Thinner is 10 times better and even that of the cats is twice as good! This in my opinion is one of the worst! The only good thing was that the action scenes with the dog seemed real, although they were boring. <br /> <br /> The movies ended now, and they did not improve. Avoid.
