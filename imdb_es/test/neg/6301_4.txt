This is one of those harmless and slightly entertaining little movies that strive to make you like them more. But like many others, the material is not strong enough to fill a couple of hours successfully. <br /> <br /> The tone is promising: three drag queens drive a bus through the Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs. They face many problems: with the homophobic premises, with the engine, with their pasts. <br /> <br /> The real problem is with the dialogue. The clues are fine (although Pearce's continuous attitude becomes boring), but the phrases of a line and the epithets feel forced where they should be casually discarded. Characters should not laugh at their own gags. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Elliott also feels the need to huddle in the pleasantly incongruous takes of extravagant drag suits against desert backgrounds like a cheap makeup. For a film about self-confidence and just being oneself, everything seems very insecure with itself.
