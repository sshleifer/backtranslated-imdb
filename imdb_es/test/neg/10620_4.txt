Sometimes you get exactly what you expect. You can not expect a film produced and for and as a vehicle for a rock band in the middle of a reappearance to have a high rank in artistic merit, and in this case it certainly is not. In fact, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the film itself, which, like the 70's rock and roll lifestyle it attempts to portray, is characterized by excess, drugs and excessive pranks, but unfortunately it is not. almost so funny Using a script by Carl Dupre horrible enough to make a fellow screenwriter embarrassed, and wasting the talents of Edward Furlong, the only highlight of this piece from the rock and roll era that went wrong is the music, about all the elaborate recreation of a KISS concert in 1978.
