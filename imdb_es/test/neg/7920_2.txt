First, they ruin it with exceptionally bad animation quality, then get voices that do not look anything like the original. They make so many movie mistakes. When Sasha sings in Count Me Out, the drummer disappears and then reappears, Itchy's shirt changes color, his hat changes position, one of the bridges is white, all those in the background look fat, the halos keep changing of color and appear and disappear. . Even the sky seems different. I do not give a damn if this is a low budget movie, they should not cut corners in the animation. They completely ruined the first ADGTH. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.
