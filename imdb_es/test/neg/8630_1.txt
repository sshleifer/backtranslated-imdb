Man, what a horrible movie. As with many terrible movies, the structure of their horror lies in the script. This is such a pathetic attempt in a psychological thriller that gives the whole genre a bad name. Okay, here's a major problem: the Sandra Bullock character is kidnapped by Jeff Bridges in his car in a busy store in broad daylight. Somehow, her boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland does not find a single witness of this act and, later, he spends most of the film without having any idea of ​​his whereabouts. Come on! Personally, I find this completely insulting even for the weakest members of the audience. However, we are forced to buy in this nonsense. Equally frustrating is the poorly explained reason for Jeff Bridges' actions. His character is a bit of an eccentric academic, no doubt, but far from the sociopath who would do these things. He spends about ten minutes, more or less, spilling his beans to Sutherland as to why he has performed his cruel actions. But the explanation itself lacks even the most elementary sense of logic. Therefore, no member of the intelligent audience can really believe in the possibility of their evil. And if you subtract that element from history, everything collapses. <br /> <br /> It is also of great concern: -Jeff Bridges uses a strange, pseudo-French accent for no reason. <br /> <br /> - All the boring secondary plot that involves Nancy Travis, especially saving the day by changing the tables in Bridges. <br /> <br /> - The crazy woman who somehow manages to remember Jeff Bridges' registration number even though I also thought that the Lucky Charms duende is real. <br /> <br /> -The name of Sandra Bullock's character, Diane Shaver, re-encodes to form the word "disappeared". Are you joking with me? -The logistical impossibility of drugging, kidnapping and burying (in a very remote place) a human being in the space of forty minutes (as Bridges alludes specifically). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that made me remember the fictional character, incredibly stupid (but very successful) of Donald Kaufman in Adaptation. Many screenwriters are brilliant, inspired artists. Some are just bozos that convince the fools who run the studios to do their nonsense. This particular script is so amazingly weakened that Donald Kaufman himself could have sold it. Unfortunately for all of us in the real world, Todd Graff really did.
