How horrible is it? Let me tell the ways: 1) It is a bait and change film that starts with a UFO investigation and then becomes a high-pressure sales work for Christianity. Let's go! If the creators of this film were so convinced about their message, why disguise it? It annoys nonbelievers and pushes those who fence in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good selling point! If the characters in this movie asked me to go to church with them, I would run like hell in the opposite direction. That are scary 3) The acting is terrible. Everyone behaves as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace. 4) Cinematography is bad from home movie. Wait, it's not really that good. 5) Script evil, bad, evil. All dialogue, there is no action. Like a tennis match, they bounce back and forth between the close-ups of "talking head." 6) Address ... Which address? Oh, there must have been a director somewhere. I challenge you to find out where. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, I have some positive comments about this movie. The editing seemed professional, but it could not make a difference. A good edition of bad material is still a bad movie. The opening theme of the music was really very good! Very scary and UFO-ish. Too bad the movie was not about UFOs. <br /> <br /> If you can not tell already, here is the conclusion. I wasted my money watching this movie, and I got angry. If they had not disguised what this movie was really about, I could say it was my fault.
