This movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes, Nicholas Sparks is a great romance author and this film had all the possibilities of being as excellent as The Notebook, but what distinguishes the two is that the notebook had a dream team leads McAdams and Gosling, but here the balance is miserably lost by the inept performance of Channing Tatum <br /> <br /> I felt that many of the scenes were unequal simply because of their performance, much emotion in various aspects the scenes are lost because can not act, leaving an uncomfortable and uneven situation, Amanda Seyfried gave a great performance just for Tatum to drop the ball and the mood was lost and the scene could not recover. <br /> <br /> This story deserved to be cast well, but what he got was a pretty boy who can not act. Tatum should stick to what he does well, the films that are more about his physical capacity, although horrible, like GI JOE, intensify and Fight. The less you talk, the better. <br /> <br /> Try not to think that I am a fan of Channing Tatum. I went to this movie with an open mind, because I was often surprised by the likes of Adam Sandler in Reign over Me. I gave Tatum the same opportunity. I did not see him here as the sum of his past roles, simply because of his performance in this film, which unfortunately was a disappointment.
