I'm currently watching this movie and I have no hesitation in reviewing it now. The acting is ridiculous. Half of the cast should be retired porn actors, and to miss you, you can imagine the quality of the performance. <br /> <br /> The graphics are different from everything I've seen. I think there are puppet shows with more credibility. They can not even afford the blanks for the weapons that trigger the pathetic excuse for the monsters. Maybe I should also take into account how incredibly impressed I am with the amount of "bullets" your pistols can hold. <br /> <br /> If I were asked to summarize the film, I would say that someone had robbed a group of complete non-hopers at the local county fair, had slapped them on an island, added unnecessarily intense music and I had left Children of 6 years do the editing. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not formulate any possible explanation as to why this movie was released, recorded on DVD and it costs $ 6 at my local video store for a day. In any case, I have received the benefit of knowing that I am much smarter than all the parties involved in this film. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie with great intensity. Why? I wish I knew captain, I wish I knew ...
