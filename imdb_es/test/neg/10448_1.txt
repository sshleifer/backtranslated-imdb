Finally, a movie to rival "The Godfather" and "Darkness Falls" in terms of total and total boredom. This is actually the first movie I have given to 1 out of 10 in IMDb, and with good reason. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the cast is nothing special. Usually, that's not a problem for me, except that the only character that is interesting or different from all the others is Harrington by Grand L. Bush. Secondly, the production values ​​a lower quality: the science fiction television, like 'Stargate', has more convincing sets, and all the underwater scenes that the SFX teams do not handle are filmed in dry scenarios with 'falling particles' which are not very convincing. This movie is literally 'dry'. The worst part is that this movie is boring. For the first 45 minutes, I felt as if we were circling and circling: "It's a prehistoric shark." "Bullsh * t" "Not really." "Bullsh * t" "I'm not inventing this." "Bullsh * t" "There it is now!" "I did not see anything". "Let me guess?" "Yes. Bullsh * t." After that, it rises slightly for about twenty minutes or so. Then we go back to the dialogue. Dialogue is not a bad thing, but that's all there is to this movie. Characters talking. That's not a bad thing either, except that this movie is not very good at that. Dialogue is often devised and cliché, and it is not very interesting to listen to it. I do not see any point slandering the special effects; This movie has worse qualities. <br /> <br /> The sets are small and unrealistic. The performance is sub-par. The script, oh Lord, the script, is worse than a science fiction television junk has to unearth. It makes you wonder where the budget for this movie is or was. <br /> <br /> Another terrible, terrible addition to the 'Megaloadon' movie series (there are around four). Bring Steve Alten, please ...
