This film was a sad attempt to recreate a crucial moment in English history. The film version of Cromwell's growing involvement in the War is marginally accurate, but the overall historical accuracy of this film was very different. This film implies that the war started because of religious differences, but the Civil War was not Catholic in any way against Protestant: both sides were Protestant. Cromwell was never present at the Battle of Edgehill, nor did he "save the day." Realists did not win, the battle ended in a draw. <br /> <br /> As another critic pointed out, Cromwell was certainly not one of the "Five Members" who should be removed from the House and arrested. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was decent. The producers tried too hard and it was not so good. <br /> <br /> It could definitely have been better.
