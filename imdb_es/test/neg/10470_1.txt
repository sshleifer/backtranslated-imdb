Bone Eater is located in a small desert town in Alabama, where property developer Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is financing the construction of a large resort. One night, three of his workers, Riley (Timothy Starks), Hansen (Adrian Alvarado) and Miller (Paul Rae), are digging foundations in the desert when they discover what appears to be an ax, unfortunately for them an ancient native demon American called The bone-eater comes and kills them. Local Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) soon makes Krantz breathe his neck while the construction of his resort stops, Sheriff Evans also has to deal with the bone-eating demon that kills anyone he meets. . <br /> <br /> You know I consider myself a big fan of the horror and science fiction genre, I certainly do not think my opinion is worth more than anyone else's (unlike many here in the IMDb ...) but please believe me when I say that Bone Eater is the worst feature of the science fiction channel that I've seen and faces a very strong competition. As a fan of horror and science fiction, there are two names that, when they participate in a movie, shake my back, anticipating how bad it will be, those names are: Franco of "I have no talent" of Jesus, who had nothing what to do with Bone Eater and Jim Wynorski, who led the absolute disaster that is Bone Eater. In fact, Bone Eater is so bad that Wynorski hid under the pseudonym of Bob Robertson, when a director as bad as Wynorski hides under a pseudonym who knows that the movie must be bad. Where do I begin? Bone Eater is just the worst movie I've seen this year and it's so bad that it's fake, the story is horrible, the script is careless (at one point Sheriff Evans tells Kia to meet him at the hospital, but when they are there later, he acts surprised and says 'what are you doing here?', at one point Sheriff Evans triumphantly affirms that we are in the 20th century and that the ancient Native American demons do not make sense, although in reality we are in the XXI now, there is a part when a woman tells in a flashback the story in which three men wake up the Bone Devourer and kill them, but since he killed all three of them, how did someone else know it to be transmitted in the legend A bit embarrassing The characters are horrible clich√©s, the little sheriff of the city who saves the day, his daughter gets involved, which increases the personal motivation and, as for the Native Americans, there is a wise old man, a young man or who hates the "white man" and a young woman. Who is the voice of reason between the two who have names like Storm Cloud and Black Hawk? The movie is as boring as hell, nothing happens, the story is horrible, it is full of plots and flaws in any logic, the scenes are terrible, there is no horror or gore or suspense or mystery and Bone Eater is simply The type of movie that makes you lose the will to live. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater has some of the worst CGI computer effects I've seen in a long time, from the stupid creature that eats bones and looks stiff, which is just a selection of bones magically attached to a motorcycle that jumps from a big hole to a horrible CGI truck that crashes on the edge of a cliff to a truck that the bone-seeker throws aside. Every time the bone-eater needs to accelerate a little, it causes a great horse to form from the sand and dust, and he mounts it! In general, this is a pretty good idea, but it looks awful and the scenes even have cheesy cowboy music on the soundtrack. There is a pointless scene at the end when Sheriff Evans cuts off his own arm (why?) And bleeds but, apart from that, there is not a single drop of blood on the thing, every time the bone-eater kills someone usually just disappears. A cloud of dust, boring. The sympathetic climate showdown between Sheriff Evans and the bone-eating must be seen to be believed, Sheriff Evans becomes a native on horseback with tribal war paint on his face while the bone-eater also rides his horse in dust and has a kind of fair. The contest, which is too bad to describe correctly. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of around $ 700,000, Bone Eater was filmed in a very smooth, easy to forget and flat way, there is no sense of style here. Most of the film takes place under sunlight and, if you watch it on a decent TV, the desert landscape is quite pleasant at times. There are several 'known' veteran actors who are really talking here, Boxleitner plays exactly the same role as in the 'Sergo Destacado' of Creature 'Terror of similar theme (2004), William Katt will obviously put his name to any garbage while he is paid while the former Star Trek man, Walter Koenig, must be really desperate to accept appearing in this. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater is a truly atrocious 'creature feature', there's not much you can say about it other than avoiding it well. The worst movie that ever appeared on the Science Fiction Channel and that's saying something, is not it?
