I agree that this movie is too pretentious, and it is not easy to know where it is going. I have taught literature and film for many years, and I consider this film to be one of the most overrated, according to some of the previous reviews. <br /> <br /> However, let me remind you that this is the same director who has L'ora di religione (Il sorriso di mia madre- My Mother's Smile) in his credit: a movie jewel! <br /> <br /> Was he trying to beat Fellini's 81/2 here? The scene with the dogs, which has also been pointed out, is absurd and excessive? just an example Others would take too much space, and some reviewers have already noticed them. <br /> <br /> In general, the most frustrating and annoying experience!
