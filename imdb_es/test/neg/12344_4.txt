The film begins a little interested in the son interested in a teenager of his age. Clayburgh's shy-looking husband dies in a car accident as he prepares to go to Rome and sing like a diva. Matthew opposes but he comes. He connects with the girl again, but this time, Matt is taking cocaine. His superb voice, charming, impetuous mother is in the center of attention. She does not know how to handle Matt's addiction. The film is prolonged in search of a plot. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci may have had his head on the moon while directing the film. The Moon has a great symbolism. <br /> <br /> Save your time. Maybe I'm too generous with 4 *.
