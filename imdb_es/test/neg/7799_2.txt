Surrender Cinema has been known for its extremely erotic, almost explicit science fiction films. While generally doing very well in this (Femalien 1 and 2, Virtual Encounters), this particular entry seems to be just a replay of an old tape. Any number of girls, some recognizable and others not, are in this movie in all the stages of nudity. There are also several other movie clips that are exceptional, unless you've seen those other movies. There are a series of solo nude scenes that do several things: some play basketball, others speak, and others play with themselves. The only thing of value in this film is the last scene: a brief but erotic girl-girl scene with a very enthusiastic and pleasant Sandy Wasko and a more tenuous Tammie Hainum. Not very recommendable
