Perhaps it is time for us to declare 2007 as "The International Year of the Kinematic Crocodile"! The ridiculous "Primitive" came first, on a crocodile named Gustave (!) Who governs the swamps in Burundi. Then there was "Lake Placid 2", a low-profile sequel made for the television of an original that can not be forgotten. Thirdly, there is an incredibly derivative and soporific piece of Australian horror and, finally, I still have to see the promising "Rogue". It is likely that the latter is the best, considering the participation of the next Australian horror talent Greg McLean ("Wolf Creek"). "Black Water" is certainly not a complete waste of time and film, but it is another rather useless survival film that confuses the agony of real life with horror. Forgive my frankness, especially because I honestly feel sorry for the people who went through this terrible experience, but representing three characters sitting in a tree and whining for more than an hour is not my idea of ​​pure suspense. Three young people travel through northern Australia and decide to spend a day fishing in the remote areas of the swamp. It is not long before a gigantic and ferocious crocodile turns its small boat over and devours the guide. Grace, Lee and Adam barely manage to escape the hungry teeth of the reptile climbing a tree. Although it remains invisible most of the time, the crocodile patiently lies in wait and makes it impossible to leave the swamp alive. Yes, it sounds a lot like the "Open Water" plot in fact. Replace the many invisible sharks with a giant invisible crocodile and the open sea with an equally inescapable Australian marsh, and there you have it. Well, "Black Water" at least presents some rare moments of emotion and an impressive designed water monster. It must be said, the crocodile looks fabulously full and eagerly counts every time it leaves the water wildly. The cast of three heads does what it can to keep its characters interesting, but how do you do it by sitting on a tree all the time? The concept based on real events obviously causes a series of restrictions, such as limited images of fantastic shooting locations, dialogues and drawings of friendly characters.
