There was nothing remotely funny in this movie. He mocks several sports movies and cliches, but none of this is remotely fun. Most parodying films do not even fit with the movie and are really just theirs so they can be in it. No, the main actor was fine, but that's really the only good thing about this movie. Also, the various cameos were well seen, but I have no idea why they would waste their time on this piece of garbage. Thank God, I only spent $ 4 on this since it's not worth spending money. Just see if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to lose an hour and 30 minutes.
