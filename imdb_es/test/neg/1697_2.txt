Forced, cloying, formulaic. Do these adjectives make you want to run to rent yours? Miriam Hopkins was brilliant in the original "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde". Some other early films of his, particularly "The Story of Temple Drake," are never shown, but are said to be excellent. <br /> <br /> Here, she is cute, bossy and totally unpleasant. Ray Milland, like a bohemian from Greeniwch Village, is not at all convincing. <br /> <br /> The two performers are creepy and have no relationship with the Village as it was at that time. <br /> <br /> Speaking as a native of Greenwich Village, I find the environment ersatz, generic and fake. It's not like I've been around for a couple of generations, but my relatives were there in 1937. It's not funny. It is not remotely authentic. We do not care about the characters. <br /> <br /> At this time many films were made about the masses in struggle against the capitalists, and they took control of elan. "Easy life" comes to mind. It did not take place in the village. But it sounds very true. This sounds like a thud.
