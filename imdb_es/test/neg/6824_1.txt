Rourke does his usual part, like a sinister, resentful, Neandertalian idiot, fierce and evil, in the same mold as in "Picture Claire," "Out in Fifty," "Get Carter," "Double Team" and the rest of the trash in which it is. <br /> <br /> It has very few lines. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this is just trash, undervaluing Rourke, discouraging him, and it does not matter because of his characterization as an actor. Even so, after seeing "A Prayer ...", "Johnny Handsome", "Barfly", "9 1/2 weeks", "Year of the Dragon", etc., etc., for many years I considered Rourke a outstanding man, intelligent and intelligent. I think it has changed since then. <br /> <br /> It seems insensitive, burned. <br /> <br /> "He left with a grim expression; / Despair lived in his chest / And made man a perfect plague". (Belloc, "The Example"). <br /> <br /> I had absolutely no other reason to see this boring movie, except that Rourke was in.
