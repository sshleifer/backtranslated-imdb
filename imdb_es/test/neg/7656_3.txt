This movie is not a little bad. It is not even a bad thing. It's horrible. You know you're in trouble when Charo appears in a movie. She must have had the free week of "Love Boat". George Kennedy, at least he is a player, he is there trying. Actually, he is fine. And it's good to see Martha Raye. Jimmie Walker is fine. There is a better performance than in Airport '75, but what movie does not have better performance than in Airport '75? One thing I liked about this movie is that there were more things than many other disaster films per plot. At least they made an attempt to sub-parcels. What really hurts this movie are the special effects, ugh! It's not too special if you ask me. This is the kind of movie that at 2 am is really fun if you have fun with your friends and are looking for something to laugh about.
