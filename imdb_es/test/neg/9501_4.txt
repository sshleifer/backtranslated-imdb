The ridiculous story of Underwoods about a young man (Arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas). The film is written ridiculously, the direction is strange, the dialogues are out of place and scrambled, the actors did not do much justice either, Arquette is annoying in everything, Ian Nicholas was non-existent, Macy was decent, but only because it is quite well the actor and probably did everything possible to not leave this project with a totally embarrassing performance, at least it was tolerable. This is a stupid movie in my eyes, boring at times, not entertaining, just a movie I would not recommend to anyone. Rating of IMDb: 5.5, my rating: 4/10
