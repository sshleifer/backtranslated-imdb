I found this film very interesting but a little tired, it talks about violence and what it is doing, I still do not see the point of becoming terrorists to stop the terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and in other countries who justify the use of violence and war tactics because they believe they are right. Think of the Puritans and the Christian crusades against the Islamic people during the medieval era. Much blood and death far exceeding the violence of today, the Western world has had a negative impact on religion. I do not justify their actions, but Western culture in the past has had a very negative effect on some. But they still remember that most of the Islamic people are PEACEFUL! The people of any nation feel some kind of patriotism, but to start a war because of the fact that I am right and that their mistake needs to be rethought. I repeat that you can not stop terrorists from making you like them.
