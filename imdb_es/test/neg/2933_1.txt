Maybe I expected too much from this movie, but at least one comedy should be fun, and it has very few funny moments. It manages to be insulting to homosexuals, heterosexuals, women, the obese, and probably also to other groups. The scene in the graduation where everyone says to be gay is one of the most unpleasant I've seen. <br /> <br /> Tom Selleck and Matt Dillon are ridiculously grumpy and Kevin Kline seems to be confused most of the time. <Br /> <br /> Other critics compare the movie with "Will and Grace", but at least "Will and Grace" _is_ funny.
