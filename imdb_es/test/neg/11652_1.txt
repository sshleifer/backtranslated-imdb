"Snowball Express" from Disney Studios is not as outdated as some of its results from this era. There are no hippies or hot-rodders, only the bored Dean Jones inherits a dilapidated hotel / ski center from a deceased relative. When Jones and his family stop in a quiet town in Colorado, the people who give them instructions (which look like extras from "Deliverance") are curiously vague about the hotel (we hope it looks like a one-room cabin), but in reality The accommodations are very nice. Jones' teenage daughter has a moody expression on her face (which does not stop one of the local Yahoos from glancing at her), and of course the clumsy pop Dean Jones is a regular fool on the slopes, leading to many situations in sleet. Maybe this square scenario could have benefited from some magical whim, since this script is a frozen rigid. * since ****
