"The Italian Job" is a caper film made by numbers. Mounted on the back of each cliché of capers, it does not reach particular heights and will be a footnote at the end of the month. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that "The Italian Job" has no imagination at all. I've seen it all before and I've done better then. The acting is fine, the cinematography is completely acceptable, but this movie does not open any new ground. <br /> <br /> We are going to mark the clichés: <br /> <br /> - "old school" criminal father figure and his protégé <br /> <br /> - another member of the gang that is jealous of the protected <br /> <br /> - a double cross <br /> <br /> - only the bad guys use weapons while the good criminals do not have to <br /> <br /> - the good criminals always mock the bad guys <br /> <br /> And that's about the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even the car chase and chase scenes, supposedly the highlight of the movie, seem quite common. This is especially true, since they appeared in the trailers of the film, so I already knew what to look for. <br /> <br /> For me, a caper movie only works if it has an element of realism, maybe, just maybe, it could be achieved without relying on a deux ex machina or "just because" in the moments. Parts of "The Italian Job" simply throw that out the window, with computers that do things that computers can not do, good ones that do not hit anyone with their driving (especially down the stairs) and no police car responds to the street. Explosions, imprudently driven minis or even a low-flying helicopter. It must be an incredible city so that these things do not qualify an answer. <br /> <br /> The acting is passable, and the crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) is at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is too stinky as the "good guy" hero, while Charlize Theron is almost the only actor called to show some kind of rank. Donald Sutherland is a class act as always and shows Wahlberg's shortcomings in every moment they are together. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a rather uninteresting movie. Given the IMDb ratings, it's the girls who really love this movie, which I can understand to some extent, but there are better caper movies out there, even the vapidity of the recent "Ocean's Eleven" eclipses the non-event that is " The Italian Job ". <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> In the conclusion, take a moment to think about what will happen to the character of Norton. Are we destined to be encouraging the good ones to cause their demise, especially since it seems to be long and painful? He did not deserve that, pretending that it was. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER END ***
