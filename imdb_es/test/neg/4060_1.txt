[WARNING: Some spoilers included, although it's a documentary.] <br /> <br /> I bought this documentary because I like the work of the D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, which include MOON OVER Broadway, STARTUP.COM and THE WAR ROOM., All the incredible documentaries I recommend. Seeing this story, ultimately boring and without vision of the Depeche Mode tour in 1988, I realized that they had nothing to work with when they went to edit this movie together. The members of the band were certainly less than close to the camera; So, no doubt, the contest to add fans to a week-long bus trip was added to cheer things up a bit. Actually, now, I mean, come on. Who thought that a concert movie from a pop synth band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea? Of course, I like the music of Depeche Mode, and Martin Gore writes good tunes, but watching them in concert never seemed to be interesting, and this movie is a positive test. Unless you're a HUGE fan of Depeche Mode, stay away from this documentary ... it's a complete waste of time.
