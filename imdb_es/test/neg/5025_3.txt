Once, Rossini described the work of rival composer Wagner as having "some wonderful moments ... and some terrible quarters of an hour". Inuyasha, apparently, can also be described in this way. It has many great episodes, but among them there are innumerable episodes of filling. The complete series consists of approximately 175 episodes, of which I would say that at least 125 are filler or some kind of secondary argument (I did not bother to count them and I would not be surprised if that number were actually higher). <br /> <br /> Some of these filler episodes are actually quite nice, although many are pretty dull or boring. However, the constant digressions begin to run out after the first few seasons as the plot ends up progressing in a laborious drag during most of the series. The development of the character also slows to a great extent and in recent seasons, the cast has become quite immutable, resulting in increasingly old jokes (particularly those related to the monk, whose ironic features begin to be slightly comical, but they become tired when the jokes are associated with them) appears repeatedly). <br /> <br /> However, all that does not mean that Inuyasha is a bad series. It's just not a big series the way it's generally considered to be Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example. As something that should be seen at the end of a difficult day, it is pleasant, but it can never be confused with high art.
