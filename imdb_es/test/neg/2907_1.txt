A montage prologue, obviously fabricated by the blessed maniacs who actually chose to distribute this, tries to convince us that the comic impact of this amazingly incompetent piece of nothingness is completely deliberate. Do not believe it: this is for Lloyd Kaufman as Andy Warhol for Herschel Gordon Lewis. He is so thorough in his project of torturing his hypothetical audience that it seems a kind of installation of misanthropic denialist art, only that it can not be because he is completely devoid of self-consciousness. As unpleasant and ugly as the "Things" or the "Frozen Scream", this manages to raise the stakes by recycling with a maddening and bald insistence that must be seen to be believed. A Hitchcock-style shooting analysis of, say, the attack on cardio girls can produce twenty editions and perhaps three minutes of images: only the sequence lasts ten minutes! You WANT to believe that this started life as a short topic a little more bearable, except that if you remove the repetition what remains would be much less fascinating: for example. When the "demon" enters the room, he only inspires prolonged, highly apathetic, completely blank looks from his imminent victims (off the screen). Repeat this scenario approximately four times, in slightly varied configurations; Bridge these with perhaps thirty lines of total dialogue; offer actors even more hateful and lethargic than those of the classics mentioned above; and add us with a monster that includes gauze, ketchup and a yellow ear of Spock, and has a film too mind-boggling to reject, a functional definition of bad. I'm proud to own it!
