Experienced actors in this know how to act and have shown it before, but the Director, who also wrote and produced this farce, is incompetent on many levels. IN AGREEMENT. It's low budget, but I know that film students with lower budgets and lesser-known actors can do much, much better. For example, since there were people involved who should know better some of the weapons platforms were totally out of place and never existed in those days. The trick job was clumsy, the story was stale and hokey. If someone gives you a copy of this, use it for a roller coaster. By the way, I love westerns and I've known a lot of stunts and I even went to high school with one of the actors, so I was looking for it to be good.
