I hated it. I hate the pretentious, self-conscious madness that passes for art. This movie is stupidly inane or insanely stupid. After the first half hour, I moved quickly on the DVD version and saw the same juvenile delinquents again and again. I got angry for spending money to make money in the palm trap. Silly dyeing in sepia or blue does not make something become a movie, let alone art.
