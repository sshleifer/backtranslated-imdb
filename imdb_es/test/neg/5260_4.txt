During the bust at the Colton factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats in the head. Survive the wound and then arrest Moses. Dodging Colton's hitmen, the duo must overcome their mutual hatred to survive. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler's films are often a matter of success and error, with his comedies loved by his fans or hated by everyone. This is not as stupid as his other movies, but he still can not get over a lazy script. The direction is incredibly irregular, with fast-paced action sequences that give way to the slowdown of comic exchanges between Sandler and Damon Wayans. Some of the action scenes? Flying a plane without engines, a car chase at night through a forest? they are absurdly devised. Performance is the standard for this genre, with Sandler & Wayans making a good pair. In short, the movie is silly but fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Grade: C + Revision by M. K. Geist
