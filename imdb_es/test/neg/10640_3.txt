*** SPOILERS! *** Sometimes I wonder what makes sequel makers think they have to explain (and therefore destroy) the mysteries behind the iconic Horror movies. The original 1987 "Hellraiser" was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the most terrifying movies ever made. The 1988 sequel "Hellbound" was also a fantastic horror movie, although I personally did not like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites, some of the creepiest horror villains of all time in the original. The third part, "Hell on Earth" (1992) was already quite messy, whose creators obviously thought that it was necessary to add a dose of humor to the previously incomprehensibly creepy lead-censor Pinhead (a typical stupidity of the 90s) and by thus they destroyed most of their fear This fourth part "Hellraiser: Bloodline" (1996) is slightly more atmospheric than the third, but reduces this quality by inventing an even more absurd and completely unnecessary "background information" about the cenobitas and the opening of the doors to hell. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the doors to hell are being made? I think not, and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this movie. The "Bloodline" setting comes and goes in three different periods. The film begins on a space station of the 22nd century, when the scientist Dr. Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) tries to close the doors to hell forever. When government soldiers interrupt his mission, he has to explain his reasons. In the eighteenth century in Paris, the ancestor of Merchant was a toy maker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult. An evoked demon, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful Angelique (Valentina Vargas). Since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it, the bloodline of the toy maker would be cursed and their ancestors would be infested by the cenobites over the centuries ... The movie, which It takes place in the 18th century, Present, and the 22nd century, it really is a disaster. I admit that the part set in the 18th century has a spooky atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film, but it is also its smallest part. The parties established in the present and in the future are quite weak, and are full of stupid and unworthy elements. The strengths of the film, undoubtedly, are the fantastic makeup and gore effects, the dazzling Valentina Varagas as the demon, and Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who, despite losing some of his chill, remains a threat villain. It's an almost offensive idea for "Hellraiser" fans, however, Pinhead is supposed to be defeated by a ridiculous light show. In general, "Bloodline" is not a complete disaster, but it is a sequel unworthy of a series that began so brilliant. Even director Kevin Yagher was obviously embarrassed about that, as he preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee. In general, this is only recommended for Pinhead fans, and most of them will probably be upset by another decrease in the chilling life of their favorite demons. All others are advised to continue with the brilliant and excellent second part of the "Hellraiser" franchise and omit all others. The makeup effects in "Bloodline" are creepy, but almost everything else is disappointing. My score: 3.5 / 10
