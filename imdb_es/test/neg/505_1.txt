Now the infamous Western was (at the time) the biggest budgeted disaster in Hollywood history. I had the "luck" to see the full 220 minute version in a theater in 1990. It was really amazing how bad the movie was! <br /> <br /> They had a great cast, a story based on a real incident. (a fight between foreigners and Americans in the nineteenth century), magnificent landscapes ... and what went wrong? Three words - director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after "The Deer Hunter" that he came out and made this god terribly western. He is not totally guilty. His previous film "The Deer Hunter" was considered a masterpiece and United Artists gave him free rein to do anything. They left him alone ... and everything went wrong. The cost was out of control and Cimino insisted on remaking the sequences again and again until they were perfect. <br /> <br /> First of all, the sound is horrible. They pass whole sequences and you can not distinguish a word from what the characters say. For example, the Jeff Bridges character appears during a dance sequence, but I STILL have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible! That is the director's fault: he should have made sure that the dialogue was heard. Some scenes are shot with so much flying dust that you can barely make out what's happening. The story does not make much sense and Cimino took great liberties with the facts, in the real story, only one person was killed, Cimino turns it into a massacre. There are some certainly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by the lack of history and an incomprehensible dialogue. Also, the bad sound was not the theater's fault, all the impressions sound that way. <br /> <br /> This garbage effectively closed United Artists and was the end of Cimino's career. A textbook example of a director so full of himself that he does not realize what he is doing. Jeff Bridges has said that this is the worst movie he made. This is from a guy who made "Tron"! A definite must visit. <br /> <br /> There is a pretty good book called "The Final Cut" that details the whole disaster. This gets a 1. I would like IMDb to have negative numbers, it deserves it!
