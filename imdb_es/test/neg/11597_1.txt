A group of environmentalists travel to an island to discover a secret laboratory that is experimenting with animals. When they arrive, they discover that they are too late. Apparently, the government had a scientist try his experiment on a komodo and, yes, they guessed it, a cobra that made them grow a lot. I'm not sure that this movie really needed or deserved an explanation, since it's almost identical to Curse of the Komodo that also sucked. The effects of the computer are as caricatural as ever and the komodo roars like a dinosaur that really made me nervous. Like Boa vs. Python, this movie is not worth seeing and it's as fun to watch as nailing your hand to a table. Avoid!
