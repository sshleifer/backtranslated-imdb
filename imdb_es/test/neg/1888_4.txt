It is proof that filmmakers and their financiers who treat their audience with contempt is not a new phenomenon, as it was done in the 1940s and the HOUSE OF Dracula is a great example. One would think that by having a movie with Dracula, the werewolf and Frankenstein's monster, the producer would order the screenwriter to have the three appear in one scene. They had a chance with CASA DE FRANKENSTEIN and then, when they had a second bite of the cherry, they blew it again with CASA DE Dr√°cula. Losing an opportunity is a misfortune, losing two waves of cynical money making <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the producers are beyond care. Larry Talbot appears again despite being shown to have died in the previous film, which sums up the cynicism of the franchise. It also shows how poor the script is and they mistreat us with some terrible turns like Talbot's condition cured by a special type of plant that will soften his skull. I'm thinking that screenwriter Edward T Lowe might have softened his skull if this is the kind of thing he's with <br /> <br /> Director Erie C Kenton can not improve the script and throws a few keys to the For example, Talbot is surprised to see that Dr. Edelmann lifts a car in a car, but observes Edelmann carelessly climbing a wall and jumping into the courtyard of the castle. One can not help but think that Talbot's reaction shots were changed by mistake at the editing stage. <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney Jnr is famous for his roles in horror films, but he did not have a great career out of them. Maybe it's due to the fact that he's not a good actor and here he commits the worst kind of acting: being very clever. However, it is not entirely his fault, because all the characters emit a rather horrible dialogue and are made of wood due in part to the lack of brightness of Kenton. <br /> <br /> HOUSE OF Dracula feels a million miles from the 1931 James Whale film and its sequel since 1935 and would have been a very sad note to finish. But ironically, Universal decided to make one more film to close its franchise with a horror comedy starring Abbot and Costello.
