Based on the true story of two young Americans who sold national secrets to the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, "Falcon And The Snowman" wants to be suspenseful and philosophical, and ends up falling short in both departments. Le Carré is less than who cares. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton plays Christopher Boyce, a former seminarian who, disgusted by Watergate and the values ​​of the middle class around him, is probably the wrong guy to be hired by a company that runs spy satellites for the CIA. Sean Penn plays his drug-trafficking friend, Daulton Lee, who gets Boyce's mail, delivering secret files to the Soviet embassy in Mexico City. An incomparable score of jazz synthesizer, lack of sympathy or emotional attachment for anyone, and many scenes of boys who get angry in the rooms, combine to cushion what could have a thriller about the moral dilemma. <br /> <br /> It's really Penn's movie despite the second billing; his character talks about turkey with the Russians while Hutton plays with his falcon mascot. Hutton seems to have been awakened five minutes before they called "action". With Penn, it's a dice game if you get a brilliant performance or a superior one. Here, it's a bit of both, but more of the latter, especially in the second half when Lee switches from coca to heroin. He shouts. The snorts The festivities of the Russian embassy crash. He is hit with phone books. It spits in a mirror, a great goober that must have been saving for a paparazzi. "I do not know who my friends are anymore!" he screams It's exhausting to just watch him. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to have modeled Lee in some way on Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo from "Midnight Cowboy," complete with too nasal line readings and constant eye change. John Schlesinger directed this film like "Midnight Cowboy," but he seems to have had in mind another Hoffman movie, "The Graduate," throwing up scene after scene of Boyce and Lee by the pool, trying to decide how to live their lives in His golden cage. Too bad nobody suggested plastics. <br /> <br /> From the first shots, the news images of the American decline juxtaposed with Boyce and his bird, "Falcon" makes it clear that it is a film message, although the message itself is far from clear, probably because the characters never focus. Is Boyce supposed to be an idealist? Or is he just a mercenary? Hutton and Schlesinger do not seem to know, which makes it harder for us. Meanwhile, opportunities to establish something of suspense, such as Boyce stealing documents from the secret "Black Vault" where he works or Lee playing with the Russians, are interrupted by cuts in the scenes of the couple with their family and friends. It is the normality of the story that Schlesinger finds interesting, but it is the least interesting aspect for us. <br /> <br /> The good: it's interesting to see a movie that works with the vibes of the 70s as early as this one, referring to María. Muldaur and Tang. Dorian Harewood, memorable in "Full Metal Jacket," has a good turn as Boyce's paranoid colleague, Gene, who shows Boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder, but he has some serious problems of Nam beneath his festive mood. Macon McCalman is also fine in a totally different way as the sensible boss who gives Boyce his high security job. David Suchet, as the official of the Russian embassy that deals with Lee, creates a fascinating mixture of threat and kindness. <br /> <br /> But "Falcon And The Snowman" relies on the issue of the two title characters, and Neither the actors nor Schlesinger are able to exploit many answers. Worse still, after more than two hours in their alternately wild and catatonic company, you really do not want answers. You just want those credits to roll.
