By 1971 it was becoming increasingly obvious that Hammer's film studios were in the process of disappearing. HANDS OF THE RIPPER is a case in which even the idea reeks of despair: the spirit of Jack The Ripper possesses his own daughter! Yes, it's okay, nobody expected a documentary, but this plot seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel in search of a stupid premise and you're wondering why the hell the producers brought Jack The Ripper to the story. Was this to give the movie a quick title? <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not impressive and the cinematography gives the whole movie a cheap TVM sensation, but you know you will not see a classic Hammer horror as soon as the title starts because the music is ridiculously inappropriate I think the composer was trying to make the subject disturbing and moving, but the music looks like something from a romantic movie. I'll give some credit to the cast, since they take their roles seriously in what is far from being a serious movie. <br /> <br /> I did not really enjoy this movie and it instantly reminded me of Phantom Raspberry Blower Of London Town of The Two Ronnies that I had been laughing about in the weeks before I saw this
