"I remember waiting to be born ..." <br /> <br /> "Vision search that was the American West". <br /> <br /> "We went to a psychic ..." <br /> <br /> "I am sure that your first reaction is that she is a cuckoo" <br /> <br /> ". ... the place is delighted ... "<br /> <br />" I think there is another dimension here ". <br /> <br /> An artist (Marta Becket) and her husband many decades ago left the bustle and culture of New York and moved to a city abandoned by the gods with a population of 10 in the Valley of Death . There, they renovated a theater; painting it is a very popular art style. And, once it was over, she began performing dance performances for virtually no one. In many ways, it is reminiscent of Werner Herzog's film, FITZCARRALDO or FIELD OF DREAMS, although AMARGOSA is a documentary of a real person, not a mythical fool like Klaus Kinski or Kevin Costner. Her husband finally leaves, much of that apparently because of the lifestyle she chose. So, today he continues to live with his ten cats and a sanctuary for donkeys, along with his new male partner, Tom. <br /> <br /> What you think about this documentary depends on your perspectives. If you like New Age ideas and are open to these sensitivities, then you are more likely to appreciate the movie. His talk about how he remembers his birth, ghosts, vision missions and psychics frankly made the psychology teacher in me shudder and this would definitely be the case of many people. In addition, its donkey sanctuary and the attempt to preserve horses in the desert will probably attract PETA and many other animal lovers, although with my experience in biology and environmental concerns, I see donkeys and horses as a plague that would destroy the native plants and animals. So in two different versions, I tend to think the opposite of Marta, who is more of a person who "feels" and "feels". Depending on how you feel, all this will surely color your opinions, and I'm pretty sure that most people will think it's a genius or a madwoman. You'll have to guess what I think. <br /> <br /> Now, despite all this, the film is interesting and Marta's life is definitely NOT boring, especially because in recent years, people have really started traveling to the desert to watch her act . There is a defined follow-up for her and her unusual little world. While it would not be as positive as most of the reviews, I can not be as negative as the only review, since there is a definite merit for this strange documentary. I like movies about unusual people and Marta is certainly unusual! I also appreciate your love for your art and your happy life, that is a rare gift. <br /> <br /> I teach psychology in an arts school and it would be interesting to show this to the staff, where I'm pretty sure we would get a strong positive and negative reaction to the movie, probably depending on whether the teachers taught the classes of art or the basic curriculum! By the way, it would be interesting. <br /> <br /> By the way, and I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but when Marta's husband was having affairs, with whom did this happen? After all, they lived in the middle of nowhere and left me wondering where I would find companions. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you would like to see her act and / or stay with her hotel, you can find her at www.amargosaoperahouse.com/. The site is in English, French and German and the hotel rates are quite reasonable, as are the prices of the tickets.
