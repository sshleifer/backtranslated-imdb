If pulp fiction and Get shorty did not exist, this could be a good movie. When I say this, I want to say that nothing in this movie is its own, unless it is another bit of terrible dialogue or a complete cliché scene. All the lines like 'i will not say more than what I have to say if' it seems that Short 'seems to appear in this trash sequel, all cameos like Steven Tyler act terribly and are not necessary, and as for Christina Milian , do not get me started. .Slightly, some of the best actors and actresses like John Travolta and Uma Thurman seem to be trying to be wrong with children and hip and have almost ruined their reputation because of this movie and, frankly, I think the best performance is The rock who plays along with one of my less favorite actors, Vince Vaughn. The man tries to be funny with him, taking the mickey of how rappers talk apparently. The actor, the actor and Andre 3000 perform another terrible double act {I personally think that the background actors were better than Cedric an Andre and the only fun part of the performance of Cedric, Andre and the rest of the gang is not the way that there are pants up to the knees so that I can clearly see the boxers and the only reason I find this is funny because a lot of people really do that. So, in conclusion, this film tries to be funny and fails miserably, does not have any new material, comedy or freshness, since it copies all the other movies and, finally, the only reason why I should see it is if I want to compare the bad which is with its brilliant predecessor. Get in short. Oh, yes, I forgot to mention that there is a big cliché at the end.
