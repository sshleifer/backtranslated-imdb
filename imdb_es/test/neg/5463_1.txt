First, the title has no relevance to the film. He started well with good development, but was upset when he could not tell his girlfriend what had happened. Even his attempt to tell the police failed, which increased the value of the annoyance. There were too many pregnant breaks in the movie that seemed more like a filling than anything worthwhile. The plot never revealed who did this crime, although a good plot would have allowed the disclosure. The ending was nothing less than "hey, we have run out of budget, let's stop here NOW!" ... If I had written a novel that ended in this way, I would get over it. THE TRASH THE TRASH THE TRASH !!
