I agree with all the comments published so far: this film was a waste of time and energy, both for the spectators and for those who made it. Terrible CGI, horrible script, stupid and good plot, the scene is Alabama but it looks like California. But the worst thing has to be the point of view of Native Americans, which captures all the stereotypes you can imagine, from the boss surrounded by the smoke, the angry warrior, the people who speak without using contractions ("Do not do this! "), Native American pipes playing in the air, etc. It just shows such disrespect and understanding that I was ripping my hair out. A Native American with a hint of self-esteem would have thrown his TV out the window at this junk. So to finish, I would say that this movie is an offense for everyone.
