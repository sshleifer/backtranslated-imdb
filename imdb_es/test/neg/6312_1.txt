This movie has some of the worst performances I've seen in my life. The performance of Dennis Quaid was the caliber of the high school. While it is difficult to portray a character off the wall as Jerry Lee Lewis, it can be done. Just ask Jamie Foxx (although Ray Charles had more depth in his personality and musical expertise than Lewis ever dreamed of owning). The Phillips brothers' portrait belonged to The Dukes of Hazzard, and Alec Baldwin playing Jimmy Swaggart is a bit like Donald Duck playing Shakespeare. When Robert Duvall played a preacher in the country, I bought it. Baldwin never made me believe a single word. The part of Wynona Ryder was the best, and she was mediocre. (And can anyone find out how he was 13 years old when Lewis met with her and still 13 more than a year later?) Some online checks reveal that the essential facts presented by the film were true, at least not more complicated than most from Hollywood. bio pics This movie did badly at the box office, and I should have done it.
