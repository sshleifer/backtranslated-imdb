It's a shame to throw a good idea. The main idea of ​​the film is to travel to past lives that, fortunately, is not a journey in time, but a journey within man that has nothing to do with the past or the future. (Maybe they should not be called past lives at all in the movie now that I think about it ... Another disadvantage, I suppose). Everything is in the present, in a different space ... Very interesting without causing much religious anguish. <br /> <br /> However, the music is totally repetitive, melodramatic, sentimental and out of place (not to mention "western"!). There should have been more variety and more reflection on where there should be music and where it should not be, the flashback romantic scenes take up a lot of space and runtime and are totally unnecessary, the acting is not bad, although the language has prevented me from understanding better. <br /> <br /> I think the idea needed a Little more reflection, development and development The internal scenes could have had a better background configuration because in many cases they seem unreal ... In general, I would say that this film leaves much to be desired ...
