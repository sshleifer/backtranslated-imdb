I really do not understand to whom this film is directed. For the absurdity of this, not to mention the ridiculously bad acting, the cheesy dialogue and the fact that the villain is a child, I assume it was supposed to be a children's movie ... but I think there may be more swear words That Pulp Fiction, not to mention the constant references to drugs and chaos and murders in general, then, what demography are you trying to please? This film is too schizophrenic, like trying to combine country music with heavy metal, in the end nobody will like it because it is a bloody paradox. I would recommend this movie because it's very funny (in a bad way), except that the actors are so obviously unbearable that I would not want to suggest otherwise. <br /> <br /> I'm completely serious when I say I could not see more than 15 minutes of this. Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiible
