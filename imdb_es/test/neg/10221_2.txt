The first animation of Stop Motion seemed intriguing to me and the action, mostly live, cuts with the girl in any country where I kept my interest, but the other 11 odd short did not really interest me or make me think about anything in all. The music and the 8 mm images seemed so random that everything seemed random. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you see it for free. <br /> <br /> As for the music being so in step that it was not found either. I rented the DVD because I thought everything was stop motion animation or SMA mixed with live action and only the first short film was SMA, the second had a small stop motion mixed with action mostly live. There were paper things cut into one, and the rest were outdoor shots of an 8mm camera with the music bed. It just did not have any meaning for him to see.
