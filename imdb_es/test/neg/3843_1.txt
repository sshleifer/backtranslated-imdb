Actually I joined this site just to write about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie appeared on one of the local channels. I did it about an hour before I simply had enough. With curiosity to see what the general public thought about this movie, I looked for it on this site. I was very surprised to see that there was an overwhelming number of people who thought it was great. I needed to give my opinion, and here it is: This movie is absolute trash. It was a chore to sit down. The "jokes" were not inspired by others, better shows and movies, and Leguizamo's maniacal description of this detestable character should only appeal to ten years or less. That can actually be a stretch even for that age. I am in favor of ridicule, but there is not even the slightest hint of wit or intelligence. I have an idea, let's take obvious bad jokes without inspiration and reproduce them at twice the speed. Now that's funny. Say ah. Ha. <br /> <br /> Movies you should see that take a silly humor and add a comical moment and originality: A night in the Marx Brothers' opera, The meaning of life in Monty Python, South Park: More Big, Longer, and Uncut, ... and the list goes on. Do not waste an hour and a half of your life in unmemorable shit. <br /> <br /> By the way, I can only assume that the reason why David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little in the movie after this movie is because he was instantly on the blacklist. I am really impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover after this disaster.
