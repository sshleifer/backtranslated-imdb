I do not know where to start. Dragon Hunt could be the worst movie in film history. Even Anus Magilicutty was better than this, as it was intentionally bad. Showgirls? No, it had kitsch value and technically it was a well made movie. But Dragon Hunt takes the cake and eats it, then vomits it and feeds it to a homeless man. It is a great parody. <br /> <br /> The performance, if you can call it that, is rough. It does not have the charm of improvised performance, so it must have scripts, but it is recited with an almost malicious tone of poor quality. Several lines were delivered in a way that shows the actors (or basically, the people on screen) who regretted being connected to this movie or who were thinking of a particularly fun Saturday Night Live joke, which they had seen before put yourself in front of the Chamber. I could write another three paragraphs about the quality of the performance in this movie, but you and I do not want to hear it. <br /> <br /> Makeup and special effects (which, with most movies, is the only good thing) was ridiculously bad. The antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous that I do not remember it, has a Mohawk stuck to the top of his head. Yes, close to the head. And you can also see that it is stuck, if you look at the place where it is with its marked skull, you can see a strip of plastic, not like those of the false eyelashes. Fortunately, it is practically the only example of non-us makeup in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is also a terrible character development, to put it lightly. The women, who are strangely mistreated by the supposedly benevolent ugly brothers (and I mean, they are really mistreated), are not only ugly, but ... panting ... they do not know what they are doing! In one scene they light their apparent lovers, they unite with the even uglier guy and then snort a little cocaine. Apparently, they managed to put some really good cocaine, because they started shaking and laughing YET, even before everything went up the nose. Great girls of the moment! Also, they wear really horrible clothes, clothes that belong only to the late 80s and early 90s. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie, this movie, this movie waste, I should say, is also a waste of time. Seeing it will hurt you and require the suspension not only of your belief, but also of your entire brain. If you want to drug with your friends and laugh a little, see if you can get this movie (you'll probably have to download it) otherwise, do not even think about it. I hope I have been helpful.
