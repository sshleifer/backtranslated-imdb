... and now I'm up to episode # 7. I was hoping it was all over (not to say that it was canceled, once everything related to the show, including the actors, had been thrown together with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere, never to see it again), because this series is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Having this program listed under the genre of 'comedy' is, at best, misleading! It's so hard to believe that Ben Elton could write something so bad, maybe this points to a lot of comments from other writers on everything that has been related before. In some episodes, I have not even laughed once! <br /> <br /> Oh, and I can not believe that Ardal O'Hanlon actually stopped doing 'My hero' and started doing this instead, his decision-making skills were obviously damaged that day, maybe he simply can not read, and did not realize how poor the scripts of "Blessed" were. Do not get me wrong, 'My Hero' is not a masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> And just to annoy me even more, I bet this will be released on DVD as well, when there are so many great TV series that do not premiere.
