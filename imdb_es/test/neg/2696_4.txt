This is one of those wonderful martial arts movies that start with two tough gang members who clash in a park; and when the deal goes wrong and the battle begins, it turns out that everyone knows karate and kung fu! The always wooden Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, inexperienced, good cop, this time in Los Angeles. She and her fellow police officers are trying to break a counterfeit ring, and when the plot is exhausted, the story simply changes to something else, and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a rich and great looking magnate. Within the obvious budget of the movie, obviously, there is some helicopter action, some speedboat, some car chases, a fight in which Cynthia hits everyone in a country-western bar, some scenes of swimming pools with bimbos in Thong bikinis, and a surprising Good chase on horseback. Approximately a dozen and a half policemen are shot to death. There are many twists in the plot that simply do not make any sense; Do not worry about them (And counterfeit currency is a federal crime, where's the FBI? I guess they were too busy). The choreography of the fight was performed by Cynthia Rothrock's co-star, Richard Taylor, whose elegant and witty presence in front of the camera. Frankly I would have made this a better movie. She also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and frankly she could use it; she seems tired and bored, and she does her best performance in GUARDIAN ANGEL when she is playing in front of a pet dog to whom she gives drunken monologues. The dog almost overcomes it! She also wears some of the scariest garments that any leading lady ever wore in any movie: the baggy loose pants with pale areas washed with acid over each buttock were the most shocking. The other actors are all over the map. You can imagine many of the minor characters that are cast in this way: "Hey, me and other guys that I know are going to be in a movie, do you want to be in it too? No, friend, I mean it!" Then there are the professionals of slumming: the most fun is Lydie Denier, the impressive French model and veteran of "Red Shoe Diaries", "Baywatch", "Melrose Place", and of playing many, many other variations of the sexy French bomb; here she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in BAISEZ-MOI or in an episode of "Alias" and not a direct trash to the cable like this one. There is also the tall, dark and handsome Daniel McVicar, now a regular on "The Bold and the Beautiful," John O'Leary, who has played a worthy elder in dozens of movies and comedy episodes and does it here again, and Aharon. Ipale, the veteran Arab character actor perhaps better known as "Pharaoh Seti" by THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals, GUARDIAN ANGEL should be the most ridiculous entry in their curriculums. I gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters, who are enthusiastic students of martial arts, both like to see a woman kick her ass and have big action scenes for a change. They are still too young to worry about what is really a low quality image, and they just enjoyed cheering for Cynthia while doing the kicking, kicking and fighting. If you like this kind of movie, you can probably enjoy it at that level.
