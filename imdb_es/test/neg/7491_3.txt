The cast of class C and the scenes with a poor transition, along with a terrible performance, have also led me to believe that this would be a good launch for television, like the FX presentation of a smallpox outbreak. However, in my local box office success, about 9 copies are stored on the shelves, none of which was checked when I rented the title (I wonder why ...) Anyway, this title was almost ridiculous in the "factor of fear" of the director went by All the "count of deaths" at the bottom of the screen completely contradicted the plot sometimes, as when the helicopter traveled Angola, and the toll was accelerated at a dizzying pace of 23 million 24. However, as the movie ends, (possibly several hours or even a day or so after the helicopter has landed) the death toll counter is also reset what it was at the time the helicopter was approaching the area. The films ended up leaving a great set in the whole plot, and God knows that nobody is waiting for the sequel. Anyway, do not rent this, I only advise you to see it if you have obtained the title without monetary loss, and you are in the mood for a corny movie.
