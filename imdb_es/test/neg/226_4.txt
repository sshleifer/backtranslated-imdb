"Fool for Love" is one of the several films now forgotten that Robert Altman directed throughout the eighties. This, a screen adaptation of a play by Sam Shepard that presents Shepard in the lead role, is just not very good. Altman made many not very good films throughout his fascinating career, and many times the fault was his. But here I think that Shepard is to blame for writing such a weak work. Altman's management is assured, the performances are o.k. taking into account what the actors have to work with, but this inconsequential script does not lead anywhere and it takes time to get there. <br /> <br /> Shepard is Eddie, a specialist who has a love / hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger). The two fight endlessly over the course of a night in a dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) who may be a figurative or literal father to Eddie and May watches in silence. Randy Quaid completes the cast of four people as a calling gentleman. <br /> <br /> The only dramatic hook in the whole plot is the suggestion that Eddie and May's relationship is incestuous. However, this hook feels more like a trick than nothing. The script does not explore your relationship in detail, and does not use your relationship to explore more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric and educated characters that become irritating in the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but they provide feedback. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie is especially bad, when the stories of Eddie and May begin to play in a flashback on monotonous, somnolent voice-overs. <br /> <br /> Mark this until another Altman experiment went wrong. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
