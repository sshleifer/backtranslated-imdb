This film with good production values ​​presents secrets and how friends use each other. Henry May Long is an article from the beginning of the century, very well acted, with little light and depressing, about a friendship between a seriously ill man and a debt-ridden and melancholy addict. The dramas of drawing rooms are not my cup of tea, and all the crying fades. Recommended if you like the independent, astutely intellectual and ivory-style Merchant features. <br /> <br /> I suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimate that it did not really have the emotional impact of 'Brokeback Mountain'. It presents a good script with a scene that explains how to disappear in life, but it is really a dark and depressing movie.
