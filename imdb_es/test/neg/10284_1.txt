The annoying hosts do not bother me, nor do I bother the cynical and honest stance that the creators of this shit shit. <br /> <br /> What bothers me is that the vast majority of episodes are fake. I would not even be surprised if ALL the episodes were staged. Therefore, this is not a reality show, but something even worse than Oprah: trash television with zero zero point. Like the daily television soap opera, but with more action and struggle and less plot. <br /> <br /> The premise would have been great, if only it had been executed without deceiving the spectator. If only this idea was free of all the legal complications / pitfalls that would surely arise due to what would happen to real people, and what would eventually be transmitted. Therefore, the only way to create this "" reality show "" is to get some desperate actors and make them improvise (and what most unfortunate and unconvincing improvisation is most of the time!). Should not it be obvious to someone who finished elementary school? Most of the criticisms I read here do not even mention that none of this is false, much less that everything could be. Illusory thinking or ingenuity without limits? <br /> <br /> The actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of unemployed actors who are miserably waiting at the tables, eagerly awaiting the call of a talk show (or this crap), which is when they finally have the opportunity to earn several hundred dollars. I even recognized an actress (in the role of "cheat") that I saw years before on "The Jerry Springer Show". And I only saw 6-7 episodes of "cheaters". How many more of these losing actors appear in Springer and "Cheaters" that I do not even know? <br /> <br /> However, comparing "Cheaters" with Springer is not fair to the latter. The Springer show is not all false; Most episodes are not on stage, therefore, they are often very entertaining. You can not find any value in "Cheaters", unless you are an actor with problems and want to get advice on how NOT to act in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Producers use several (very cheap), transparent tricks to create the illusion of reality, to give their images that elusive documentary feel. But everything is in the vein. In the end, the smartest spectator looking for train accidents sits on his haunches. "Professional wrestling" has more credibility than this.
