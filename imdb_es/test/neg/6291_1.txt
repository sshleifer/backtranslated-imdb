The film is an adaptation of a Japanese story by respected author Yukio Mishima. It just does not make the transition to a credible story about British and Americans. <br /> <br /> The story moves slowly, especially in the part where Miles and Kristofferson separate and the director fills up with the clich√© images of a ship's bow cutting the waves and the small line of route that fills in the maps, while your letters are overdone. The film moves so languidly that I even advanced through the scenes of sex and masturbation that, although they are long, are not really passionate or erotic. The film gained some notoriety when Kristofferson's then wife divorced him for extracurricular activities with Miss Miles during filming. I guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it's not the same for a viewer. <br /> <br /> There are no characters to cling to. The sexually frustrated widow is unpleasant, the little boy is detestable. Kensofferson is kind enough, but does not have the acting skills to contribute much to the role, although we may not want to get too involved with him, considering his final destiny. <br /> <br /> As for the child, well, he falls in love with a large crowd after his father dies, and they help him plan some evil against the man who enters his mother's life. Now this is a very bad crowd. They do not just steal and smoke drugs, nosireebib. They slide a mickey to a cat and vivisect it. This is shown in bloody detail. But, of course, this is just practice so they can do the same with Kristofferson! <br /> <br /> Therefore, the film mostly moves slowly, with no characters to relate to, and when something happens, it is relentlessly morbid. <br /> <br /> The ending is as unsatisfying as any movie you will ever see. <br /> <br /> All this could have made some sense if the location and the Japanese cultural context had been preserved. As it is, it is simply abysmal. <br /> <br />
