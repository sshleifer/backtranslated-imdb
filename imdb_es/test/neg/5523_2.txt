Each year, the company called Nu produces a couple of "action-packed" movies, "full of suspense." This little nugget, called Shadowcaster III (until I visited this site, I was not sure it's a complete trilogy), is a great example of the good work the company is doing. Frank Zagarino is as petty as ever and does a great job as a schizophrenic (?), Almost indestructible (?) Android. I will not waste any more words, since I do not want to reveal the big plot and ruin a couple of great laughs. <br /> <br /> 2/10 rating (Revard for those hard working technicians) Man, putting together this kind of garbage should be a disturbance.
