The plot of the film seems to have been constructed from a disconnected dream. There is not enough realism to maintain the interest of the spectator. The Vermont Farm scene was a failed opportunity to show how the farms were established and how the farm families lived, which would have been interesting and entertaining. There was little or no research on the whiskey smuggling trade of the time. The costumes of the Canadians seemed something of the French Revolution, totally incredible. The violin game was good and of the time, but the movements of Chris while playing supposedly were incredible. The appearance of the owl was a mystery never explained and the train that disappeared in the air was too much. I could not understand how a live trout was frozen in the ice and why two men in the desert without food would release the trout, a good source of food.
