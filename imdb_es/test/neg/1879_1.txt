Chronicle of a breakfast combines the worst defects of Mexican cinema, a rare feat today. <br /> <br /> He's pretentious: he wants us to believe he's deep, just because one scene is out of focus, another is pseudo-surreal, but another play plays with the Eisenstein-Infante-Caifanes tradition of laughing faces and they cry, the edition is fragmented and everything is very solemn. <br /> <br /> It has a weak script: the main story is barely developed, so it has three other smaller and unnecessary stories, stuck in it. They are just good at making the movie last longer. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is bad. A real feat, considering that many of the best-known Mexican actors were chosen. <br /> <br /> There is an abuse of unnecessary rude language. To the point that the character of Paloma, which symbolizes the dreams of freedom of a child, uses it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> He is homophobic. The character played by Eduardo Palomo is the saddest and most punished representation of a transsexual that I have seen. <br /> <br /> It's very boring. I ended up envying the people who left the theater before the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever you try, it has been done better, in Mexico and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> In other words: "To split your mother, nothing like a bad movie"
