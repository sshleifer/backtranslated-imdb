It's too nice to call this a "fictional" account of Barker's band. They had the right names, but that's it. <br /> <br /> Russell is still fashionable, I'll grant it, but this is not the real Ma Barker, who basically cared for children cooking and cooking. Help when they moved across the country, not planning or participating in the crimes. I think it would have been much more interesting to present the real story of a middle-aged woman involved in the criminal activities of her children and her friends. <br /> <br /> I also have to agree with the reviewers who found that the shooting scenes were totally incredible. The victims of Barker / Karpis were a combination of innocents and law enforcement officers chasing them, but they definitely did not cut half a dozen FBI agents every time they were cornered. (On the other hand, as it has been related in several recent books, the FBI of that time emphasized the idea that the agents came only from legal or accounting backgrounds, to the extent that many agents had little experience in complying with the law Agents trained that we imagine today <br /> <br /> But the worst sin of all is that the movie is basically a bore.Nobody changes, nobody grows.We know that the end of the road is by come, we just do not know what shooting will be. <br /> <br /> Only for Russell fans.
