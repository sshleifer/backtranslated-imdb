I wanted to see this movie, it seemed that someone who had seen it loved it. I was completely disappointed. The performance was so exaggerated. The script seemed that the writer had gathered 25 different scripts from several films and randomly chose the dialogue and had put them together to form a plagiarized script. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: Was any clich√© omitted from this movie? There was a coup of style, homosexuality, prostitution, a serial killer, a fire, numerous aspiring sponsors, the main character in love with the prostitute, the bandage, police torture, mutilations in the style of Hannibal Lechter, and I could go on and on . <br /> <br /> The line is like (the sponsoring godfather of the prostitute) <br /> <br /> - "Ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (I do not want you to work anymore) <br /> <br / > - "Ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek?" (Who would pay the rent if he did not work) <br /> <br /> Unrealistic scenes: we never saw a single policeman during the serial killer scenes, but when the main character disappeared, his father was arrested by the police. and tortured for weeks. <br /> <br /> The only way I can make sense of this whole movie is if the version I had scene was edited severely from the original. I definitely do not recommend it, and I would very much like to discuss it more thoroughly with anyone who wants to do it. <br /> <br />
