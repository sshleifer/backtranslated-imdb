In the cartoons it is shown that the ants are capable of carrying chicken legs, watermelons, people, etc. This can be an admirable characteristic because the ants carry the Phase IV film. This is not because they want to, but because they have to. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a narrator who explains cryptically that some cosmic event has occurred on Earth and that a fellow scientist has been working on the effect that this disturbance has on the ant population. The movie is divided into segments; the first part after the cosmic event is Phase I, and so on until the end of the movie, which is Phase IV. <br /> <br /> What is Phase IV? Who knows? We did not see that part; Presumably, it has something to do with the connection of one of the scientists who study the ants and a girl who lived in the area. The girl, who looks like a cross between Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler, is angry at the ants because they killed her horse, but with the exception of an angry outburst, she surrounds the biodome with a blank look ("Clueless"?). <Br /> <br /> These ants are very intelligent; Or the scientists are pretty stupid. I will give credit to the ants. Why? Anything that usually ruins my picnics that can then build reflecting towers, pop trucks and adapt to the poison with the greatest of ease gets my vote to be the smartest species, at least in this movie. <br /> <br /> Sterno says stepping on this anthill. <br /> <br />
