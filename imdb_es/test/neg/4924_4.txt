The noise and the atmosphere that this film has, but also the impression that I have just seen. Raymond Massey provides a relaxed Sherlock Holmes, almost comically in the first scenes with his bathrobe, which changes for a worker's outfit to investigate the creepy mansion of Dr. Rylott (Lyn Harding). What was not clear to me was why Rylott would have wanted his stepdaughters to die. If, as in the case of Helen (Angela Baddeley), he did not want her to escape to get married, she would have achieved the same if she had been sent. <br /> <br /> Other curiosities abound as well. After setting an early date for the wedding with Helen, the bride will no longer be heard during the rest of the photo. The presence of a gypsy band at the time of Violet Stoner's death provides merely a detour, and what could have been an interesting murder tool, a poisonous snake, is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra, Despite the Indian servant's musical interpretations. <br /> <br /> Athole Stewart competently interprets Holmes's assistant, Dr. Watson, though he takes time to get used to it if Nigel Bruce is more his cup of tea. Like Rylott, Lyn Harding is sufficiently threatening, a trait that would be well used as Professor Moriarty de Nemesis de Holmes in two later films: "The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes" of 1935 and "The Murder in the Baskervilles" of 1935. <br /> With repeated bites and an unstable camera, it is surprising that the story line is no longer interrupted than it is. Its integrity is generally maintained, even if one stretches a bit to fill in the gaps. I guess that would be my main complaint with the movie, since mentally overcoming some of the jump cuts in the image proved to be a real pain in the asp.
