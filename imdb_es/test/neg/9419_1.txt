I had the dubious opportunity to see this movie on television. It is the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst movies ever made. Not only the acting and the effects are bad, the film has more logical holes than ten pounds of Swiss cheese imported. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie as an example of how NOT to make a film and what director not to use in one of your own. <br /> <br /> I turned off the television for the last ten horrible minutes of the program. Calling it "pathetic" is a gross understatement.
