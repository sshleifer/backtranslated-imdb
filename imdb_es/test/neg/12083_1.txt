This movie had potential. If it had been handled differently. What I needed was a different director. That's true And maybe a different protagonist. I just can not understand the character of Minnie Driver, or at least how she played it. She was completely incredible. I can not believe that she would also have liked her performance in this movie. It was probably abandoned by the principal or unable to deliver what the principal was trying to make her do. I'm writing this while I'm still seeing it. I'm thinking that I would have hated being in their shoes trying to "act" something I did not understand. Well, we just moved on to the issue that she starts with the son (I'm still watching). Now I am beginning to feel deeply embarrassed by all involved in this company. If you like to watch movies that lose their big mark, then look at this one.
