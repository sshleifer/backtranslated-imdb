Documentary that aims to examine science fiction films from the 1950s and how they affected (and reflected) America. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron are interviewed and Mark Hamill narrates. <br /> <br /> Pretty terrible. The "ideas" that are given are nothing new, for example, the Cold War and the threat of nuclear war affected an entire generation of children. Well-duh! They try to cover all the different subgenres of science fiction films of the 1950s: the great films of errors, the invaders of space films, etc. That's good, but they choose the most obvious movies and have been analyzed to death already. It was great to see clips from "Rocketship XM", "Destination Moon", "Forbidden Planet", "The Thing" and "The Day the Earth Dtood Still", but everything the directors said was so incredibly obvious for any viewer that is insulting. Even though it is less than an hour, I was completely bored for 30 minutes. This gives a 2 to some of the clips, but nothing more.
