Being a member of the American service, believe me when I tell you that this movie in no way accurately reflects the emotional state of our soldiers / sailors / aviators / marines returning from the deployments. <br /> <br /> That said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is a big clich√© stack. Acting as horrible (with the exception of the girl) the character's backgrounds are weak and ridiculous, and the plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I made an IMDb account to warn anyone with a half brain of it. <br /> <br /> Canadian writer / director Francesco Lucente should feel very, very, very embarrassed about this movie. If you do not agree with US foreign policy UU., You must write a letter to the US government. UU., Do not punish the whole English-speaking world with a monumental shit movie.
