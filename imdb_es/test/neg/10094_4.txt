In short, the film is about a gang war in the 1950s. Leon, the leader of the Deuces, starts the gang after his brother OD is in "trash". He swears to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the rival gang just got out of prison and wants revenge. <br /> <br /> The movie really did not do it for me. The "good guys" were no better than the "bad guys". There was very little to suggest that the Deuces really cared about the community. I suppose the writers went for realism here, but I just did not care which side won. None of the characters was nice, not even able to draw my sympathy. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the relationship between Annie and Bobby had an agile dialogue, and the overall performance was well done.
