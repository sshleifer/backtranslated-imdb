The actors can not act. Every dialoague was plagued by bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression ... NEVER. <br /> <br /> History is nothing new at all. A street child gets involved in a professional dance world and turns his life around. that, along with the whole incident that involves the little boy, is taken directly from You Got Served and Save the Last Dance (I'm not saying that those movies were good either, but this movie did not bring anything new to the table). ). <br /> <br /> and the dance ... THERE WERE ONLY 3 SEQUENCES OF DANCE THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE AND 2 OF THEM WERE TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE COMMERCIAL. Maybe I'm being too critical because I'm a dancer, but maybe that's what you need to hear. Channing Tatum is NOT in any way a b-boy. His little solo in the parking lot had little style, technique or any surprise factor, all of which is part of the criteria of a street dancer. All the jazz and ballet in the film had nothing to offer except bad technique and some acceptable turns, but nothing more. the grand finale left me thinking "... OK, now they will get serious" until the end, when I realized that it was never going to happen. <br /> <br /> I admit that im sure it's hard to make a good dance movie, but Step up is no exception to the rule. You Got Served, with the exception of its inconsistencies with the culture of street dance, at least it had the appearance of dance. Save the Last Dance was trash, and so was almost any musical of the last 10 years (although I was impressed by Moulin Rouge) ... look Center Center for Ballet, watch Beat Street for Hip-Hop
