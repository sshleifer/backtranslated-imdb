Do not take this movie seriously, fix it to some people who want to play Mystery Science 3000 and you will probably laugh. The evil guys are not scary, it's funny, it's like a seventh grade guy with a sickle in a scarecrow. The acting is hilarious. I love the occasional car torture with a bad horror movie and this really made me laugh. I recommend it on that basis. Of course, recreational drugs will improve the experience. Oh, there's a nude group swim scene, which will allow some stardust in the 5-star system. The black male token is seriously injured, but continues joking and uses the injured body part quite easily. Enjoy this complete and absolute disgrace for the movies.
