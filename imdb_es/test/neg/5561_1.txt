Another try, another lady. France may be condemned for not being able to produce a good horror movie. I mean ... the least they could do was shoot the film in the Broc√©liande forest, but even the forest is fake! He was shot near Paris! The subject is useless, the actors are really insignificant and the text makes you want to be deaf. Nothing could save him. <br /> <br /> Bad ... to the bone. I was not warned. I want my money back.
