This movie was SO stupid. I could not believe what I was seeing when I was looking at her, it was like a big train crash. I could not look away because it was SO horribly horrible! I can honestly say that I have never seen anything so bad in my entire life. It was so cheesy and the acting was so unfortunate that I kept thinking "this just has to be kind of a joke, right? No one would really make a movie so horrible on purpose, right?" I really hope this is just a bad joke and these people do not really expect people to see this seriously, and I really hope that the people who were in this movie were acting so terribly on purpose and not believing. What are good actors ?! However, drag queens are pretty fun to watch, and so are the kitschy special effects of a bad sci-fi movie of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Just look at this if you've seen all the other movies in The first thing is existence and there is nothing left to see! I would give this one a "0" if possible.
