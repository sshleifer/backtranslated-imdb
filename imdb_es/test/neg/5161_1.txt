This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Thank God I saw it for free. I would have hated to spend my money on him. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is no character in the movie that is in any way pleasant. Michael Caine approaches, but even he is quite defective. The rest of the "commands" are composed of disgusting ex-cons. There are two gay Arabs, and three guys who are trying to rape a Red Cross nurse, and the "leader" who has no problems sending his men to kill him so he can escape. <br /> <br /> The "mission" is something of suspense. They are to blow up a dumpster. It sounds exciting, right? Well, the images follow them through endless sandstorms and fixing tires. Yes, you read it well. The "suspense" is if they will run out of spare tires. Actually the MIRAMOS change something like 12 floors on the road. That's how incredibly exciting this movie is. <br /> <br /> They arrive at the fuel tank to discover that it is a decoy. Therefore, nothing to exploit. And at this moment, for some very complicated reason, the British Army decides that they no longer need these guys, and tells the Germans their whereabouts to kill them. <br /> <br /> So, at least now, will I have an exciting race to freedom? No, instead, they decide to fly a different fuel tank, to create a deviation. But, when they enter the place, they activate a travel cable, and the Germans come to look for them, shouting their names through a loudspeaker. <br /> <br /> I really miss it. If the Germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they let them get completely into the dumpster before launching the "trap"? Instead, they wait until they enter the fuel tank and set all their charges. Yes. Right. That would happen. <br /> <br /> Then, they blow up the dumpster, the leader sells all his men, except Michael Caine, since he was offered $ 2000 to return him alive. <br /> OK ... then, the men are all betrayed and killed, and Michael Caine and Nigel Davenport survive. The British troops come with tanks, and decide to go rescue. As they wear German uniforms (they used them to blow up the dumpster), they stick a white flag around a stick and hit the road. <br /> <br /> A British guy walks behind them and gives them machine guns. to dead. Roll credits <br /> <br /> Yes. The two "Heroes" of the film die due to a random act of violence. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if the movie suddenly ran out of budget and decided: "That's a wrap, kill them and let's go home." I lost 2 hours of my life watching this movie tired, unimaginative and totally unrealistic that ended with the grace of a bomb.
