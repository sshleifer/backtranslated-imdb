This movie was terrible. You could not move fast enough to get to the end of this movie. It was reduced to the last 20 minutes of the movie and I literally pushed the eject button right in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst movies I've experienced. Worse than all the Dean Cain movies combined. For starters, the performance was terrible. I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivors, but one would think that any television experience would have given them a bit more talent. The films, another main problem, were the visual effects and the poor quality of the film. In the defense of cinema, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was fine.
