Originally I wrote what was a sarcastic and scathing critique of this pathetic piece of excrement, but every time I presented the review I got "this contains a very long word that is not allowed", and the words that were not misspelled were considered incorrect. <br /> <br /> Now the word that was judged too long was never identified. After numerous attempts to eliminate words, I finally had the suspicion that the IMDb site is politically sensitive and is willing to reject certain words automatically. Nothing I wrote was obscene or racist in itself. But after deleting all the longer words, the same message was repeated again and again, even words that were not considered misspelled were suddenly considered misspelled! <br /> <br /> PC police are everywhere.
