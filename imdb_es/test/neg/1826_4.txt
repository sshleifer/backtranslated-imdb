I had high expectations when entering this movie, but unfortunately, I feel disappointed. I bought it for $ 5 at a used VHS location, and the version I bought was the English-dubbed version. The dubbing is horrible, so be careful. "Lola" was not as good in this movie as in "Run Lola Run", and the bad guy came out of nowhere. And "Lola" begins to realize what happens at the moment he arrives at the university. It seems unrealistic to me. I also wondered if in the original version there were American songs on the soundtrack ... they seemed extremely out of place. Pity about this movie, I really thought I was going to rock.
