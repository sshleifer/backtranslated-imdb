How could a movie that is about how illegal Mexican immigrants who are robbed and beaten on the border be boring? Well, "Border Incident" is. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder that the career of singer and dancer George Murphy ended shortly after this terrible movie came out. The policy was undoubtedly an outlet for this future senator who dies a horrible death in this slow-paced movie. The film is a stereotype of the typical Mexican migrant farm worker, dumb and terribly bored. <br /> <br /> The film only intensifies once the identities of Murphy and Ricardo Montalban have been discovered as federal agents for the United States and Mexico respectively. <br /> <br /> At best, today we see similar problems in our own society.
