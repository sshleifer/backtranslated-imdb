When all we have is more or less reality TV shows with people who cheat themselves for any reason, either too fat or can not sing or cook for more than I know, Hollywood has run out of Original ideas. I can not remember a time when something original or intelligent has appeared on television in the last 15 years. What is our obsession with seeing vagabonds make a fool of ourselves? I thought that this type of programs would have completed a complete cycle, but every year something new happens to them that is more strange than the previous one. OK, people in this case need to lose weight ... most Americans need to lose weight. I just think that everyone, to a certain extent, enjoys seeing people humiliated. Maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone else who looks like an imbecile. I do not know, but I just want something smart to come out that does not insult your intelligence.
