I just watched this movie for the first time after buying it on DVD. <br /> <br /> It is presented as a cheap attempt to take advantage of the two Conan films. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie did not seem to have the same budget as the Conan films and, therefore, some of the sets and effects are not as fast as the flash and some scenes seem rushed. <br /> <br /> Nielsen is fine to look at, but unfortunately he could not act if they put a gun to his head. <br /> <br /> Arnie's support role seemed to have been done as a favor for director Fleischer, who also directed Conan the Destroyer. Maybe Arnie did not trust that he would go on to headline movies like Predator, Total Recall, T2, etc. <br /> <br /> Some of the women guardians of the talisman at the beginning of the film seemed to be struggling to raise their swords and the looks on their faces suggest that they were having a lot of fun making this movie. I could not be so jovial if I was fighting for my life. <br /> <br /> Leaving all this aside, this film required very little concentration and was a little entertaining. I have seen much worse. Two stars
