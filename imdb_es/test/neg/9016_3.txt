WARNING: SPOILERS Dear Roger: <br /> <br /> During your distinguished career, you have created a wide range of entertainment, some good and some not. "The night of the blood beast" falls into this last category. It's not as terribly horrible as saying, "The ghost of the 10,000 leagues" or, perhaps, "The horror of Dunwich". However, one of my biggest criticisms of this movie is that I could have made it for you faster, better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the title and titles. Roger, the rocket sequences look like something from Disney's "Man Into Space", not so good, of course. The futuristic rocket does not look like the 1958 contemporary. Why did not you use a Vanguard, Atlas or even a Viking launch? Better yet, why not completely dispense with the launch and start with a shot of space and the capsule floating in it? That's what I would have done for you, Roger. Second, why did the spacecraft crash on re-entry? Even a high school physics student could have told you that your astronaut would have arrived on the most crusty and largely disgraced earth. I would have shown your astronaut as "possessed" by the monster (perhaps using those great "negative / positive" things you used in the "Satellite War"), losing contact with the earth and landing in the desert. That would also explain how your "blood beast" could impregnate your astronaut during the tremendous heat of re-entry, but it could still be destroyed by fire. Even with these stupidities. The first half of your movie is pretty good. If you had spent some money on decent music, it would have been as good as a mediocre episode of "outer limits". But, once again, his writer describes Ed Nelson as the designer of the landing system, then gives him a stupid dialogue regarding magnetism. The biggest problem with the second half of "Night of the Blood Beast" is Michael Emmet. It's terrible like the damn astronaut. You should have fired him on the spot and replaced him with Ed Nelson. He could have combined Nelson's responsibilities with those of John Dunlap and saved the cost of an actor. I do not know if you really PAID any of these people; but, at least, it would save the cost of supplying three meals a day. I had also taken off the "scorched parrot" costume and I had spent the extra money using makeup to make the astronaut the "blood beast". Maybe that was a bit too close to "The Creeping Unknown" for you, but it would have helped immensely to the rhythm of the second half. If you are going to have a "blood beast", would not it be a good idea to show some blood? Yes, I know that the title comes from the embryos in the blood of the astronaut, but Kowalski could have done a much better job for you if he served himself some chocolate syrup. After all, it looks like black and white blood. What did that cost you, maybe two dollars? I would also have used some close-ups. For some reason, the insipid dialogue and the bad performance do not seem so bad in the first planes. Watch the television series of almost 70 and you'll see what I mean. Oh, to finish, Roger, a note for your writer. You can not use a fluoroscope to show some poor imbeciles full of alien embryos when you DO NOT HAVE ANY ELECTRICITY. Remember, you fried the generator on the first reel? Oh, and I almost forgot it. Roger, could not you afford a fake knife? You know, the guy where the blade comes in the handle. I had one of those when I was 9 years old, which is also the year that became "The Night of the Blood Beast". Maybe it cost me another two dollars. I think I knew enough to make you a better movie. I know I know enough now to do it. So, Roger, if you decide to remake "The Night of the Blood Beast", or if you're looking for a writer / director to work with you on ANY OTHER PROJECT, I'm your man. I'll work cheap, because I'd really like to make a movie for you, Roger. <br /> <br /> I give "The Night of the Blood Beast" a "3". SPECIAL NOTE: if you like to watch kitsch movies like "The Night of the Blood Beast", the DVD that I bought for $ 3.99 was of very good quality. You can also get "Night of the Blood Beast" along with many other horrible horror / science fiction movies in places like Bestbuy for about $ 6.
