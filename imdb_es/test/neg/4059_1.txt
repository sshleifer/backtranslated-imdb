This is without a doubt the WORST sequel I've seen in my life, and I've seen many of them to come to that conclusion. The plot is simply ridiculous. I can also catch a ball and run around a field. Why can not I play in the Superbowl? Yes, I know that this film was aimed at children, but there are some arguments that even children can realize that they are totally dumb and unrealistic. The first Air Bud movie was pretty good, but this was a total downfall. Disney is losing it. If you controlled who won the Razzie Awards, I would give you a couple of them. You have a good day! =)
