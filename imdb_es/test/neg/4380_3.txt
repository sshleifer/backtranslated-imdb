This is just another bad movie by Chuck Norris. Norris plays a policeman on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women. He kept the guy three years before, but somehow the man comes out of the bars of the nut house where he is using what appears to be a dental floss. Then, the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives him over a 400-foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater under renovation. Irish Jack O'Halloran is the best in this movie, but just like in Superman II, he does not say a word. Somehow that's supposed to make it more threatening. Ron O'Neal of Super Fly Fame and Steve James are wasted playing the mayor of the city and the companion of Norris respectively. The film also contains the idiotic secondary plot of Norris and his girlfriend who has a child out of wedlock; It's so 1980s When Norris' "serious" acting turn is combined with the exaggerated musical cues that signal all upcoming scenes in a predictable way, the film becomes a difficult task to sit on. The accumulation while looking for the killer in the theater is interesting enough, since Norris crawls through the shadows to discover the hiding place, but the final fight is disappointing after starting in such a promising way. It's another disappointment of Cannon Films, and it plays like a movie made for television. * 4 stars
