The film is a pathetic attempt to remake "Sonata de oto√±o" (1978) by Ingmar Bergman, starring Ingrid Bergman, Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson. I did not take more than 5 minutes to discover it. <br /> <br /> It's time for film journalists like Khalid Mohammad to take the time to think creatively. It saddens me when potentially good filmmakers waste their talent by making inferior remakes of Hollywood and European films. <br /> <br /> However, you have to give something to the filmmaker. The film he chose to copy is one of Bergman's classics and, easily, one of the best examples of the portrait of a tense human relationship in European cinema.
