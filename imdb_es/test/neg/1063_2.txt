... The continuity announcer said when TACTICAL ASACT was about to be broadcast. After seeing the first two minutes, I started thinking that Rutger might want to get a new agent. After watching the next ten minutes, I began to think that Rutger could retire and save a potential audience from his performances. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a really terrible movie. I did not expect much and why I should if the name of Rutget Hauer appeared in the credits, but within seconds of the initial title, the credits of the NATO warplanes with marks of the USSR bombed Bosnia. After Christmas. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail does not exist. The NATO aircraft carried marks of the USSR and then were told that the character of Hauer spent six years in an Iraqi prison that would be the scene of 1997. What NATO were bombing the Serbs in 1997! I guess the producers did not think the audience would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy, but I know I did. The producers probably also hoped that the audience would not notice the lack of continuity, like the dogfights with Iraqi planes that suddenly returned from Migs to F-4 Phantoms and then I did it again, but I did. Even the strangest characters take off in the F-16s and then, when they get back to the base, the jet has become a Soviet Mig. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're expecting a stupid action movie, just You're half good because it's silly, but most of the plot is centered on a BASIC INSTINCT revenge plot. I'll give some credit to the producers (Maybe the credit is too strong a word) because after seeing plots with nannies from hell, cops from hell, companions of hell, now we have a fighter pilot from hell, which means that each of the occupations of the 20th Century has appeared in a hell-type plot with perhaps TATICAL ASSUALT being the worst movie of the lot
