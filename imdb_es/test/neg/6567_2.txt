While Star Trek the movie was mostly boring, Star Trek The Final Frontier is simply bad. In this terrible sequel, the crew is on the ground when it receives a distress signal that the ambassadors representing Earth, Romulo and Kronos (Klingon's homeworld) have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan who was engaged in his search to reach a spaceship. venture into the great barrier. There, he hopes to find God. Using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the Company's senior officers to betray Kirk and seize the ship. They reach inside the great barrier and find a planet where they meet an alien similar to a god. This is so bad that it's hard to figure out where to start. At the core it is a good idea that it never really develops. The plot does not go anywhere instead of where no man has gone before. It's almost as if the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes do not have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn, the philosophy is boring and the humor is exhausted. Now I will concentrate most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. Most of the focus is on him, Spock and McCoy, but he does not give others enough to do it. Also, while Shatner is usually guilty of acting in excess in previous movies and TV shows, it's just plain bad in this one. Now Kirk is reckless, a practical and foolish joker. One of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song "Row Row Row your Boat" in a round next to a campfire. In any case, this is the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I should have given him three out of ten instead of five.
