Truly, really horrible. I do not even know where to start. This is a perfect example of a movie that does not know what to do with itself. I'm not sure I can assign myself a category, except that I'm pretty sure it's a slap to everyone, everywhere. Even the unborn. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, I thought I was watching a parody, or some kind of farce. Sometimes, just a bad B movie. But I kept waiting for porn, which, I'm afraid, is almost (but not quite), non-existent. <br /> <br /> Someone advised to jump to the end. I would definitely like to second that emotion. The last five minutes are intense, and they certainly contain some of the best CGI movies you'll ever see, ever. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood would be proud.
