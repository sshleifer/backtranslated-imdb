This is a family movie that aired on my local ITV station at 1:00 a.m. a couple of nights ago. This might be a strange decision on the part of the programmers, but THE REAL HOWARD SPITZ is a rather strange movie, strange in the way it does not want to disturb its audience. Come on, there is nothing that children like more than sadism and that is why Roald Dahl was such a popular author for children. It also explains why DOCTOR WHO was such a successful show all over the world. In this script, you are simply dying for the author of pulp fiction for doing something unpleasant for children, but this does not happen. I'm not advocating child abuse, but watching Howard Spitz lose his rag with the kids would have made the movie so much better. Can you imagine the worst that KINDERGARTEN COP would have been if the producers had all gone to the PC? I mean, if you're making a film centered around a child author who hates children, should not you show the story and not tell it? <br /> <br /> Much of the problem lies with director Vadim Jean and you have the feeling that you do not know how to handle the material, which is bad news for the film. As someone pointed out earlier, the soundtrack is random and Kelsey Grammar is very wooden. I guess I was trying to play it like that program for which it's famous, but it does not work here and there are many scenes with ridiculous and silent camera angles that seem unintended but distracting a lot. But at the end of the day, the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because nobody wanted to offend the public's sensibilities.
