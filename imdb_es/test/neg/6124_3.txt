The dominant conflict is between a couple of good actors (Huppert and Dutronc) and the horrible script. Obviously, the actors lost, since the director / screenwriter Claude Chabrol eventually forced the leading couple to follow this useless piece of diseased imagination to the letter. Fortunately, the powerful performances of Huppert and Dutronc drastically improved the overall quality of the film, which miraculously gains in depth and humor. As for Chabrol's persistence in keeping the film bland and illogical, he reaches the climax in the final scene, which is so incredibly poor that you wonder what pills he was taking while running it.
