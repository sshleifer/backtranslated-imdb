One of the worst movies I've seen in 2009 so far: the story vacillates between a silly thriller or a silly comedy. <br /> <br /> As nothing happens, the void is filled with long, boring dialogues that do not. no sense! <br /> <br /> The cast is famous but does not bring any emotion except to advance the play! <br /> <br /> And it happens in a luxurious beach hotel that looks really bleak. In comparison, "Shining" is a funfair! <br /> <br /> NB: Many users think it is located on the French Riviera! You are wrong! It is not the south of France (Nice, Cannes), but just the opposite: Cabourg and Normandy, to be simple the D-Day beaches! That is why the sea is as gray as the sky and there is no sun!
