It is intended to be the life of Paul the apostle. It opens with him involved in a fight fight with a priest. The Pharisees were called that because they "separated" from Hellenism and were forced by the Jews by their Gentile rulers. The point is that Saul had never been involved in the Greco-Roman struggle. PERIOD. <br /> <br /> Then we have the two men (Saul and the Priest, Reuben, a completely extra-biblical fictitious character) who show themselves naked in a Roman-style bathroom. Again, the Torah, to which Saul adhered religiously, was condemned in the strongest possible terms by seeing the nakedness of another man. <br /> <br /> Reuben is the one who pushes Saul to destroy the church. Once again, the text of the Scriptures does not matter, since it is Paul who says he squandered the church and exhorted threats and massacres against the church. <br /> <br /> The film shows Barnabas "sprinkling" Paul: he does not baptize (submerge) him when the Text of Scripture says that it was Ananias who did it. <br /> <br /> Mark and him are not mentioned so that the writers of the writing are forced to do so. Paul and Barnabas argue about Paul's desire to preach in Rome as the basis of his separation. <br /> <br /> No Silas in the Second and Third Missions of Paul; Not Timothy ... NEVER. No Titus; No Apollos ... No, NO, NOOOO !!! It is said that James "met Jesus for a long time" instead of saying, as the Text of Scripture does, that he is the brother of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Why do not you just call the movie "Frank, the fictional Apostle?!?!" At least that would be closer to the text of the scriptures.
