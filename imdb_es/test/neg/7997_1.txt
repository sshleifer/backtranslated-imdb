This is one of those movies that is so bad that it's amazing! It has everything a movie of the early eighties needs: flared trousers, big mustaches, chicks with Farrah hair, and most importantly, ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ NINJAS !!! I have some moments of choice to retract for you. Cole's teammate has a strange monkey face and always seems to speak without moving his jaw. He gets his ass on all the other scenes of the thugs who want their land, so the whole movie gets drunk. At one point, the farm workers finally came back after the thugs in a gangster's ran away and Frank, I think his name is Frank, is so excited he shouts to the whole group: "Let's have a fight of roosters !! " and everyone moves happily to the farm fighting area to start the festivities. This is fun at all possible levels. If you take it dirty or literally, it still heats my heart. Another fun thing is the little grunts of Sho Kosugi and about the animated movements of ninja style. I remember this guy from when he was a kid and he used to say that he was the only real ninja in the world (he had ads in martial arts magazines) if I remember correctly. My friends and I were a little crazy ninja during the time this movie came out and I can remember having seen it at the local theater many times. I wondered as I watched this in Starz last night why every sleazy American gangster guy always has a bastion in the Philippines and wears a white Steve Martin suit. In fact, this guy goes beyond that by demanding that all his thugs wear white Steve Martin suits. There is a scene in which it seems that 20 impersonators of Steve Martin are attacking an underwear model of Sears (Cole) in 1970. When we finish the final battle, Cole bursts into the bad guy's headquarters and is immediately discovered by a secretary who in turn alerts a guard who shoots a round from his pumping action shotgun, not 30 feet from the bad guys and nobody seems to notice or care. Cole, wearing a completely white ninja outfit, proceeds to creep up a ladder and then makes a turn to the area where all the bad guys are. The second in charge tells him that he did not need to kill everyone as they expected, and then he takes him to the Cock Fighting arena of the bad guys. Do not ask me why Cock Fighting is a big part of this movie, but it is. When they arrive, Cole still wears his ninja mask, although everyone involved knows what he is like without him. The final battle is approaching, since Cole has killed everyone and now Sho, as I like to call him, is revealed to have kidnapped Cole's wife, also known as Frank's wife, and they are in the arena of fights of the most dazzling cocks I've ever seen. Then, very politely I could add, says the lady and the battle is about to begin. They make their inclinations and begin to surround themselves, both masked by the way. When they join the battle, it seems that Cole intermittently becomes another person, and "Finishing The Game" is a funny parody when completing Bruce Lee's "Game of Death". Cole eventually comes out on top, Kills Sho, who dies with honor by being decapitated and all is well. Then we see Cole, after ruining everyone's life, is about to divide the city again, but not before presaging the brutal death of a fat guy with a hook in his hand and then inexplicably winks at the camera, freezes the picture, the credits, ready.
