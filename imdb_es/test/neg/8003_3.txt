Boring, cliche and predictable. The only original part was Brighton's location for gangsters. It certainly is not "Lock Stock, etc ......." Hannah was nice in "Sliding Doors". In "Circus" I did not develop empathy with his character and I could not rule out what happened to him or his girlfriend. Although this film was so clich√© and predictable, the ending was not a surprise, it did not interest me or matter to me why the film was given the name of "Circus" ... Booooring ....... Don't visit this great cap
