A monotonous morality about a high school kid who is practically a nerd now stereotyped. He's smart, but he has no friends, no social skills, and a lazy loser from a father who borrows money from HIM. A pretty girl hits him (he should have known that she wanted something, he's supposed to be smart, right?). She manipulates the poor desperate fool to write her work on Shakespeare, which the teacher knows immediately that she could not have written. Loses the girl (not that he really had) the confidence of his teacher and his college scholarship, all in one fell swoop. <br /> <br /> Marv is so foolish and desperate for love that he decides to steal some heroin dealers who are running things through the warehouse that works. Then maybe the little trashy whore will be impressed and want to marry him. Sad, very sad. Marv is such a pathetic drug (and quite foolish, for a supposedly intelligent guy, I mean, try to steal from drug dealers, has this guy gone crazy?), You stop feeling sorry for him and you have the terrible need to kick it in the back, instead. <br /> <br /> The girl, of course, tells her boyfriend about the theft Marv boasted about, and talks to him and his friends to steal the money from Marv and company. They try to do it, and in the process they manage to shoot several people. The cops appear at the same time, and the idiot Marv is dragged, a total disgrace forever. I know that this thing was aimed at making teenagers behave by showing them the consequences of bad behavior, but all that really illustrated was the consequences of stupid behavior. What is the premature end of your film career, of course. Goodbye, Marv, we never really met you. And thank God for that.
