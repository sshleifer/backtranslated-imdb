The dam has an interesting story, unless you remember her ads in the newspapers in June 1984, you may have seen her in the movie channel in the summer of '85, but little else is remembered. The plot is your basic killer in the woods again. But, ironically, this was filmed before Friday the 13th. The dam was fired at some point in 1978, according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But launched for about a week on some drive-in (yes, Jim, the namans drive showed it in June of 84). But it looks old-fashioned. Maybe they published it later to take advantage of all the other horror movies that flooded the market in 1984. Now, in the story, it has some kind of history, a forest fire in the 1940s leaves a lot of gypsies burned to death. But one of his children survives (our monster), so we move on to the current day, which would be 1978, we have a camp for older middle-aged couples that will only be sent by the Monster. The line of the label for this image says that it IS NOT HUMAN AND THAT IT HAS AN AX, but only one Ax was used in these first two murders. Now we have a group of teenagers who look like their camp in the mid-20s. We all know they are the prey, and the monster hits them one at a time. For an 80-minute movie it seems longer. We also have a lot of wildlife images to fill in the gaps during the 80 minutes. In general, for being in a horror movie of the 80s, it seems more 70 than ever. Hey the Prey had the potential to be a good horror killer in the movie Woods, but it falls a bit short ... However, it presents a pretty scary-looking monster at the end, and we have to wait until the last 2 minutes for see him. Side note, the monster has gone on to star in Addams family movies in the 1990s ...
