When HULK hit theaters in 2003, it was not long before the DVDs of the former Incredible Hulk television show appeared in an attempt to capitalize on the craze. We saw a similar occurrence a year earlier when the Spider-Man cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with that hero's big-screen debut. Companies take advantage of the opportunity to travel with the financial whims of a fashion brand. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the fact that this image never appeared on the shelves of Wal-Mart when its heroes appeared invaded the box office in the summer. of 2005 says a lot. I guess everyone involved would prefer to forget. To be fair, THE FOUR FANTASTIC ones are not as bad as they all say. Let me rephrase that. It is not as entertaining as all his negative reviews suggest. <br /> <br /> Veteran TV actor Alex Hyde-White (no, you do not remember any of his roles) leads the way while Reed Richards, the brilliant Scientist who, along with his crew, gets strange powers after a mishap in outer space. It has been left with the ability to stretch and twist the body in extravagant lengths. His future wife, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab), can suddenly become invisible, while her brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood), can now turn on at will. Then there's poor Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith), the adorable dog whose body transforms into a sheer, orange rock mass. <br /> <br /> Just as friends are getting used to all this, they are called. To rescue the world from certain chaos. It seems that the old Reed colleague, Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) is living up to his name, and that villain Jeweler (Ian Trigger) is not helping the old women to cross the street. Can our heroes save the day? Of course they can; Like any superhero movie, it's just a question of how and when. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about THE FANTASTIC FOUR is the amateur that is in almost all aspects. The dialogue is so boring and tired that it looks like it was written by a high school drama class. The performance is so polished that it makes a third class evening soap opera look like Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good considering the minuscule budget, but there are still some positively embarrassing moments. When the human torch ignites his body completely, for example, the whole film briefly becomes a caricature. I can only listen to that production meeting. "Oh, no one will notice, they'll be too intrigued by the action!" I mean really, a caricature? At least give me a burning mannequin supported by a rope! Before that, the scene in which the four arrive on Earth after their spaceship crashes is the fare of the teenagers in the backyard. The crew simply found a field and set fire to an object similar to a spaceship vaguely. Is it the only remnant of such a big disaster? <br /> <br /> Of course, there was not much to work with in the script. Here is a fairly coherent story, but everything is very simplified. When Reed and Ben decide to go to outer space, they simply go through the house of the Storms and ask them if they want to join them. Is it really that easy? Do not they require this kind of thing, oh, I do not know, years of training and experience? Not in the world of these writers, who seemed to be inspired by the underestimated genius on display in the FULL HOUSE repeats. But as bad as it is, nothing can compare with how painfully clich√© Dr. Doom is. He was pulled from those horrible superhero cartoons of the 1960s, even the evil laugh and hit his clenched fist on the table to rate his comments. No comic, much less the Fantastic Four, has presented a villain so obscenely one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, THE FOUR FANTASTIC ones are saved from being a complete turkey because it is so damn innocent. You can tell the people involved, since the little talent or experience they had, they really tried. They did not know that the final result would be so embarrassing. They had the impression that this was their great opportunity, that people would go to theaters. It is worth repeating that they practically did not have money to work (and I am sure that half of that was devoured by the brilliant costume of Thing). After all, they did it well, and because of its many flaws, the final product is quite fun for comic book fans.
