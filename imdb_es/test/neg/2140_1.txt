Italian filmmakers love to cheat American movies. All our movies, and as often as possible. <br /> <br /> I am not claiming that it is an insult against Italy as a whole, but I would like to note that the Italian film industry does a great deal of damage by allowing festivities like this to be seen abroad. For the world in general. That's all I say. <br /> <br /> And there are no more serious injuries to which the Italian people are subjected than by not imposing a harsh punishment on those who made the world see "Shark rosso nell'oceano", which is, without a doubt , a scam of the "jaws" very superior (as if you did not know). <br /> <br /> Let's dive into the plot (Do you understand? Haw-haw ...): This is a huge and monstrous swimming thing that looks like a cross between an octopus, a shark and Steven Tyler attacks many innocent (ie, Italian) Americans off the coast of Florida (ie, Italy) and the intrepid and drinker Peter (Sopkiw) sails with his anorexic, her beer girlfriend and other people who drink beer, whose main purpose is to be devoured by the creature, killed by mysterious forces that want the creature to be alone or simply stand and be otherwise useless (and beer). .o be the doctor in this movie that defibrillates moribund patients repeatedly (20, maybe 30 times in a row) without waiting for their shovels to recharge (it must be a good battery, doc). <br /> <br /> Then there is the monster ... brother, if you thought that the shark "Jaws" was false, look here and change your mind IMMEDIATELY. <br /> <br /> This is a film that was directed as a last-minute idea (by a Bava!), edited with an onion cutter, represented by wandering bits of driftwood and written by people (PRESUMENTLY Sweeping beer) who should never be allowed to approach a typewriter, a movie studio or a major city in the world. If this is how the people who made this movie think that real people act in such a situation, obviously they have made too many zombie movies. Or I drank too much beer. <br /> <br /> Do I need to say that this movie is bad? It is: bad like green cottage cheese; bad as a Hawaiian shirt at a formal wedding; bad as the parodies of "Bad Theater" that Dan Aykroyd used to present on "Saturday Night Live"; bad as Calista Flockhart's weight gain tablets, do you understand? All right. <br /> <br /> Mike and the SOL gang slap this beauty beer drink face up repeatedly and reveal this "horror" movie for what it is: horrible. However, with a certain European charm: it is charming when you look at a European, preferably one who drinks beer. <br /> <br /> There are no stars for the drowned dead fish known as "Shark rosso nell'oceano"; Six stars for the MST3K version. ... and now, someone for a beer? <br /> <br />
