This is just another of those "Americans find romance with a charming stranger in an exotic place in Europe." This genre has been in film bankruptcy since the 1950s, however, they continue to produce them. I let my girlfriend convince me to see this, bad idea, we both hate it. If all you want to see is Tuscany, try watching "Steal Beauty" with Liv Tyler, a slightly better movie. <br /> <br /> This type of genre films are very typical of greeting cards.
