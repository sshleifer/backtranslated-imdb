Mild spoiler in the second paragraph. <br /> <br /> Anna Christie was the dazzling first talker of Garbo. She and Dressler look like the only people who know what they are doing in this movie. The old man who plays Garbo's father (George F. Marion) in the movie is sooooo ah! All he does is stumble drunk in a totally false way and scream about "dat old dah-veel sea". He blames the "past" of Garbo, his whole life, and everything in the sea! He appears as a stupid x 10. Charles Bickford is Matt, Garbo's sailor who falls in love and falls in love with him, and is well in his role, but nothing really exceptional. when Garbo unleashes his "terrible secret" on Bickford and his father. Finally, Marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and hits her head and fists on the table perfectly with Bickford. Then, soon it goes by the sea. <br /> <br /> I had to force myself practically to finish with Anna Christie. It's too melodramatic in many parts and screeching. There are many good early talkies, but this is not one of them. If you have not seen Garbo before, try something else before Anna Christie, like CAMILLE or GRAND HOTEL.
