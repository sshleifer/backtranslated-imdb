Victor Buono as the devil? Surely someone must have gotten drunk when that decision was made. That's not the worst part of this silly mix of various devices in the haunted house, but get my vote for being the funniest part. While the movie is by no means terrible, it does not even come close to other "haunted houses" movies of the 1970s such as Amityville Horror, The Changeling and The Legend of Hell House. Evil can be entertaining in places, but do not expect to be afraid. It is best addressed for what it is: a silly horror movie that gets stupider by its too serious approach.
