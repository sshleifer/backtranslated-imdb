Having spent all his money caring for his terminally ill wife, the widow recently Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) moves in with her two daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to the house of her late husband's family in a rural area of ​​Pennsylvania, where local legends speak of zombies roaming the forest at night. <br /> <br /> Seeing the names of the writer and director of this film in the initial credits was enough to send chills: Boaz Davidson is the 'genius' responsible for writing scripts for STV titles such as Octopus 1 & 2, Spiders and Crocodile, while JS Cardone gave us the great 'unpleasant video' of The Slayer and the boring vampire movie The Forsaken. With such dubious responsible talent, I did not expect much from Wicked Little Things. <br /> <br /> And I just finished the movie, I'm glad I kept my expectations low. <br /> <br /> Even though the film looks good at times, with a lovely use of the mysterious place of the forest, and the cast offers reasonable performances given the feeling of nonsense with which they are working, the plot is So worked, badly written and derived that it is impossible to be enthusiastic about. Perhaps the most important thing is that the assassins of the film, the undead children who get up every night from the mine in which they died, are not in the least frightening, a makeup stain, black contacts and some scars of jokes shit they do very little to add. to the meaning of the threat. Scout Taylor-Compton and company do their best to appear fearful of the little terrors, screaming convincingly with each confrontation, but their admirable attempts to instill a sense of fear in the audience have little success: the little distillers simply do not have what It is needed to cool the blood. <br /> <br /> There are some mediocre chow zombie scenes in a futile attempt to win over gore-hounds, and the final kill, which sees the blood of the victim soaked Compton and Heuring, is appropriately tasteless, but in Generally, Wicked Little Things (AKA Zombies in the United Kingdom) is instantly a garbage that can not be forgotten, it is only one more obstacle in the filmographies of Cardone and Davidson.
