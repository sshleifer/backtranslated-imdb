The only time I really laugh while watching this show is when I'm making fun of him. Jamie Lynn Spears only got the acting job because of her older sister, and I do not think anyone can argue with me about that. There is no expression on his face EVER (even when he smiles) - just look at the show and you'll see what I mean. Now let's talk about the show. Zoey 101 is one of the most unreal shows I've seen! As many people have already said, Zoey Brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone wants her, she is a straight student and all the boys think she is "good". PCA is a boarding school full of rich children who give all their students flat-screen TVs and laptops, which serve sushi for children at the sushi bar. In one of the most recent episodes, Zoey is completely clueless and thinks that Chase is not in love with her, and acts as if she did not even want Chase to love her. Then, when he bursts into Chase's bedroom to prove his friends are wrong, he finds Chase kissing this girl named Rebecca. Zoey, of course, is scared, probably because she likes Chase's attention. Anyway, just watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on TV is Zoey 101. At least you can have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is!
