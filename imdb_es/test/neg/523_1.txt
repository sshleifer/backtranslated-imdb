This movie was one of the worst I've seen (not including anything from Pauly Shore). I could not believe that a movie could really be THIS bad! <br /> <br /> Coolio has to be the worst actor (once again, not including Pauly Shore) who has "starred" in a movie. The temptation to press the STOP button during this movie was huge (in fact, if there was a DOWNLOAD IN THE TRASH button on my VCR, I would have liked to press that). <br /> <br /> Please, and do something more interesting than watching this movie, like watching the grass grow or watching golf on television.
