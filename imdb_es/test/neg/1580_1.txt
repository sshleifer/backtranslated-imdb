I saw this movie a while ago and the only thing I can remember about the movie is how absolutely horribly bad it is, it is definitely in my 5 worst worst movies I've ever seen. And to think that I had to persuade my colleagues to get this movie. In the video store, my reputation has been reduced to pieces because of this movie. Will my teammates trust me again? I doubt it, they always say that they do not judge anything by their cover, they were right when I saw the cover of furs / gang members I thought wow, this looks very good since it had a lot of skin heads on the cover with riots with metal bars . DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. I can not think of anything else to say that acting is bad. The story is bad, it's just bad.
