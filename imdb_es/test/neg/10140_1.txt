Reba sucks. It stinks hard It's about this horrible country singer who tries comedy. You could call this program "Generic", because that's what it is. It is silly and generic. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad that your delayed program has been canceled because you suck, and also Brock, Barbra Jean, the redheaded teenager, that kind of rider and the 12-year-old boy who was attacked. You all suck, and none of you is funny. Oh, and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a gay devil worshiper who idolizes Hitler and tortures the animals. And he puts subliminal messages on his show and on his "music" in hopes of making children kill their parents and commit suicide! But it was just a rumor. Anyway, this is the worst program of all, Reba is gay, I do not like her, I think The Office is better than this program, and this program sucks.
