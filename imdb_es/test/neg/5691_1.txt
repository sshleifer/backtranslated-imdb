In a world where humans can live forever, you spend the whole movie wanting them to die. First of all, if you insist on seeing this movie, do two things: first be quiet, do not worry, you lose a plot, damn, do not even talk during the first 70 minutes of an 87 minute film, after putting it to silence . Now you must move fast until the main girl dies, do not worry, even if you pay attention, you will not know why or how she died. Once you get to the "good part" take it out of silence. Oh, how you know the good part, wait for an elevator scene with two idiots in spacesuits with World War II weapons. These weapons will not seem much until you realize that the first protagonist had a laser gun and a bandit of CO2 cartridges. The only remnants of a plot take place between a bright ball and a semi-hot girl that looks like it was attacked by Wolverine. After listening to the "argument", you will wish they have not spoken again. Of the four people in this film, none of them can act remotely, not even a little bit, they will have better luck witnessing the performance in a kindergarten theater. <br /> <br /> To comment on the special in the special Effects, let me say "Wow", no, you will really spend the whole movie telling yourself "Where did the 1.8 million dollar budget of this movie?" Seriously, it will leave you out of the magnitude of ineptitude. The best "sets" are basically Windows wallpapers. The ships are basically flying keys, expect some to be barges that look like whales. I have never heard so many invented words in my whole life. They have buttons on their wrists (large pedometers) that can put them in "fight mode" and in super runing mode (makes them very fuzzy). This will seriously deplete your energy reserves, but you will find pieces of wires to chew and regain your strength. The explosions were less impressive than my fourth of July, I only had flares. <br /> <br /> So, as far as I can tell, something like "mother" is a spaceship captain and goes to the desert. For a while, a rocket dies. Then, her daughter 6000 years in the future (no, I'm not exaggerating) remembers her mother's memories through some kind of capsule. Anyway, they chat for another 10 minutes and then they cause a big bang. Yes, the same "Big Bang" that started our solar system. It explains how she goes back in time or something, it does not really matter what happened, I suppose. Roll Credits Seriously, the entire script was fortunately on a sheet of paper, unless in reality one of the terrible fighting scenes was detailed. <br /> <br /> After seeing the credits, now I have laughed more than the full movie, the works created as catering supervisor "galactius sarcophagus" and then the special thanks to George Lucas was the best. <br /> <br /> I really did not expect much for a movie for which I paid 99 cents, but seriously some The body owes me for this. The most frequent comment heard after the movie "I want to get my life back". You have to admire that, but devote time and effort to this movie, but seriously, why?
