I love comedies and I like independent films, but this was too slow and the humor was extremely regional. I guess it would have been better if the main characters were nice, but they were the typical types of gen-x slacker, just like the people who have been causing problems in high schools for forty years ... I can understand the praise for a young man Indie filmmaker when he deserves it, but this is an extremely average movie.
