A full zero of four. One of the worst summed Ajooba: horrible. Actually, more words come to mind: ridiculous, third-rate and terrible. This is one of Amitabh's worst films, he wears a cheap leather jacket and an equally inexpensive tinsel fox-style mask with what looks like wings on the sides. <br /> <br /> The film is set in ancient Persia or Arabia and is characteristically non-historical for an Indian movie. As mentioned above, 400 years ago there was no K-Mart leather jacket with Velcro straps, unless all my history teachers were wrong. <br /> <br /> Rishi also makes his patented outfit in this movie. Far from being fun, it is very embarrassing to see it. What could the son of the legendary Raj Kapoor possess to skin the memory of his house like this one on the screen? <br /> <br /> On the positive side, if you really want to laugh, go ahead and watch this movie. The obvious inconsistencies in the plot and the costumes are no match for the terrible dialogues and the bad performance.
