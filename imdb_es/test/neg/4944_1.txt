Come on? FANTASTIC DRAMA ON SCREEN? Are you kidding friends? I would not put the horrible Molly Gross to play even in the school game! Where did these people learn to act? By borrowing some actor's papers from your neighbors? Terrible plot, horrible performance. Jeh ... why do you take us for imbeciles? What can I say more? I understand that this is a television production and the acting is not supposed to be that of Citizen Kane. But, however, they should try harder to earn their money. And apart from that, what can be said in 10 LINES for a simple movie like this one? Do you want an article in the morning paper? To say that? Worst movie in the decade? Ok, you want it - you have it!
