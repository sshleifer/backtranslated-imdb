It was so boring! No plot at all! Basically, a diluted version of the Lion King mixed with Animal Farm. Once again, no plot at all. Horrible! The worst hour and a half of my life! OMG! I had to leave the theater for a few minutes to get some relief! Maybe I laughed twice. All semi-fun parts are in the previews. I hate movies like that. Yes, the movie quite sucked. I do not know how he got such good grades and comments. NO PARCEL OR HISTORY! If you are going to watch this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend / boyfriend to keep you occupied. Horrible. I do not think I've ever been to see a movie and I've been so upset. It was good that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be crazy if I had paid $ 7.50 to see this shit.
