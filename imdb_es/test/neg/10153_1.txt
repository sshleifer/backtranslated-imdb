I got this on a dual-function DVD called "Scream Theater" and it's definitely one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. And I've seen some very bad ones. School is over, and three girls (who if they were teenagers would eat my hat) talk about "party without stopping", so, of course, all go to the house of the girl whose parents are the most strict. a slumber party Meanwhile, a psychotic has escaped from the local insect house where the father of a girl works and walks loose with sharp objects and wearing green robes, and with eyes wide open ... I guess that's for show that he is crazy. Of course, since he has a bone to remove with that particular doctor, he goes to his home, whose location is apparently common knowledge. Meanwhile, some types of imbeciles are throwing beers and frightening the girls, and of course, the crazy one also appears and begins to cut throats. And that's it, while heavy metal music resonates in the background. Or, maybe it's not that, but in reality, that's all you need to know. Unless you spend your time perpetually stoned or drunk, here you will find little interest, and even if you lose most of the time, you are likely to find your intelligence insulted. 1 out of 10
