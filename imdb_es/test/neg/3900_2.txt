When I started seeing this, I instantly noticed that I could not understand what someone was saying. I turned up the volume. With the background noises now booming, I could hear the voices. What are the actors saying? Is the movie not folded? Are they speaking Spanish? After some confusion, I realize that he was English. At least, I think ... The Amazing Jess Franco has placed the microphones too far away from the actors. As a result, we can not fully hear what they are saying. He has done this before. But maybe this is the intention of Mr. Franco? By not knowing what people are saying, we throw ourselves into a mystery about what is happening and leave us with more visual clues ... Maybe it's just me, but I would have liked to know what was happening! How about some advice? The basic premise (I refuse to call it a "plot") refers to a young exotic American dancer named Paula (played by Amber Newman), who has a boyfriend who invites her to a small island that is owned by sordidly rich people. It is somewhere on the coast of Spain. For this visit, a large cash payment is promised to Paula, who receives the groom. Then he escapes from the island, then returns. Why? Pay close attention to the scene in which the boyfriend opens Paula's American passport. Although his hand tried to hide it, you can see the REAL name of the actress, Amber Newman, printed below the photo at the bottom of the passport. Anyway, going back to "history": there are some other sordid, rich and beautiful characters that visit the island, all with ambiguous motives. We are witnesses of sadistic games (are they real or false?) And unattractive gastronomic scenes. But the food must be good, as prepared by a fake French chef! There is a young maid who runs naked and never speaks. Is she really mute? And do we care? Of course, all women are naked for the most part throughout this movie ... Well, at least we can be grateful that men (over 50 and overweight) remain dressed. Besides the abysmal sound quality, what has always surprised me about Jess Franco is his incredible ability to film beautiful naked women in such a way that leaves the viewer completely off. This movie is not the exception? I needed fresh air after seeing it! <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I am pleased to report that, regardless of what Mr. Franco can imagine, I am still attracted to women.
