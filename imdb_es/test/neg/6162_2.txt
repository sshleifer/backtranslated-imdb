They say that David Duchovny took six days to write the script for this film. That sounds pretty good. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst I've seen and I've seen Gigli. It's not as bad as Gigli, but it's like saying that Saddam Hussein was not as bad as Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Tom Warshaw has been living in France with his French wife and 13-year-old son. He has been pretending to be French all this time. He reveals to his wife that he is actually an American. For some reason, this is presented as a revelation to her, even though she always commented on her husband's American accent. Also, your son (remember, he was born in France and never knew that his father was American) speaks perfect American English without the slightest French accent. That is just one of the many holes in the plot in this movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is a flashback to Tommy's youth in New York City during the 1970s, as he explains to his wife why he has been hiding in France. His best friend Child was Pappas, a retarded adult that Robin Williams played terribly. I suppose Duchovny thinks that "retarded" is someone who is a bit silly, because Pappas is slightly slow at times, while at other times he does it alone like Robin Williams. Yes, Williams actually fits into his tired improvisational game, even though he's supposed to play a mentally slow person. <br /> <br /> Tommy's mother, played by Duchovny's wife, Tea Leoni, is a nurse who takes pills and is distressed about her husband's recent death. Leoni does a good job, but mainly smokes a lot and yells at Tommy for things that do not seem too important. The script did not give much to work. Tommy also befriends a lady (whom he calls "Dama") who is in prison and offers advice through the prison window (this house of detention is called "House of D", said is the title ). Tommy has no qualms about shouting his personal problems out loud on a street in the city, so this incarcerated criminal can offer advice, and he does it many times without care. <br /> <br /> I do not want to bore you with the full summary of the movie, but the plot holes abound in this movie, which tries to be too hard to play but is presented as, well, bad. Really bad. Really very bad. Near the end of this train crash, the script becomes more and more cuckold and ends with a ridiculously horrible ending. <br /> <br /> Critics trashed "House of D" and rightly so. I can not believe that some people like this movie. It is a painful film to sit down and then I felt weak, not because of the emotion, but because of how terrible it was.
