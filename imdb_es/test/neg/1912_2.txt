You can always tell if I'm enjoying a movie by the number of times I cross my legs, change my position, make slight noise noises, etc., etc. The lower = better. I moved so many times throughout this movie that I succeeded in knocking down my friends in the giant popcorn tub and in a huge workout to strengthen my thighs. The daughter never cries "he made some promise for his theatrical talent, he misinterpreted in a badly written paper Depressing fact number one Number two: Chris Klein was in it Depressing number three: Chris Klein had lines Number four: Chris Klein played a valedictorian Woah The mannequins of rich families come together! What's worse, actually tries to act, but only manages to sound like a mentally disabled superintendent in an increasingly sad independent version of a film by Cecille B. DeMille Re-fuck your American Feet. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible in almost every way, except for the unattractive performance of Josh Hartnett as LeeLee's rigid boyfriend, Jasper. Fortunately, he refrains from trying have too many "moments", unlike all the other characters, of course, this is why it's so much better than the rest and actually shows something of value here, if you like Josh or are you Endeavoring to choose a child who knows some things, is your man. <br /> <br /> Hartnett is a keen actor, but the rest does not need more criticism. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10 (for poor Hartnett in this terrible movie) <br /> <br />
