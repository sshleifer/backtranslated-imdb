Here are a couple of paragraphs from an essay I wrote for the university about TBOR. <br /> <br /> "The Book of Revelation is an erotic thriller about the sex, power and struggle of a talented dancer to regain her sense of self after being unfortunately raped by three hooded women." The three women who violate it have distinctive marks on the bodies, one has a giant birthmark on her buttocks, another has a butterfly tattoo on the bottom of her stomach and the leader of the ring has a small circle on it. So she lives her new life in search of these brands, and to find them in these intimate places does what any sane man does when he needs to see as many naked women as possible to solve a mystery, he has sex with them ... One hour and ten minutes in the movie and you feel like you've almost had a piece of every woman in Melbourne. <br /> <br /> The movie is a giant piece of pretentious celluloid, it's like grandiloquence drips from everyone at one point towards the movies, the final climax Kok does The kinos give the scene the same energy and strength that their first feature film Head On had en masse. Like many films financed by government agencies, the film takes itself seriously, the script and its execution seem to be tasks instead of gifts and, unfortunately for the talented artists, their brilliant performances (particularly Tom Long as fractured protagonist) They are trapped within the confines of a pompous wan k fest.
