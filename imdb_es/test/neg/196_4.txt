I have liked the films of Milos Forman since I saw "Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest" and "Amadeus" (two great masterpieces), but when I saw "Cabello", I wondered if this was the same Milos Forman. This movie is boring and uninteresting to say the least. Okay, the music is pretty good, but on the screen it only looks like a group of drugged people dancing (wait a minute ... that's what it really is!). In fact, the only interesting part, and the only part in which Milos's talent appears, is the last 15 minutes or so (SPOILER!) Since Berger takes Claude's place as a soldier destined for the war of Vietnam. Those 15 minutes are touching and well directed, but it's a shame we have to endure so much horrible stuff before that. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe this is one of those movies in which you must be "in the Subject" to enjoy (the theme is marijuana, acid and other drugs that the movie glorifies). Im not so...
