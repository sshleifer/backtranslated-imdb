OH MY GOD! After having such a promising start, Critters 2 reiterated that the karmic rule of what happens comes back. Clearly, very few things were thought when this movie was made, and what about Scott Grimes wearing an ear! This should have been the last expedition to the Critters saga, but there was more trash on the way. This was the big reason why I did not see Critters 3, and why does every series of bad movies have to have an episode in space? (Critters, Friday the 13th, Leprechaun in Space, Hellraiser, etc.)
