My God, how bad is this. Who is this impostor who claims to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs. It replaces the intelligent multi-layered satire and humor of your show with the humor of the toilet and the toilet. <br /> <br /> This was obviously an attempt to make it public in the United States before he released his show there on HBO. br /> <br /> A commentator here tells us that we do not judge the film because of the merits of the program because of the difference in the media. While it is true that the standard format of the series could never have been transferred to the big screen, Mr. Sacha Baron Cohen could have ensured the intelligent use of his comic style in a more conventional film story. Instead, we have this mess, which in all honesty has nothing to do with Ali G, except with the packaging. <br /> <br /> Terribly disappointing. Go find the DVDs of Innit, Aiiii or Bling Bling to get a true Ali G.
