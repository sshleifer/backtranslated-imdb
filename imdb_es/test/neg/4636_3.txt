Here is example number 87.358 of Hollywood's anti-biblical bias, so typical of them. <br /> <br /> At first, Ray Liotta's wife did it and the women are being interviewed for the position of housekeeper. The first interviewee is an antiquated one (clothes, manners, speeches) that immediately establishes strict rules here, declaring that "there will be two hours of Bible study every day". <br /> <br /> This is said, of course, to make it seem that reading the Bible is the worst punishment you could inflict on anyone, especially a child. Once again, the Bible is equated with suffocated and malicious people. That woman, of course, is fired immediately. <br /> <br /> Naturally, the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg, who else?) is the one who is hired and, voil√†, saves the day! <br /> <br /> Yawning.
