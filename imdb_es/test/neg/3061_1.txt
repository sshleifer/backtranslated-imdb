Is this movie as bad as some say? In my opinion, it is. I was not going to make any comments, and I realized that a few comments had already been made, ranging from 'horrible' to almost not so bad ... '. However, I can not resist. <br /> <br /> What do you think about a movie you have on the cover of the DVD? the phrase "the real story of" Ma BArker and his children ... ", and the norm" some similarity with real people ... "disclaimer in credits? I'm not naive, but in this case, it's a nice comment relevant to this movie. <br /> <br /> Several comments hit the presentations, they are quite horrible, Roberts, Russell, Milano and Stallone have something like 315 movies and TV shows listed among them. However, the dialogue is not to my liking and, at times, it is quite funny.The arcs of the story do not seem to be anything, but the minimum required to chain specific scenes of Violence and melodrama together. <br /> <br /> You have to criticize the direction and writing of the screen: Amyrillis laughs after seeing the violent temperament of Ma Barker and ends with "Take The Girl!" What do you think? Alyssa's acting skills .. some screenwriter wrote that line or reaction , and / or a director filmed it and said: 'Okay, that's enough, no ne To take that back, that's credible ...' A footnote: I picked up my copy for $ 1.99 or $ 2.99 on a discount container of supermarket history; the execution time is shown as 91 minutes, and I notice that the execution time appears in the IMDb list as 95 minutes. I do not know what 4 minutes are missing, but I recognize that if those 4 minutes were the right kind of person in the right kind of situation, my rating could rise to 3 or 4 out of 10. As I've seen that, 1/10 is what I should vote.
