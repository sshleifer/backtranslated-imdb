This movie has ALL the clich√©s of all terrorist or airplane crisis films. <br /> <br /> However, it is not entirely unrecognizable, thanks to the good performances of Rowland, Loken and Smallwood (and perhaps Enberg). <br /> <However, what IS incredibly bad, is the computer animation that they try to convey as live action scenes. Boy, oh boy, the CGI scenes in "The Last Starfighter", filmed in 1984, are better than these (filmed 17 years later). The feeling of cheepnis really makes you shiver. <br /> <br /> Pity, this could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste.
