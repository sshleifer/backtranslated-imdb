Imagine the worst that could be conceived by the human intellect. Now imagine something infinitely darker, I mean, worse, than that. Then multiply that by the amount of suckiness that the Star Wars Vacation Special possesses. This movie is much worse than that. <br /> <br /> "Dracula 3000: Infinite Darkness", starring such illustrious and renowned actors as Coolio and Langley Kirkwood (as the "horrible antagonist" of the film, Count ORLOCK) is comparable to eating your own feces exclusively for a lifetime, condensed in about one hour and twenty minutes. To be honest, there is no way to address a revision of this cinematic tragedy: plagued by communist propaganda, promotion of drug use, futuristic anachronisms and possibly the worst special effects from the (original) "War of the Worlds". <br /> <br /> The hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union can be seen proudly throughout the dirty sets that dare to call a spaceship. Lenin can be seen in several posters throughout the "movie". And, of course, religion has been abolished for two centuries by then. So they do not know who this "God" is, even though they have no reservations about using his name in vain. But, of course, in the Socialist Republic of space (presided over by interstellar President Baker), drugs like the death stick are legalized and are quite common. However, the mobility of the disabled seems even worse than at present (they do not even have a wheelchair ramp). <br /> <br /> Racial tension still manifests itself throughout the galaxy in a fairly familiar / predictable way. We received a great comment about the ethnic division through lines like "Dracula is a brotha?", "We brothas should stay together" and "Once you turn black, you do not come back". Speaking of the black characters, one of them is interpreted by Coolio. Playing a stereotyped stoner, Coolio possibly becomes the most annoying and ridiculous vampire in history. Oh wait, second most ridiculous vampire of all. That precious title is for our friend COUNT ORLOCK, of PLANET TRANSYLVANIA, in the CARPATHIAN SYSTEM. These two make a good pair, between Coolio's attempts to paralyze a paraplegic, the strange attempts to make high-pitched animal noises, a 1004-year-old hairstyle, and the GIGANTIC sections of completely useless dialogues; and the generic vampire costume of Count Orlock's Halloween style, the exploding coffins, or the confusingly inane back story. <br /> <br /> One wonders if they did not give Coolio the chance to get "as high as a kite in space without gravity", allow him to interact with the other "actors", and simply departed from there. <br /> <br /> Count Orlock's motivations are also somewhat in doubt. Do you want "infinite darkness", as you would believe in the subtitle of the movie? Do you want to eat the crew? Or do you want * Coolio * "kill them all"? Or do you want to give disabled people a chance in such an inhospitable future? It really does not matter, because in no way the plot of this movie makes sense. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie is that it is ending. More for the fact that it means that the movie has ended more than for any merit of the abrupt burst of trains of the climax in which they call before the credits. Instead of facing Count Orlock in a kind of duel (the closest we come to is from an Orlock shot at dizzying speeds in front of our protagonist, who dies shortly afterwards), our heroes beat him by cutting off his arm in a normal way. door. Then, Orlock begins to collapse, squeaking in pain at a totally worldly but understandably painful injury. This is, by far, the most fun you'll get from this movie. Seeing the contorted face of a vampire while crying in pain will have you on the edge of your seat, with laughter. It's almost worth the four dollars for that alone. Of course, right after that, they treat us with one of the worst phrases of a movie, the obligatory allusion to sex and, perhaps, the EXCUSE MORE ABRUPT FOR A FINAL * ALWAYS *. They are driving towards the sun, and their ship literally explodes before they even approach the impact. I think they just beat the Wachowski brothers. for the worst end of the story. <br /> <br /> I can only sleep at night because we know that a sequel is impossible. Given this fact, we can safely say that this is the WORST MOVIE THAT HAS BEEN CREATED, and one that will never be surpassed with the quality, the lowest budget and the lowest acting talent.
