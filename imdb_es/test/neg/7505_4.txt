Zombie Planet seems to be an example of good ideas and laudable ambition that exceeds the budget. I thought that the explanation for the zombies was really original and twisted, and I loved the dog eating at the scene of the exhibition. The rest of the gore was effective on a low budget, but too spaced throughout the film. The problem was that it was too long and anti-climatic. Sure, they had an intriguing plot, though derivative, and a similarly familiar but great scenario, but a low budget zombie movie really needs to be goretastic to make an impression and there were not enough red moments in this for me. I think there was also an excess of cheap and bloodless fighting scenes, especially considering the general minimum level. Also, for a two-hour movie, there is very little closing at the end, and although I'm a bit anxious to track down Zombie Planet 2, I felt a bit cheated. So probably the most worth looking for both.
