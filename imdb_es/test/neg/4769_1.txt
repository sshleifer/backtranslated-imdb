First of all, I saw another critic who said that this movie was "fantastic". Well, nothing could be further from the truth! This movie is complete garbage !!! A horror comedy that is not even a little funny. Do not take that means it's so bad that it's good because it's not. It is a total waste of time and money! <br /> <br /> This is what I see in this loss of a DVD. A group of friends meets in a weekend, gets drunk and then decides to make a video in the backyard. They take the video camera from mom and dad and start creating scenes in the place. Everyone likes to watch the camera's cup themselves. They think, if they think it's fun, then everyone will think it's fun. Well, they are wrong. This homemade video of the backyard is garbage. The "acting" and the effects of comedy gore are terrible, but I suppose that is to be expected since this is not more than a homemade video. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I think the fact that this shit has gone out there gives hope to anyone who wants to make a movie. If these people could get their film made and released on DVD, anyone can do it! <br /> <br /> 0 / 10-- Save your money.
