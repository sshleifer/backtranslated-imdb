Other commentators have described this film as "Classic SciFi from the 50s" with an intelligent use of archival images and documentaries, and the intelligent interaction of the characters. <br /> <br /> Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is classic SciFi from 1950 ... but SciFi from 1950 at its worst stupid moment. <br /> <br /> Consider that the first prey of the Mantis is a radar station that is first displayed from the air and then on the ground. .. but the station is (from the air) represented as on the top of a mountain, with snow on one side and semi dark terrain on the other side, but when (on the ground) researchers visit the site, Suddenly it's on a flat, uniformly white plain, miles from the nearest mountain. <br /> <br /> Consider also, the ridiculous pseudo-scientific babbling of the highly recommended expert who is taken to examine a huge claw. He says: "Well, we know one thing ... it can not come from an animal, because all known animal species have a skeletal skeleton, even reptiles and birds have bones." Then he goes on to say that some creatures ... snails, shellfish, insects ... do not have bone skeletons. Excuuuuse Let's define "animal", here. Even in the 1950s, someone over the age of six could not take this man as an expert in biology, since he clearly does not know what an "animal" is, nor can he name several broad categories of animals that lack skeletal skeletons. (sharks, rays, jellyfish, insects, molluscs, arthropods, gastropods, sponges, arachnids, echinoderms ... you can think of the idea). The characters are cardboard, 2D types ... scientist, partner's girlfriend, big bad monster. Nothing here shows any sense of creativity. There is no pulse, there are no signs of life. <br /> <br /> There are no clever dialogues, special effects are foolish even for their time, and archival images are used with reckless disregard for continuity. This is a B movie at its worst, with a production team that clearly would not bother to even try. <br /> <br /> Use sparingly, as sleeping medicine or as punishment for young children who are easy to use. Offended by bad science.
