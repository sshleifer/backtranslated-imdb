Wow .. where do I start? I rented this movie because it sounded like something I would be interested to see. With a name like Val Kilmer starring in this movie, I thought how bad it could be. This has to be the worst movie I've seen with a name so big that it's attributed to it. I wondered why he was slipping through the cracks and I never remember hearing anything about it when he first came out. It starts quite well, and it reminds one of the introductory sequence in the Bourne identity, but after the first 30 minutes, it goes from bad to worse and then enters the WTF territory. If you have not seen this, do yourself a favor and do not rent / buy it unless you are a masochist or in a search to see all the Val Kilmer movies out there. There are many more titles that deserve their time. This movie (if you can call it that) is a good waste of time. I want my 82 minutes back.
