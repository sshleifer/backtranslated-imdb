If this is the best Commander Hamilton movie, I'm not curious about the others. <br /> <br /> The best tools of a film actor are his eyes, but when Peter Stormare wants to show great emotion, he closes his own, so for five or six seconds we get to admire his eyelids while his feelings they remain unknown behind them. Lousy acting technique. <br /> <br /> Stormare also shudders sometimes when he fires a gun, turns his head and closes his eyes. Look carefully. James Bond can rest easy with a competition like this. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting performances by other actors, but not enough to hang a full movie. The cinematography is attractive, doing a good job capturing the Nordic cold. Even the Sahara ends up looking cold. Maybe Hamilton brings his own climate with him. <br /> <br /> Here are some good individual action sequences. Unfortunately, the only sense of humor on the screen belongs to the villain, who turns the hero into a great pill. James Bond jokes may not be particularly good, but at least he does not get constipated all the time. <br /> <br /> A positive point in favor of the film is that the psychotic, contorted and vicious hatred of Israel in Guillou. The books have been left out. What has been maintained is the cult of a noble and heroic PLO, which shows us functioning in Libya without the knowledge or supervision of the Khaddafi dictator. This fantasy is hard to believe, since Khaddafi actually threw the PLO out of Libya for four years at a time. And at the end of the movie, Hamilton gives the PLO a very disturbing gift. Where will they use that gift? Hamilton does not care. <br /> <br /> We are very, very far from "For whom the bell tolls". <br /> <br /> Commander Hamilton will remain a local phenomenon. While Henning Mankell's books sell well all over the world, Jan Guillou will never have the same success. <br /> <br /> Regarding this movie, bleeeeaaahhhhh.
