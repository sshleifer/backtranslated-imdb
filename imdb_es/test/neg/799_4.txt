In 1976, a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night, a box is placed in the door of his house and the next morning they open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key. At the end of the afternoon, a man with a terrible scar on his face comes to his door and presents Norma with an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and he announces that if they press the button, someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash. If you do not press, nothing will happen and the offer will be moved to another person. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone, including their son, about this agreement. The incentive for the family to press the button is greater because of their financial difficulties. Arthur, who currently works for NASA, can not be accepted for a new job for which he requests and Norma, who is a teacher, learns that her faculty funding is being cut. <br /> <br /> The enjoyment of one by this strange The science fiction thriller, based on the story "Button Button" by Richard Matheson, will be determined by how far they are willing to reach this absurd premise. The opening of the film is particularly problematic because it is based on a sense of realism with the home. Richard Kelly's previous film, Donnie Darko, skilfully used the condition of schizophrenia to justify his excursion to paranormal activity and parallel universes. Without the dream-like state of that superior movie, The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world, it's completely unlikely. Norma also accepts someone in her house who has almost the same scar as The Dark Knight's Two-Face and believes that this offer seems equally contrived. <br /> <br /> If this sounds unlikely until now, what follows is the following. even more absurd, involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning, the possibility that an extraterrestrial life or some other divine being will influence these situations. Scenes that involve access doors that open into public libraries, random nosebleeds and senseless drones that lurk the Lewis family, become almost mindless comics in their absurdity. Up to a point, the movie could be called intriguing simply to see where it is going. Kelly is occasionally intelligent in her ability to maintain our attention through many of the movie gadgets. In one scene, Norma is teaching a class and then a strange child asks her about her foot. He makes fun of her because he's missing four toes. Later, at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding attended by Norma and Arthur, this same student appears as a waitress and seems to be harassing them. However, the eventual justification of all these oddities is wrapped in a highly artificial science fiction revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly from the beginning, many of the moral implications that were initially promised decrease for much of the duration of the images. The end, which will not be spoiled here, reappears again these moral questions with the hope of repeating the Greek tragedy. While you can see the similarities, at this point, given the improbability of much of the film and the uneven performances, there is little reason to worry. The southern accent of Cameron Diaz may be unnecessary, but surprisingly, Langella is the most disappointing of the film, with a very poorly written role, as the mysterious scarred man, who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud . It really is just a shadow of his impressive performance in Frost / Nixon. There is not much to do for many of the other actors in the film; in particular, both Norma and Arthur could not be considered as characters but as spokespersons for Kelly's ideas. Undeveloped and brief conversations, like when Norma sympathizes with Arlington for her deformities and also when Norma and Arthur wonder if they really know each other in case the button kills them, highlights this. <br /> <br /> Since 2001, Richard Kelly has not been able to make a film that has lived up to the quality and imagination of Donnie Darko. Although this film can be intriguing for a while, it is too absurd and implausible to enjoy it in its entirety and, of course, it would not justify multiple presentations due to the rather illogical revelations of the film. Sci-fi fans might appreciate it a bit more and draw their own conclusions, but what Kelly is really trying to say below the surface is still cryptic. The Box is a movie this year that should have been archived.
