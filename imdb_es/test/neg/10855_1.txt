This is the possibility, the worst and most disappointing movie I've seen in my life. I have spent four years in two universities and I know there must be a good movie about the experience. This is not like this. The "acting" is terrible and the plot does not exist. <br /> <br /> Here are some incidents from my year in student residences. <br /> <br /> 1) An elegant boy who unknowingly got off with a transvestite. 2) The best couple of two friends: one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname "the brick". 3) A couple that shag too strong. 4) The boy who gets all the girls 5) The boy from Northern Ireland who is very difficult to understand. 6) McDonalds in bed 7) Curry every night for a week 8) Hit the students, some of my classmates ended up in the hospital 9) The discarded joint that started a fire. 10) The flood 11) The boy who wakes up in his apartment to find that each piece of furniture has been removed from his room. <br /> <br /> And if I can find that list in 5 minutes and in real life, I'm sure a couple of writers can do better, much better. <br /> <br /> And for a movie that goes by the name of a Sleeper song, where's the Britpop soundtrack?
