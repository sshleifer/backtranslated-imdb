"Tart" is a pathetic attempt to make movies that roams among a group of teenagers in Manhattan exploring all the usual things of teenagers ... sex, drugs and classical music almost completely without history, focus or purpose. Griffith is in the film for about 2 minutes, while Swain works diligently on his long list of dog movies. Nothing in this movie works and Wayne should consider getting a real job. Not recommended for anyone. PU! Ugh! (RE)
