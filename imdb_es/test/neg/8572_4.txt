Six students in a convent do the unthinkable: kill a nun who was dominant. Now, eighteen years later, the spirit of the nun is back and she is taking revenge for her murder. <br /> <br /> Yes, basically that's it. There is more than that, but I still have no idea what it is. The only really great thing is the effects on the spiritual nun, since I was very impressed by being a lower budget movie. I am also confused as to whether or not he is in English. Most of the actors are Italian, and even the title here is in Italian, however, they spoke English in the movie (I think, or it could have been dubbed, I still can not say it). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the real premise of the movie is pretty stupid, and the end does not just make no sense, but ... well ... it does not make sense.
