The man was so hard to see! It was not funny at all, it was not well done and I had no point or argument at all. The acting was horrible. It was not well done at all. It seemed that a group of children my age were playing and making a meaningless movie. It is by far the worst broken lizard movie. If you're a broken lizard movie like me, you'll be disappointed and bored to death. please, skip this meaningless movie about ugly guys looking for girls. You will not regret my advice. By the way, do not say that this review was not useful simply because you did not agree with it. That's stupid, like this movie. the only correct scene was when the main player was playing rugby and he managed to beat the shit. I liked that because I found his character pretty damn annoying.
