Tonight I saw 5% of this movie and you can tell me that I need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly I do not think so. <br /> <br /> What the hell is the story in this movie? I saw many people running in a factory, shooting at everything around them. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well ... <br /> <br /> 1) They were shooting around the place like it was the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The whole place is made of metal, but not a single bullet fired on metal surfaces. <br /> <br /> 2) No bounce. Metal vs. metal is meant to cause rebounding, but apparently no one was hit by a stray bullet. <br /> <br /> 3) Magical bullets? In one scene, a bad man stands in front of a good man when another good man appears behind the bad man and fills it with metal. You see that the bullets come out of his chest when he explodes in a bloody fog, but the good man who is right in front of him is not hurt at all! 4) After splashing a human being all over the wall, the two good guys tell jokes and laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft weapons. <br /> <br /> 5) Sound? At one point, the good guys cut a wire and an alarm sounds (who the hell cuts a cable just to sound an alarm?). The lady shouts "Alarm in the sector blah, blah" and the boss of the bad guy says "It's okay ... this ... is ... not ... a ... exercise .. blah blah" in a very , very amateur. Ooh, we're being ambushed by terrorists, this is not a simulation, but I'm going to sound like I do not care. <br /> <br /> 6) Focus! First you see the bad guys carrying weapons. For some reason, the same guy gets the same Uzi twice. Leave vu or loop of scenes? Literally, you see that all the bad guys receive the same type of weapon and they are blocked and charged in the same way. The arms dealer appears in the clip and the bad boy does not. XX locks and loads. When they started to open fire, you had to see the flashes of the cannon. Boooring !! 7) Actors or mannequins? One of the supposed good men throws a smoke grenade for some reason and, of course, the bad guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they are blind to smoke or something, so they do not see it coming. They cough and moan as if it were anthrax in the grenade. Then a bad semi-boss arrives and he does not even cough when he enters the smoke, he just drives away the bad guys and suddenly they realize that the smoke is not Anthrax anyway. <br /> <br /> 8) B flick? I think so! A guy who slides down a metal tube holding an Uzi in his right hand, apparently shooting someone at the height of his eye. I'd like to see a guy shoot an Uzi with one hand and I'd like to see him go find his hand after. Extra bloody mess in a B-type movie a bit. The small pops * and a red hole with a torn shirt indicate that this guy is dead. Although the first bullet hit his heart, the good man who is a trained green super beret still feels the need to empty his clip on the dead man. <br /> <br /> 9) One of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out of His skin with an empty clip! How stupid can you be !? Always check your clip before facing an unknown number of enemies! 10) Boring scenes. Like the barrel scenes and the blocking and loading scenes, the film is full of scenes that waste the time of people running in a seemingly empty building. Go to the action if you want a B movie, please. <br /> <br /> My two cents in this movie.
