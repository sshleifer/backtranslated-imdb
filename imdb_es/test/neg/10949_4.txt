The concept: show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the Fairfax district of L.A. preparing for the family reunion on Thanksgiving Day. I loved Soul Food and how to make an American quilt (I think there is a law according to which Alfre Woodard has to be in all these films) that, similarly, offered a pastiche of family traditions and was prepared for a gift. Instead, I felt cheated. They trot around more than 40 characters, and all but two are cliches of a note without any finesse. Writers and the director must spend a few more years learning about life and learning how loving people from different generations relate to each other. Instead, you have a lot of ** holes that meet on Turkey Day to act as an extra-nasty ** hole. Now, to some extent, this is what Thanksgiving is all about. But, it is not wrong. And why bother to have Julianne Marguiles and then give her absolutely nothing to do? It was a difficult task to overcome, and Mercedes Ruehl is an outstanding one, but I give it a 4/10.
