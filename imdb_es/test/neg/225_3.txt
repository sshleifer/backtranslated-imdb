After reading Fool For Love in one of my drama classes, I was looking forward to seeing how the wonderful work of Sam Shepard would be translated to the screen. To my dismay, it was not at all as entertaining as the play. The film seemed to crawl, the music was not appropriate for the tone of the film, and all the raw energy of the work seemed to have been extracted from this film version. It is a shame to see this happen in this way, even with the participation of Shepard, playing the role of Eddie. Do yourself a favor ... look at the play the next time it's done in your area or just read the book instead.
