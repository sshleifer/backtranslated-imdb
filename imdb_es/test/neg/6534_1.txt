Plot: <br /> <br /> - An eBay chair <br /> <br /> - Random people <br /> <br /> - Random people speak ("Friend, it's okay". "I am feeling it. "" Let's get married now! ") <br /> <br /> - If you are a" hippie "then you will love this movie. (You must be drugged or drunk, otherwise you will question your life seeing this garbage). <br /> <br /> This movie was clearly not intended from the beginning to the end, and the other comments are probably the team's fill-in comments. If this was not addressed to my demographic group, I do not know what it is for. The plot I found boring every day. It's something I would do, and believe me, it's not worth filming. Going on tour and filming half the silence does not make a movie!
