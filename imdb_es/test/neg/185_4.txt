Do not get me wrong I really love the "sand martial arts genre," and I'm increasingly surprised by how many movies like this one out there. This is one of those, and it's not even close to being one of the best. With Mathias Hues in it, I thought it would be good. However, you can not save this movie, and to be honest, it was not very good either. Just do not pay attention to what other people say; The fight scenes in this movie are not good at all. I really know what I'm talking about, since I've seen so many movies like this one. There are also a lot of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot at all. I guess they added them just to make the movie last a little longer, in addition to manifesting the bad guy as, uuuuuuh ....... bad (as if we did not already know).
