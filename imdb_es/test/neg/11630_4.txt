Mickey Rourke is enjoying a rebirth at this moment ... and a fair game for him. I have always liked his image and his ability to act on topics such as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you'll get with Rourke: bad, bad-tempered, dirty. But this movie gives you much more, and you do not want most of it. <br /> <br /> First of all, all this simply does not make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA assassin who, after killing a busload of schoolchildren, flees from Ireland to London. He is fleeing from the police and from his own army comrades. He has also vowed not to kill again. It seems that the bus full of children finally did it for him. <br /> <br /> However, when he arrives in London, he is spotted by a local mobster (Bates, who looks like his eyebrows and hair came out of a Burton's Dummy) to kill his main competitor for 50,000 pounds and a boat trip to the US UU Rourke reluctantly agrees to do so, but is seen by a priest (Hoskins) and confesses the crime in the confessional to keep the priest's mouth shut. He thinks it's better than killing him. <br /> <br /> Here are a lot of things that just do not add up: <br /> <br /> 1. Why choose Rourke in your competition? As illustrated by a scene in which an employee is immobilized on a wall by a pair of heavy with what look like pimples: these guys in London are strong enough to perform their own killing. <br /> <br /> 2. Not only that, but the Mobster gets a man to follow Rourke and witness the murder with his own eyes. Why did not that guy just kill the competitor and save all the trouble of dealing with Rourke? <br /> <br /> 3.Hoskins sees how the murder takes place and the police let him go, without protection, I can add, to confess? No way. <br /> <br /> 4. Rourke hangs around the church (right next to where he committed the murder) immediately after the crime is carried out to confess. Why are not the police officers checking the place? <br /> <br /> 5. Rourke hangs around the church and the blind niece of Hoskin in particular, during the following days without anyone bothering him. What? Are you running away and staying in the same place where you committed another murder? Stupid. <br /> <br /> 6. The cops actually meet Rourke in the church "fixing" the organ and have no idea who he is. Do not they know that he is fleeing because of the bombing of the school bus? They do not even watch him? <br /> <br /> 7. Why get Rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait a few days to get on the ship? You would think that you would want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? <br /> <br /> 8. Why does Bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the middle of all the waiting? Could not you hold back for a few days? At least until Rourke has been transferred to the United States? Ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 9. Rourke suddenly has internal turmoil after all his years of murder and beats the blind niece immediately, even after she knows that he is a killer, do you still love him? ? Once again, absolutely ridiculous. And besides, she falls in love with him in record time, a few days! <br /> <br /> 10. The question of the bomb at the end is simply silly from Bates' point of view. <br /> <br /> 11. Things happen in parts of this movie that just do not make sense or are just there to help the story (and I say it in jest). Bates lodges Rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly shows moral ground to respect the bitch in the house, but still sleeps with a blind girl. <br /> <br /> 12. Rourke asks a minion in the boat where Bates is, and the henchman practically spits out his boss's complete movements in less than 10 seconds. It was shameful, the boy was telling Rourke a lot more than he even asked. <br /> <br /> 13. Hoskin's priest is a former soldier and we see him beat three henchmen behind a pub. Totally out of place and another scene that is worth it. <br /> <br /> I'll stop there in the unfortunate 13 without mentioning Rourke's hair (so fake red that it's ridiculous), his accent (which to be fair is not too bad sometimes, but deteriorates to a whisper barely heard on other occasions, his clothes, walk, look at the sky, etc. Nor will I mention the music and the choppy editing style. <br /> <br /> Oooppps - I just mentioned them. <br /> <br /> In general, a disaster of a film with some obvious religious images thrown (Rourke on the cross, preaching from a pulpit) that would embarrass a first-year film student, not caring about anything, star and director. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
