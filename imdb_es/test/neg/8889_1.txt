This movie is so bad that you can not believe it. Even for a low-budget independent film ... it's just that, well, it stinks. I can not even believe that Troma would throw so much garbage. I've been a fan of some Troma movies for years (Toxic Avenger, Squeeze Play, Rockabilly Vampire, to name a few). But LLoyd, come on, this goes beyond the limits of any taste. It presents some of the worst performances imaginable. I think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been so good ... oh, wait, that's what they did. I mean it, these characters have a negative charisma. Without luck, the producer and director of this film will have a great karmic debt because of this atrocity. Like people with special effects. But beyond the terrible performance and the horrible special effects, the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears. The script is full of raster holes the size of Alaska, and there are serious continuity issues. The worst part, however, is that it is not entertaining even in the smallest way. And this is the most unforgivable sin in the making of movies. But, do not trust my word. Go out and ruin four dollars by renting it. Do not say I did not warn you.
