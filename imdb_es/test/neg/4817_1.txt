Fully brain-made actuator in the Philippines. This belongs to the way Filipino films tried to pass as American films in the international market. After a pretty boring start, the movie takes off and never disappoints. Actually, it's a scam of the worst movies Chuck Norris ever made: an American prisoner in Vietnam is brainwashed by soviets who put a microchip in his brain and is scheduled to kill the Pope, and then the President of the United States. United. One of his old friends (played by the unconditional film B, Max Thayer) is sent to stop him. Absolutely ridiculous action scenes, putrid acting (Nick Nicholson's performance as the evil Soviet commander is something to be seen!) And an implausible argument that offsets one of the most cheesy action images ever given to the general public.
