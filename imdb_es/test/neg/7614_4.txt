I'm still waiting for that dark movie of muppets where we will not know how it ends from the beginning. I think Linklater could do one that he has experimented with animation. This time, intelligently, I did not expect such a thing, but I deeply wanted it. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusack reeked. She moved to a level made for television acting lazily with cynical clich√©. The muppets were more life-living than her. A disappointment. <br /> <br /> But then the whole movie was, Bar Pepe. I loved him He was the only one who made me laugh (while Goldbergh, like God, made me choke and curse). If we can not see a dark muppets, how about at least one PG: 13 one with more of the controversial jokes of Pepe and the character of Animal head, egg-nog-chuggin. <br /> <br /> The worst Muppets? He even saw the bored villain villain to this one. Muppets should avoid this during vacations marketed. <br /> <br /> 5/10
