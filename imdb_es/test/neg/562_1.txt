The Man with Bogart's Face prepares to undermine the nostalgia of the spectators for the cinematographic era of the late 30s and late 40s. It fails miserably for several reasons. First, Sacchi, although he reasonably resembles Bogart and even talks like him occasionally and uses his manners, is completely lacking in Bogart's charisma or acting ability. This is really evident when Sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of Bogart's films. Secondly, the film does not have the actors of first level characters with whom Bogart could work. There's no Peter Lorre or Sydney Greenstreet in this, folks. Of course we are treated by the performances of Victor Buaeno, Olivia Hussey and George Raft, among others, but they are not of the same caliber (or they are not given enough screen time or they are of poor quality). Third, attempts at "modern" humor fail. All the underwear jokes, with Marlowe almost * never * take off the damn hat and the raincoat (although Bogart would have done it), etc. They just are not fun and they really pull this movie down. Fourth, I've never heard a funnier song on this side of Mitchell. Finally, the false reverence of the film by Bogart (and the work of other classical actors) is truly irritating. Bogart almost * never * played a direct hero, on those occasions he was a hero. He played complicated characters. This film makes Bogart become a moralist and happy good intentionalist. While this may have been true with respect to some characters in the film, Bogart's characters rarely conform to that law. It is films like this that make people who are not exposed to the cinema of the past think that all this is very bad, "the good boy overcomes the bad guys and takes the girl" with the values ​​of low production.
