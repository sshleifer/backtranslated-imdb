What a waste of time. I spent about five minutes and I became very anxious, and soon I moved forward a little, and very soon the desire to take my thumb off the fast-forward button did not exist. The actors Mark Redfield and Barry Murphy did very capable jobs, I thought, but no one else I saw gave anything like a good performance. Again, take this review with a big grain of salt because the movie was so unbearable that I could not get to the end. Heck, I could not get to the middle !! <br /> <br /> I can not send this review because it is not long enough. Maybe this last sentence puts it above.
