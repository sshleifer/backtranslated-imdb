Talk about false advertising! What was this doing in the comedy section of my video rental place? I think maybe there was a laughable part in the movie. I can appreciate the black comedy, but this only had the blackness without comedy. The film was generally disturbing and not funny. Yes, Kevin Spacey was as good as Buddy and the rest of the cast was good too, but in general the film collapses because we really do not see a good enough reason for Guy (Whaley) to lose his mind. The ending was disappointing too. What would be Buddy's motivation to let Guy get away with it? This is not really explained at all. Why would Buddy go for such a plan? Would not it be more like Buddy ruining Guy completely by handing him over to the police? The ending did not seem to make much sense to me, no matter how I saw it. <br /> <br /> In general, I did not like the movie despite the good performance. Spacey essentially chews the stage for most of the movie, but towards the end it gives Buddy some of the necessary humanity. The story was not as good as the cast.
