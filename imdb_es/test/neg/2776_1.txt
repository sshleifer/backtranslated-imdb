In the Muslim country of Khalid (fictional), his benevolent leader / dictator, Reed Hadley as Amir, is dying of cancer. Amir dies and a desperate plot develops. His body is wrapped in aluminum foil and taken in a clandestine operation (the population does not know of his death) consisting of his doctor (Nigserian) and Mohammed, out of the country to perform a risky brain transplant. The surgery is performed by Dr. Kent Taylor, who is in disgrace, because he believes there is no possibility of failure and that he has two assistants. One of them is about 3 feet tall (Master Blaster did run Barter Town) and the other is a mutilated and traumatized giant of 7 feet called Gor. What could go wrong? <br /> <br /> Did I forget to mention Amir's American deathbed, Barbie's blond wife, Tracy or that Dr. Kent has a dungeon with proof subjects of slaves and delusions of grandeur? How about a brain transplant that you did not take? There's a lot of double dealing throughout this and people are killed, but I'm not going to lie to you anymore: MISSION FULFILLED. The end justifies the means. If you can accept that, then you will not have to waste 80 minutes. I hope that is enough warning. Do not say I did not warn you. If you have to look, do not look alone and have enough medications waiting. <br /> <br /> -Rehabilitation of celluloids
