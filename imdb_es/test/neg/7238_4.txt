When I saw the first octopus movie it was a laugh to see the cheesy performance and the terrible effects. This movie seemed to compensate for the performance, but not the special effects. After Jaws and Piranha, of course, why not make a movie about a killer octopus? The octopus invades the waters of New York, where 2 police investigators try to stop the furious beast before July 4. <br /> <br /> A pretty clean plot and descent events, but the octopus was pretty scary, it's nice to see it actually accomplished this time, but it looked like a piece of plastic ... Better in a big budget really, This movie could have been a good watch. There is a continuous amount of errors in which I would not be surprised if they did not investigate the way the octopus lives ... <br /> <br /> Check this out if you like the cheap DVD sequels, otherwise, you will see better Jaws.
