** Possible Spoilers ** From Dreamworks and director Peter Chan, 'The Love Letter' is a romantic comedy set in a picturesque coastal town in New England where single mother Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a quaint bookstore. One day at work, Helen encounters an anonymous letter (the "love letter" of the title) that has somehow stayed under the cushions of a reading couch. When reading the prose prose in it, she believes that it has been written to her, deliberately placed on the sofa for her to find, and, for reasons of her own, believes that she knows the identity of her secret admirer. However, without realizing it, Helen leaves the letter where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds her, believes it is for her and, of course, believes that she knows who wrote it. The circumstances then put it in the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who thinks that Helen has written the letter. And before everything is resolved, you can only imagine the funny situations in which all those involved have been thrown out; and I mean to imagine, because of the way in which this film develops, the audience gets little more than what it contributes. There are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably: it's just not very romantic and it's not funny; and that is a powerful combination that makes this movie catch fire practically since the first credits. Once the configuration and the main character (Helen) has been established, it basically goes nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so. The moment you finally discover who wrote the letter and who could care less. Rounding out the cast are Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan. It's a shame to see how much talent is wasted in a trap like this, and it looks bad in the balance. Kate Capshaw, who usually lights up the screen just by appearing, looks tired here, while Selleck seems to have just come out of a three-day doubler that lasted a week. Ellen DeGeneres actually goes and looks like the best of all. It is said that travel is often an experience more exciting than destiny. However, in the case of 'The Love Letter', it would have been better for all concerned if, in the first place, everyone had stayed at home. I rate this one 1/10.
