However, it must be said that perhaps more in the United States than to say, here in the United Kingdom it can still be a sensitive issue. Just look at the debacle of homosexuals in the military sector a few years ago in the United States. With 'In and Out', the writer Paul Rudnick adheres to the small-town mentality of the middle of the United States and the way in which the press in the United States (as well as in the United Kingdom) do great business in the exit of a celebrity. You only need to see when Will Young and Stephen Gately from Boyzone came out of the closet. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), a high school English teacher in his hometown. The local people are preparing for the Oscar night, since one of the nominees Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) came from his city and was a student of Howards. Cameron, who plays a gay soldier in a Vietnamese epic, wins the award just for the fact that Howard is gay during his acceptance speech. This can not be a worse time for Howard, who is one day away from marrying his fianc√© and Professor Emily. (Joan Cusack) As expected, the media reaction is catastrophic and Turn's Howards life turns upside down. He not only tries to convince his family and friends that he is not gay, but evades the sordid news reporter Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck). <br /> <br /> Although it was presented as a comedy of madness, it is clear that Rudnick and director Frank Oz are also trying to be satirical. You just have to look at the early scenes of the Oscar ceremony and the way the people in Bracketts' hometown and the school's teaching council react to his departure. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film does not fulfill the promise we see at the beginning of the film. This is a pretty flat attempt. to make social commentaries of a crazy comedy. Unfortunately a good cast is wasted on a script that never offers the amount of nessecary laughs and is not as insightful as it seems. <br /> <br /> Kline gives us the same kind of endearing performance he gave us in his previous comedy "Dave," making Howard a sympathetic character instantly.Cusack is also of great value since the fiance obsessed with the Howard's weight, while Tom Selleck plays very well against the kind of gay news reporter, Bob Newhart is also a joy, as director of the high school where Howard works, it's great to see him on the big screen for a change. It's a shame it had to be this. <br /> <br /> Performances as good as they are can do little to keep the movie from being a pretty boring affair, while a couple of scenes do offer a bit of fun. the inspired scene in which Howard tries to appear more manly when he listens to a self-help tape.There is little to enjoy, and when things can not get worse, Rudnick turns to a sickly ending that teeters on the upper feeling. to avoid feeling that my intelligence was being insulted. It seems that Minoy is too weak a character to become the man who put his ethics before getting a good story, while Cammeron finally comes to the rescue at the climax of the movie. Being a character too involved to worry about what happens to your former teacher. After all, it was he who caused all the problems in the first place. <br /> <br /> 'In and Out' is not exactly dire. But when you consider that people like Klines work better as 'A Fish named Wanda' you can not help but feel that here is a great talent that is sadly wasted. <br /> <br /> Robs Rating: * *
