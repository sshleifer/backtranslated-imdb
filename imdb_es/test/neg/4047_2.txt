This has to be one of the weakest arguments in a movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> However, it is not all that is missing from this movie. This movie has the worst performance, writing, direction, special effects, whatever, it's the worst of all. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you devote your time to worthwhile films and do not waste your time on this garbage. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous post that "women" were definitely men dressed as drag, and that made me laugh, I keep trying to find out if they were obvious or if they were really trying to be sexy women. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is not much else in this movie that is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> In short: horrible acting, horrible script, horrible idea for a movie. An hour and a half of my life I want to go back NOW!
