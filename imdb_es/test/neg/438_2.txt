I wanted to see An American Werewolf in Paris for a long time because he loved his predecessor, but this movie did not impress me as much as An American Werewolf in London. Actually, to be honest, it did not impress me at all. <br /> <br /> Tom Everett-Scott and his uncles friends are roaming Paris and, in a ridiculous bungee trick in front of the Eifel Tower, rescuing the wolves. Baby Julie Delpy of death. Before having time to work if the constant robbery and bulky dialogue are comedy things, the full moon has arrived and the brats are being persecuted by terrible CGI werewolves in the Parisian sewers. <br /> <br /> The script is disgustingly poor, the actors were created to make this movie, they are horrible performances that match the state of the movie. From beginning to end, this film is never entertaining, attractive or even a little visible. To be honest, I had trouble seeing this whole movie without throwing up my dinner. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are not exciting, the jokes are not funny and the werewolves are not scary. In short: lose yourself or stay enchanted forever. <br /> <br /> I rate an American werewolf in Paris 2 out of 10.
