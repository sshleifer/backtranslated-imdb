"A new generation" is the third entry of Amityville that bases its plot around the premise of the writer John G. Jones of an article taken from the house of Long Island that causes spectral misery and death to its new owners. First a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. However, this is also the first Amityville since 'The Possession' which is directly related to the real life events that started the whole series. On this occasion, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, receives a macabre-looking mirror for a homeless man one day. Soon, the people around him begin to die, which eventually leads him to discover that the mirror once hung in the Amityville house, in fact, the same night as a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in 'Amityville II ') murdered his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry, her discovery of the mirror is not entirely a coincidence, and she soon discovers the truth about her past, a truth that has remained buried since childhood. <br /> <br /> This seventh installment in the often-worn franchise is somewhat disappointing to me. Things started to improve with the stupid and unequal, but at the same time entertaining 'It's About Time', and given how much this film tries to build on its roots, not in the first episode, but in the source material, it should have been better than it was. <br /> <br /> However, three trips to the same well with another evil artifact from the Amityville house with yet another explanation for the evil paranormal visits are wearing me down, to say the least. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the determination of each group of producers to completely ignore all other episodes in the series. On the one hand, it is perfectly reasonable that they do not want to be tied to the continuity of another person, but at least they could recognize the lines of history that have already been made and possibly not repeat them again and again. *. <br /> <br /> There is also something quite annoying about the way the story unfolds, no doubt due to the inevitability that this repetition-fest brings. As you already know what is going to happen, the careful accumulation is simply slow and tedious. Or maybe it's tedious anyway. Director John Murlowski probably could have done more to intensify the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror instead of simply having it blink red and emit "evil" voices, which lack subtlety. There were times when the characters seemed quite immaculate because of their otherworldly qualities. If they do not take it very seriously, why should we? <br /> <br /> What is a shame, because 'A New Generation' has a more than capable cast. I was going to wait to see this until I saw the name 'Julia Nickson' in the credits. She captivated my attention as she always does, and in any case, it bothered me that her part was not more extensive. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and, again, underutilized. Partridge, in the lead role, clearly fits the square-jawed heroes of the early '90s, and although I'm not sure he's really given the necessary gravity, it's not like someone is doing Ibsen. <Br /> <br /> The sets are also worthy of mention, from the dramatic works of art that fill Suki's room, to the claustrophobic hallways that appear in the flashback / supernatural sequences. Obtaining the correct aspect of these is especially important given that certain sequences are repeated throughout the film in simulated fragmented memories. Clearly, Murlowski is more a visual director than an actor director or one of horror. Unfortunately, it is meant to be a horror movie, after all. <br /> <br /> 'A New Generation' sees the same race for the third time in 4 years. Add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and all the effort is not kept as high as it should be. However, it should be recognized for its strong links to the source material and some good actors, not necessarily at its best. Honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who has not seen any of the sequels beyond 'The Possession', for whom the story will not be a massive voyage of deja-vu.
