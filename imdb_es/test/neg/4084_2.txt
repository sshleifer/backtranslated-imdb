The only way to feel good about giving you these precious minutes of my life is to tell someone how horrible it was. And even if I say it once a day, every day for the rest of my life I will not express it completely. Simply silly. <br /> <br /> There is a difference in movies like this and movies like Elephant or Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid, two of my other less favorite movies. The last two were terrible, yes, but that was it. Evan Almighty takes a strong cast and tries to kill them all. Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, John Goodman and Steve Carrell ... WHY GOD WHY? All these people have much better talent, now every time I see any of them I will think about this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him a 2 instead of a 1 was when I saw the movie. , there was an old woman with mental problems who thought that the barrage of birds poop and jokes that were hurt with tools while she was building were so funny that she did not stop laughing all the time, she almost caressed them several times.
