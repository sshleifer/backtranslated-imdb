THE GOOD: The performance was excellent, especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> THE BAD: I am a visible minority (not white) and I have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT despite the experiences of my life and the theme of the film, I would definitely NOT say that this movie is the best of the year, in fact, it is far from that. I have problems with this film both from the perspective of the viewer and from the perspective of a visible minority. Some of my problems with this movie are: <br /> <br /> (1) Poor development of the characters (or none). Just because we saw the extremes in a character, for example, Matt Dillon is a racist cop and a good caretaker of his sick father, that does not mean in any way that the character is well developed. Yes, I admit that in a great cast as in this movie, it is quite difficult that all the characters are well developed, BUT that does not mean that none of the characters should be like that. <br /> <br /> (2) The dialogue seems really contrived to the point that I am really surprised that this movie won for Best Original Screenplay. They should show this film in a script writing class NOT because it's good, but to show the students and future script writers what NOT to do. I felt that I had hit my head again and again because of how bad racism was. I get it. <br /> <br /> (3) The plot seems to be a coincidence, it's laughable. What are the chances that a black car thief will run over an Asian man who is also a trafficker when he gets into his truck, and that same black car thief ended up stealing that Asian man's truck several hours after he had taken to the hospital only to discover that the various Asians who are trafficked inside the van just to show them that the black car thief has a good side after all? Or, what about that scene in which a white woman of high class and prejudiced who fell down the stairs and all his prejudice and hatred vanished in the air? If it was THAT simple, why do not we throw all the racists in the United States up the stairs to change their minds? <br /> <br /> (4) I think my biggest doubts about this movie are unrealistic. vision of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than on your face. They have refused me to enter a supermarket because I am not white. Did the store owner say he was not white? No, he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people buying. He shouted racial insults? No. Racism in the United States is more hidden. It is likely that some taxi drivers do not stop to pick you up because you are not white, but that does not mean they will try to run you over or go out and say racial slander. If a Chinese woman throws me back, I will not say "Blake! Blake! Learn some English bitch!" On the other hand, if I were a Chinese woman and accidentally put a Mexican woman, I will not say "Mexicans are bad drivers" in front of her face. This is not how things work. Instead, I would give my insurance information, ask for forgiveness and go home and tell my Chinese friends and relatives that Mexicans are bad drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. That is the true racism. It is hidden and not in your face. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Crash is not original unlike what some people may say. The lines of history, diagrams and characters intertwined and intertwined have been made before. "Magnolia" is a film that makes it much better than Crash and, nevertheless, was never nominated for Best Film at the Oscars. He had a star cast: Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won the Best Actor Award), Tom Cruise, etc. It really amazes me how Crash was even nominated for Best Picture.
