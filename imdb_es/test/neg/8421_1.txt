One of the worst movies related to homosexuals I've seen in my life. Since these are not characters in this story, it is difficult to comment on the film itself. Therefore, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) left his life open for all to see, I suppose it's a fair game to criticize. And that is not hard to do. Here it goes. Glen something is a great porn star who wants fame and fortune as a singer. (I guess 11 movies make him a "star") Being gay and forty, I've seen porn and I did not recognize him or his lover. Personally, everyone seems the same with different hairstyles. Face it, guys, he's not Jeff Stryker, Jim Bently or Casey Donovon. That's fine, though. The purpose of these films is carried out in approximately 6.5 minutes, so almost all have the same requirements, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So Glen wants to be a serious (legitimate) singer after he leaves the porn industry, but he can not make anyone take him seriously. I wonder why? Was it so stupid to think that he could wash his clothes and have sex in a movie? And according to the movie, they do not only dedicate themselves to porn movies, but to live in a house with other "stars" where people can connect to their bedroom, the bathroom and anywhere through webcams. It's $ 500 an hour to entertain at a private party. Strip shows in optional clothes "hotels". Doing something called methamphetamine that I presume is a drug. And then you have the balls to get mad when someone at a club concert tries to touch you, because now it is "legitimate". Oy! <br /> <br /> The only interesting character, without cardboard, is the gay screen writer who won an Academy Award who did not want to give his name. And considering that this is a documentary, well, porn is like porn does. You can say he's more fun with the silly bunny porn star. <br /> <br /> Glen has a hyper-nellie manager (Kyle) who wants to "sell" him as a porn participant hoping to make him gay. Concerts in the club. Try to do Svengalli's routine. "You saw this." "You do not smile." Tell him this "in terms of controlling the problems, but our antihero will not be controlled or told what to do, the first mistake, I'm not saying that Kyle was right, but if a budding singer starts questioning the manager, it will not come very Something like: the one who is your own lawyer is a fool for a client. <br /> <br /> All this would not have been bad if it were not for a small part of the information. Please touch the battery, please It's bad, he sucks, his talent as a singer is at the level of Ashlee Simpson, difficult to encourage someone who, while trying to make his dream come true - at 50! - does not work like normal people. There is work, can you say lazy? And the whining and the why do not accept me. singing and dancing. And one After a few months of scraping the surface of the music industry, he says: "Why do not I have a recording contract by now?" What? The actors are waiters. The writers work in low-level newspapers or magazines, whatever. This guy is above that. It is true. He wants his success now simply because he decided he wanted it. Whine. Complaining complaining Your lover leaves you to go back to the infirmary, but I tell you that I would not like that imbecile to give me medical attention. Both were useless. Airheads The movie is useless. Unless you really like Whine and Cheeesy, people get away. Do not waste your money on the bad lives of useless people, there are much more interesting things attached to the bottom of your shoe.
