The respected Western author Budd Boetticher is terribly out of place with this modern story of today's thieves and robbers who suffers from a strong lack of emotional credibility. Boetticher seems to have given up the rehearsal time and settled for the first take as leaders Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming put little effort into their roles, delivering lines flat and powerless. <br /> <br /> Good-mannered employee Leon "Foggy" Poole works as an internal man in a bank job that goes awry and causes his wife to be killed in the process. He escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the wife of the detective who killed him. Hundreds of policemen are mobilized to prevent him from reaching the house of the person who was moved to another place, but would not know in the last moments of the film that we have Foggy behind the victim (who thought somehow that take a bus)? returning to the house was a good move) while a police company observed and discussed what action to take. Does it sound absurd? You should see it. It's all that and more. <br /> <br /> The work of Lucien Ballard's camera does a decent job of bringing air to the suburbs, but the editing is indifferent and shapeless and drains the film of its suspense and rhythm. Like Poole, Wendell Corey is the best in the film that manages to evoke great sympathy as he moves from the kind soul to the murderer. These attributes, apart from Killer, fail uniformly in the construction and execution clarify your message. Go old western Budd.
