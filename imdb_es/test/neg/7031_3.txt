We all saw the same movie? I can not believe the raves that some of the others are giving this really horrible biography that, believe it or not, was authorized by the same Shirley Temple, based on her book CHILD STAR. I get the feeling that some are very easy to please. <br /> <br /> First of all, ASHLEY ROSE ORR, whatever her modest talent, by no means, shape or form resemble Shirley Temple enough to be chosen like her in this kind of biography simple of the most famous child star in the world. She gives no indication of why or how this girl was so revered, except for doing everything possible to make a personification of Shirley who never clicks on any level. None at all. <br /> <br /> And that is the main disadvantage of the whole piece. But as if that were not bad enough, any drama inherent in Shirley's story about her rise to near-night stardom has been completely bleached with insipid writing peppered with songs and occasional dance moments that do not even come close to what that Shirley did (such as "The Codfish Ball" with Buddy Ebsen, which was probably the highlight of Shirley's choreographed dance routines). <br /> <br /> The simple act of putting a girl in a polka-dot dress does not make her the Shirley Temple. None of Shirley's own brands of charm, warmth and appeal is even remotely suggested. Everything we see on the screen is a pale imitation of the original proof, once and for all, that there was only one Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> It is useless to write something more about this mess. None of the others is more than ordinary in the lifeless papers. My advice to Shirley fans is to read your book, or better yet, watch your movies. <br /> <br /> This is the worst.
