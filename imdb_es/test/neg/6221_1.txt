I love the musicals, all of them, from the happy Oklahoma, to Poignant Porgy and Bess, to the romantic "Damn Yankees". And I know most of the songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or humming alone. <br /> <br /> In a "real" musical, different from this vaudeville show, all the songs are carefully designed to fit. the exact moment It is an expression of sadness, repentance, love, joy or exaltation, a natural extension where mere words fail. Then, in Guys and Dolls, "My Time of Day" describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson, as she is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. Each song in this brilliant example of the genre creates a state of mind, or develops a character, creating a phantasmagoria of place, turned into something absolutely believable by the evocations of the revealing song. <br /> <br /> For this lover of the Broadway musical. , and its adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel and amusing distortion of the genre. There, the songs of these musicals advanced the lines of the often elaborate, often charming plot. While here, the songs, simply collected from a collection, only interfered with the shaky premise of the film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most of the viewers who are turning this film into a monumental success simply do not have exposure to the art form of twentieth-century musicals. They have no idea of ​​the magic performed by the writer and the lyricist who can turn a dancer into a dance hall in someone we know and love, as was achieved in "Sweet Charity". <br /> <br /> Allow me to offer you an apology for the arrogance of this criticism. Maybe, another day, another mood, I could have been involved, and not have been so critical in this review. <br /> <br /> But I can not help but imagine what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and so many others could have done even with this stupid premise. I think about it, while the memories of seeing this movie are fresh, and I can not help but mourn the great loss.
