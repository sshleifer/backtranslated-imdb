This movie was so bad that it became pleasant. If you want to see a telenovela cast, decide to make an action movie, this is for you! Exaggerate, irrelevant incidents, improbable dialogue, it has everything. The main character has a divided personality and can not decide if he is a thief, a loving father or a hero who will risk his life for others. It is not plausible in any of these papers. This sets the standard for many of the other characters. The head of the company whose building is on fire shows the same unpredictability, as does his wife. And the line of blow, which has taken the "chip", begs the belief. I found myself laughing with enthusiasm and for that reason, I recommend you to look at it.
