What can be said about a movie that makes two hours seem like three weeks? The hero begins in ninjaville, Japan, goes through an identity crisis (saving a shinobi), makes a trip to America (saving a slave named Sam) participates in a small action of the wild west (saving a native French / Japanese called Julie), goes to look for the gold of the pirates and then returns to Japan to fight a war. Obviously, the film has no idea where it is going at any time; I think the director modeled each scene after the last movie he had seen. If you are going to see this movie, I suggest you rent the subtitle so that you and your classmates can talk openly about how silly the movie is without talking about the movie, and possibly another plot twist is missing. <br /> <br /> Movies the director was watching during the making of this movie: An American Tail, Fievel Goes West, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Goonies, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kung Fu, Vampire Hunter D, The Ten Commandments. <br /> <br /> Notes of Interest - The most inspiring fear line of all time. Approximately 90 minutes (or 19 days) of the movie, the main character has just defeated an American villain, and just as one turns to the vcr to end the pain, the hero proclaims "Let's go back to Japan," and the agony continues. another week.
