A boy, with the unlikely name of Shy Walker, searches for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half. That's the whole plot ... with bad acting in all areas, of course. Walker wanders through a maze of corn (corn? I understand! HAHAHA ... is not funny) and shouts: "Girls, where are you?" about 1000 times. For some reason, every time he runs next to a pumpkin, a voice that sounds like a squirrel laughs (as if the pumpkin was laughing at him, yes, it's okay ...). His daughters scream for most of the movie ... even when there's no reason to scream (maybe because they're still stuck in this horrible movie?). Twin girls taken from 'The Shining' appear from time to time. Most of the corn maze looks the same, so Walker's search ages very quickly. The filmmakers realize that there is NOTHING for this movie (even the music is repetitive), so they try to do interesting things by turning the camera very fast, filming backwards, inserting smaller images of the same shot from different angles, with red lights. to make the corn look scary, and turn the camera 360 degrees (at least I guess it was done intentionally, but it's probably just examples of incompetent movies). Most of the time, when Walker is roaming the maze, you can not see his face. I guess the child holding the camera can not look that high ... This film gives you a new appreciation for the original 'Dark Harvest' (which has nothing to do with this movie, except for the fact that it also has a field of corn). Do not be fooled by the rating R Walker says the word F three times and now we have "a horror movie with R rating", ugh. The scarecrow on the cover does not even appear in this movie ... and when you're wishing those scarecrows from the first movie come back, you know that things are wrong! Instead, we have a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero (unfortunately, he's dressed like Mr. Walker, so I did not even realize they were following him for a while). I discovered the identity of the guy with the yellow boots long before Walker did (the movie is almost finished by the time he puts 2 and 2 together, natch). The end of the film is prolonged again and again ... and in case it is not slow enough, there is some slow motion! The last sound you hear (besides your own laugh) is a very poor sound dubbing. In case you can not say, this is the worst movie I've seen in my life. At least they did not end up with the promise of another sequel!
