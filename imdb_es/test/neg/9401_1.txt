Well done divorced American with more money than brains buys a ruined villa in Tuscany. (Much more money, while he has to doubt the price, he later manages to cook sumptuous buffets for his workers and wander around Italy indefinitely without work or apparent means of support). Endless boredom and the inevitable Italian lover ensue; This is a movie for girls in the most pejorative sense of the term. Lane behaves like a clueless adolescent without dexterity, which clashes dynamically with their looks that fade seriously, while clashing with a variety of cardboard stereotypes (dikes, divas, divas, senile contessas and gigolos) among them. Inflated with unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous is a clumsy insertion and senseless recreation of the fountain scene in 'La Dolce Vita'. (A similar concept was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in 'Only You', the widely superior ode of Norman Jewison to Italy and romance). The "Tuscan Sun" may be the most empty piece of cinema of the last decade, despite its panoramas of Italy, which have a good image. An additional negative point for the strange lover who parachuted at the last minute to provide the necessary Hollywood end to his target audience of housewives with Oprah brainwashing. Avoid at all costs, unless, of course, you see Oprah and Dr. Phil as pinnacles of intelligent discourse.
