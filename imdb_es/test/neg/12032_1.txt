A low budget can be an excuse for bad acting talent and fake gore with a pathetic appearance. However, it is not an excuse for bad writing. It's a talent to be able to write dialogues without making it sound forced and mechanical. The dialogue in this film was on par with most of the instructional videos shown to the fast food staff in training. <br /> <br /> I also understand that one should make some exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 dollars. to spend on it. That said, no serious director would have looked at these scenes and would have said to himself: "that was perfect". I see a better character acting on Canadian television. <br /> <br /> This movie had a thin plot, a bad performance, a poor dialogue and does not contain smart ideas. This simply shows me that some independent films are like that for a reason. If you are looking for a quick scare, rent any other thing. Even the "Cable Guy" was a more terrifying movie. After watching this movie, I think it would have been better to see a new execution in the X files.
