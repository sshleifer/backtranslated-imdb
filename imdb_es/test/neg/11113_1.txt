I was only in the UK's science fiction channel, on July 5, it was ****. What a shame for JRD! Maybe he got bored for a week! He can not be skint after LOTR. I guess it was not my fault. Mr. Sheppird was. I turned off after 50 minutes, I could not stand it. The CGI ship was bad and the creature looked like a big 5-foot bat. Who funded this project? I think everything must have cost $ 250 dollars. Avoid at all costs, do not think about buying the DVD if they throw one, I can not imagine that they would spend dollars to produce one. Hopefully someone will make a decent Chupra movie and a decent BIGFOOT movie. Sasquatch was fine, poor Lance. It's a pity that a great studio and direct do not risk it, no more superhero movies, please!
