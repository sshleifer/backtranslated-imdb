The director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own theatrical material for the screen, clearly inspired by the real-life dilemma of Rock Hudson of the 1950s: what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual? Marry it with an unsuspecting woman to calm the gossip (and keep it working). Winky-thin idea thanks to the retro production design and good cast that looks like a Shag greeting card. The dialogue is not very smart, and there are some slapstick near the beginning that does not work (spit food, etc.). Still, when a serious tone reaches the final act, it is handled with great gusto, and is much more welcomed by the viewer than all the nonsense. Matt Letscher does a good job as movie hero / male whore Guy Stone, but are his experiences here enough to strengthen his character, or would he be back at the bar next night? The movie seems not to know - or worry. Day wants to get rid of a few simple sentences and a carefully written pro-gay speech, a request for tolerance, but has no other agenda. For audiences who invest their time and interest in these people, the sentimental reverence of this thing may seem like nothing more than a joke. * 1/2 of ****
