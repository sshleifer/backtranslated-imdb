The Lifetime channel was aired in October, but I only saw it now. Is it the old eternal triangle again? Dave Ford (Matt Long), a small town in Connecticut, has a quick affair with the girlfriend of his best friend, Emily Darrow (Emmanuelle Chriqui), on the eve of his departure to study law in New York, think of her during the next five years. He is not making contracts and reports, he runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a major exam five years later, and becomes involved with her again romantically. But director and co-author Matthew Cole Weiss goes beyond the top, framing everything in flashback when Dave confesses to murdering Emily, her husband and another of her lovers in front of (here comes the spoiler) a lesbian cop who also calls of Emily. Weiss overindulges with the "bridle" effect by which Dave can see fragments of his previous life before his eyes, even before he is really dead, cutting them off even when Dave and Emily are having sex and, therefore, ruining the porn shots that give even some Lifetime movies, otherwise, quite unconvincing, at least a little attractive to the audience. I could not help but return my attention to James M. Cain and how much better he wrote to women like this in his classic thrillers (all adapted to the hit movies) "The Postman Always Rings Twice," "Double Indemnity" and "Mildred Pierce." It also does not help that the film ends with the bad guys (the bad girls, in fact) triumphant and the decent hero, although naive and stupid, apparently on the way to the lethal injection table. or that the actors who play the people Dave and Emily are cheating are more attractive than they are. By the way, although this movie went directly to cable in the USA. UU., There were some blank spaces in the soundtrack that indicated where the bad words were written, so I guess this had a theatrical premiere somewhere in the world.
