For most people, RoboCop 3 is the movie that really is the great misfortune of the Robo series. He has few fans, and most people hate him for his brazen commercial PG-13 approach. Now, I'm not going to say that RoboCop 3 is good. Frankly, it's pretty horrible. But as far as being a film executed and shot correctly, it overcomes this part of the chaos of the circuit. Yes, the truth of the matter is that RoboCop 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels of a close masterpiece. So, what if RoboCop 3 turns Robo into a superhero of cartoons in an ultra-conventional production for children to enjoy? At least, he is doing it openly. I do not know where RoboCop 2 starts and ends, I do not know what it is or who it is, I do not understand what is happening, I do not understand which jokes are deliberate and which are not. I will go crazy if I try to understand the characters, I do not see anything of value in what others say, I can not believe that someone has seen the shooting script and I thought it would work and I can not believe that Irvin Kirshner has seen the Finished the result and I thought he liked what he saw. By the way, he probably did not, not Miller, not Weller, not Allen. It is not hard to see why. <br /> <br /> Now, RoboCop 2 has its fans, I know. For the most part, they belong to this league of absolute antiprepressions, discarding anyone who has expected some depth or theme from the first film, as apprentices of academic Roger Ebert Sith. It's just a lot of fun, good action and great entertainment, says the argument. Yeah, well, I guess if you do not listen to what some of the characters are saying, you could fool yourself and say that we could have Arnold in the suit instead of Weller. Do not get me wrong, I like a good action movie, with pure entertainment value, since it is the only virtue, the most satisfying. But RoboCop 2, sir, is not such a thing. <br /> <br /> Watch the first scenes. This horrible actor makes Robo repeat that it's just a machine, and then enters into this operatic discourse about how he could never be a man, after which Murphy's wife (who is suing OCP for stealing steel) comes in from the nothing and has this little sad moment with him, and then he never comes back to listen! Surely I would like to enter this film scene by scene, because everyone has this kind of absurdity in them. It's as if a twelve-year-old fan made the script, the characters act in a totally random way and first they say this, then they say that. OCP wants to stop the crime with a new robbery, especially this drug called "nuke", but it seems that they really only want to become this great capitalist empire and control the whole city? The policy is abandoned, I suppose, understandable given the comic relief mayor, the villain (played by Tom Noonan, who made a better version of this in Last Action Hero and that's saying a lot) is an addict, but is still used for this machine. The woman behind all this has an agenda that is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> Speaking of twelve year olds, this movie has the infamous role of "Hub", this crazy kid who swears and kills people, played by a child actor. I will not be completely moral about it, it's a free world and if you want a psychopathic child in your action movie, do it. I do not know how much of Frank Miller's original vision was included in this, but the credits at least recognize him as the creator of "history." And, if I walk away, I could see this as a great character. It is unpleasant, no doubt, to have a manic child but, again, this is the world of RoboCop and who would be surprised? This whole thing with the OCP that tries to become this gigantic monopoly over everything, is, in truth, dystopian and good too. Also, the idea of ​​RoboCop getting in touch with his wife and his son, incrusting them in some way in the story, would also be great, and as far as I can see a logical and natural step if now they had to do a sequel to RoboCop. <br /> <br /> But, of course, these are just ideas. As many people have already said, the script is 100% messy. The boy has a scene (the torture scene) in which he insinuates that, in fact, it is only a stereotype of a disordered child, and then we have this unimaginable scene in which he is dying and becomes very friendly and friendly towards the head. Why do not you take your uzi and try to defeat it with your last breath? Is not that what your character would do? Does your life think of a second thought there on your deathbed? Not necessarily, since his last words are "stinks", then why? It really does not make sense, and this can be said of everyone, not everything, in this movie. Is there a strike in the police force? Is it the RoboCop machine or the man? What is the problem with turning Robo into this community service machine for 10 minutes? I mean, of course, it's pretty funny that I would not deny it. But why build it, and then discard it? And why the hell is Allen so underutilized criminally? and what is this? Weller has an obvious need to express himself with his character and yes, well, the threads are many and the disorder is huge. <br /> <br /> This review is as messy as the movie. The only reason I give an additional star is because of the actors in the first movie, I'm sure they had good intentions with her. I mean it's a stable thing, a kind of anchor in this sea of ​​bad movies.
