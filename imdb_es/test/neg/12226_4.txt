In 2002, when Matthew Lawrence made The Hot Chick, I also saw Drumline that day. Drumline wins by default! If The Comebcaks had been released in March (as planned) the same time that TMNT was launched, TMNT would have won by default. <br /> <br /> Of course, Matthew Lawrence did a good job representing a field marshal. He did not have to resort to uttering dirty words, which is an advantage. But when he started playing with his private parts, as well as other soccer players and touching a girl's tit, those were the least. <br /> <br /> But the biggest drawback is that all football players have to participate. in the music simulation video, except Matthew Lawrence (insert the lost horns of The Price Is Right). Another great musical opportunity for him, simply because he is shy to make music. <br /> <br /> In the past, Matt has disappointed me many times (Super Human Samurai Syber Squad), where he was so close to having a musical moment. , but it ended up failing. <br /> <br /> Sure, Joey had a career as a singer with two albums in his belt and Andrew is starting his own musical career. But it is very rare to find a musical moment of Matt. The two that stood out were in Brotherly Love, where he played the guitar and sang "Pigeon On Your Car" (Art Atrack), which he wrote by the way, and in that romantic moment of Boy Meets World when he sang "This Dame". that time passes). <br /> <br /> Matt, you played the sportsmen too long. Why not make a musical comeback? You have a good voice and I miss your musical side.
