This late effort of Freda plays like a modern Gothic thriller (of the 70s), but it is not exciting. Certainly, it is not a terribly bad movie, but it has the feeling that many of Freda's later films have of someone who has given up when he saw the first newspaper. It begins well enough, almost with a similar tone to the giallo, then it turns towards the Gothic territories with a decent scenery (although terribly clich√©). Then, suddenly, Freda seems to have lost interest in the film and all we get are the prolonged shots of Camille Keaton and the lit candles. After about an hour in the movie, we get a kind of violent climax with special effects from decent to poor. This is followed by a slow-moving outro with a very obvious end of turn (if it is meant to be a turn?). And throw some half explanatory scenes and you get the Tragic Ceremony. Thus, in parts it has its qualities. But then, suddenly, he stumbles and collapses in front of you. A shame <br /> <br /> By the way, stay away from the SHAROMA DVD, a useless and murky scan edition that destroys what could be a good visual experience.
