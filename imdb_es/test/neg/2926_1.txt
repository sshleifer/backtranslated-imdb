I was just at the cinema in the center of Prague watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Not because of the poster, I found a very old heroic style of Holywood <br /> <br />. It is not due to the high level of the stars, which remind me that most of these high-profile French films are usually pathetic. But only <br /> <br /> because there are not so many films in my French mother tongue in a city like Prague. And because I love Cyani, Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau <br /> <br />. So I decided to write this little comment because I think that <br /> <br /> I really do not agree with the mainstream of comments in this film on imdb. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The film looks like the poster. The characters <br /> <br /> are as stupid as they seem. For a while, <br /> <br /> I thought Adjani would be like a caricature, just a funny character <br /> <br /> that you can laugh at. No, she's not! For example, when she decides to tell <br /> <br /> Depardieu, she is the one who killed the fat man she killed at the beginning of the movie <br /> <br /> then the violins come in a great pathetic. <Br / > <br /> the music that should make you cry and realize that the character of Adajani is <br /> <br /> a deeper person as seen. Maybe this was humor at level 10, but I'm sorry that my sense of humor is not that high. If I want to <br /> <br /> watch a funny French movie in World War II, I see once again La Grande <br /> <br /> Vadrouille! It's definitely more fun! I have also read in imdb <br /> <br /> that Lemoine is doing a great performance in this movie. I have to <br /> <br /> say that I have never seen such a bad performance! (Well, I've never seen any Ed movie <br /> <br /> Wood). However, the film is well filmed with many good (/ very expensive) scenes like the one in the morning Pantheon <br /> <br /> when the German army arrives in Paris or when the refugees settle down <br /> < br /> on a bridge in Bordeaux. I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker but <br /> <br /> he does it better with a good script. It was easy with Cyrano. He <br /> <br /> did not have to write the dialogues! <br /> <br /> I give 1/10.
