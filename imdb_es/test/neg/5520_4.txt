Oddly enough, it is Fred MacMurray who plays the most "nutty" role in this comedy about balls. Carole Lombard shows excellent performance that combines lighter moments with drama and seriousness. <br /> <br /> As usual, Fred MacMurray remains a mystery to me. The camera is not a fan of him, it is not so attractive, and he does not have the style or style to carry out this role much like Cary Grant. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bellamy is excellent as the friendly friend comes back to life through his relationship with the Lombard character. One can only wonder why his character would not want his soft and reassuring love instead of the almost certain death of MacMurray's ineptitude. But that's Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The image almost works but loses the mark, mainly due to the performance of MacMurray. It would have been nice to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role. Lombard and Bellamy are largely credible and pleasant; MacMurray is rigid and makes you want to keep it at a distance.
