How many Monster Tree movies can you see in your life? Well, I'll take my chances and say one. This movie looks better late at night, with a pack of 12 beers, the sound off and you and your friends doing it. until the dialogue. <br /> <br /> On a Pacific island, a young man is sentenced to death for associating with the "evil Americans." (It seems that his beloved wife has been sleeping with the witch doctor and they put him in touch with him). dies so that the doctor can be the king). Then he swears to come back and take revenge. <br /> <br /> Before you can shake a stick, foolish natives run to American scientists, but shout "Tobanga, come!" <br /> <br /> It seems that the young corpse has done just that as Tobanga, the walking monster of the tree. Yes, his revenge is terrible (and so is this movie). It seems that these natives can not escape from a heavy tree, so they are thrown into quicksand, rolled downhill, etc. Soon, the new king wants to change his wife or kingdom for an ax or a chainsaw. <br /> <br /> The general problems with this movie are numerous. Comedy relief is an unpleasant woman with a Cockney accent (like this movie needs comedy). You want her to die in her first appearance. The protagonist is weeping. The protagonist is a donkey. The performance is wooden (pun). The dialogue is rigid and heavy. Natives have Brooklyn accents. The monster costume is pure laughter. <br /> <br /> While this is a bad movie, it's still fun to watch. He gets a 3 in unintentional laughter alone. . Your dog can rate it a bit higher, but only if the tree was not mobile.
