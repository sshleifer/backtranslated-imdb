Travolta and Thurman deserved a better movie. This is very secondary in all aspects, not a single new idea. But the biggest problem is the ridiculous philosophy of this movie. A gang of black rappers after all their criminal activities and even killing people are becoming almost positive heroes of Mickey Mouse acting on stage and delivering awards at the ceremony. Maybe this coincides with real life. But to show it as a fairly normal "happy ending" is beyond my imagination ... "What's wrong with shooting a couple of bad Ukrainians if they're not politically correct?" - The show must go on! That makes me think that Hollywood writers have a big problem separating good and evil, even if the genre is supposed to be a "black comedy".
