I agree with the comments about the downward turn. The last view shows that it has been a bit better, but surely the writers need a little more direction. I think the characters are still interesting, although sometimes they turn too much in the "white trash". The subtlety and the nuances go very far in programs like "Office". I think the target audience is something similar, since both are in the same night and alignment. One might think that Karma and all Eastern religion is a subject large enough to present some different and interesting shows, but that only scratch the surface of the theme. In my opinion, it shows the contempt that many people have in Hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses. We can handle more intoxicating content. It has been tried before in many other shows.
