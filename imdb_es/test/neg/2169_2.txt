While the writing was terrible, the performance was atrocious, the only thing that saved this "turd" was the breast count, but that was not enough to make me see this again. All said and done, I'm actually more stupid to see this movie. This was a new low for Troma. Lloyd Kaufman starting the movie with a garbage bag and making fart noises I should have realized what I was getting into. This was, by far, one of the worst that the Troma team has taken out. The best place to show this movie would be to the invalids, since they can not get up to change the channel. To conclude, this is not a quick recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts.
