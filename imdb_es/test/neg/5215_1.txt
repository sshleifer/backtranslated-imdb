My friends and I are always attentive to the Chuck Norris movies to just hit and make fun of us. One of our favorites so far is Lonewolf. I went to a Wal-Mart Christmas store and found this movie in the 5.99 container. I had to get it I had a lot of hope for this movie and, although I was sometimes very funny, we agreed that the innocence campaigns is the worst movie we have seen, done, produced, thought, etc. good idea. Not only is it confusing at times, but acting is hard to see. The man who plays Oren has an action. I can compare it to my own vomit, and Chuck immersed himself in this. He is not the best actor, but it was terrible. and what kind of names are pray, conrad and jux ........ jux. Come on people. if you honestly thought that this movie was visible, great for you because it was difficult for me and I really had a headache and a stomachache after seeing it. I'm telling you now if you have not seen this movie, NO. For God's sake, please, do not submit to so horrible 90 minutes of your life.
