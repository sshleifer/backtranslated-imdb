Absolutely nothing about this movie is fun, interesting or relevant. besides two characters that come together in the end, nothing is ever solved, and there is no argument. And by the way, what is the deal with the cover of the DVD? has a female ass in shorts by Daisy Duke ... where was that scene in the movie? Nobody ever used sprigs of daisies in this movie! Surprisingly, almost all the acting in this movie is good, and Jack Black plays a complete song (it could be a tenacious clue ... although I do not know) ... those are the only redeeming values, however. In general, it's just a waste of time.
