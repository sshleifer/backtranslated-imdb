I'm the kind of person who never, never watches animated movies, but I make an exception for Thumbelina and Princess Swan. Being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series, I bought it and sat down to see it with a very skewed mind, determined to love it because I had spent money to buy it. I finished the movie, and all I can think about is THE HORROR !!! I wanted to like it, I really did. I tried very, VERY hard to like it. But I could not enjoy a second of this exhausting movie. The songs made me feel like ripping my ears off my head. The dialogue was so lame that I felt trembling with frustration and irritation every time someone opened their mouths. The villain laughed and I felt that I wanted Derek and Odette to die at the end ... and I was absolutely in love with them from the first movie. <br /> <br /> I will try to repress the memory of This movie, because it almost destroyed the first one for me. There is a song in the movie in which there is a series of flashbacks to the first movie. The difference in the animation between the two becomes very obvious, and I began to long for the first and wishing I had never set eyes on the third. <br /> <br /> Do yourself and favors and do not waste your time.
