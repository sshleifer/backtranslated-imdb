This is one of the few movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should see it with a bottle of vodka. To be completely honest, we are a group of people who really know the man, Mo Ogrodnik, and we decided to take this stupidity with this movie. <br /> <br /> The cinematographic aspect of Wolfgang Something's photography seems to have left both of them aside. close-ups and breasts. The collaborative effort of Mo and Wolfgang revealed the passion of the two actresses, the plastic people who hold passion. There are also beetles striking. As Violet would have said: "This (plastic peen) goes up your ass." The pornography of the rat and its subsequent crushing are impressive. <br /> <br /> Good. So, if you're still reading, let us explain who we are. Mo Ogrodnik teaches at the University of New York and we are a group of his students, who, finishing a film class with her, decided to confront the poop and see his directorial debut. She also wrote Uptown Girls. I can not tell you how much has been stuck in our skulls. So this movie is the whole experience. At the bottom of this publication, there will be a drink game that we created for this movie. <br /> <br /> In about 13 minutes of play, none of us could see directly. The large amount of Dido in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to pacify an elephant. There was something secretly pleasurable about seeing two underage girls hit Kurt Cobain's lookalike without any context, except for his mysterious scene in the convenience store where he was, of course, reading a local newspaper. Because that is what we all do. The heart-shaped glasses were deliciously derived from Lolita. And something about that provocative scene of the naked boy with the chin suggests the story of the director of homosexual pornographic experiments. We wish we were joking. <br /> <br /> Sufficient intellectual contemplation. TO THE DRINK GAME! This will ensure that the visual experience is positive. It is very simple and very likely that you send at least one member of your group to immediate attention. <br /> <br /> The Mo Ogrodnik / Ripe Drinking Game: 1. Every time you see something related to pornography, have a drink. . 2. Each time you see the author's name Mo Ogrodnik appear, have a drink. 3. Sex 4. (plastic peen) require two drinks. 5. Each time someone points a weapon at another character, take a drink. -At this point, you probably have to fill / urinate the remaining sobriety of your body.- 6. Any time there is blood (INCLUDING "LADY BLOOD"), take a sip! 7. The underutilized hula-hoop girl requires one drink per second. 8. Free use of the "magic black man" requires a drink. 9. If you can not understand the line of passage, KEEP DRINKING, Beyotch. 10. When you can predict a line, take a drink. Trust us. It is easy. <br /> <br /> That's it, internet! Keep drinking and try not to get mad. <br /> <br /> -Hawaiian Smirnoff Punch, Jr.
