42/100 It is often called "Tarzan with clothes," but it is not at all in the same league as its much higher Tarzan series. Basically, The Jungle Jim series became a Tarzan replacement for Johnny Weismuller, after he started being out of shape for a loincloth. In Jungle Jim, he is fully dressed. It can not be compared to the Tarzan series in any way, nor in the performance, the scripts or the quality of production. It is rather silly. This is the first of the best in the series, and that does not say much. Too much footage is used, and it's very obvious. The score is exaggerated, and the plot is scarce and production is so poor that it is sometimes difficult to see it.
