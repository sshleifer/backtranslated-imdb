All this show is, it's the same plot. Kuszko (spelling?) Is in danger of failing at school, needs to pass to become emperor. He needs to learn something, what he thinks is stupid, then he uses it / learns more about it and realizes that he is not that stupid. Eezma, posing as the director, tries to transform Kuszko into an animal to stop him. All the episodes <br /> <br /> The jokes of the film are copied (the incredibly complicated plans of Eezma, Kuszko breaking the 4th wall constantly, squirrels). They should try to hire some writers. <br /> <br /> 2/10
