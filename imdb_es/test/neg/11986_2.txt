I really liked the Far Cry game, good graphics, good level design, interesting and intelligent enemies, a longer than average duration and even a decent plot. I am not by default against movies derived from games. I thought "DOOM The Movie" was very funny. But what Uwe Boll has done here, is to take the game and modify each of its positive aspects and turn them into something horrible (well, not the duration, the movie only lasts 90 minutes) The characters are even more stereotyped than in The game , which is quite an achievement. The whole plot is told without any kind of twist or mystery. Several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every part of the story. And are we going to "Genetically Modified Soldiers"? They could have found a better name. <br /> <br /> However, this movie should get some prize for the most idiotic love scene. I've never seen anything like that. I could not believe they were trying to be serious "we have to take off our wet clothes" "I think I will get hypothermia" (although everyone is wearing shirts) "We need to hug to have body heat" "Is that your weapon?" But. .. but ... were not there people who did this consciously? There must have been a scriptwriter, a director, actors, a person in charge of things, an electrician, some kind of food! Why did not anyone jump to that scene to prevent this evil from happening? Was this film made by devastating, inhuman and genetically modified film people? I'm not going to start commenting on how many logical errors, inconsistencies and writing failures there were, but even for action fans, this can not be more than an insult. <br /> <br /> This movie I really asked you to rate 2 out of 10, so I'll do it in that favor. But that leaves me to explain where the second star comes from. Special effects? Nah Interim? Not really. References to the game? You wish. I waited! They used the font of the game for the title and credits. That was great. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie for a bad movie night, go to "2012 - Supernova", this is just - sad.
