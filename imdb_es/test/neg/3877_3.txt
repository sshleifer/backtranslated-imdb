I do not care about the sequels; Sometimes they are better than the original. However, it is often better to leave the originals alone ... especially when the model can not be duplicated. One of the main reasons why "The Magnificent Seven" was a success was the very popular cast. <br /> <br /> This is not the "magnificent seven", when only Yul Brynner returns as one of the members of that famous group in "The Magnificent Seven". With six of the seven boys absent and replaced by much less known actors, this loses its appeal in a hurry. In other words, with the exception of Brynner, these guys have no charisma! This is like a championship sports team that presents all the substitutes except one. <br /> <br /> Brynner is good, once again: fun to watch, fun to listen to with his distinctive and deep voice, but the story, not just the rest of the crew, is lame. This movie should never have been made. In the original, we worry about the "seven"; here, we would not mind less.
