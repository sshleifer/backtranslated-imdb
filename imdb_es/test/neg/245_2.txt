The first 2/3 of this film were not so different from the films of American mummies of the 30s and 40s. Two lovers in ancient Mexico dared to challenge the law and were condemned to die. One became an Aztec mummy whose job was to keep the sacred treasure and her lady's love. And the lady was reincarnated in the present and the mummy was naturally attracted to her. So far, it's all the typical movie of the mummy ... although it's a bit slower and more boring than the American versions. Oh, and of course, the Aztec mummy looked very, very bad. <br /> <br /> However, in this standard but boring movie there is a super villain. Why? I do not know, it sure did not make any sense to have one. It seems that this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why do you need the treasure? Well, to buy the necessary equipment to make an army of atomic robots, dummy! But first you have to build a mummy to defeat the mummy, since the mummy has so far been unstoppable. <br /> <br /> You have to see these "human robots", since they look like the huge clumsy Robots of Flash Gordon and other series, BUT, they have a rubber head of a supposed dead inside! They really look funny and when you see the conclusion when there is a big battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot, it's worth sitting through the rest of the boring movie. Both fight in super slow motion, as if they were bathed in candy ... and is done in such a naive and silly way that is bound to cause giggles, certainly not emotions. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is terribly boring and a confusing mess, especially at the end. However, for fans of bad movies, it's a must-see, it's bad but unintentionally fun and great to watch and laugh with friends.
