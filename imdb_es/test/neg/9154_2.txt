THE DAUGHTER OF THE KEY OF MEMORY in the form of a novel by Kim Edwards was a very successful sales success and probably appeared in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation. So, what happened when the novel became a television movie? Perhaps it is the mediocre script that appears next (Oops!, Teleplay!) Of John Pielmeier what constantly advances in a clumsy and pedestrian way, eliminating all the sense of credibility of the story. Maybe it's the cut and paste direction of Mick Jackson that loses the rhythm and the delineation of the characters. Perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of a non-accredited source or the musical score of 'Lágrimas líquidas' by Daniel Licht. For any of these (or all of these) reasons, this film novel survives because it is a good case to educate the public about the abilities of those born with Down syndrome. And that's why it's worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> Dr. David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a successful orthopedic doctor, is married to the beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol) and her pregnancy is changing their lives. On a stormy winter night in Kentucky, Norah goes into labor and Henry rushes to a nearby clinic where David delivers his wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the help of his old friend, nurse Caroline Gill (Emily Watson) After the delivery of a perfect child (Paul), Norah continues in childbirth and (surprisingly ...) delivers an unexpected twin girl (!). David and Caroline immediately recognize that the girl (Phoebe) is 'Mongoloid' (this is before the use of the term Down Syndrome) and David, who has a history of losing a little sister due to a birth defect) decides to send Phoebe to an asylum for people with mental disabilities: Caroline must make the delivery and Norah is told that the second twin died at birth. <br /> <br /> Caroline follows the instructions, sees the conditions of the 'home' where Phoebe is going to deposit, shrinks in horror and decides to stay with the child. Helped by a friendly trucker, Caroline changes her lonely existence and mothers Phoebe, finding a new life in her truck driver's Pittsburgh. Norah insists on a formal funeral for Phoebe, a fact that deeply disturbs David's psyche, and Henry's life continues with only one son, Paul, leaving submerged pains for the lack of Phoebe's presence. Norah gave David a camera ("the life of the people is like a camera, that's where they live, in a room captured for a moment") and David becomes obsessed with photography. Norah grieves, drinks and loses David's attention, while David traces Phoebe's existence with Caroline, sending money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Tyler Stentiford to Jamie Spilchuk) grows up, discovers his mother's infidelities and gets angry over his father's lack of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician, and goes to Juilliard. Meanwhile, Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) has matured into a very well-adjusted young girl, and the way in which the broken Henry marriage and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe and Paul's lives are produced, along with the courage who has supported Caroline Gill's fight to win. Acceptance in the world for those born with Down syndrome constitutes the conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast of well-known actors struggles, but only Emily Watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this soft script. Jamie Spilchuk gives evidence of a young actor with a lot of promise. Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to mold empathic characters from the corny lines they have to deliver. The film is a disaster, but the message about the acceptance of children and adults with Down syndrome is important. Harp grady
