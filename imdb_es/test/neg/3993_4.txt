I had always watched the efforts of the Italian horror master Dario Argento as a producer with some suspicion, and this was only confirmed after my recent visualization of the terrible DEMONS by Lamberto Bava (1985); the fact that this was supposed to be his third installment did not sound promising, but I decided to give the movie a rent, no matter now that we are in full swing of Halloween. I checked the theatrical trailer on the Anchor Bay DVD before seeing the main feature. The images, without a doubt striking, intrigued me, but the film itself (which does not make more sense than what is presented in that frantic two-minute montage and, in retrospect, you can see that most of it has compiled wisely of its highlights) turned out to be a definite disappointment! <br /> <br /> With a promising opening with a medieval prologue taken from Alexander NEVSKY (1938), it goes downhill quickly because it relies too much on surreal images at the expense of narrative. Consequently, several characters randomly take center stage in everything? As the unbearable male protagonist succumbed to the dark forces at the beginning, the sinister looking Bishop (Feodor Chaliapin) became a simple false trail, the mysterious black priest gradually assuming heroic qualities, the protagonist is, for whatever reason, prey of a goat. demon in form (which culminated in a sexual rite carried out in front of other cultists too obviously removed from BABY OF ROSEMARY [1968]) and a reasonably impressive 13-year-old Asia Argento as the rebellious but sympathetic daughter of Sacristan (emerging as the Only survivor at the end). By the way, Argento, the eldest Argento, also co-wrote the story and script of the film together with director Soavi and (under a pseudonym after they apparently fought with Dario in the early stages of production), the original singer Lamberto Bava and the prolific scribe of the genre Dardano Sacchetti (who met at the 61st Venice Film Festival in 2004). <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie, which is so confusing, sees a group of people? Including unavoidable teenagers, but also a couple of English people who deviate from the world (who are given a fight with funny punches)? similarly, locked inside a building in the grip of evil spirits (the church is the cemetery of a satanic cult), it is unlikely that this excursion of terror will dispel memories of the sublimely surrealist EL ANGEL EXTERMINANTE by Luis Bunuel ( 1962)! In the end, the film is even more disappointing (although the horrifying effects of Sergio Stivaletti, at least, are remarkable), since he had really enjoyed the only other Soavi title he had ever seen. CEMETERY MAN (1994), which I own through the DVD of R2 SE. Having said that, would I still like to see his first feature film? Chill (1987) ?? and the follow-up effort of the director to THE CHURCH, entitled THE SECT (1991) ...
