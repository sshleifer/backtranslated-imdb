This was a sordid and sad disaster. I needed a shower when it was over. This is something like this: some people in society are killed and a homicide detective is assigned to the case. She discovers that the victims belonged to a clandestine lesbian society and befriends a group associate who may have relevant information. Since the detective is an attractive woman, of course she is horny and intrigued (which reveals a lot about Hollywood and her psychosis about women). The surprising thing is that none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and disgusting. Ellen Barkin offers a respectable performance as a leading detective, and Julian Sands offers involuntary laughs as a transvestite psychiatrist, thus escaping a one-star rating.
