I've been waiting to see "Wirey Spindell" since it happened in Schaffer's "Fall". Unfortunately, I found that "WS" is a set of wandering, unattractive and boring traps along with what is apparently the signature of Schaeffer, a mixture of history, storytelling and poetry. The film narrates the sexual and other experiences of a Manhattan man about to marry through autonomous flashbacks. Like beads on a string, Schaffer has apparently put together every little experience of sexual life, while neglecting to attend to the beauty of the necklace. The result is a disjointed and unbridled story about a child who grows up and fails to generate empathy and leaves the viewer disconnected, dissatisfied and with a later bad taste that corrupts the end of the mechanical feeling. A mediocre indie and a step back for Schaeffer.
