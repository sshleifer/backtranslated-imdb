The effects and the action in this film not only did it, but the story was terrible. <br /> <br /> A scientist discovers that a comet fragment will reach the moon ... the world leaders ignore it ... he builds a shelter ... then, everyone is upset because he is "playing God" " <br /> <br /> What a lame! He built the thing, why do all have "right" to access? A totally boring story, do not waste your time!
