This television show is possibly the most pathetic show of garbage on television today. Horribly predictable, the obscene use of slow-motion photography, corny story lines. Chuck Norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to film anything. The way you choose to make each episode a public service announcement is really annoying. His acting is so bad that it makes a person feel embarrassed. However, I will give some credit to the series ... sometimes it entertains, but not enough to make a difference. With all the negative points that this series has, I still prefer it to reality television, it really can not have more value than that.
