I think most people would agree with me if I had to say that the movie Alien practically sets the bar for the environment. I've seen quite a few movies that match that bar, but none have surpassed the mysterious Alien tunnels and dark rooms. The Cave is a movie that tries to reset the bar. I think the trailer even mentioned something about being as scary as Alien, but not once throughout the film did I even feel the slightest fear, or excitement about it. <br /> <br /> So now we have the ball. Of the negativity rolling, it could also explain why the main hook of the Cave (the atmosphere in case you were not paying attention) became a waste of time. Right now I will say that most of the sets were beautiful and well lit, but what we hear and what we know is that it ruins what we see. Music for one is terrible. Either we get corny rock music or we exaggerate the enchanted house music. Well, maybe that's pushing it a bit, but I could not stand it. The many underwater scenes were bad enough (it's a well-known fact that underwater scenes are always boring like hell). I did not need rock music to resonate in my ears while they simply swam in a cave. This really produced a lot of unintentional laughter that was then amplified by the following scene of the jet ski accident. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as I mentioned, it was not just music that killed the atmosphere, hell no. The creatures that hide in darkness are supposed to invoke horror. I'm supposed to be worried that they'll show up and just a glimpse of them is supposed to make my blood cool. The Cave wisely takes a page from the extraterrestrial handbook by not showing the whole creature for a long time and leading to revelation only with flashes, but it just does not work because the creatures are very lame. I guess it would be rude to spoil the details but they are basically aliens with wings. <br /> <br /> I guess you already understand the point. Ruined atmosphere. However, I know many people who will still see a movie if it is exciting. I would like to say that about the Cave, but I would be lying. This movie takes time to get to the action and, once we get there, we wonder when the day will end. We've seen all this done better before, with the exception of some pretty scenes (the impaled type in the stalactites, the eel and the rapids), so it really does not excite you to see people running away from uninspired extraterrestrial imitations in tunnels endless . <br /> <br /> Oh, but the pain does not end there. You also have to take into account the characters and the performance. Well, I can not remember a single line of dialogue other than "run!" and the only name of the character that I can remember is Jack, but that's because it's located on almost every line near the end of the movie. Maybe the actors were capable, but the script did not allow them to do anything other than run and argue. They had almost no history and each time someone died they just shrugged. It's pretty sad when you consider that the CGI eel has the best performance in the movie. <br /> <br /> Speaking of CGI; There is a lot of that, most of which is terrible. I congratulate you on the use of suits (at least I think they were suits) but nothing fits the environment and, as a result, most of the effects end up looking pretty bad. <br /> <br /> So I guess that to finish up, the cave is bad and has very little in its favor. If the film had been a premiere movie on the SciFi channel or a low budget release direct to the video, I might have a little more love for it, but this movie was a theatrical premiere. With more ingenuity and talent, this could have been a frighteningly funny movie, but as it is, this movie is as scary as going to the basement and it is not very good. <br /> <br /> My review of Frider Waves: http: //friderwaves.com/index.php?page=cave
