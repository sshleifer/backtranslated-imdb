As a big fan of most modern fantasy movies, I was really looking forward to this. I was not familiar with the character, although after listening to some general stories about the style of the comic and the good reviews of the film, I thought I was expecting a real gift ... <br /> <br /> From the moment the Main character began to speak with his voice forced and hoarse, I could tell immediately that I would not enjoy this movie. I found the story weak and predictable, the performance poor, the effects were very good for a low budget movie, but did nothing for the general plot. <br /> <br /> Maybe as a fan of the Comics you can get something else from this, otherwise, I would suggest that you skip it and not waste your movies in this boring adventure.
