If only he had not surrendered to the clich√©, Mr. Shiban could have made a good movie from this story. It was different enough to keep him interested, so for the same time, energy and money we spent on this stinker, we could have had something good instead of a good eye. <br /> <br /> Production - wisely, is as good as you would expect from a handheld camcorder, so you get good grades there. It really is the script that is to blame, since the performance was not so bad either, considering what the actors had to work with. <br /> <br /> I thought the days had passed long ago when we saw someone, To find a radio transmitter desperately wanting to operate, first turn each knob of the thing from end to end, hit it between 6 or 7 times , and then wait for it to work. This story is ruined by a continuous series of stupid movements of all the characters, except the bad one. It is as if we think we are too shallow to grab all the devices of the plot, so we all feed with a spoon to make sure we get them. <br /> <br /> I do not know about you, but that does not work for me. My attention ends up being occupied by the holes in the plot and the excessive dramatizations, not by the story. <br /> <br /> So, since I found that this was not so bad in the technical sense, I think Mr. Shiban should try. again, just with a proper script next time; then he could give us something worth seeing.
