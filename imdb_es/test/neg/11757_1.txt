Yes because? Among the filmmakers who came out in the 80s and 90s, Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, a few. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, sometimes irritating, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make me turn on the television, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. The "Psycho" by Van Sant, however, gives me a break. Why? I wonder. Massacre to shot of one of the classic perennials. The color was discordant, the performances, atrocious. What was Vince Vaughn doing? Was it a parody? A bad joke? What the hell was that? Anne Heche as Janet Leigh? Who dressed her? Viggo Mortensen with a cowboy hat. Viggo is an excellent actor, but in this case he could not make us forget John Gavin and if Julianne Moore had been introduced to the world through this performance, there would have been "The Hours" for her, maybe "The Minutes". So, here I am, talking badly about the work of one of my idols. The question that crashes remains: Why, Mr. Van Sant? Maybe, in the words of President Clinton, because he could. I'm afraid that's not an excuse.
