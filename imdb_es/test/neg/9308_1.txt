Serious Yahoo is like a $ 3 bottle of wine, had no substance to begin with and only gets worse with age. This film proves that it is completely toxic. We can only hope that this is his last film and that his serious lack of success diminishes his chances of obtaining financing for future ventures. It is at the height of "Lightning Jack" and "Les Patterson Saves the World" as the most abysmal example of the Australian comedy imaginable. How tragic it is that with so many comedic talents infinitely superior in Australia, Yahoo receives such vehicles to express its childish comedy brand in the school playground. And to think, I was 7 years old to devise the script. Real genius!
