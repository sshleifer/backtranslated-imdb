This homemade movie is basically outrageous trash, but you have to give them 3/10 for trying. Blood is rubbish, but the grandmother who kills them is pretty funny, and I think the concept is good, and makeup is fine for a home movie. However, thank God, it only lasted 55 minutes, and the turn at the end is, literally, a Fight Club (almost in the trash like the movie). Just read this comment, do not watch the movie.
