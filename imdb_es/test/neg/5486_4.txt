I've seen quite a few films by Pedro Almodóvar, but so far it should be the most disappointing. This movie seemed to lack the madness that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story never interested me. Many Almodóvar regulars appear in this film, so it's not as if there was a lack of talent on the screen, but this movie seemed more serious than its other films. If there was a comedic advantage in this movie, I certainly could not find it, and it became a surprisingly weak movie.
