Eaten Alive is a small movie that opens in New York City and in the Arctic where men of the tribe shoot snake venom to a few people, then a woman enters the police station that is trying to find her sister which has disappeared after 6 months. Sheila is from Alabama. but his accent sucks, is formed by an adventurer who seems to want only his money and seems to say a lot throughout the film. They venture through the Amazon just to find a community with people and meet the sister. I've been confronted with a crazy man who has probably seen too many Jim Jones preachies. It will take them to a better place, it could be heaven, but no, Mark and Sheila later discover that it is actually a suicidal cult. <br /> <br /> Why do I call Eaten Alive a "little movie"? I'll tell you, but when I saw him, I went through all the encounters with the cannibals, Robert Kerman has a different role than his professor in the Cannibal Holocaust. It's a bit annoying, once we found him in an arm wrestling match that looked like Russian roulette, we know he's a tough guy. Besides, the strong misogyny only makes you tremble and it seemed that you had seen it somewhere, oh the scenes of animals killing each other. But the whole movie revolves in those scenes, it's like they're seeing images of nature with parts of a movie. But after watching this movie, I realized that most of the scenes in the movies are taken from other cannibal movies, even the disappearance of 2 of the characters, well ... most of the movie is. That's why I called this a small movie, when I discovered that the scenes were borrowed, I wanted to throw the disc through the room, this is not a movie, but a simple assembly of all kinds.
