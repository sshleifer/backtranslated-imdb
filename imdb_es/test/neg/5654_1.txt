iCarly is everything that is wrong in the world. All the main characters, except Carly and Freddy's brother, are morally bankrupt. <br /> <br /> Sam hurts other people on a whim. She breaks a child's locker and he is forced to pay $ 100 to fix it, and everything he says is "Lucky Luck" and goes to Freddy's cell phone. She only caused damage of at least $ 300 and is more focused on getting some food. What the hell?. The only time he feels guilty is when he makes fun of Freddy on the show. And that's just because Carly bothered her a lot. <br /> <br /> Carly is the "I'm perfect, everything I do is good". type of girl Everything she does is for her own benefit and, often, she is shown only with remorse for herself. What's worse, she encourages Sam's shit. Does Sam ruin some of Freddy's clothes? She laughs. Sam ruins a child's grades? She shrugs her shoulders. <br /> <br /> I do not even mean humor. The track of laughter is reproduced at all times. <br /> <br /> Sam: He's not so good Carly: Yes, he's Sam: Yes, you're right * EXTENSION OF LAUGHTER * <br /> <br /> It shows that humor consists of demeaning others and say dark words and, occasionally, joke about trivial matters with similar sentences. <br /> <br /> Not to mention all the 'great special technological effects' that can be done in Windows Movie Maker. .
