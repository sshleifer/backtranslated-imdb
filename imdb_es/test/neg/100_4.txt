I really wanted to see this movie. Actors of confidence, interesting plot. Great atmosphere then ????? IF you are going to try something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life. First. I know. OK, I did not expect the directors or writers to really know the meaning, but I thought they might have offered crumbs to peck and try to add fuel to the fire. What! They almost did things that I did not understand. A woman wandering in dark places and alone parking, oblivious to the consequences. Great riddles that fell down the road. The promise of knowledge contained there by the original criminal call. I did not have any problems with the budget and I enjoyed the suspense. I understood and I can cover up the fool about the fool and I found the role of Adrian Pauls crucial and penetrating and then ????? Basically, the story line and the script were good to some extent and that point was the last 10 minutes or so. What? Stay without ideas! Too bad that this movie has disappointed us so much. I may not understand the meaning and I really did not expect the writers to understand it, but I was waiting for an intellectual, if not spiritual, journey, and I had a bump in the road
