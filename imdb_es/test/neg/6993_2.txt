So pathetic that it's not even funny. From the first scene in the movie I knew I was in a bad time. Thank God I only saw this movie on television. The plot was terrible, not to mention the performance. It was horrible. Very unreal and unusual things happened in this movement like. The lady puts a whip under the door and whips the boy a little and he just gives the keys. I'm like, become real. The terrible attempt of the creators to make a futuristic city even deepened my distaste for the film. To tell you the truth, the only good thing about this movie was the fight, which in itself was quite boring. All I could ask myself when I saw this movie was "when is it going to shoot!"
