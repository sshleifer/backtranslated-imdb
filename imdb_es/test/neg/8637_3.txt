When George Sluizer was told he could direct an American version of the book "Het Gouden Ei" / the movie "Spoorloos" (outside of Holland, this movie also has the name "The Vanishing"), he was told that this alone I would pass. if the ending was changed, he was told that 'the American public' would not approve the original ending. Of course, the original ending is much better and, without it, the film loses its impact. Because I've already put this in the trivia section, I will not give the original ending and I'll keep my spoiler-free comment. If you want to know the original ending, look at "Spoorloos" or read the book. This movie is absolute rubbish, and I do not like the first film by Kiefer Sutherland. Watch the original Dutch movie, which is one of the best thrillers in the world.
