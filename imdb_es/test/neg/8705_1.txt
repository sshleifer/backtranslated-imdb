I appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to make of the story of Moses and the exodus from Israel, and that the film helps the audience to put themselves in Moses 'place and understand the intense load that falls on Moses' shoulders. As excited as I was to see this movie, I was very disappointed in the story. (I'm going to put aside videography, special effects and artistic skill in this review). Most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this film and how far it is from the historical accounts of the biblical texts. One of the general principles of the Bible is that * God * took his people out of Egypt and promised to take them to a land flowing with milk and honey. Not only did he make this promise, but he led his people in a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire in the night. He never left them; It was always visible to the Israelites. The film, however, represents a God who remains silent during the entire journey through the desert. This film changed the essence and theme of the biblical text and, instead, describes God as a silent, cruel and disciplinary emptiness. <br /> <br /> In addition, the description of Moses was just as wrong. Moses was known as a man of faith (why, otherwise, he would be a father figure to Israel throughout the Old and New Testaments, even if Moses is known as a man of great faith). However, the film describes him as a pragmatic, angry and insecure loner who despises the call God placed on his life. Well, I'll allow some creative freedom for the filmmakers in the Exodus story ... but this is beyond creativity, it's a heresy.
