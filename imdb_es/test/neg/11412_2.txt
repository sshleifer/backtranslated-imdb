Another son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner. Technically, it is horrible. The performance is not too good either. But there is something about that that makes you want to see more (something like a car accident). The ridiculous close-ups of murderers' eyes are more fun than anything else. If you're looking for a scare ... this is not the movie for you. It is very dark and almost impossible to find. I'm sure there's a reason for that. For a time, it was titled HOSTAGE. No matter what you call it, it's still a bad choice for entertainment. It can be good for an MST3000 party or something. Can you believe that they would use a title like ANOTHER SON OF SAM? If that does not have written exploitation everywhere, I'll eat my hat. I remember when it was shot in Belmont, North Carolina. Many local personalities were used as talent.
