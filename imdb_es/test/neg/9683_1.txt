Oh boy Where do I start in this piece of silt? This is one of the few real high budget movies on my list that I have really considered adequate to give a rating of 1, and that is not for the production values, which are quite high. This film has no respect for the account in the Bible and treats the whole story as a ridiculous fantasy. I could not recommend it to anyone, except to see how low as a society we have become ... <br /> <br /> First of all, Noah was not Lot's friend. Anyone who actually reads Genesis could tell you that Abram was the one they were thinking about. The writers were just trying to fill the story with the whole secondary plot of Sodom / Gommorah, and it seems out of place because it is. Noah is treated like a silly fool ("You were kissing! You were kissing!") But at least it's a step ahead of Voight's hilarious exaggeration in Anaconda. <br /> <br /> However, these offenses pale in comparison to the heretical treatment of God in this film. God is portrayed as a mean and unequaled being who changes his mind at the slightest whim. ("I'm a perfect eternal, but I can be wrong") What? Where do you get this? This kind of God ... no one should pay attention, much less worship, praise or love. What the director says in this, I do not pretend to know. I only know that responsible treatment of Noah's Ark should not take such an easy way out. Shame on these people.
