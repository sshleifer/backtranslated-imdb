It's true that I can no longer watch Comedy Central just because I can not stand watching the repeated commercials of this program. I'll tell you the truth, this is a terrible show not because it offends me, but because Carlos Mencia is one of the worst comedians I've ever seen. I'd rather see Carrot Top make an impression of George Bush than see this attack without skill. And believe that he calls himself the greatest. Even if he did not steal the jokes, he is still bad at counting them, is out of time and is unoriginal. I remember that in a joke he said: "Why do whites go camping? To pretend they are poor for a week?" Now, what is that supposed to mean? That all whites are rich? Another that I did not understand was when he made a sketch of Price is Right and told a fat guy: "You must know how much a refrigerator costs, you're fat" and the fat guy had the saddest look on his face. But what does that mean? That the "fat people" are always looking for refrigerators? Those are just the two I've seen in their commercials, God knows what your program is like ... <br /> <br /> This program falls into the likes of Epic Movie and Date Movie ..
