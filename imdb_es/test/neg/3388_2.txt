I would like to know who cheated the producers of this film to pay for their production. That persion is a genius. This movie somehow got my attention by about two-thirds of it until I realized that I was not going anywhere fast. I think the music made it look like something was happening, but nothing was really happening. It was not scary. The dialogue was badly written. The first 90 minutes should have been covered in approximately 15 minutes. This would have been an episode of Twilight Zone or Outer Limits moderately acceptable. <br /> <br /> At this point, I'm angry because I wasted all that time. That is a couple of hours that I will never go back. <br /> <br /> I hope these comments prevent someone from losing the night. Take a nap or go to the gym instead. Or if you want to be afraid, turn on a cable news channel.
