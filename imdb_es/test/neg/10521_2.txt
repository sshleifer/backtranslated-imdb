This stinker is in a disconcertingly frequent rotation in a channel here, and I have found myself staring in horror again and again. The script is like something you would invent with friends after drinking too many drinks, and the production values ​​coincide admirably. <br /> <br /> It is meant to be a children's movie, but it presents a grotesque (and poorly explained) kidnapping scene; the star dog has a lack of star quality matched only by the other actors; and, in general, it has the appearance of being filmed in someone's backyard (the soccer game does not present more than three dozen extras sadly applauding in the background). <br /> <br /> Even everything ends with a limited budget. The voice-over sequence when the story, to one's relief, simply stops. Those of high rank here should be the producers, or most of the extras in the game of football!
