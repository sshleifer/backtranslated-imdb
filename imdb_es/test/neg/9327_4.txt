I hate to admit it, but they were right to fire Schrader. The opportunity is here to create an atmosphere, to attract an audience to a movie. It was not done The characters are weak. The story was weak. The address was very poor. Schrader was out of his depth and it shows. I have seen it several times now in the hope that there is at least one trade-in feature. But no, nothing. The next stage will probably be a new version of the original or, hopefully, it will be fine by itself. Anyone wishing to know which was the best sequel to The Exorcist should read 'Legion', written by Blatty, it has to be the best follow-up of an original piece that should be printed. Unfortunately, it was not translated to the screen very well and I doubt if it could ever be. As for the domain, from. Avoid at all costs.
