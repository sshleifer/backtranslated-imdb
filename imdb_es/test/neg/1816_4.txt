This is the first and, as far as I can tell, the only complete production of "Heart of Darkness" ever released. Before starting on "Citizen Kane", Orson Welles recorded some test images for a version of "Heart of Darkness" that was filmed entirely in what would now be called "POV", where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character Charlie Marlow; it would only be seen fleetingly in mirrors, windows, water, etc. The movie was never made. The technique "POV" was used, without success, in 1947 in "The lady in the lake", with Robert Montgomery playing Philip Marlowe. Presumably, the coincidence of the two characters "Marlow (e)" is just that. Of course, Francis Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" was based on "Heart of Darkness." <br /> <br /> The short novel "Heart of Darkness" by the British writer Joseph Conrad, born in Poland, first serialized in a British literary. The magazine in 1899 presents one of his favorite alter egos, ship captain Charlie Marlow, who also tells the story "Youth" and indirectly tells the story of "Lord Jim". Marlow, temporarily without work, decides to take a job as captain of a riverboat for a Belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of the personal fief of King Leopold II, the cruelly misnamed Free State of the Congo. Marlow travels from London to Brussels, signs with the company and they tell him that his mission is to take a boat down the Congo River to a station located in the interior of the country, headed by one of the most productive agents of the company in the colony, a German named Kurtz. . The shipments of ivory, latex (for rubber production) and other products from the Kurtz station have ceased, and no word has come downstream from Kurtz for some time. There are rumors that he has "turned native". Marlow must investigate, take the necessary measures and make a report about his return. He takes the passage along the coast of West Africa to the mouth of the Congo, is delayed for weeks while he is forced to repair his boat at the company station on the coast, and finally goes upstream to find the Kurtz station. The river, the heat, the vegetation, the wildlife, the insects, the people, make a dent in their resistance, their imagination and their mental resources. Find Kurtz sick, half crazy and close to death. The last meeting and the death of Kurtz are almost an anticlimax, especially because Conrad is so obscure about what really happens that we have left to solve it for ourselves. This is a novel in which you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the end, but nevertheless treasure the story for its incredible atmospheres. <br /> <br /> This "Heart of Darkness" was filmed with Guyana in Central America for West Africa. It is better where the novel is at a greater disadvantage: it actually shows the inhabitants of the First World what a trip by boat would be like on a tropical river. But the rest of the movie was forgettable. Tim Roth does the best he can as Marlow, but so much about the plot, characterizations and relationships of the characters has been altered beyond recognition that one wonders why they got upset. If the goal was to make Conrad's story for the screen, why did not they leave her alone? It is not reasonable to expect that no concessions will be made when a book becomes a film, but so many changes were made that, for me, they did not have a cinematographic justification and one wonders if we are simply dealing with incompetent screenwriters and filmmakers. The most disappointing of all was John Malkovich as Kurtz. He was completely grumpy and simply gave him the paper. Everything about him is wrong: his appearance, his acting style, his voice, his accent, everything. A much better option would have been someone like Bruno Ganz (unlike Malkovich, a true German, as the character). <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing production and I would recommend it only after reading the Reserve if you wish to rely on more than your imagination to get a visual image of a boat trip on the Congo River around 1900.
