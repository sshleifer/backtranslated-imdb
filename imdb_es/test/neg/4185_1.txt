This movie was horrible, it was like accidentally watching a gay porn waiting for the girls, but they just do not come ... I waited almost 2 hours for the damn scarecrows ... they just did not come ... Instead, it's just a Foolish vagabond wandering through a field of dead corn with a camera, is a mix of the witch Blaire and a bad episode of the twilight area. And the best of all is that from October 23, 2005, they started filming a sequel, please do not be fooled by the box, although it seems exactly the same as in the first dark harvest, it is not that Lions Gate bought the rights of Corn: the movie. and I had the brilliant idea of ​​releasing it as the sequel to the original dark harvest, which I found funny ... the only thing they had in common was that they were both shot in a field of corn ... This movie WILLLLLL will not scare you like the first one, so get away !!!!!
