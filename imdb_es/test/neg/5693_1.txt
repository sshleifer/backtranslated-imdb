Today I had a real longing for a science fiction movie, so I decided to take a look at Battlespace. Unfortunately, that was one of my biggest mistakes this year. <br /> <br /> I see that the director, Neil Johnson, has directed more than 500 music videos, and I suggest he come back to that. Music videos are a perfect form of entertainment, and not everyone can make movies. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is probably the voiceover. And that says a lot, since special effects are sometimes terrible. The voiceover did not work on Blade Runner, and it does not work here. The first hour or so is spent watching the main character walk through the desert, while his daughter tells the story. I think the story could have made a great movie, but not this way. <br /> <br /> The second worst part is the effects. They are simply bad and do not mix with the rest of the image, so you simply do not believe in them. And absolutely all the frames of the film have been filtered, and not in a good way. The filtering used as an effect is good. 90 minutes of that, bad. <br /> <br /> And what about all the devices that talk all the time and do not shut up? If I had used such technology, I would have gone crazy. I was just waiting for the weapons to come out: "I'm really sorry, but it looks like I've run out of ammunition." No, stay away. This movie is not worth the time.
