Years ago, I was able to watch a fairly well-made television movie called "Linda." It was made in 1973, and starred Stella Stevens in the fatal woman title roll. Imagine my surprise when, more than ten years later, I once again saw the same story unfold on nightly television. However, it was this 1993 version, starring Virginia Madsen. Do not get me wrong, I can handle remakes, even dark ones. But this badly written and badly filmed retread made me feel bad for both Madsen and his co-star Richard Thomas. Unlike the original, the dialogue here is clich√©, and I ask myself: "Why did you bother to write it again?" Secondly, the work of the camera is very heavy, and the stock of film is poor. Sometimes it reminded me of the student film competition at the beginning of "The Big Picture" by Christopher Guest. Finally, the cast looks bored (Madsen) or suffering (Thomas). In fact, the only one who seems to be enjoying work very much is Ted McGinley. Of course, with his hair perfectly combed and his teeth covered, he is really stretching from his previous work on "The Love Boat." In summary, to take a critique of Opus the Penguin in Bloom County: <br /> <br /> "This movie makes for the movie what Jonestown did for Kool-Aid". <br /> <br /> Thomkat
