I'm a big fan of horror movies, particularly of the subgenres of the eighties. Name one ?? I've probably seen it. Last year, a new little horror movie that seemed to slip under the conventional radar called "Saw" was about to hit theaters. I was moderately excited. Having not heard anything about it, I thought it looked pretty promising judging by the previews and the posters (well, except for the backs and the whites with their hands and feet cut off ... those looked terrible!) the movie on opening night. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. This movie was literally mental and psychically painful to watch. Because it was scary? ... DO NOT! Because it was one of the most horrible movies I had ever had the disgust of seeing! First, the construction of the script and the editing was completely outrageous, even by the standards of horror movies. Begin a sequence in an interrogation room with a victim (Shawnee Smith) who recently survived the attack of a serial killer, and then shows a flashback of what she survived? IT'S NOT SCARY! It was impossible to feel any tension, ALSO knowing that the aforementioned victim was perfectly fine. Sure, that thing about the reverse bears trap was creepy ... but WHY should I feel a little scared when CLEARLY, you just showed me that you survived the test? Unfortunately, the whole movie was built in this way. Start with two guys in a cellar. Then, they show flashbacks of how they were kidnapped ... NO SCARY! Why? Because we already know what will happen to them, since we have just seen the result of the attack. THEY ARE FINE! Keep up the story! Even more unfortunately, the real story was, in the best of cases, meager. I could not have worried less about these annoying and regrettable excuses for the "characters" and the acting did not help. Cary Elwes was solid for the most part and then, all of a sudden, towards the end, he started crying like a lost baby as he struggled to keep his American accent intact (it did not work, the audience I saw this with was in stitches). This led him to a reckless and idiotic decision that was not the simplest he would try. I had other options. The best THE MOST INTELLIGENT. Even given his intense emotional state (horribly communicated through a horrible performance), it was still irrational. I did not buy it. BAD WRITING ALERT! In addition, even when certain sequences were played directly and without flashback, they were terribly predictable. I constantly found the patting of my foot impatiently waiting for the silly sequence to end. This happened for the whole movie. I saw every "turn" that comes. Twenty minutes into the movie, he had already called the murderer's identity, not to mention his connection to his "accomplice (s)" as soon as they appeared on the screen. Better acting could have been able to eclipse the horrible script. Instead, the actors could have had themselves tattooed "RED-HERRING" or "ACCOMPLICE" on their foreheads. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I was totally outraged because I had even wasted a fragment of my life in this movie, and the whole theater was laughing hysterically at the absolutely horrible ending. Seriously, you'd think you were watching a Monty Python movie. I would have been laughing too, if I had not been so angry about the film's total and absolute failure to achieve ANYTHING it set out to do. When we left, there was (no kidding) a line to talk to the theater manager to get his money back (it did not happen). I was absolutely sure that the movie was going to be a box-office bomb. The following week, I could not have imagined my surprise when I discovered that "Saw" had reached number one at the box office and EVERYONE was talking about it (mostly, people who considered "Napoleon Dynamite" an epic story that provoked the reflection and thought "satire" was some kind of rubber). I'm so sick of hearing people praise this movie that I often feel like I'm going to throw up. It is entertainment for the weakest and simplest of the human race. Those who find a strange Jigsaw clown-puppet mounted on a tricycle threatening (it's a doll, stick it and leave, what's so scary?). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I own all the "Friday the 13th", I love my splash movies, I thought "Napoleon Dynamite" was very funny, I was not tired enough of Freddy, Michael, Pinhead or Leatherface, we appreciate the sources for unknown gems of horror and classify in "Sleepaway Camp II: Disgruntled Campers" among my 10 best favorite Slashers. However, I realize that these films are not the most sophisticated that American cinema has to offer. I appreciate them for what they are ?? Fast, easy fun. "Sierra" is cinematic garbage. The film tries to be an intelligent and semi-sophisticated trip, unpleasant, and gets stuck in an irritating and annoying waste of time, money, energy and celluloid. Atrocious to all accounts. Each individual copy must be incinerated, along with its weak-minded fans. What a shame. <br /> <br /> Will I see "Saw II"? Maybe after taking a double shot of Liquid Drano before taking my eyes out and impaling shish-kabob skewers to white and heat in my ears and colon. My rating: 0/10. Avoid at all costs.
