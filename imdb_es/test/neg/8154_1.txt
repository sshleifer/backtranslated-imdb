The only thing I hoped this movie did not have was an intelligent and talking motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This movie is just horrible. I gave him 1 star, which of course means that I enjoyed it immensely. Bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad choreography of struggle. The only real actor in this movie is Martin Landau, who, of course, does a good job playing the villain, although the character is the evil CEO / villain of the standard cardboard cutout. Even the so-called "plot spin" in the end was not a surprise. <br /> <br /> There was a lot to be mocked in this movie, I enjoyed it a lot. And I had some awesome car stunts. <br /> <br /> Do you like bad movies? Look at this, ay. Do you want a good movie? Not here.
