This is a bad movie. Without a doubt, it belongs to the category of how not to make a feature film. The story, the direction, the acting and the style are flat like a pancake. The story consists of five? yes five ?? Football matches stretch throughout the duration of the film, each more boringly filmed than the previous one, like a dysfunctional amateur football team that goes from strength to strength. That's right, that's the plot. It is difficult to know to whom this film is directed. It's too banal for football fans and there's nothing for teenagers or adults. Nor is there anything for her in women, not even a single female character. Sadness wears you out when the team plays game after game game after game after game. The story, as it is, the dialogue and the manners seem to be taken from a past Ireland, with all the actors spitting accents of cod in the accents of Dublin. You do not have to see it to believe it. Avoid at all costs. Can someone give me back my 90 minutes? High point the credits at the end, low too many to mention. Brendan Gleeson is in this movie.
