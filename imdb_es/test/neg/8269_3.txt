The television announcer who presented this last Saturday night said that he should have won an Oscar. Quite a comment for a movie I had never heard of ... although I do not know why I should have paid attention to a television announcer. In the event, said announcer was talking about a gut. <br /> <br /> It's a sad and miserable movie that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I could not continue with Hoskins' horrible gum accent. I can not see any advantage in being established in the Midland anyway. <br /> <br /> Unresolved threads abound ... and normally I would not mind, but half of them do not make sense. And what happens when Hoskins says he's going to pick Felicia out of her guest house even though she never told him exactly where she was staying? Or her participation in the funeral that clearly never took place (and where was she during those days?) Clumbsy and badly thought through business if you ask me. <br /> <br /> It's a thriller without emotion. . It's full of pretentious business things. It's depressing ... <br /> <br /> I did not like it. I thought it was garbage. I would not recommend it. 'Nuff said.
