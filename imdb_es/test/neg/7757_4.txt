From what I understand, Mr. Bava abandoned this project before it was completed ... AND ALSO, like this !!! If it were, I would have definitely made sure that EVERY copy would burn and if someone in the future ever asked me about this movie ... NEVER HAPPENED AND NEVER EXISTED ... End of story. <br /> <br /> Despite some great scenarios and a good photograph, this is a horrible movie ... is it supposed to be scary? (not in the least) is it supposed to be fun? (puh-leese) A total waste of time ... and I really do not like to have to say that !!
