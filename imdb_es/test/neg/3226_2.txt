Despite being one of the first films of John Cusack and Demi Moore, it is one that even the toughest fans can get lost, unless they have to complete the collection. I have rare moments, in which I can handle Better Off Dead, but this movie is, ultimately, worse. I'm just not a fan of Savage Steve Holland, and he did both movies. So if you do not like random comedy and amateur animation, stay away from this one. FYI even for fans of Demi Moore: can not sing and the synthesizers of the 80 did not save it. There are too many predictable turns and too easy jokes. I suppose if you want nonsense entertainment or something that you can leave in the background and ignore while doing something productive, do it. Otherwise, do not watch this movie. If John Cusack (or Demi Moore) could not save him, you know he has to be bad. They are the only reason why I did not give this movie a 1.
