In short, this movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is a Disney movie, which are generally shallow movies with mediocre arguments and bad acting. HOWEVER, I must say that this is the worst of all the Disney movies, with bad acting, MANY IRRITANT GIRLS OF ADOLESCENTS (my god) and an extremely unrealistic plot. Even at age 12 there is no way I liked this movie. The only way this film could have been worse was if they tried to put it in theaters or if they tried to sell it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and change the channel before seeing this, no matter how boring you are on a Sunday afternoon.
