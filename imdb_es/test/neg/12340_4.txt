Like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing cars, this has all the appearance of a "jollies" project for Robert Redford, since he can ski up and down in the sunlight of the Alps. <br /> <br /> The story is as light as powdered snow with Redford's boy, David Chappellet (what kind of main name is that?) That, with his eyes on the prize of Olympic glory, He takes his nose, in no particular order, to his coach, father and teammates. Women are a mere secondary spectacle in their insular world, as evidenced by a rather unpleasant scene of repulsion with an old girlfriend in her hometown and then her selfish and petulant search for, heaven above, an independent, free-thinking woman, interpreted by Camilla. Sparv. The ski sequences are good with some good tricks that involve numerous hits and scratches on the track, but their effectiveness is tempered by our subsequent familiarity with television coverage of skiing events to the present. Also, I'm not convinced that the Winter Olympics have the same massive identification with the general public as the summer games, so when Redford finally wins his gold medal on the final reel, he could not be so excited about it. He in one way or another. other. <br /> <br /> Of the actors, Redford, the best profile in advance, does not need to do much and, in fact, does not, while Gene Hackman does it better with equally scarce material. Mrs. Sparv likes the main female interest that treats Redford in the same way that she has undoubtedly treated all the other women in her chauvinistic form. <br /> <br /> In truth, there is a lack of dramatic tension in all of which the action sequences do not fully compensate and does not care a fig for any of the main characters. One of those movies where the actors probably enjoyed doing it more than what the viewers saw.
