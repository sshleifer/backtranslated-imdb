The rhythm of this movie is quite slow. It takes about 70 minutes to take Katie to China (which we know she will) and leaves her 30 minutes to finish things. The story is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I guess the film is coming of age, but it is full of stereotypes that are exaggerated: <br /> <br /> Katie: a beauty that realizes what you see, boys and shopping is not everything . She realizes that she can "feel" and "see the real world." Touching <br /> <br /> The mother - very nervous, nervous and screaming (wow, very innovative) that needs to be taken care of by a strong man. <br /> <br /> The father - patient and always understanding and cares for the incapable woman. <br /> <br /> The boyfriend who just wants to get in his pants. <br /> <br /> The Chinese comical clown who does not know how to speak English correctly. and he made an action of laughter. I thought Hollywood abandoned those characters in the mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> The nurse who sometimes knows everything how to move in China, which in the next moment is a carbon copy of The mother, that is, a woman who can not handle the situation or knows something. <br /> <br /> The deformed Chinese girl who, with the help of Westerners, gets help and becomes a beautiful girl. Because in China (a third world country according to the movie) we have nothing and, therefore, need our charity. Gah, wake up and smell what you're shoveling. <br /> <br /> Surely there is some poverty in China, but the portrait of the aid of the western countries (read USA) is such a superficial and happy ending that it is sad and disgusting. Shanghai (where the film is set) is the most expanding and evolving city in the world at this time. <br /> <br /> The Chinese father is so kind and kind-hearted that in the end he has a desire ... be a cowboy with a white hat ... <br /> <br /> The teacher (Sean Astin ) that has this really touching story (not) that counts without feeling. Why Sean? WHY ?? <br /> <br /> Etc, etc. It is really difficult to find a "real" person in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> This is just a good movie for Americans under 15. If you want to learn something about the world clock p. Ex. Hotel Rwanda instead. For a better life story or a mature film, I suggest you watch the Italian "Cinema Paradiso" which won the reward of the best foreign film academy a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is how small it is. Landscapes of the city that really capture some (not all) of the beautiful Chinese countryside. I've been there and I've seen some of that.
