Apparently, in the eyes of some, there are not enough horror films these days that involve young people being chased through a desert by a mysterious and bloodthirsty lunatic in a truck. I mean, all we have so far is Joy Ride, Wolf Creek, Jeepers Creepers, Monster Man, among others. REST STOP may very well be the worst of those. It's about a girl and her boyfriend who leave their lives behind to start together again in California. On the way, they stop in a dirty bathroom so that the young woman can relieve herself, but when she returns, she discovers that her boyfriend and her car are no longer there. From there, he learns that the culprit is a guy who drives a yellow truck that proceeds to stalk and terrify while hiding in the bathrooms. This movie is so unoriginal that it's boring. The acting is annoying, the gore is soft and the murderer, whose identity is not revealed throughout the film, is anything but memorable. Terrible - terrible movie ...
