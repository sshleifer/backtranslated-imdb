When I first saw this movie, I was literally rolling on the floor laughing (especially when they were being chased by the water, and when the guy was driving through people's gardens, I mean, would it hurt to drive around the washing line? ?) the special effects! This movie clearly did not have a big budget. Either that or the boy left his child in charge of the controls. the water that came out of the curse looked like a lock on a beer can that had burned. What were the actors thinking? Did they really think it was a good movie? Or did they simply need the money? It is not that they had won much. When I saw this for the first time, I was like 'God, how old is this?' When I looked at the information about it and saw that it was done in 2003, I thought my TV was broken. <br /> <br /> This is really a disaster movie, in more ways than one.
