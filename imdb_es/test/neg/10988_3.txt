I will recommend it in one way ... it was innovative. Innovative does not mean that it is a good movie, it means that it can give you an idea of ​​what you can take and implement in your own movies. <br /> <br /> The simple plot is ... well ... simple. I got to the point where I did not care if they destroyed the building or not. If I had to listen to that girl's annoying laugh one more time, I swear I would throw the DVD out the window. And there is also the protagonist. They try to make him nice, but he is a crazy pervert! Sniffing the girls bra, looking at her furtively when she is naked, putting the bra over her eyes when he sleeps, putting the bra on an inflatable sex doll (she takes off her panties while he sleeps and puts them on her wrist) umm ) <br /> <br /> What irritates me even more is the tinting of shit. In the photo gallery on the DVD, you can see what the movie looked like before it was embedded and put a color tone (also digitally). The film looked MUCH better without the effect ... so they sacrificed it being a good idea. Film just to be artistic ... bah. I could understand the use of tricks like that if the quality of the film were shit ... <br /> <br /> I think most people who liked this movie just liked it because the girl was naked for a good 5-10 minutes. This does not compare to Delicatessen (as many try to do). Delicatessen has characters that you can get into and like ... these people here just grunt and laugh. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would also like to point out that this was also an attempt to be like a German Impressionist film. old silences. One of the problems with most foreign films, especially artistic ones, is that they focus on making an artistic composition and forgetting about the "space" of the scene. The result is that the audience does not really understand what is happening because they do not have an idea of ​​the surrounding space. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's nonsense. The short film on the DVD, Surprise, was much better.
