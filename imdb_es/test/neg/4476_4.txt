Talk about your wildlife. Just a series B movie, but what about that ... science fiction and lesbian sex. From the mind of writer and director Cody Jarrett, a piece of cheesy fun. A chemical company is dumping waste that is causing mutants in a fish farm. The hot Kristi Russell plays Dr. Barbara Michaels, an EPA agent sent to investigate this environmental dilemma. She has just entered into a lesbian relationship with the waitress Trixie (Ariadne Shaffer) and her love scenes are as good as those in this movie. A frog the size of a man incites chaos; causing a car accident, raping the daughter of the head of the chemical company, raping a girl under the stands at a football game, stretching her arm with a runner at the football game, raping a nun ... all before receiving two shots in the chest after one The antidote was found all ready. The special effects ... well, they're not special; A boy in a rubber frog costume without genitals to prove himself. The difficult tadpoles, do you still want to see it? Go ahead, but bribe any secret witness.
