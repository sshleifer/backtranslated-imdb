I like Arnold, and I love the subject, but this was a very disappointing movie. The first time I saw the previews, they were dark and sinister, and Arnold's name was not even mentioned. But I recognized it, which led me to believe that I was making a film that had a more serious and suspenseful mood. That was not just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (although I admit it, most of them are pretty good!). So far, I had avoided movies with any real religious theme. And I was excited. I was wrong. This is just another action, explosion, firearm. And it's pretty bad.
