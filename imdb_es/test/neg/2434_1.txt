I think this was a HORRIBLE mistake by Disney. First, Kuzco does NOT need to pass the "emperor's school" to become emperor! That has never happened before. Second, the new voices do not sound like the originals at all. Very poor redo. And while he loved the movie The Emperor's New Groove, the New School is simply stupid. As all the jokes are the same, and many are from the movie. The plot becomes redundant, always Yzma (is that how it is written?) Trying to become empress, Kuzco stops her, etc. Or Kuzco learns to become a better person. I think Kuzco is upset with his constant complaints and questions. He is a spoiled brat and that bothers me. I do not think this is worth five minutes of your time, much less half an hour.
