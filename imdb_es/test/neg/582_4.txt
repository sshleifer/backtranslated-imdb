Lou Costello (without Abbott) plays an autonomous "garbage collector" of a small town (and the inventor of a time-keeping machine!) Who is secretly courting the niece of the city. After a dispute, Lou's girl (Dorothy Provine) runs into a misty cave, so we never learn with fog, and emerges as a 30-foot giant. Provine is certainly a good sport, and does not bother to try not to look ridiculous (anyway, it would have been impossible), however, the screenwriter is very cruel to this character, making her not only a giant but an insensitive harpy . all right. Provine manages Costello while creating chaos among Army troops who are summoned, but nothing funny is done with the transformation. Triumphed by "Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman" the previous year, the film presents Lou Costello in his last reverence, but offers little else. The special effects are marginal, while the script needed more fun lines and more agile direction. * 1/2 of ****
