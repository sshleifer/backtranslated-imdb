This attempt at a "thriller" would have no substance at all! Some may say that this movie "has it all?" Autism, arson, robbery, lost love, a bag of money, cut throats, murder, blood, a flat revolver, moaning of clenched teeth, tits (several definitions can be used), big flashlights, tribal people, a brother duo he tries to portray "fools and fools", white wolves, scenes of fights that resemble "happy slaps", snowmobiles, a large tracked vehicle and a motel in the process of renovation. All this, with a melody "Enyanesque" towards the end ... <br /> <br /> Maybe my rating is a little hard, but one view will be enough for the healthy cinemaphile, with nothing else to do. <br /> <br /> Yeowza!
