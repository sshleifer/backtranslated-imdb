The combination of Dan Haggerty (Elves) and Linda Blair (Exorcist) is enough for any horror fan to get excited about this movie. And once you see the cover of this movie of a frozen zombie coming out of your cryogenic camera, you'll think you were in B-Movie Horror Heaven. At least that's how I approached this movie. But boy, I expected a shock <br /> <br /> I love horror movies. I also love movies B Nothing makes my day more than a little corny movie about zombies, monsters, murderers, that kind of thing. But to say that this film was missing is an understatement. This movie was pure garbage. You would think that the zombies would look in some way like what is shown on the cover of the box, but instead, get actors with masks that are clearly sold at any Halloween counter. In addition, the script is more than regrettable. Our main character, Joseph, suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks comfort in the warm Mary, played by Blair. Not once do you see any sign of sadness or discomfort on the part of Jose's character. Instead, we see the head of the cryogenic laboratories, a man named Dr. Miller, eager to get the corpses and experiment with their organs. There is no emotion or anything that makes you think you should care about anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, very disappointing. All the elements to make a great horror movie were there. You had your zombies, your decent actors and your story. But the lack of good writing and little or no sense of direction ruined it in a real way. In general, 4 out of 10
