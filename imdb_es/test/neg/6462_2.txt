I'm a big fan of the Northern Exhibition. Men In Trees is a complete version of Northern Exposure. The people of New York City are trapped in a remote city (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman). She does not immediately hook up with a local (Jack Slattery / Maggie O'Connell). The city only has one pilot who is not available often. There is only one radio program. And the whole show is about extravagant people with sincere and strange relationships. Too many parallels. Like Northern Exposure, except for an obvious demography, it has been altered in each character. I'm bored. Give me something new to think about. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the writing is pretty good. But if it were a school project, it would certainly have earned the stamp of plagiarism. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the people who love this show were protected from the dedicated creativity and hard work of Joshua Brand and John Falsey.
