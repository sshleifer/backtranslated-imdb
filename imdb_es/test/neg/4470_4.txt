Come on, let's put aside the second-year humor that we can find in racism and let's be honest ... it's not funny. I was appalled by the fact that the two main stars agreed to make a film that was so offensive and so detrimental to race relations, and I'm not referring to the obvious black / white comment of the film, but the attacks on other ethnic groups, like the characterizations of Betty White of Hispanics. Should we say that we accept to make this film as a sign of senility ... is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotyped garbage? Or is it the fault of the writers? How about the third makeup assistant? No, the fault is with us to perpetuate this kind of trash (in the form of comedy), that Hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say that enough is enough ... racism is real and it is not. A matter of laughter . We are all different, we celebrate that diversity, we do not make fun of it and we promote division.
