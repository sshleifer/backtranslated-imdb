And you know why? Because they thought (or at least made fanatics believe the horror) that a group of unpleasant, moody and screaming teenagers, some stupid demons (where do they come from, what is their purpose? Who knows?) And a dark mansion are You all need to make a horror movie. Needless to say, they were wrong. You also need a script, some logic, some rules and some inventions. This movie has a scene that lives up to its reputation (the lipstick scene, of course), and a couple of fun moments (the child's brother's description of his mother's cookies, the "Do not look at me" scene "by Linnea Quigley). It also has more blasphemy than any movie I've seen since the last time I saw "Reservoir Dogs." Literally, every fourth or fifth word is a "f ***" or a "b ****". Then, again, when a movie starts with FOUR false scares in its first 5 minutes, you know you should not expect anything that resembles good movie making. (* 1/2)
