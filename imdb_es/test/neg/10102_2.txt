I just saw this on TV today. It was in the ABC evening movie. <br /> <br /> This was not a very good movie, but for a low budget independent movie like this, it was fine. There is some suspense in it, but there are so many bad qualities that really make the movie stop. The script is quite scarce, and the elements of the plot are not very realistic, like the way a 911 operator would laugh and hang when someone reports a murder. I do not know what the writer thought when they came up with that idea, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was going to be a good suspense thriller, because there were a few scenes that seemed to lead to something good, but unfortunately they never did. There were some elements of the plot that have been used in other movies similar to this one, and in the end, they did not prove to be very creative. <br /> <br /> If there's something good in this movie, it's the cast. All the actors in this movie did well with what they had to work on. The terribly underestimated actress Elizabeth Pe√±a was great in this movie. She is very sexy, and has an incredibly sexy voice. However, if you want to see a movie that is really good, check out the excellent animated movie The Incredibles. In that movie, she made good use of her sexy voice. <br /> <br /> What can I say? This movie really is not worth it, but the actors were good. Unfortunately, everyone was wasted in this movie, which is a real shame. This movie tried to be a good suspense thriller, but in the end, it collapsed. If you want to see a good movie that is similar to this, but much better, see The Hitcher. If you want to see something with the cast members of this movie, watch any of their other movies. You can easily pass this movie if you ever have the chance to see it.
