This is an adaptation of a work by Edith Wharton, whose writing is incredible. Unfortunately, this film never shakes the feeling that these twentieth-century film people do not understand the repression and despair of the 19th century that Wharton's work describes. Ward and Dalton are not that bad, but Alicia Witt's wooden performance made me shudder. She was supposed to be interpreting the restless element of the story, but she stayed like a stick throughout the movie, and I never believed a word out of her mouth. When she asks Sela Ward "Why can not I move?" Near the end of the movie, I could not help but reply: "That's what I've been wondering for the last hour and a half !!!"
