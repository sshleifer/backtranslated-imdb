This is the only movie that represents everything that is bad in the movie business. The actors are pathetic and the script is horrible. Special effects, if any, are so badly made that it would have been better to do it with cartoons. On top of that it's great! I think the creators of the movie wanted me to have humor, but the only time I laughed was when I saw Patrick S. with the long hair and the colorful costumes that everyone had. The scenes at the end were good, but they were not part of the movie. In the end, you will ask yourself, "Why did I waste my time and money with that trash when I could see the plants grow or move the clouds?" I do not think he's a critic or something, but this is a really boring movie! DO NOT LOOK! STUPID DANGER OVERLOAD!
