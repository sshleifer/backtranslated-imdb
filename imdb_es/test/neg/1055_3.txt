*** Possible spoiler but probably not *** <br /> <br /> The game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is no longer in it <br /> <br /> more! Diddy is also gone! <br /> <br /> The 1st Donkey Kong Country was one of my two favorite games of all time <br /> <br /> Super Nintendo. (The other one is Super Mario World) <br /> <br /> The 2nd Donkey Kong at least had diddy kong and good levels, <br /> <br /> although sometimes it looked more like a pirate-based game. <br /> <br /> However, this is the worst of all! Does not have the feeling of <br /> <br /> the original or the second, the appearance of the enemy is stupid and the levels are <br /> <br /> even worse. It does not seem realistic anymore! I did not enjoy his game unlike the last two, the first one had great background music <br /> <br /> and the second one was not bad, but the music in this game <br /> <br /> is horrible ! <Br /> <br /> In these days it happens a lot that movies, shows and, sometimes, <br /> <br /> videogames that start off fantastic, end up ruined by <br /> <br /> a stupid continuation! It saddens me to say that I feel Donkey Kong as a saga is not so good <br /> <br /> now that he has Donkey Kong 3! <br /> <br /> They should have left it in the original or maybe the second
