This is horrible. Not really, this is, without exception, the worst of the worst ... the worst ... I doubt even calling it @ & $% in '_movie_'. It is a visual radicular of ninety minutes. The plot is practically non-existent: a mad scientist who looks like the leader of 'The Cars' impregnates a woman in his secret laboratory, a lawn chair in what I believe can be a garage, through an injection of Palmolive. In a matter of hours, she gives birth to an adult monster who then goes on a rampage. That's the whole movie. The scenes of the death: these are badly configured, it takes forever, and the acting ... how can you ruin yourself _create_? The victims remain standing there while the monster snarling, wheezing and congested advances towards them and strangles them for about three days. The games are cheesy, the lighting for most of the film consists of a single maglite (yes, a big flashlight), the sound quality is poor, there are only about 40 words of dialogue for the whole movie and the performance is described with generosity like wood. The images are shamelessly recycled to fill the film. And the special effects would make any BBC science fiction production shake its head and proclaim "They did not even try." The 'monster' has no name in a $ 3 halloween rubber mask with a few bandages attached. In his encounter with the only police officer in the film, the policeman shoots invisible bullets without flash, which apparently travel so slowly that the monster can avoid them in five steps. I do not see this movie. Not really, that's not a challenge. I do not see this movie. The director must be shot. The writer must be chained to a giant rock where his liver will be devoured every morning by Ed Wood. Enough rentals and there could be a sequel, do not let that happen!
