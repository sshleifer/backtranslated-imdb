We chose to see this movie as an alternative to the screening of The Polar Express at our local IMAX theater. What a waste of time and money! First of all, it's not cute. The snowman, at times, seemed demonic. Other times, he was simply a zombie. He did not show expression or emotions most of the time, and his blue, hollow eyes were simply creepy. <br /> <br /> In the second place, Santa declares that at the beginning it is a film about the spirit of giving. Santa Claus and a snowman declaring war with each other is a film about giving? I am in favor of a small parody, but this was not fun or entertaining. <br /> <br /> The idea that Snowman's flute is his voice is different. Too bad you never see or hear the snowman play his flute ... not even a "thank you" to Santa. <br /> <br /> The only fun parts of the movie were the "jumps" at the end of the movie. movie. Too bad they did not use them in the movie. It would have been better.
