Worse yet, the incredibly boring "The exorcism of Emily Rose." It started decently, and until the mother said to her dad: "Look, I knew I was possessed", in a voice I told you. It was a terrible line, badly spoken and announced the rapid disappearance of this incredibly bad movie. Each member of the family has a past problem with the priest. The father begins to accuse everyone that he likes his wife, or that he actually has an affair with her, which culminates in him killing his friend, and then himself in apparent instant lucidity after he realizes that his friend had not slept with his wife after all. People are dying, others are under possession and, by this point, most viewers no longer care. Except for his employee Miguel, none of the characters in this movie was really nice, so it was hard to worry about any of them. The acting was terrible and the writing even worse. I'm glad I saw it for free; although I feel that for such a bad movie, someone owes me money for the time I lost.
