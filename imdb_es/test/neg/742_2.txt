I'm afraid I did not like this adaptation. When I started watching it I had the strange feeling of watching some 70's TV series, due to the filter and the musical score. I did not like the final scene. Mr. Tilney appears dressed only in his vest. Jane Austen would never have a gentleman leave without a frock coat. It seems that the producers made a modern misunderstanding of a romantic girl's dream. I appreciate the more modern JA adaptations, which show an eye for these details, which makes the BBC series worthwhile. We're sorry, waiting for the 2007 adaptation. I hope that's better and shows the benefits of Jane Austen's 20-year adaptations.
