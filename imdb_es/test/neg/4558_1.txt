It amazes me how many people think that this movie is decent ... much less great! Do most people have basic standards for a movie they see? I just do not know anymore. <br /> <br /> This "commercial film product" does not really deserve the respect of being called a movie. Calling Dean Cain talented is a serious injustice for anyone who has talent. I've had a lot of respect for Lori Petty, but most of that has gone down the tubes. At least his role was extremely small. Maybe she had an account that desperately needed to be paid. <br /> <br /> The ignorance I saw while watching "Firetrap" was incredible. Let me start by taking this out of my chest: if you can not show fire realistically, then do not show it at all. Good?!! It is a shame for all involved when they show unconvincing effects that do not even resemble simulating a real burning building. <br /> <br /> Some interesting details: 1. A concierge opens the door of a large storage closet and finds the entire room engulfed in flames. What does he do? Try to put out the fire with your broom! 2. The same concierge (who knows the building is on fire) later finds a door marked "DANGEROUS MATERIALS". His bright mind tells him it would be a great idea to open that door. Big mistake! 3. A woman is making a fantastic donation of $ 100,000 for a greyhound rescue fund, but ... she is wearing a fur coat for the charity event they are organizing! (Do people who care about animals do not frown with that sort of thing?) 4. Several of the people in the film are forced into a vault of some kind with huge steel walls that even a pulse electromagnetic (!) t penetrate However, they have a spacious air outlet that leads directly to the back of the thing by which anyone could pass. That sure seems like a lapse in security. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I have become tired thinking about this movie. Our "hero" whom we are supposed to be encouraging is a career criminal who from the beginning tries to kill some policemen. What a good boy! If the general public wants to waste their minds on this nonsense, then more power for them. I just wish I could erase it from my memory. 1/10
