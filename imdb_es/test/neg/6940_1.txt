I never thought that a movie could make me regret the fact that I subscribed to the HBO service. Now I know better! Jack is usually one of my favorite actors, but even he could not rescue this part. It's not that I tried. Jack plays his usual Wiitches character from Eastwick. Unfortunately it is not transferred to the southwestern United States. He is as believable as a desperate cowboy like Pee Wee Herman. There is no advantage in performance and for that reason the comedy fails. He is almost ridiculous. The rest of the cast was worse. The synchronization in the delivery of lines is apparently something that the leader had not perfected in 1978 and the others seemed happy to be there. My recommendation for those of you interested in watching this movie is to save your valuable time for something like seeing dry paint.
