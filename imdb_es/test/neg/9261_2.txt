I bought this movie for 99 cents at K-mart several years ago (along with "Hawken's Breed"), calculating anything with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe that will surely be worth it. It was not "Dark Obsession" (the title in which I bought it) it was a slight cut above "Hawken's Breed" (IMBD rated with 2.4), but not enough to allow me to keep it in the house. I threw both movies in the trash. <br /> <br /> This thing fails on so many levels that it is difficult to reduce it, but let's say it is silly, incredible, boring, hedonistic, confusing and even at 100 minutes. too long. <br /> <br /> I love Byrne as an actor, but this sorcerer really looks bad on his resume.
