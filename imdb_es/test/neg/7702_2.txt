The problem with this movie, like so many other films that fail, is the script. <br /> <br /> The script is so out of focus that it flows everywhere. What is the story here? Okay, it's a biographical film, but I think everyone will agree that there's no way a whole life can be condensed in 100 minutes. Some selection and editing is required, but this script simply did not select or edit enough. It did not cause Hoffman's life to be reduced to one or two definable key moments or themes with which the audience could identify and, through them, "obtain" the greatest image of the whole man. <br /> <br /> The film goes from being a biographical film of 'genius with problems', to semi-docu / mocu-mental (using new falsified shots to match the archive images), to Sub Life Life Sob Stories Movie of the week (the whole subject "I am mentioning a son who does not know that I am his" father ", to the film of the theory of political conspiracy, etc., etc. He never decides what he wants to be, and middle citizen Kane has a similar narrative structure (reporter interviewing people from Hoffman's past) is soon abandoned, which leaves the film even more unstructured and flaccid than it starts. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of moments and incidents that do not contribute anything to the story and could have been Cut to leave space to expand something more important The whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after Vincent D'Onofrio hits the window shouting "I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! "(" I'm acting! I'm acting! I'm acting! ") It could easily have been cut off, all that happens is that the psychiatrist says" you have bipolar disorder, here's some lithium, "and the two women in your life say" We could see you on the weekends with more frequency. "and bang! That's it.No more mental health problems.This is a ridiculously useless tokenistic scene that could, and should, have been abandoned before being fired.The scene where everyone stands tall and sees the images of Vietnamese newscasts and Hoffman's phones, GOD "useless." It does not tell us anything at all, however, when it comes to a crucial moment like that of drugs, the making of the film is so hasty that the situation has just left the left field and it does not make any sense to the public, suddenly it's about heroin, where is this coming from, why, what's going on here? <br /> <br /> Me, being a middle-aged southpaw, I guess I'm sitting well I did not even get fed up with the portrayal of 'The Man', 'The Pigs', 'The Fuzz', etc., as brutal, game-smart, thoughtless and hateful hippies. It may have been like that in the America of the 60s, I do not know, it was not there, but in cinematographic terms it was a clumsy and cheap polemic. <br /> <br /> Having said all that Vincent D'Onofrio was convincingly as charismatic as young Hoffman and I could see Janeane Garofalo in anything, even reading a bus schedule, although it just was not right for this part.
