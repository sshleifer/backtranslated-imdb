I have lived in Istanbul for 24 years and I (according to my experience of 39 years) know what Istanbul has lived during all those years. <br /> <br /> Faith Akin is still very young (born in 1973) and falling into the big mistake of being ORIENTAL when looking at Turkey (just like her other film Gegen Die Wand did) This film MISSINGLY LACK of life Contemporary urban Turkish AND MESSAGE the audience by giving (rather false) clues about the geographical and cultural spread of Istanbul. <br /> <br /> Anyone who speaks Turkish could easily attest that many underground bands and groups represented in the film (Siyasiyabend for one) are SO MISERABLE and their members can not even speak a proper language that can not be taken as 'representatives' of contemporary Turkish music. Much less a piece of garbage that many Turkish listeners do not even know. <br /> <br /> We Turks have been accustomed for a long time to the 'shallow' Westerners who look at Turkey with an Orientalist point of view: try to fit the real Turkish image into their mental molds. What is new in this film is the fact that now a director of Turkish origin (Faith Akin) is making the same mistake: look at Turkey with some false Western glasses and struggling to describe it as if he understands better All a futile effort. <br /> <br /> Just ask any Turkish friend of yours: What kind of musical documentary is this without mentioning the names: Zeki Muren, Baris Manco, Ajda Pekkan, Teoman, Muslum Gurses, Ibrahim? Tatlises, Ferdi Ozbegen? ... and many others that have FORMED to date, the real MUSIC that we hear today? <br /> <br /> Faith Akin has a long lesson to learn before babbling and confusing the minds of other people with false Images about contemporary Turkish music.
