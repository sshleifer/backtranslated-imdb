This film was filmed in my hometown and I met many of the "actors" in smaller rolls. Most of them were students of the local karate school and even at the time it was filmed, we all knew how bad it was. It was interesting, however, to see it done. Most of the places where it was filmed no longer exist, such as the nightclub, the pizzeria, etc. The "world premiere" was held at the Akron Civic Theater and we all laughed hysterically at how absurd it was. Personally I think it's the worst movie ever made, but it brings back many good memories. Watch this movie with a tip ... enjoy it for what it is ... a very low budget, badly done, karate movie.
