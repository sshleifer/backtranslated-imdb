The animation is great, I'll give it to you. But Disney perpetuated every stereotype that Alaskans have been trying to overcome for the past two generations. And the names, I mean, go ... Sitka, Kenai, Tanana and Denahi (cheesy takeoff from Denali)? These are real places where real people live! And the real people for whom these real places were named are probably struggling to get out of the Earth looking for revenge for this trivial and small movie. Disney, you live in California and Florida, right in the middle of the rest of the states that still treat us like a foreign country. If you can not stick to what you know, at least hire and / or work with people who know what area you are trying to protect yourself in. Maybe then it would not be so insulting! :(
