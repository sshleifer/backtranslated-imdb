It's easy for a movie that tries to be suspense to end up being simply uninteresting. It happens very often. Dark Harbor is not only not interesting, it is very badly done. Scene after scene adheres to an otherwise exaggerated premise. A couple with problems pick up a stranger with problems to find more problems. <br /> <br /> Some films create tension when building the story. Dark Harbor continues to expand its history but never building on it. I hoped that like other movies, the suspense would finally explode. Never does it In addition, the characters do not have continuity from scene to scene. They can act in one way in one scene, but then act in a completely different way in another scene. At first, you think they are simply out of place, but in the end you realize that they are not really characters at all. They are only props for the final turn. The last ten minutes try to be impressive. On the other hand, it is quite boring and uninteresting. The only thing that struck me was that the movie finally ended. With less than ninety minutes, the movie still seems too long. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those low budget gems. It's more like a fake watch that breaks as soon as you take it home.
