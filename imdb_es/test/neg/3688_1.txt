This may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is absolutely the most boring. Do you wonder why it was filmed mainly in the dark, and especially with Vincent Gallo walking away from the camera or looking down? Because he does not want to show his face for agreeing to be in this movie. I liked his early things, but the pretense of "Brown Bunny" and after being thrown into this nonsense he knocked down a peg in my book. And Val Kilmer? Actually I want to send you a sympathy card. The "doors" to this ??? Actually, the cast was the only reason I saw this movie, and Val does not even appear until the movie is more than half. Simply a sad movie.
