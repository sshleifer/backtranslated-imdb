I made the mistake of seeing "Dark Star" (1974) one night, many years ago. It was one of the stupidest movies I've seen: <br /> <br /> 1. Bad acting. <br /> <br /> 2. Bad writing. <br /> <br /> 3. Scientifically stupid argument. (Destroying an entire planet because its orbit is unstable or the way it will only make things worse: instead of having a large and easily avoidable object, you will have thousands of smaller objects, but equally lethal and more difficult to track.) <Br / > <br /> 4. Totally unreal characters. A beach ball painted as an extraterrestrial? The writers must have been consuming too many drugs. <br /> <br /> It's not surprising that most of the actors who starred in "Dark Star" never did anything else. Of those who did something else, most never acted again after Dark Star. Therefore, having Dark Star in the curriculum vitae of his performance was a death star in his career as an actor.
