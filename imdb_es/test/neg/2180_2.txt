This is supposed to be Charlie's masterpiece, but I'll argue that it's actually one of his weakest films. First of all, it's not funny. Nothing in this movie made me laugh. Okay, there's a quick jump in a box that was a giggle, but that was one of desperation. The first and only speech of The Tramp where he speaks (he sings in a previous movie), but his plain dialogue shows us exactly why it was a joy to see him in "Modern Times" and "Gold Rush", two films that are At least ten times better than this movie. Literally, there is only one good scene in this movie, in which Hitler plays with the balloon like a beach ball. That's. <br /> <br /> Well, then we received a lot of praise for being the first movie to wage war, even long before we entered the war. No, that's not true. It just is not true, so that praise can be rejected a bit. The Three Stooges did it on January 19, 1940 with "You Natzy Spy", ten months before the release in October of the Chaplin movie, and that movie was really fun! If you want to see the best Chaplin movie, look at this as a reference only. And then click on "Modern Times," "Gold Rush," "City Lights," "Limelight," "The Kid," or even "Tillie's Punctured Romance."
