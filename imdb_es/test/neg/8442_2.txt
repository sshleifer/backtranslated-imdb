Let's see: what are the advantages of seeing Piranha, Piranha? Well, if you've never seen anything that has to do with Venezuela, there's a lot of travel videos from both Caracas and the countryside (and the jungle side), and from the various indigenous peoples who work and play, as well as a lot of indigenous people. wildlife. If you like William Smith, he plays a bit git (as he always has). <br /> <br /> And that's it. If it were not for William Smith, this could probably happen as a movie to raise funds for Save the Children or some other organization that benefits the "third world". The only time you really see the fish of the title is during the opening credits. No mutant killer fish, as in Roger Corman's unique name piranha. You would think that with double the fish in the title, there would be twice as many monstrous fish that take advantage of the characters, but unfortunately, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a photojournalist and his brother. Come to Venezuela to make a story about one of the last virgin places on the planet, but your motivation quickly changes to one of wanting to find diamonds, which apparently are quite abundant there. <br /> <br /> There is not a lot of real action or danger in this movie. What could have been an exciting motorcycle race is tempered by the large amount of landscapes and animal footage that is inserted into it to lengthen the time of execution of the films. There is not much more action until the last fifteen minutes or so of the movie (which is probably about how long the movie would last without all the travel documentation). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only ways in which a movie can really be a BAD movie is to be boring or incredibly stupid. Piranha, Piranha certainly qualifies for that old badge, and is very close to the second. The only reason I do not rate it with a "1" is that the added images are more interesting than the rest of the movie.
