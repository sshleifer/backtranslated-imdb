Although Charlie Chaplin made some great short comedies in late 1910, others do not. Examples like His New Job and Shanghaied come to mind, and so would The Floorwalker in this category. <br /> <br /> Charlie gets confused with a department store manager (and vice versa). This manager tries to steal money from the cash register and run to get it. Charlie is just an honest client, but he is blamed for some missing objects stolen by other customers. <br /> <br /> There are not many laughs at it, except for the last few minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator. Otherwise, quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
