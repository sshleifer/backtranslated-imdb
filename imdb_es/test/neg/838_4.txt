Lately, I've been watching many westerns from the 1930s to the present. There are some excellent low budget spaghetti westerns from the late sixties and early seventies. This movie had all the elements of a decent western: a good story with talented actors and everything else. Although, it is a parody of this genre, and for me the way it was done just did not work and it was a disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> This movie can be easily divided into two parts. <Br /> <br /> The first part is great; It has a great opening scene and an interesting story of a bounty hunter (a.k.a. the unknown) who pursues a bandit pursuing a large bank shipment watched, in part, by a banker. In the course of the film, these three characters form changing alliances in an attempt to obtain the money. There are subtle comic winks at the contraptions of previous films of this genre, but comedy does not interrupt history in general. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is where the comedy is exaggerated. and essentially ruins the movie. The turning point is right where the waitress causally scolds the dwarf to stop firing at customers while she waits for other customers who do not seem to notice the four bodies around the place. From this point forward, the film changes from a decent Western spaghetti with comical nuances to a stupid parody. <br /> <br /> There are three horrible fistfight scenes (one in the river, one in the market and one in the market). in the bathrooms) that follow in rapid succession as if one were not bad enough. The fight is so false that it is ridiculous, and since the sound is not synchronized with the image, it makes it even worse. In the scene of the market fight, the banker bounces over the place on hidden trampolines and revolves around the poles as if he were in the circus; It's a clown Although, the worst part of these fight scenes is music; It's this cheerful and happy mix best suited for a square dance or a cheesy episode of 'Hee-Haw'. These scenes practically derail the main story. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was disappointing because it had great potential as a decent western, but the comic book goes crazy. If you want to see a good western parody, see 'Burning Saddles'. If you want to see a good spaghetti western, then avoid this movie.
