And I can be generous. The overwhelming majority of the film consists of a looping footage ... the deranged monster, two women exercising, the rickety monster again, a group of people in the pool, the deranged monster again, nothing worse to wear to despite having been injured. .you get the picture. I refrained from shouting "TAKE IT WITH YOU NOW" several times. <br /> <br /> And it does not help that the images they used have been produced poorly. The sound is disconcertingly out of sync with the image. And in the only scene in which they tried to get "artistic" with lighting and camera techniques, the lighting boy, holding the flashlight that provides the only illumination of the scene, is clearly visible in the shot. <br /> <br /> My hope is that the production was the victim of a horrible disaster in which the original audio track and most of the images were destroyed, but they decided to release it anyway, improvised from the floor of the editing room, in memory of the heroic members of the crew who gave their lives trying to save the * real * movie - the one with the plot and the interesting dialogue. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of this, and I am forced to conclude that, in the immortal words of Joel and the Bots, they simply did not care. <br /> <br />
