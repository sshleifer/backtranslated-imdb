Now, I love old and bad skifee movies as much as most people do. And I understand that a budget is a budget. That said, The planet of dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie. The thing has no actors, and only one attractive woman who is killed two minutes after swimming on land. Literally, there are no redeeming qualities found in this pile of wasted celluloid. The only thing that was not wasted was the paper ... the script should not have more than four pages. Surely no one really is WITH this meaningless dialogue. I am constantly surprised that such films have been made, let alone released. I'm just glad I did not pay to see this waste of time. It's the 75 minutes of my life that I'll never go back.
