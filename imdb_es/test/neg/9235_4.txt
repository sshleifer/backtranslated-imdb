Persuaded by the 7.0 points in IMDb, which is quite good, I decided to watch this movie. However, I found this film quite boring (around 2 hours) and full of clich√©s, a girl who has multiple personalities after a childhood trauma, etc. Tamer KAradagli is quite funny in this movie, dialogue moves, etc., you will have to watch it. He's a bit of the tough cop you see in American movies, maybe copied too much. I would describe this movie as a common American thriller with a bit of Turkish touch. Unfortunately, once again I am convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres that are worth seeing in Turkish cinema. of cliches
