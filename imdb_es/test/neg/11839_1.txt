Okay, let's clarify one thing, I love dinosaur movies, even bad ones. So with this in mind let's proceed. "Raptor" is a really horrible movie, in fact, it's not even a movie in itself, as it is improvised with fragments of "Carnosaur", "Carnosaur 2" and "Primal Species - Carnosaur 3". There are some new images with Eric Roberts as sheriff and his busty companion running confused, scared or whatever he is trying to convey (badly) on the emotional scale, but then, how can they react to something that was filmed several years earlier? . The producers (yes, Roger Corman, I'm talking about you!) They even went so far as to hire 2 people from "Carnosaur" to play small parts, so the horrible death scenes can be reused! So this movie is the cheapest of the cheap ones. Watch the 3 original films, there are no Oscar winners, but they have a merit and entertainment value, but they avoid "Raptor". Oh, it also has the most useless sex scene that lasts almost 10 minutes! Do you think they were trying to eliminate the execution time?
