This turned out to be more of a women's thriller and soap than what I expected it to be ... just a tense thriller. Yes, the last 20 minutes were suspense, but most of the previous 75 were simply tedious. <br /> <br /> Ruter Hauer was a little too moderate, not interpreting his intense normal character. Natasha Richardson looks a bit silly most of the time and her character was very unattractive. <br /> <br /> The story is regular. It's not as bad as what I'm doing, but it sure is not something I see again, and the back of the VHS that describes this movie was misleading.
