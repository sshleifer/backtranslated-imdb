Clearly, this would have had potential in more capable hands, but given Uwe Boll's record, it would have been surprising if there had been any merit in this farce. <br /> <br /> The first 5 minutes is a classic madness of a monster movie - even the horrible single line delivered by GI Joe type soldiers feels like they've been removed from another company of the same genre. . <br /> <br /> You'll be doing yourself a favor if you leave the movie at this time. He has already surpassed all the salient points and will have spared the suffering of sitting through some of the worst performances in recent history. <br /> <br /> Then, enter the absolute talent of the garbage. The protagonist has the same amount of charisma that you will find in the garden slug. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of an uncomfortable artificial romance. This feels so bad that you can only speculate why this scene was conjured. First. Normally, the genre uses interludes of romance and nudity to inject some humanity and sympathy to characters that would otherwise be cut out cartons. Here, all cylinders are counterproductive. <br /> <br /> The effects are bad and the action incredibly boring. Where other classics show originality and imagination in the face of budgetary restrictions, here it seems that everything was spent on restoration. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are no redemption features here, not even the "it's so bad". It's almost good "it applies, it's just bad, and in a bad way. <br /> <br /> Our hero asks the main star about the night they spent together and how she would rate it. I give the whole thing 1 (I would have gone for 0 if it had been possible). <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this boat, there's a lot of Crap cinema out there, that overcomes this ridiculous rumble in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Oh, and finally, the movie has little or nothing to do with the popular game Far Cry (at best, it is extremely based on it). <br / > <br /> Horrible, move!
