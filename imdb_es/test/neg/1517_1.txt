Wow, this movie was terrible. It's as simple as that. Actually, it's the first time I left early, as far as I can remember. However, everything went well: I had a very nice conversation with two of the most charming girls, while we all hoped that the rest would finally surrender to that shit they called a "movie". <br /> <br /> Where to start. Bad acting, bad jokes. Fecal humor, which I simply can not stand. I'm sorry, but snot, pee and scat are not funny. Have you seen the photo of the title? That scene actually goes on for about 5 minutes, with the two "heroes" hitting and mutilating each other, which is supposed to be humorous on its own. It is not. <br /> <br /> Apart from bodily fluids, violence and transvestism, I do not remember much about this. At least not much good. I was really disappointed by this piece of garbage. Or let's be honest here: since I'm actually a big fan of "British" (ie, black) humor, I was angry. <br /> <br /> So, you want my advice? Three words: not look.
