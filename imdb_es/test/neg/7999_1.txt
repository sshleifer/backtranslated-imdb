Anyone, who claims that this movie is a classic ninja movie, must have seen this movie before the mid-nineties or had less than 10 years before watching it. Otherwise I can not explain the title of this 'classic ninja movie'. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes in this movie are simply intolerable. Instead of choosing Franco Nero as the ninja, they could hire an experienced martial artist. Either way, the ability to act is not important in that kind of movie. Nero's combat ability is just a street fighter in a bar. Their kicks and blows are lame. <br /> <br /> There are enough old action movies with good action. This is just a waste of time.
