You know, I was very surprised to see this movie. It was broadcast during the day once I was sick and, since I had nothing else to do, I continued to watch. This is by far the worst movie of all! But to my surprise I kept looking. I sat there saying that this is terrible, but I did not change the channel because it amused me how bad it was. Maybe it was the guy who looked like Big Tom's survivor or the terrible mustaches and mohawks that these characters had, which kept me watching. However, the girls were not that bad, but if that's what you want, there's much better. Oh, and there are "NINJAS" and "PAJAMA BOYS!" <br /> <br /> So if you like ninjas, bad performance, hilarious (and terrible) dialogue and two twins who are five feet tall and kill everything in their Mira, then this movie is for you. It's so bad that it's good. However, I only had to give it one out of ten. I could not have put a 10 in it with the Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> ENJOY !!!!!!!!! :)
