This show was shown in a space of time in the morning at SPACE, a science fiction cable station. I am surprised that someone pays for this or transmits it; He is incredibly amateur. <br /> <br /> The complete show is a sequence of short monologues or scenes made in a set that looks like a closet with a lot of circuit boards attached to the wall. There is very little continuity between the scenes, and there is no plot. A typical scene revolves around a lame joke or a special effect and lasts only a minute or more. The dialogue makes little sense and the special effects look like Photoshop filters. The actors are all adults, but I have literally seen high school plays with better compositions and games. This program is a shame. <br /> <br /> Maybe each scene works as an interstitial; A filling between shows instead of commercials. Joining all the scenes together makes the limitations of the material extremely obvious.
