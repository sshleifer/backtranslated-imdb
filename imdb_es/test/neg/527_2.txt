This movie moved too slowly for my taste. The concept of history is refreshingly different, as it explores the family dynamics of living with a family member with mental retardation, in a way that I have not seen on the screen before. the execution of the concept was defective. Each character was fully developed within the scene of his first appearance, then one had to endure the feeling that each character was stepping on water for the rest of the way. That is, each character moved awkwardly in their interpersonal relationships with others in the film, which seemed to me a form of emotional and social retardation. I suppose this has an artistic merit, given the irony that the story centers on an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by friends and family of intelligence above average. However, the performance was well done without exception. I agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful. In summary, I think that the film has a great artistic merit due to the fine Cting and cinematography, but it fails on an emotional level due to the deficiencies described.
