I'm not afraid of bad movies. I like bad movies. I enjoy making fun of them in the company of my friends. In fact, we're all pretty good at that. That said, let me tell you how much I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, it was incomprehensible. Rob Lowe attacks some people, they capture him, but he escapes in this great shooting. There is a singer that we believe died, but she does not, unless there are several of them who act and look the same. Ask Burt Reynolds to come and ask the singer. It seems he has just wandered into this movie off the set of Walker, Texas Ranger and is very confused. Then Rob Lowe dies, only he does not ... And the worst thing is that there is not enough dialogue or action that does not involve killing people or trying to make fun of this movie! And do not even make me start with the chihuahua at random. Then there was the fact that it was supposed to be the old power structure in Eastern Europe falling apart. We did not know where we were, all the accents apparently were "from Eastern Europe" and what were Burt Reynolds and Rob Lowe doing there in the first place? <br /> <br /> I desperately wanted to tell people in Blockbuster what I thought of this movie, and to get my money back, but since I got it as a special (only $ .99) I decided not to do it. What I want to know, however, is HOW THE DIRECTOR ROSE THE GREEN LIGHT to make this damn movie, and what were the "stars" thinking about when they signed up?
