This is the epitome of 80's cinema, unless you're a pre-pubescent girl. Riding a big name like Madonna, a story that physically attacks the intelligence and humor of one that is best suited for a daycare. If there was ever any doubt, I think that this large number of films clearly shows the absolute lack of talent for Madonna's performance and made me feel very embarrassed in her name. The only thing I can not believe is that they will once again let the director get closer to another movie. Madonna spends most of the film wandering around like a baby rag doll and talking like a baby. It is painfully obvious that the only reason why this movie was made was the fact that Madonna was a big name in pop music at that time. DO NOT FORGET TO ORDER TO SEE THIS MADE A CASH ATTEMPT IN THE STARTOM POP. Stay away at all costs!
