There are no words that can describe how horrible this movie is. It's as if the director literally took *** on a roll of film and sent it to the public. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is terrible, the plot is so silly and the death of Every character is ridiculously bad. Some stupid scenes include Akshay Kumar pulling a gun out of nowhere to kill a hologram (yes, a hologram), Akshay Kumar carrying a bazooka through the city, Rajat Bedi being hit by a poorly animated skeleton, Rajat Bedi and Siddharth penetrating into double to Monisha Korella (How did you think it was straight?). I would also like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible. The scene that supports this claim is when Kapal has the motorcycle and somehow wins the glasses. The shopping work seems to have been done in microsoft paint. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this movie are with Sunny Deol. This man is so strong that he even makes God feel scared. In one scene, he literally breaks the door of a prison by kicking it. Chuck Norris's round house does not have any of that. It's even so powerful that it can fly from London to India in just 10 minutes! In general, this movie is perhaps the most evil movie in the universe. If you were to see it, look at the hilarity that follows (BTW, this movie is supposed to be serious)
