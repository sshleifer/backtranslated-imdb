Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS? An issue featured Charles Bronson (Robbie Coltrane) when he was interviewed about his new film GLC: <br /> <br /> "It's about a man, a common man whose wife and family are destroyed and I have to hunt them down. in a sadistic and graphic way "<br /> <br />" And after GLC, what will be next for Bronson? "<br /> <br />" We are using a new angle. erased but I go after those who crawl just like this "<br /> <br /> This describes with precision THE EVIL THAT MALE DOES. It is a Bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation is not reduced to a bloodbath, but this makes the credibility become tense. <br /> <br /> Bronson is a retired assassin who will not give up his retirement for anything until Somebody shows him a video with interviews with the victims of "The Doctor", not the legendary time traveler, but an infamous torture expert. It's never really explained why The Doctor is so infamous, because any police state has a lot of these sadists, or why The Doctor and his sister have ridiculous English accents. <br /> <br /> As you can guess , is lazily written The movie and the incidents happen because the scriptwriter needs things to advance the plot, no matter how unlikely they are as one of the bad guys who are invited to a trio to be killed or revealed things like The Doctor's sister is a lesbian. It may include T & A <br /> <br /> In many ways, it's like one of those nasty Chuck Norris vehicles that were launched at the same time, but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who did ICE COLD IN ALEX and THE GUNS OF NAVERONE, two very well-considered war dramas that are often shown on Sunday afternoons. Believe me, this movie will not show until after the basin.
