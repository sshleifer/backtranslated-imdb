I've seen this in a Sneak Preview yesterday and I must say it was terrible. After the credits, I thought: "Hey, with this cast it will probably be pretty good". It did not turn out that way at all. <br /> <br /> He licks predictable moans, terribly simply drawn characters (maybe except a little from Mrs. Lara) and an ending that could foresee 10 minutes in the movie. And worst of all, he misused a sensitive issue (handicapped people) for low level jokes and mostly without flavor, without touching anything other than the surface of the problem. The person with disability with whom the film is most sympathetic is the one who is faking it. What kind of message is that? And the film does not have any thought at all, basically it boils down to: "I love you, it does not matter that you acted like an imbecile." <br /> <br /> To sum up: Great cast that must have been terribly bored to sign up for a terrible movie.
