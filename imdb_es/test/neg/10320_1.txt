I saw this remastered on DVD. I had a big picture of Sandra in it and it said "Starring Sandra ..." and it seemed that she had a big part in it. Not so She is hardly in that. She does what she can with the script, but that's not much. <br /> <br /> The sound was horrible. By that I mean that things did not go together. Shots would be fired and the number of shots did not correspond to the sound. People talk in a car while it is moving and the shot is from outside the windshield, but there is no engine noise, road noise or any other sound. Something strange. <br /> <br /> The score was horrible. It sounded like the same few notes over and over again. Dialogue really horrible. <br /> <br /> Acting was horrible, I could not believe any of that. The fight scenes were like a Batman comic without the "BIFF" and "BAM". They were really lame. The shooting scenes, I mean with guns, were laughable, literally. I moved quickly through much of this movie. Even then, it was too long.
