I'm sorry, but I can not agree that this was a good movie. Yes, it looked good visually, but it is the story that drives the film and I must say that the story was a great tragedy. How in the world they managed to slip some of those holes in the plot beyond the critics. Better story and I would have given a higher vote, but it was impossible to do it and still I could live with myself. I've always been a fan of scary movies, and the previews really cheated me. All the scary scenes were shown in the previews. And why did the family that was murdered stay to stalk the house? Why did the father return? Why did you decide to kill in the first place? Why were the children the only ones to see the ghosts first? To many questions, there are not enough answers. If I could have given him a zero, he would have done it.
