Dracula 3000 is the epitome of painfully cheesy cinema. From the first moment, I assumed that something quite unpleasant was waiting for me. With a cast line that included Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio and Tiny Lister, what could you expect? Well, let's just say that expectations were crushed ... <br /> <br /> If I really start, I feel that this review will last for years, so let's keep this simple. The vampire is not even called Dracula. The space team is carrying coffins from the Carpathian sector of the Transylvania system. In his great scene, Coolio talks about the most horrible things that have been talked about in the history of cinema. In the year 3000, all wear clothes poorly made by today's standards, they have nothing more advanced than a modern wheelchair, and they decorate with neon lights that look like they are stolen from a skating rink. <br /> <br /> At first all off ... the end. God sweet and merciful. It does not deserve to be ruined. You must believe that you must believe. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie with a "1" and I would like to give it a zero ... but I feel compelled to make you see it. What madness is this?
