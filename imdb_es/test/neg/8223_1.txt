Garden State was a mediocre movie at best. The film seems more like a compilation of thoughts that the writer (Zach Braff) had, instead of a coherent story. The disconnected plot may have been more attractive if it was not interspersed with meaningless scenes that were nothing but "extravagant." Coincidentally, these scenes are often those that are conveyed in the conversation (Zack goes through the taps that open when he passes, crazy party scene under the crank, screaming over a ravine, and the list goes on). <br /> <br /> The main character is flat, unhooked and, ultimately, unpleasant, which is exhibited most in the scene where he talks to his father, selfishly ignoring his father's problems, including a wife recently deceased, and continues talking about his own "What should I do? With my life?" problem. <br /> <br /> The movie ends when Andrew (Zach Braff) decides not to return to Los Angeles because he can not separate from the love of his life, Sam (Natalie Portman) whom he has known for 2 days. . What can only lead me to the conclusion that the message of the film is that love at first sight cures occupational dilemmas ... Of course I could interpret it as misappropriation of priorities, but if that is the case, it could have been done better Better. <br /> <br /> This movie does not know what it wants to be. A drama, a comedy, a movie for teenagers or a range of other things. I say this not as a person oriented to a single genre, but as a person who loves pieces of multiple genres such as those mastered by Stanley Kubrick. The reason why I feel that it does not work for Garden State is because instead of mixing the genres, it jumps; One scene is one genre, the next another, and again, and so on. <br /> <br /> I have listened to many people who tell me to dedicate a bit to Zach Braff, after all it was his first feature film and he debuted as director, writer and main actor. Although it was a first movie, I think with all the money you have, you could do better. There have been much better film directors for the first time (Michel Gondry "Human Nature", David Gordon Green "George Washington"). Maybe if he had just written or directed or acted, it would have been better. Zach Braff is a talented performer, maybe his second attempt is not so tedious and disjointed.
