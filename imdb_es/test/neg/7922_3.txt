How could they take a jewel as beautifully animated as Don Bluth's All Dogs go to heaven and ruin it with a sequel without charm, cheesy and uninspired? The disturbing music and the charming characters are gone, now replaced by a sticky animation and an unimaginative plot. <br /> <br /> The professionals: Charlie Sheen is sometimes as funny as Charlie, but he lacks the charming tough-guy attitude that led him to The Life of Burt Reynolds. I especially enjoyed the songs "I'll always be with you" and "It's too heavenly here." <br /> <br /> The cons: It seems that there is no connection between this and the original. At first, Charlie is a friend of Carface, but wait a minute. Is not this the same character who was responsible for Charlie's murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved? I guess all the changes in the sky, but why is not even Anne-Marie mentioned? If Itchy reaches the sky, would not Flo and Killer also? What's with Annabelle the voice of the whippet? In the original it sounded feminine and charming, and in the sequel sounds like a querulous parrot. The new characters are not so good (except Sasha). And the animation is better compared to a generic caricature on Saturday mornings. The constant "humor" of the cartoons is flat and without grace, and the "heart" does not work when compared to the original, which had a touch so subtle that it always makes me cry. <br /> <br /> All Dogs Going to Heaven is one of my favorite movies of all time. How Don Bluth allowed this sequel to be made is beyond me. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Not all sequels go to heaven.
