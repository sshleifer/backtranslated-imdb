What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece about problems in low-income schools. While the theme must be addressed, the film uses all the clich√©s of the genre and is presented as a movie of popcorn for textbooks. The characters are cuts from the downtown version of The Breakfast Club or even The Faculty. Observe this with your children when they turn 13 or 14. With them, it could be a way out for a lesson on current social problems. For any older person, it will be nothing more than something to see and spit at 4 in the morning, as I did recently at Bravo. In fact, what was doing this in Bravo?
