Essentially, an undisclosed B movie that is mysteriously directed by one of the greatest talents of the golden era, Fritz Lang. Even with the star names of Lang, Walter Pidgeon, Joan Bennett and George Sanders, get ready for a ridiculous plot, bad acting, scenes of falsehood and bad behavior. For the sake of transparency, I must admit that I am an ardent non-admirer of Walter Pidgeon, who was fortunate to have found a niche in MGM's artificial dream factory, and somehow worked in supporting roles, supporting Greer Garson and others. He is tremendously evil, acting in a chipper, the comedic tone of 30s-Ray Milland, in a role where his life is in danger, and he hides. The cockney accent of Joan Bennett is excessive, but her lacquered hair, her perfect make-up and classy attire belie a girl from Cockney's slums. George Sanders is unable to act badly, but disappears after the absurd opening finds Pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot Adolph Hitler. Surprising for Fritz Lang is the unevenness of tone. I found that the film wavered uncomfortably between the occasional moments of suspense-suspense surrounded by a cheerful comic interaction. Hitchcock totally reversed the ratio, using comic relief to occasionally control suspense. There is a reason why this movie is unknown. It did not help or boost anyone's career or reputation, and it is forgotten because it is a surprisingly bad movie from such a pedigree group.
