I must admit, although I am ashamed, that as an impressionable young teenager, this one that is below the pair of horror and horror, was one of my favorite movies of all time. Nine years after seeing the terrifying story of Stephen King for the first time, however, I have now come to the conclusion and can evaluate Fritz Kiersch's work more reasonably. Below, a young demonic preacher and his sadistic partner are truly disturbing on paper, but it makes for a medium and cheap horror show on celluloid. Much of this result can be attributed to the fact that Kiersch almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hacker show, and then turns the ending into a hocus-pocus special effects nightmare. <br /> <br /> The cast is reasonable, but they can only represent as much credibility as this quite incredible, what the upper movie will allow them, and Jonathan Elias' soundtrack is more creepy than the images. <br /> <br /> It's a real shame. The script of George Goldsmith turned the brief history of Stephen King into a shocking horror. Isaac, Malachai and all the other "Sons of Corn" are not really that terrifying. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 7, 1994 - Video
