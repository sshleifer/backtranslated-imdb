The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so bad that it forced me to register and make a comment. I must add here that I am a movie aficionado who rarely passes a severe trial. But sometimes a film is so badly performed, poorly conceived, poorly edited, with a history so poor that it demands criticism. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by all the claims of the magnificent, bright and dark. , and beautifully filmed this movie was. I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. The performance was extremely thin. The pace of the movie was agonizing. I gave him new opportunities every shift (especially since I did not want to feel like I was wasting a Saturday morning in New York), but with each new scene, he would crawl more time, delivering characters that did not interest me, with I could not connect, with whom I could not empathize. <br /> <br /> When I see negative comments in IMDb from small independent films like this, I sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal ax to grind (something like ... I used to go out with the manager, she She left, and now she's going to destroy everything she always works in. But here, no, I do not know anyone who has worked on this movie, and I wish it would have been great, but the film was not dark (as some have mentioned) or depressing (as others have claimed) ... That suggests that I connected with the movie ... No, Henry May Long was too long, empty and tedious. <br /> <br /> That's Tom√°s Toma on this one.
