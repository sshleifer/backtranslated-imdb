The film that appears here as made in 1980 is not the film that is available in Something Weird Video in his "Driver's Ed Scare Films Vol. 5". On the one hand, the 1980 version is in color. SWV has on this disc an earlier version (1972) of the film made in b & w for the 5 channel of WLWT television in Cincinnati. Either way this movie is notorious. However, unlike most other driver films, it was intended for the transmission and viewing of television by the general public. Thus, the level of the butcher shop has been reduced. It remains a rather grim exercise in the exploitation of bloody death for a supposed educational intent. I live in the Cincinnati area and I remember that this thing is shown every year around the time of the prom on Channel 5. If you are looking for a movie that demonstrates the tone of this exclusively American film phenomenon, "The Last Prom" It is quite typical: Morose, hyperbolic, extremely didactic, loaded with melodrama. Anyone who has really affected the driving of any teenager is a guess.
