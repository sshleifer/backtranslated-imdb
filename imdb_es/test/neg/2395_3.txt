The love and human remains directed by Denys Arcand is an abysmally pathetic film, since it is completely different from the type of films that he has made throughout his career. Making a different movie is not an objectionable issue, what is problematic is the fact that if a movie by a teacher is out of tune, then it is a really bad event. The movie starts with a good note, since there is some suspense created. However, as the film progresses, what is shown is only a futile attempt to create something meaningful, since Arcand shows us half a dozen strange characters, whimsical characters whose lives intertwine with each other. Homosexuality and lesbianism have no consequences here. What is even more annoying is the feeling of guilt related to the characters who are rather in a solution regarding their feelings towards themselves and sexuality. Such a film would be of interest to some who want to see a different movie from Denys Arcand. Everyone, surely there would not be many takers for this movie.
