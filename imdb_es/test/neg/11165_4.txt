I recently found this movie on one of my husband's VHS tapes (the blank variety he uses to record things on TV). It seems that the film was shown for the last time in the eighties and I do not remember having seen it since then. It has not been published (in my opinion) on DVD or VHS, although I will look for a copy. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one on the verge of puberty and the other much younger, and a boy who goes to live with his mother's brother and his young and mute Irish wife. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The children's uncle is a nasty control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver necklace while she watches a puppet show that he and his brothers put in their toy store. <br /> <br /> The oldest girl and one of the Irish (the youngest) develop a love for each other while living in the same house. The girl helps her aunt in the store, while her brother helps her uncle to do things in the workshop. <br /> <br /> There are many very disturbing elements in the movie. The uncle treats his wife as a sort of foolish possession (literally) (illustrated by the necklace), while the Irish dance, drink and love are forbidden. However, interestingly, I have seen much more explicit themes in other films made in Hollywood today. <br /> <br /> It makes you wonder if the British film industry and the BBC have some kind of hidden agenda. <br /> <br /> However, even though it is not a children's movie, there are many magical and playful moments in it and the Irish makes some beautiful paintings.
