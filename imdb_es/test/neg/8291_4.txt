"Graduation Day" was launched in May 1981, during the height of film madness. Earlier that year, fans had been subjected to films like "My Bloody Valentine," "Just Before Dawn," "Friday the 13th Part 2" and "The Burning," and the theaters still waited for movies like "Halloween II," "The Prowler", and "Happy birthday to me". I've seen all these movies, and of all the popular movies of 1981, the "Graduation Day" is by far the worst. <br /> <br /> What amounts to a "Graduation Day" is a low budget exercise. Make movies with bad acting, bad writing, meaningless characters, meaningless scenes, unnecessary nudity, cheesy dialogues and an editing experiment that did not work so well. And who could forget the classic 80s disco music played throughout the film (the music from the opening scene only rivals the music played during a chase scene). However, when renting a movie like this, a person should be aware that those details will be in this film. So, why "Graduation Day" is not considered a classic like "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", "A nightmare on Elm Street", "My Bloody Valentine", "The Burning" or "Prom Night"? Why fans are still looking for those movies, but do not pay attention to this without care? <br /> <br /> Where Slasher films need to succeed above all other areas, it's in the rhythm. There is nothing worse than a slasher in slow motion, and "Graduation Day" moves pretty slow. The most aggravating part is that there are many opportunities to accelerate things; There are numerous useless characters who are presented and who never have the opportunity to be suspects in the murders or to be a victim. There is a teacher of poor quality, a stressed director, a shrewd secretary, a security guard of a stupid school, a clueless detective, an alcoholic stepfather, a mindless grandmother, and a mother with a previous victim who still suffers. All of these characters may have a motive to kill or a reason to die, but they are all wasted. The worst part is that the story still focuses on them and, sometimes, designates complete scenes just to develop their character. But for what? <br /> <br /> What surprises me about "Graduation Day" and its small fan base is that people are not surprised anymore with scenes of death. The fans go crazy for the death scenes, like the raft massacre in "The Burning", the death of the washing machine in "My Bloody Valentine", the death of kabob in "Happy Birthday to Me", the death upside down in "Friday the 13th Part 3", and jacuzzi death in "Halloween II", and even the death of the hood of the car in "Crazy". But where is the respect for some truly unique (albeit cheesy) deaths on "Graduation Day"? A victim is impaled right through the jugular with a sword fencing, while another is thrown that sword like a javelin. The best death includes spikes under a landing platform. Why these deaths are not famous among the genres like the deaths in the most popular films of Slasher? <br /> <br /> "Graduation Day" strives to be a big and unique movie, but there is only one element of logic and lack of rhythm that really ruins the whole experience. It's not the worst of its kind (try reviewing "Do not Go in the Woods ... Alone") and there's a bit of suspense, plus it offers what fans are looking for (blood, blood, nudes, sex) . , and nostalgia), but the "Graduation Day" will not be remembered as one of the best slasher movies of all time. It is not a matter of budget: almost all the matrices have a low budget, however, it is a matter of ideas, creativity and craftsmanship. That's all any kind of movie making is ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for hardcore slasher fans. Fans of terror in general may get bored a little, and people who do not have much interest in horror should avoid it. It is not the worst slasher movie ever made, but it is far from being the best.
