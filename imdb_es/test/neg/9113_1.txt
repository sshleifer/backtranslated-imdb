I love most movies and I'm a big Sean Bean fan, so I thought I'd LIKE this movie at least. Also, I'm Canadian and this is a mostly Canadian film, so I was prepared to leave it seriously. Nothing could have prepared me for the trash that is "Airborne". Steve Guttenberg as an action hero? Give me a break. The performance throughout the film was so bad that tonight I will have trouble sleeping. Now I only have two wishes in my life. <br /> <br /> 1. I hope you never have to sit through this movie. 2. I wish I could recover those 6 hours. Oh, wait, the movie lasts less than 2 hours, it only seemed like 6 hours ... <br /> <br /> Do not look at this. Seriously.
