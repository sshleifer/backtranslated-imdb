Fear of the dark left me with the impression that several different scripts were written, too short for a feature film, which then clumsily joined the monster of Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> At its best, the protagonist, Lucas. It is chilling. As difficult as it is to draw an account in the secondary characters, they are much more understanding. <br /> <br /> Fearful of the darkness could have achieved mediocrity if he had taken only one approach and seen it - and if Lucas had made Lucas just psychotic and confused instead of macabre and nasty. I wanted to see him packed in an asylum so that the rest of the characters could have a normal life.
