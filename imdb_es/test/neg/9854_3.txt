I thought that this series was going to be another series of funny action, with some dynamic plots and great performances. I was wrong. While I like Jamie Denton, this show is not worth seeing, unless you enjoy watching some battered people and the actions of the agents are supposedly justified under the theme of "national security." The show is a great propaganda for the current government, and it throws jingoism as if we spoke that way every day. After a couple of episodes, I got bored and started watching House Invaders on BBCAmerica. Rather look at CSI and Without a trace, no doubt.
