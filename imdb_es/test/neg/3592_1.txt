Ok, I will make this brief and to the point review for those people whose mental capacity is perfect to see this movie. Everyone knows about the Motion Picture Association of America ratings: G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17. For the purposes of this film, I believe that the AMP should create a new qualification standard: IQ-20.
