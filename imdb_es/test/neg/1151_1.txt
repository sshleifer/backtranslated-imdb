Let me start with the obvious: anti-Semitism has been a serious problem throughout history, present in many societies and causing the death of millions of Jews. That said, the problem with this film is that it sees the United States, probably the most welcoming Jewish society outside of Israel, as a place not unlike Nazi Germany. Set in 1943, the film is about a man (William H. Macy) who gets confused with a Jew after he starts wearing glasses. After that, several very unpleasant things happen to him (he loses his job and can not find a new one, his neighbors rejected him, and everything ended in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller's pious and condescending novels, the kind that gave liberalism a bad name.
