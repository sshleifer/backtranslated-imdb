This is a classic B movie that I would rather not waste time and watch. It started well and I thought it would grow like a good thriller, but I was wrong. Throughout the film, you have the feeling that something interesting will happen soon and suddenly it will become a tense thriller, but that does not happen. It runs slowly and peacefully until the end, with nothing interesting. Only the ending was unexpected and original, but that's it. Vote: 2.5 out of 10. Oh, one more thing. Why is this movie R rated anyway?
