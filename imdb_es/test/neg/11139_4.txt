From the Andy Warhol portraits in the I Shot movies Andy Warhol and Basquiat, this is the kind of film that would predict that Andy Warhol could do: airy, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The plot of the film (almost non-existent) that is sometimes incredibly amazing is compensated by the film's real and rude cinematography. The film has a way of being unreal, but dictates reality to the viewer. The only worthwhile part of the film is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly, and everything in it must be seen as a characterization device. There are a couple of comic scenes that I admit are fun, but Trash is really a character study of unattractive people that is a bit nice if you do not mind seeing nudity and i.v. the consumption of drugs.
