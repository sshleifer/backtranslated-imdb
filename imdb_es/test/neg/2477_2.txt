This is a comedy / romance film directed by Andy Tennant, starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes and Kevin James. <br /> <br /> It is a professional dating doctor, Will Smith, known as 'Hitch', who helps men to land with the women who interest them. He is currently helping an awkward and clumsy Albert who is obsessed with a very powerful, famous and wealthy woman named Allegra. At the same time, Hitch has become interested in a gossip columnist, Sara, Eva Mendes, who has been assigned to write about Allegra. When Sara's best girlfriend has a loving disillusionment with a man Sara believes is a client of Hitch, he plans revenge against Hitch and the misunderstanding leads the two couples to a conflictive situation. This movie is not one that men should see. It has many attacks on men and it is subtle and flagrant that it hates men. There are also double standards that you should be blind to not detect. Hitch and Sara are very sheltered from the opposite sex, Hitch still likes women despite their burns in the past and is teaching men to make them happy. But, of course, Sara, is a sexist intolerant who makes frequent sexist comments like "men want to have sex with whatever they walk." She becomes obsessed and knows that she looks like a goddess and knows that there are no "real men" out there. What bothered me most of all was the "bad" one was looking for a clumsy with Sara's best friend, which is the classic example of a helpless "victim" and even after being physically rejected by Hitch, receives the blow of the pills of Sara. , after which she says "Now I'm satisfied". Add to this that the vibrations of "women are still oppressed" that you get from Allegra can not spend your own money after asking permission to a men's table. Despite all the assumptions and generalizations of garbage, can women always know when you are not being honest with them? - This movie has the correct point that in America, love simply does not exist. There are some funny parts in this movie, like Albert and his dancing habits, but this movie in general, only beats the terrible movie Honey by a marginal amount.
