This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen. There is so much in the house that goes wrong that it would not happen, it's not even funny. Granted, this is a movie that means things that will not happen in normal life happen here, however, this movie is far more far-fetched than the theories that no child left behind is working. All these people are in the house and nobody has noticed another, not to mention the damn owl that seems to be arriving everywhere except in his cage. I could deal with an owl joke the first few times, but after an hour I just can not stand it, I'd rather kill myself than see that damn owl again. Did I laugh during this movie? do not. Not even once? do not. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. The fact that this pile of garbage is topped with Ashton Kutcher bending his boss and taking off his pants in front of everyone makes this movie even worse. But wait, the day is saved because the damn owl can fly. AMAZING! However, I give a little credit to this movie, it's not as bad as Epic Movie ...
