This movie sucks. IMDb needs negative numbers in its classification system to properly evaluate this turkey. The performance is wooden or on top; the film apparently was NOT written by anyone in particular; and the scenes of monsters were, at best, mediocre. Even as a movie directed solely by the scenes of monsters, those shots were so disappointing that they could not inspire any compassion for the rest of the film. I want the 80 minutes of my life that stole this movie.
