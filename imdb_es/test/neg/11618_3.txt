Uh oh! I just said that this "classic" movie has an argument that LOOKS LIKE! Well, it's true, ... so get over it! This film was a vanity project for Joseph P. Kennedy in which his teacher starred and money flowed to make her an even bigger star. Today, there is only a fragmentary copy, one that was recovered a few years ago. However, even if the movie had been in perfect condition, STILL would have stunk for many reasons. And, without further ado, here are some of my reasons: <br /> <br /> First, Gloria Swanson, 31, plays a girl in a convent school, maybe 16 or 18 years old! Come on, it seems she's old enough to be the mother of many of the children. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film is based on the stupid concept of "love at first sight". While some people think so, it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw EVERYTHING at a woman he did not even know! How much hooey! <br /> <br /> Third, the movie is histrionic and the plot is crazy! After leaving school, Kelly goes to East Africa and then becomes the "Queen of whores". Later, after the evil queen in Europe dies (that's convenient), the prince can get out of jail, actually finds Kelly marries her and then becomes the queen of a true honest country! Give me a break: this is ridiculous, even in the days of the silent film this plot was a growl! <br /> <br /> So, in summary, this is a poor film with great production values ​​(lovers should look good) that is parading like a classic! There are so many BEST silent movies out there: watch them first and avoid this gut.
