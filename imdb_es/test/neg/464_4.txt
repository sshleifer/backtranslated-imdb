The movie is beautiful, and the cage is a baby. <br /> <br /> but will anyone agree with me in saying that the punk representation in this movie is ATROZANTE?!?! <br /> <br /> where is the shock? The "Ramones?? misfits? Social distortion? the cramps ?? Sex guns ?! NO ONE?!?!?!?! The music is this movie is incredibly disappointing! At least they play the cure. <br /> <br /> more, Randy's feathered hair and pleated persimmons ... <br /> <br /> This definitely looks like a movie about "punks" the way many squares of the film industry see the punks. <br /> <br /> Although it's a 90s movie, SLC punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 80s. I'm just saying '.
