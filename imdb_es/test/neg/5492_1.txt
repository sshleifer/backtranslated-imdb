I do not care about the strange artistic film. But when they are full of arcane symbolism and a muddled dialogue, and when it is obvious that they were made by the ego of the filmmaker instead of the benefit of the viewer, I get angry. I'm not a stupid person, but I just did not understand what this movie was trying to say. Or do The cinema is a magnificent form of human communication. Why do some filmmakers use it to obfuscate?
