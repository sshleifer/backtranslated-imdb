This terrible movie marked me permanently. <br /> <br /> The main action of the movie is nothing special. There seems to be a tribe of people who worship snakes in a remote mountainous region of northern China, where women, rather than men, are the leaders and decision-makers. I suppose that among some men, this is enough to make "Succubare" a horror movie ... Anyway, occasionally Chinese men roam the town, delight in local girls, seduce them and then abandon them. Unfortunately for the men, the women had subjected them to a spell, derived from the venom of the snakes, that would make them die horribly in 100 days, their bellies swollen like those of a pregnant woman with worms and living snakes, if they did not return. <br /> <br /> Forget about the cover of the American video. This has nothing to do with vampires, although there is an inept scene that drinks blood. The title itself is only marginally appropriate: "Succubare" is the Latin verb meaning "to be under," and is the root of the word Succubus, a female demon that would seduce men while they slept. Actually, it is MEN who seduce here. <br /> <br /> But it is not the main action of this ridiculous movie that is so objectionable. They are the small lateral incidents. I will overlook the slaughter and the butchery of an ox that is performed on screen. The participants seem to have a lot of experience, as if this is an unpleasant duty that they really do in real life; and I'm sure they really ate the animal afterwards ... although it bothers me that the act is thrown at me as "entertainment". <br /> <br /> What I WANT to ignore (or HAVE overlooked) are the Numerous totally strange shots of an unidentified man, who from time to time interrupts history by eating live animals. The movie begins by destroying a living snake with its teeth. In the course of the film, he devours an insect, a lizard, a toad (I had to leave the room after this) and a complete mouse (I stopped looking at this point and lost my appetite for days). Let me emphasize that this was totally unexpected and had nothing to do with the film ... unless it is a cynical reference to love as shown in the film: a blind, selfish and predatory survival mechanism that destroys the helpless .. But, again, I'm probably just rationalizing to get rid of the viciousness in my head ...
