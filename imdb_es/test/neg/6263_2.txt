Cheerleader Massacre was supposed to be the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series; if that is what they were doing (which is considering an actress of the original returns in a small role), have failed miserably and have done, by far, the worst delivery of the "quadrilog√≠a". Cheerleader Massacre combines perfectly the bad acting, a horrible plot, a stupid assassin, boring and boring deaths, boring landscapes and a horrible camera work to turn it into one of the worst movies that have been made. Did I mention how bad it was? Do not get me wrong: this cheesy and delayed excuse for a horror movie is not as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, but it's definitely a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Cheerleader Massacre is a polar opposite to the original Slumber Party Massacre. Stay away by all means! This movie is absolute trash!
