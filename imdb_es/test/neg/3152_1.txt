That someone has been able to conceive this nonsense and then have produced it is incredible. That actually aired on television and that the advertisers PAID TO ASSOCIATE WITH THEM is amazing. This excuse to tear the stomach for children's programming is almost too vile to comment. I burned, yes burned, any Barney tape that people have given to my son. Finding this horrible programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise. And where, tell me where, get those actors of such elegant children? Do not your parents make sense? Those kids will be on drugs before they're teenagers. Geez The final insult is that I have to add this additional line to the revision to get it in IMDb.
