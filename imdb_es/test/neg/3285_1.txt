This is easily the worst and most offensive television article. I'd love to ignore it completely, but Fox has put it into his Sunday lineup, forcing me to find something else to watch between American Dad and Family Guy. The hollow-headed star boy is the least evolved pathetic excuse for a human I've seen on television. Nothing in the program is remotely fun and almost everything that has been done is already much better than other programs. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that his strategy is to get fully into the program on Sunday and wait. Somebody starts liking ... but I have to tell you, Fox, that's the wrong hole. The scam did not work for me, I just look elsewhere, but come on, damn fools, this show sucks, and it's even worse compared to the rest of the Fox Sunday lineup. <br /> <br /> THEY CANCELED DEVELOPMENT FOR THIS STEAM PILE?
