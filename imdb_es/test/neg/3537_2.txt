I really loved the Millenium series, starring Lance Henriksen, so I bought the movie. Obviously at some level it was an error. The mutant / monsters movies are usually very bad and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> The basic idea itself is not totally judged as a failure (well, however, this movie would never have been a success, even with a good director & actors), but the way it turns out that this is just a class B movie. The scenes that are supposed to be terrifying seem more fun to me and the creature is not believable at all. <br /> <br /> However, watching this movie with a group of friends in a state of uneasiness makes this movie shine as such. unintentionally hilarious.
