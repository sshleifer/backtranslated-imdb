Debbie Boone was very successful with her recording of the pop song "You Light Up My Life"; Didi Conn's film of the same name, however, was a horribly embarrassing failure. Conn plays the stereotypical, clumsy and homely girl, who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotyped yuppie-aspiring guy. They are engaged, but everyone knows that Zaslow is not going to marry anyone who is not blond and is not made, so only Didi is surprised when he leaves. Needless to say, Didi is quite embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, he's been doing some songwriting in his spare time, and he's come up with a tune that he thinks is pretty clever. She calls him, can you guess? "Light up My Life". She gets in the car and goes to the big city to sell her song and make a new life. Now, I remember sitting in the theater and I saw her get into the car to go to the big city, and think, "Well, thank God, we finally have all the exposure out of the way, now something interesting may happen." "And something interesting happened, the credits rolled. <br /> <br /> Yes, that was it, the film was not only badly performed, badly written and badly filmed, but it also ended up in the middle. We're talking about a total failure, a real yawn from beginning to end, if you liked Debbie Boone's song by all means, buy a copy of it. lose your time or money in this movie, this is a movie you'll be glad you lost. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
