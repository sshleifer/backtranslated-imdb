A young refugee, educated at home and possibly very gifted, harbors a disturbed and overly emotional side that surfaces after her absent father visits his mother and asks for a divorce. Directed by the famous director of photography William A. Fraker, this badly titled psychological thriller falls into the trap in which most of the films starred by the directors of photography are found: each shot is composed for the maximum style, but at the sacrifice of the fluid rhythm and a narrow, passionate narrative. Fraker (and his director of photography, László Kovács) are very fond of white gauze and gold tones, which gives the image a polished look. The mansion in the center of the action looks like a funeral home, and Fraker walks the sibilant thread like a funeral. Robert Shaw and Sally Kellerman (as Shaw's fiancee), two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s, manage to go through the plastic overlay and are quite convincing despite the irregular editing (which turns their scenes into small pieces of business half done). Sondra Locke, another interesting personality of the screen, seems to be cast for her resemblance to Catherine Deneuve in "Repulsion". Pale and silver-eyed, with an incredibly thick and long hair, Locke is a curious human puzzle, and at first it is quite intimidating and dangerous; however, this role is so old that Locke can not find anything new to get out of the freeze, and she staggers. Fraker allows Locke's freak-out scenes to go on and on, while Shaw (looking terribly elegant) finds himself in the impossible position of playing with his sensitive daddy. It might be worthwhile to continue with all this nonsense if the script had been peppered with a minimum of tangibility (or, at least, some dry wit or humorous relief). As it is, the loose script by Lewis John Carlino and Edward Hume, adapted from Stanton Forbes' novel "Go To Thy Deathbed", makes the spectator stay behind and only the charisma of the players takes us to the finish line . * 1/2 of ****
