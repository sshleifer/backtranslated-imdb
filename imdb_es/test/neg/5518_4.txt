Combined from images of movies, music and recycled ideas, this film can not be called "good". But for me, when I saw him as a teenager, it was quite fun. (I did not know BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS before.) In hindsight, it has some nostalgia, with respect to the SF wave of the early eighties and the special effects of this era. Its antiquated appearance and its ingenuity provide some attraction. To enjoy this movie, I recommend concentrating on the paternal relationship between the characters of Vince Edwards and David Mendenhall. In addition, I liked the idea of ​​a group of scoundrels discovering their heroic qualities after being involuntarily confronted with the challenge of caring for a child.
