I saw this movie when I was in France and I must say that it confused me. It is the story of a jewel thief and a young singer who, at the same time, end up in Morocco, meet and form a connection. Simple enough? Well, the problem is that this is the kind of film that has ambiguity in both chronologies (the movie does not play completely in order) and in reality (did what I just saw happen or was it just a dream?). Given these parameters, in addition to the fact that the film was bilingual, it was very difficult to follow, and I was not sure what happened at the end. I imagine that some deep artistic types could understand this movie better than I could, and it may require more than one vision to understand.
