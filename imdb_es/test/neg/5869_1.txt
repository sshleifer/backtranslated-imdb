After reading other reviews on this site, we were not sure if we would be able to criticize this movie because it did not sound bad enough. However, at 2 minutes into the movie, we knew we were on another flop. No summer is complete without the ice cream, but this movie served a cone of melted ice cream, sour and broken bottom (you know, the guy that makes it sticky and dirty and looking for a wet nap). The biggest problem with this movie was the plot. What was it? He seemed to be a psychotic ice cream man driving through the neighborhood. That's. Nothing else happens. First of all, what are the requirements to become an ice cream man in this shitty town? 1. Spend several years in the most ridiculous mental hospital known to man. This hospital was riddled with clowns, graffiti, fake plastic sunflowers and large syringes on the head. 2. To have an extremely poor hygiene and a mutant face to scare the children. 3. Make sure your truck is equipped with cut body parts, cockroaches, and do not forget white eyes! <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie are pure B-Movie caliber. Mixed with a lot of unknowns, who besides ... is a version of Macaulay Culkin of the trailer? Even his spoiled charm could not save this kick in his pants. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason for any of the murders in this movie. The whole concept of the movie sucked! Who would kill a man with ice cream in a gunfight? Gangsters? Demons Vanna White? Who? We are still struggling with this question. <br /> <br /> Whoever was in charge of the costumes for this movie should be immediately included in the Hollywood blacklist. Did they honestly believe that a pillow under a child's shirt would make the audience believe that he was really fat? Did they forget the arms, face, legs and all other parts of the body? Secondly, this movie was made in 1995, but the wardrobe seemed to have been chosen from a movie of the 80s, as evidenced by the big brother's white pants that hug the crotch. <br /> <br /> While we were watching this production of shotty, we both developed severe cases of ADD. We find ourselves leaving the room to walk aimlessly. At many points, the film, we found that looking at a blank wall behind the TV set was more entertaining than the real movie. We were surprised that this movie did not reach Bottom 100. Then, we took the tape from the VCR and left it on the black top so that it melts like a cone of inferior ice cream.
