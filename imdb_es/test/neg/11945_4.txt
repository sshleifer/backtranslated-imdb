I've been a long time fan of the original of this movie (Bella Martha / Mostly Martha), and everything that makes the movie great and fun is missing in this one. I miss the slow rhythm, the accumulation of characters and their style in small gestures, the mastery of lights and moods and dialogue about movements. I do not believe that history itself is enough. Martha / Kate is more isolated, and Mario / Nick is not a clown. In most cases, the things that make a scene great in the original, are not working in your copy here. The small alterations remove the tension. My opinion is that you should go see the original. It's worth the inconvenience of the subtitles.
