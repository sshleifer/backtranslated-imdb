They used images of a real protest spliced ​​with a woman who spoke of a society without men to make it appear that these people were encouraging the "gendercide" of men. The funny thing is that you can see a man cheering his own death in the background. <br /> <br /> OK, the plot. One lady says there should be a society without men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) thinks it's a great idea. Then all the men are killed or something like that. So there is no more. <br /> <br /> Then this blond scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so he can not be violent. The male grows very fast and soon he is an adult man. Shortly after, he takes the Volkswagen beetle from the blonde and heads to the city where they discovered him. Now you would think that the lonely man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest man of all, but by no means. The police chase him. <br /> <br /> I did not see the rest, but I probably ended up having to run against the clock and some people, or something bad will probably happen. Somehow, the man ends up in a stadium with other men who want him to lead the rebellion. These brave warriors hiding in a stadium might have had some kind of plan that laid out the details of how they had gotten rid of a planet full of women, but I did not see it. And you should not either. <br /> <br /> If you get up late and navigate the canal and this happens, do not see it. Look at anything but this. You will find that Bowflex ads or women in swimsuits ask you to 'pick up the phone to meet women like these' in your area will be more satisfying entertainment. Yes, there is something funny when you are entering with your cars. I do not know what they did, it seems they drove very slowly and carefully, but then they tried to speed up the movie to compensate, but it seems really weird.) <br /> <br /> The blonde girl was kind of cute and I feel generous, so ... 2/10.
