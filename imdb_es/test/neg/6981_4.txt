This movie wasted 2 hours of my time and I just want to scream: "LAME". Nicholas Stoller writes the movie "Yes Man", but go to "this", maybe I should keep writing. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed because I heard all the great criticism. I expected something like deranged. They say this is from the manufacturer of "Knocked up"? Why can not I see the resemblance? but this seemed like a superficial movie, of an exaggerated theme, for me. I'm very disappointed. Actually, it's not bad if you consider it to be your average girl movie, but that "boy from the band" character just makes me nervous. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was not paying enough attention to the movie, but they do have some fun lines and scenes, but I did not feel the originality. And the ending makes the film a little better. At least the ending is not a boring clich√©.
