This is absolutely the worst comedy I've seen in my life. However, it's hard to explain why (unless you've seen this) I bet you've never seen a comedy that is neither good nor bad; it's just there (that's the original part, neither good nor bad, it's just there). <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that I have seen all the comedians appear in a leading role, and I like them all. That is what makes this a mystery. The support tracks are acting (although the dialogue is bad). The only character that is quite good is the one played by John Goodman. It does a good job with the little dialogue that it has, and actually has a funny line (I will not spoil the only funny line of the movie, in case you decide to see it anyway. It is a pancake). The great mysteries They are the main drivers. I will not call them characters, because characters have not been developed. This script is so juvenile that they do not even bother giving them fictitious names. All of them only use their own. They do not even seem to be trying to act. It is as if everyone were reading aloud to each other from the scripts that the local high school sent them. I actually wrote an article like this for my English class when I was thirteen, it was not funny either. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, just do not bother renting this. It's not funny. It does not even have the kind of bad dialogue you can complain about. I just sat there and watched the whole thing. It was so boring that I could not even feel irritation because of how bad it was. I can not imagine how this is even getting a rating of 4 here.
