Well, I have to start this review by saying that I really expected to see this movie for months, I use it to see its trailer and I think it looked really cool ... little did I know that the only good thing about this cliché-driven was precisely its trailer. <br /> <br /> At the cinema, I saw the first 3 frames of this film and, although for me, "in no way is this movie so bad, do not be an idiot, give it an opportunity! You've only seen 3 minutes "while rolling eyes embarrassed. All those frames were shown ... get this ... a guy with a poker face (because he does not feel anything ... that's deep) looking directly at the camera in the center of the frame. In the second or third, he stays awake in his perfectly made bed (because he sleeps like a dead man ... because he does not feel anything), and his father calls and says "John Garden State, it's me, your father". ....Oh, come on! I've seen a bit more than a couple of films to hate cliches like "it's me, you (insert the father)", how the hell am I supposed to react? "Oh, he has a very hard relationship with him." ... uh ... yeah, that's exactly how I'm supposed to react ... <br /> <br /> Man, this is a fucking movie ... <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, we learn things about their friends, of which all are ALTERNATIVOS EMO PASEADOS INDIE PÍLÍCULA CLICHÉ. For example, one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval-themed restaurant that speaks Klingon (weird characters + pop culture = your standard American indie movie). Then we meet the character of Natalie Portman, who is a copy of Alissa Jones (from a movie that hits the butt of GS, Chasing Amy), Amelie and that girl from Eternal Sunshine ... you know, smart, original (not really) , cultured Beautiful and ... in touch with your sexuality (!). She listens to a band from the 70s called The Shins and gives ... what? Are they from this damn decade? So, why do they sound like this? Oh, they have no personality, it's okay ... then she passes her CD player to John Garden State and he looks at her with a silly face (you know, love). As the song was heard, I heard your lyrics saying "you will love this soundtrack, it is very alternative and great, you will love this movie, it will define you and your generation even if it is an ideological photocopy of The Breakfast Club, Ghost World and all the other smart movies of the last 20 years, you will have a coffee and read books you do not understand "... <br /> <br /> At this point, there really will not be anything original that starts to happen. ... he does not care if he dies in a plane crash (because he's already dead ... and he does not feel anything) and tells us in a scene idea straight out of an unknown movie called FIGHT CLUB. !!, it's a great scene but, oh, did I mention that it appeared in the trailer? ....... Then, at a party, and just when you think this guy is very deep and asexual, he gets a bimbo ... so, oh, he's not such an emotional zombie after all ... Intelligent character development or just a shty tty movie? ... well, let's analyze that scene, it presents it sitting motionless in a cou with all the others moving at a really fast speed ... the idea of ​​the scene is taken directly from an unknown film called ¡REQUIEM DE A SUEÑO! ...... so just a shty tty movie, sh! tty ... <br /> <br /> Then they meet more eccentric characters (cliché, really), and finally, one who lives next to a big hole in the ground. John Garden State says some shit like "good luck exploring your infinite abyss" and the boy says ... and for this moment I really wanted to drown, "You too" ............. .and then We are kindly told that Neo is Jesus ... oh no, wait, that is from another fool, obvious, repetitive, overestimated and cliché, piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> Finally (Finally!!), something else happens and he enters the great confrontation of the warehouse to deactivate the bombs: he has to talk to his father whom he has not seen in the last a billion years because he (FINALY COOL SPOILERS) killed his own mother .. .. (you see, he killed his mother, then he is also dead ... and he does not feel anything ... that's deep). Now I really expected an intelligent and moving dialogue like Magnolia between a father and a son ... but this is Garden State, so this is it: -John Garden State: Father, I forgive you, you did not do it You did not know what You were doing it when you drugged me for a million years, but I know you love me. Dad's dad's dad: No! Do not!!!! I'm going to say some simple things because anyway I'm not such a profound character, like this whole movie in reality, NO !!!! -John Garden State: no dad, we must get along because we're the same people ... I mean different people -Papa from the director's father! Do not !!!! ............ OK, you convinced me. <br /> <br /> And he stays with the girl (because she is not dead anymore, you know) and the movie ends and I go and like a piece of chicken that makes my day ... <br /> <br /> This movie made for tow sucks
