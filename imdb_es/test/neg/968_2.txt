I do not understand jokes. I think this is my problem with modern cinema, or those movies that are made with millions of dollars in the hope that it will become the next sensation. It is not weird? people no longer laugh so much and I think one of the diseases of that problem is the movie "Showtime". There was absolutely nothing, from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all the jokes between Murphy and De Niro, with Russo as a candy for the eyes, with even standard clichés that make the general population faint with pre-programmed laughter . Nothing in this movie that made me laugh. There were not at all the excessive physical jokes or the mental and vocal jokes calculated throughout this debacle of a movie. From the beginning, I did not buy De Niro and Murphy's showdown as anything other than the Hollywood excitement. Throughout the commentary, the director speaks vividly about the problems and laughter that occur during filming. where was he in the movie This falls to either of the two problems? The director really has no sense of comedy or the editor did not understand the value of the film. Either way, they both condemned the whole hour and a half to the Hollywood nightmare "Showtime." <br /> <br /> Besides finding no reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters through the moment. movie. There was a hint of humor with De Niro's desire to acquire ceramics as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN on the machine for the audience to understand "WHO DOES IT?"), But that was eliminated and never developing. There was the idea that Murphy was an actor, but outside that opening monologue, nobody would have understood. Do you rent a room in a producer's house where you can pay the salary of a police officer? This simply did not calculate even by Hollywood standards. There was a bad guy who wanted a big gun, but the gun was never developed, nor was there a real test of the ability of the guns? even at the end. It became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than to remember weapons. Where was the television program in this? Russo had to get permission of this random type at first, but there were no consequences. There was nothing in the middle of this movie outside of the additional questions and the nonsense dribble. The random characters were introduced, forgotten, reintroduced and forgotten again. The director and the producer laughed at this, while we, the meager spectator, must suffer internal jokes and classic stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Was there a love interest in this movie? Was there a really sinister bad guy who turned away from the comic duo to bring the real evil to the screen? Were there pop culture references that did not return to Robert De Niro? Was there random chaos throughout this movie? If you need the answers to these, obviously, you will not find them in "Showtime". The fact that I am full of this review with question after question, only means that this sub-pair (actually, well below the sub-sub-sub pair) did not fill any quota or resemble anything of value to the cinematic world. Sure, he had big names and a really neat explosion, but there was nothing substantial about this at all. It was almost as if the director said before filming that he wanted clichés, but not regular cliches. Go with the bad guys. The plot had no linear structure. The jokes were boring. The characters were monotonous and underdeveloped. This is below even the best "friendly friends" movies. I like to give movies the benefit of the doubt, but nothing worked in this movie. Shatner could not even save this movie, and even tried hard. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not, nor will I, suggest this movie to anyone with a pulse. The commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws, horrible jokes and creators that question the validity of their work. If the creators can not be behind "Showtime", why should we? I did not want a "deadly weapon" when I saw this, but I did want something like that. I understand that there was some form of criticism of "reality television" and the corrupt nature of the media, but that message did not leave the page. In fact, I think I saw the "media" leave the theater for the first time when I saw this. Shame brings her heavy hand with this movie and I can not blame her. Murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see "Coming to America"), but lately it seems he has lost his advantage. De Niro, obviously, wants to get away from an image that torments him, but doing this kind of movies will only make him go back further. One of these films is equal to an image of Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Skip this one. I promise, it will make your last cinematic days worthwhile. Oh, what if you laughed at some of the jokes in this movie? I'm really sorry! <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of *****
