This is one of those "family" movies that I can not imagine attracting more than 9 people. A group of brothers discover a "sand fairy" (yes, really) conveniently located at the end of a not so ... Secret passage in the country house of his eccentric uncle, to which they have been evacuated from the bombing of London. ... And there you have it, all in one sentence. The story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of fulfilling wishes, but none of these topics are examined in ways that are interesting for adults or instructive for children (or vice versa!). The only reason I can think of to see this is to see how the outstanding talent of Freddie Highmore stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances.
