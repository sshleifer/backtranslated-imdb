After all the enthusiasm I had heard about Jane Austin's novel and the different film versions of the book, I was very disappointed with the movie. I had expected a classic drama but that was not the case. First of all, let me begin my criticism with the fact that I love old movies, particularly the mysteries and dramas, but not the films oriented to women. This probably makes a big difference, so take my review with a big grain of salt. I thought the acting was a bit exaggerated, but that's very common in the films of this era. June Allyson was as good as Jo, but I discovered that all the sisters were stereotyped and had shapes. There were no surprises or too dramatic moments. I hate to write negative reviews, but the movie left me very cold. It has always been my intention to read the book, but after that it seems unlikely. The only warming story was between the old knights and the younger sister, which was a very welcome bright spot in a disappointing visual experience. Once again, there are others who love this movie, I am not one of them.
