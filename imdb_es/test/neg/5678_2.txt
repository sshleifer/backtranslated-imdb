I was a big fan of "SNL" in the days of Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, Gilda Radner and many other memorable stars. But every time I have tried to see it in the past for more than ten years, I have been very disappointed and, at times, it has even displeased me. Ten years ago, I thought that the program could not survive, since it had been so completely devoid of the kind of humor I could understand, and still it was still working, which always seemed disheartening to me, wondering how in the world anyone could possibly Find your lame humor at all fun. Every time I've tuned in during the last decade, I've never been glad I did it. In fact, I've always been upset with myself for staying awake and wasting my time. For me, the lowest point came several years ago when a popular young male actor that I really liked was the guest host. At a time when that night he played with a big star, maybe himself, and in the sketch, the character "Mongo", I think, played by Chris Kattan, again I think, ended up in the back seat of a car with him . What followed was that Mongo was forced up and down and down into the actor's lap, with him shouting hysterically while he was presumably sodomized. The audience was laughing and I shook my head, surprised that they could find it remotely funny, surprised that NBC even broadcast such a thing. In the years since then, I have repeatedly tried to approach the show with an open mind, hoping that I can regain the sense of humor I had loved for so many years. But, until just a week ago, for me, it has not. Not even close. One exception: during the presidential campaign of 2008, I thought that Tina Fey was fantastic, and she was the only one that kept me in tune. But those parodies of Sarah Palin, although hysterical, were not enough to save the rest of the 90 minutes. and I would always regret not turning it off as soon as I heard the name "¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
