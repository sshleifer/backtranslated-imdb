Oh my God. I never would have thought it would be possible to see a thriller worse than Domestic Disturbance so soon, but here it is. Armed with a rotten plot, a terrible edition, a forced performance and a 'style' that causes a headache (sorry, I have no other words for it), Sanctimony is the kind of film that almost forces you to reevaluate a whole genre ; that is, this movie is so bad that even the thrillers that I condemned as full faults now seem a bit better. <br /> <br /> Now, not only is Sanctimony a terrible movie in itself, it also succeeds in the difficult task. to steal better movies and do a pathetic job with that. From the main titles, nothing more than a blatant attempt to reproduce those of Se7en, I had the impression that something did not smell good. As soon as the movie started with a series of comfortable hip cuts full of bloody images and great colors, I knew where that smell came from. <br /> <br /> It turns out that two policemen, or rather, policeman Jim Renart (Michael Par√©) and police Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin), are investigating a wave of murders in Vancouver. A serial killer, known as "Monkey Killer" (what is a threatening and chilling nickname, huh?) By his methods of work, he has killed many people. You see, this nut apparently works by following the proverb "do not look bad, do not hear evil, do not say bad" and cut the eyes, ears and tongues of its victims. So far, six eyes, six ears and three languages. In a very clever way, Renart and Smith discover that the Monkey Killer will probably kill three other people ... well, because he probably wants to complete the number 666. So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien), A young, successful, handsome businessman with a frightening temperament. And that's where the American Psycho scam begins. <br /> <br /> So we follow the lives of the two police officers and the young psychopath, none of whom is interesting in the least, until they finally meet. On the way to that, a disco where Renart barely missed Gerrick, involuntarily offers us one of the funniest scenes of recent memory: Renart goes to the back of the disco, because ... well, just because the script He says he is a suspicious place; Then, with a single blow to the stomach, Renard gets rid of a great guard blocking the road, and never hear the guard again? Does this scene seem to someone else completely unreal? <br /> <br /> Anyway, after another murder, Gerrick introduces himself as a witness, but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect that he could be the killer. In typical Basic Instinct style, Smith gets some dates with the young entrepreneur, under the assumption that he could discover his true identity. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the ending, but it is simply a shame. ; there are contradictions, some holes in the plot, problems that never resolve, and especially there is one last scene in which a brutal mass murder, which is supposed to be shocking and sad, is presented as something ridiculously exaggerated and meaningless that frankly I can not imagine how anyone could laugh at it. <br /> <br /> At 87 minutes, Sanctimony is really pushing it. You never care about a single character, because they are all so flat (not to mention boring) that you know exactly who is who when you first meet them. You never get into the story, because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when they are not totally unnecessary and are out of place. The performance ranges from the average (Van Dien) to the completely atrocious (Rubin and most of the cast); Music is an abysmal genius, and photography is one of the worst I've seen. Of course, as in any fiasco of the genre, we have a bit of gratuitous nudity. <br /> <br /> 3/10
