A woman as rich as she is insecure has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdown, undoubtedly helped by a soft-spoken gigolo husband who cheats her openly. Naturally, nobody believes her when she claims to have been approached by a giant man who came out of a giant satellite. To the delight of her husband, this could be the incident that finally drives her away forever. <br /> <br /> From the first scenes, with his ridiculous news broadcast and ridiculous satellite encounter, he's probably convinced that the only redeeming value of this movie is that it's so bad that it's fun. Although it is not too far from the brand, this is definitely not true. <br /> <br /> Unlike most films of this genre, this is not really a science fiction or horror movie, but a serious drama that cleverly incorporates a sci-fi scenario into the plot. It is not a good or mediocre drama, but it will exceed your expectations if you did not expect any legitimate drama. The performance is surprisingly good for a low budget effort and, most importantly, it is well edited and excellent. It is never boring and manages to generate more than a little interest in seeing what will come next. However, this is a film strictly for those who can not pass up the opportunity to see a 1950 film with a title like "The attack of the woman of 50 feet".
