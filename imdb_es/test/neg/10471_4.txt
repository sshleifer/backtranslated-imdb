.... Okay, little town, sheriff clueless? Check. The hot sheriff's daughter? Check? No, well done boyfriend of the hot sheriff's daughter, who does the sheriff hate? Check. Corporate land developer who avidly puts profits on people? Check. Developer developer range accidentally triggers a primordial monster, and then you are pressured to cover it? Check. Do natives warn of death and mass destruction if things do not go back to what they were? Check. CGI special effects for fans that could have been produced by a Commodore 64 computer? Check. Seriously, virtually all the clich√©s of your typical original science fiction movie have been grouped into a classic movie, so bad, it's good. The only thing that is missing is the scientist / expert who tries to impart his knowledge; There's a paleontologist with three students who ambush my Bone Eater pretty early in the movie, but they're basically extras in the movie. And I can honestly say that I virtually predicted all this; according to who survives and who does not (although I have to say that the real time of death of one of the characters was wrong about an hour). I swear I could have made this movie if they gave me all the characters. Despite all this, it's fun to watch the movie, if only to play MST3K with your friends. If you fancy some senseless fun, it's a great movie to watch, so I give this movie an amazing 4 respectable, although for all purposes and purposes it deserves a much lower rating. But once again, you would not be tuning in to an original SciFi movie if you were looking for a movie with a real plot, important characters or good special effects, right?
