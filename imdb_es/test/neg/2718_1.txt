As Joe Bob Briggs would say, this film is based a lot on the talent of the actresses instead of their talent. In the early 1990s, show-the-babes-in-bikinis-fest has very little to redeem, apart from showing beautiful women almost naked. Joe Est√©vez, Martin Sheen's little brother, proves once again that his film career will not be much the same as his brother's career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this unless you like to see beautiful women with little clothes. It is about the only thing that redeems it.
