This is one of those movies that I see every time it's turned on, not because I like it, but because it's so bad that I can not stop looking at it (like "Battlefield Earth" or "3000 Miles to Graceland"). The first time I saw him, I kept waiting and waiting and waiting to laugh, and I did not get my chance until about 3/4 of the way through the movie when they stripped the stalking cops to their underwear and handcuffed them in the park. unflattering way. position. Beyond that, jokes are not funny, the characters are not funny, their setbacks and mistakes are not funny ... Suck it up, it's not a very funny movie! Not even at a slapstick level! And what about the reggae soundtrack? It's a movie about two white men and the music is all reggae. It seems out of place, right? If you like a good trainwreck, this is for you. If you like a good comedy, look elsewhere.
