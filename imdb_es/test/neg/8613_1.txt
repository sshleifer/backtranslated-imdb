Well, I see tons of movies and this really sucks ... BIG TIME. I'm sure we're all sick and tired of the low-budget ploy to make Vampire Movies use the kind of "actor" movies of "Martial Arts Teacher." I am also so tired of the boy knowing some form of fighting technique and then making his way through a somewhat boring movie. I forced myself to see him and one of the main reasons was that the main actress is quite pretty (Ha-Ha). Well, I hope this has helped you a little and if you have time and want to give your brain a break, look !!! Well, I hope that someday this type of films will not be published, but then, where will all the Low Budget actors go? :-) <br /> <br /> The movie also contains many Bloops, but I'll leave that to you to find it because it adds a bit of fun while you look at it and also, if you are a little perfectionist, it will bother you ;-) Greetings!
