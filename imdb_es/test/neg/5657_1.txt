First of all, I would like to say that I am a teenager, so all this is marketed to me, and I can safely say that the very poor programming of iCarly, and the fact that it is accepted between both sexes, baffles me. It contains some of the worst comedy attempts I have witnessed with mediocre performance to boot. The supposed humor within the program is based on repeating the lines of someone with deficient sarcasm, deficient sarcasm, saying bad phrases and, well, you get an idea. Also, I must mention that I still see Spongebob, that I know I will get a negative reaction, but that it is a quality programming with some funny moments, less we forget something that is missing in iCarly; INGENUITY. The program is about a girl, Carly, who organizes a web program with her friends, which I can say is definitely a nicer version of the Internet. That's fine, but the show is just ... well, it's not fun at all, as stated above. If this is what has reached the children's programming, parents, show them something that is really fun; SpongeBob or Rocco's modern life would work. <br /> <br /> Also, compared to its sister program, Drake and Josh, it's terrible, which was implied. Seriously, please look at something worthwhile. Even for a children's show it is poor.
