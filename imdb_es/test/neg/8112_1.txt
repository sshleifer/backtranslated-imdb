The first word I can find to describe this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. First, the plot is a very thin plot (I will not comment more on this part) and a plot that many movies of this genre follow. This makes the movie so bad, because you know what's going to happen. Second, the film contains many questions that are never revealed. One of the questions (and this is not a spoiler) is: WHAT DOES CHILDREN IN THAT CORN !!!!!!!!!! Third, the characters are very bad, not only because the movie is bad, but also because of the pitiful actors. They are as bad as they can be. <br /> <br /> The last thing that makes this movie bad is that it's a horror movie. You're supposed to be afraid of the killings or sudden commotions, but you're not afraid, you're not horrified because you know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: the movie is as bad as the movie about the killer ants! I expected it to be a great movie, but since the story is bad, the actors are bad, the film raises many questions and, as it is not scary, the film is better than not seen.
