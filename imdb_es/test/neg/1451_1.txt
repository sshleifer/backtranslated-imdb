I saw this movie for the first time a few weeks ago, and it was possibly one of the most boring and funny movies I've had the misfortune to watch. In the first place, Matthew Modine is a terrible actor, and he ruined most of the film, besides that, the plot is too stupid. The only reason he was recorded in this movie was by Alec Baldwin, and his character was eliminated very quickly. Unless you're a Michelle Phiffer fan, you should probably avoid this movie like the plague. A lot of people can not praise this movie enough, but I just can not understand what it is that people find so cool about it. If black humor is supposed to be what makes this film so great, then I guess everything can be comedy these days.
