Well, they did it again with a new pumpkin head movie, the first pumpkin head movie was perfect for its time, a silly, bloody and clich√© monster movie. So here it is, someone loses their loved one, goes to the witch in the forest, makes her raise her pumpkin head and murders all those responsible. unfortunately, the filmmakers have considered that it is irrelevant to try to do anything other than this, for the fourth output of the film, considering it much more appropriate to add a bit of Juliet and Juliet's plot, which involves an idiotic family dispute (! about a car!!) and surprise, surprise some bloody murders of pumpkin heads, so far so formidable, but it does not stop there, the talent acting in this film is serious ... oh, half of them can not keep a southern accent without slipping in its native accents and often posher. Lance henrikssen is on board, so surely it will bring some seriousness to the proceedings of the cinema ... but no spear on the screen lets the words come out of the mouth without any emotion or direction apparently, and walks away again, I honestly think He just looked for the money, then went to his trailer to get drunk and remember the aliens. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete cack, there is no other feature that is not the final credits that indicate that everything is over. <br /> <br /> despite the faults of ph: bf ... if you want a truism that will make you laugh for the wrong reasons, look at it. <br /> <br /> if you want something with something More meat and originality avoid.
