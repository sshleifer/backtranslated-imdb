11:11 a.k.a. Hell's Gate (2004) is another bad horror movie that tries to be something it is not. A young woman has an imaginary playmate. One day, while in the field playing with his friends, a couple of fugitives visit their parents and take them away for no apparent reason. The girl flees and hides from bad men. Years later, the girl becomes a woman with problems. The losers in her school (who look like repressed homosexuals) flaunt their virility in front of her when she rejected one of them. Girls hate her and life in general is miserable for her. A secret from his past revisits her. Who or what is it? Why do they all hate it? What is your Guardian's problem with her? To discover it, you will have to see the Gate of Hell. <br /> <br /> The new title does not make any sense at all. I do not know why people are given money to make such bad movies. This movie is not even good enough to make fun of. It is a headache that causes a disaster that confuses anyone who tries to make sense of it. It's not worth your time. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
