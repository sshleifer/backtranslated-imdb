I was out of town, visiting an old friend. After dinner, speaking, he expressed some reservations about his daughter's boyfriend. She is 15 years old, she is beautiful, intelligent, athletic, and the young man is also of an excellent family, pleasant, also athletic (if not so intelligent). I told him I might be feeling normal parental concerns; however, a few minutes later the young man arrived, with his DVD of this film, which he had apparently been anxious to share with the others. <br /> <br /> These people have an authentic home theater setup, with a screen of just over 4 feet, and the two girls preceded to see it, while the young girl proceeded to extol her virtues almost frame by frame . <br /> <br /> I saw enough in a few moments (and with some fascination in his horror) to back up all the most critical comments I've seen when scanning some here. <br /> <br /> I told my friend that I would not go so far as to disqualify the young suitor solely because of his liking for this opus, but it certainly seems to justify his being attentive. <br /> <br /> Some films are so bad that they are good: the classic "Plan 9 from Outer Space"; and, in my opinion, the wonderfully frightening work of Bruce Jenner / Village People, "He can not stop the music." <br /> <br /> However, this is firmly held in the horrible category. <br /> <br /> "Bananas" second / third / fourth: even the best of these (eg, Tim Conway, Don Knotts, all with Seinfeld) have great difficulty carrying a more recent series (or, like here, the movie). And these were excellent support characters in their original situations. <br /> <br /> The character "Eddie", actually on level 5 or 6 of the banana level in Griswald's previous films, and never added much to these, in my opinion. Randy Quaid is a capable actor who has offered some good performances. Your contribution to the previous "Holiday" photos was average, at best. Both he and the other cast members, many of whom have done a good job in the past, did not achieve anything for their efforts here, except to get some years of house payments or some IRA contributions. <br /> <br /> This full presentation --- history, the performances (from lead to stand) could not be worse.
