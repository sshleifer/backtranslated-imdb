Summary: A lone swordsman, who lives in the desert and acts as an agent for other swordsmen, remembers how his life turned out to be the way it is. It began with the fact that the woman he loved decided to marry his brother, which made him leave his hometown. One of the swordsmen is Huang, who is in the middle of a complicated love story, where a woman wants to be killed for having escaped the promise to marry her younger sister. But the sister wants to hire a swordsman to protect Huang, and everything is tuned when the woman and her sister are really the same person. <br /> <br /> Comments: I have seen the Redux version released in 2008 from the original that was released in 1994. I can not say that there is no difference between the two versions, but the Redux is very stylized in the action mode of Wuxia in Chinese. That is unfortunate, since that style seems to me to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining film. An understandable story But true to its style, the landscape and the visual elements seem much more important and much more in the approach of writer and director Kar Wai Wong. Therefore, there are many colorful and very beautiful scenes, which have no relation to the story. <br /> <br /> The edition and the timeline of the story are also handled incorrectly. Much remains outside in the scenes, the timeline is broken and reorganized in a confusing way. The very slow and quiet scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights, only to be freed by something else and unrelated. The result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie. <br /> <br /> Thanks to these brutal but very few fights, the film is placed in the action genre. The poster and the photographs also imply this, but they could almost be considered false marketing. Only a few minutes of the 90 could be considered something like an action, the other could not be further from it. The whole movie is very slow, boring and therefore very boring. Not even the rare action-packed scenes help, as they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I could say that I am not a fan of this Chinese style, as they often seem distressed. Of these same problems, the most important thing is that the visual is more important than the story, but Ashes of Time Redux is perhaps the worst example I've seen. <br /> <br /> 3/10
