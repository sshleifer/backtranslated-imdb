I entered this movie with very few expectations. I went with my girlfriend and two friends, and none of them could explain the story of Grudge 1. Well, if the first could not leave an impression on them to explain the plot, then I doubted that this would be better. <br /> <br /> Let me summarize what the trailers let you know: The Asian lady is back and so is Sarah Michelle Gellar. Luckily for her, she is not around for long. That decision may have saved his career. <br /> <br /> The movie has three story lines, and none of them makes sense. And what is worse, none of them is developed. You almost start to understand, and then someone dies and the story stays behind. Okay, killing people could be scary, but it left me more confused about the plot development attempt than I was scared of. They jump from one side to the other between the three lines of the story, which are not related ... OR ARE THEY? * EFFECT OF SOUND * ~~~ The time of the three stories is displaced, and you can tell from the beginning that the movie will have a turn at the end. PREPAREDDD. Oh wait. Sorry, this is not a quality touch of Fight Club or Vertigo, you can see it from miles away. And I probably imagined a much better turn in your head ... they should have hired me. Instead of the girl making her "SURPRISING" appearance, maybe it could have been Michael Jackson instead? That part of Scary Movie 4 scared me so much. <br /> <br /> The sequences of murders were terribly. Unlike the horror movies of the past, where a killer appears out of nowhere, a closet or behind a door, for example, and everyone in the theater jumps (and then the fat man behind you spills popcorn for the neck). UPS. They focused on where a woman or a random Asian child would appear, and you knew exactly what was coming. Instead of making the music very loud, then quiet, then a pop to get you out of your mind, the music really gave you time for the scary scene. If I know it will come, it will not scare me. <br /> <br /> The movie started by explaining what "Grudge" is; When a person dies during an attack of anger, a curse is placed in the place where she was killed. So, why does the Asian lady who is being cursed by her mother have any meaning to the story? And why is rancor now moving countries? This movie was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> All he did was let me piss off my friends for making me go, we should have seen one of those animated Pixar movies. It would have been more scary.
