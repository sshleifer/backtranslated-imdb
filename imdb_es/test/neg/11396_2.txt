If you read Errol Flynn's autobiography, My Wicked, Wicked Ways, you will see that this movie is full of poetic licenses. Not that that makes much difference, because Errol Flynn was quite generous with the poetic license in the autobiography anyway. There is no need to worry about spoilers, since there is nothing to spoil. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it would be wiser to use the story of a fictional Hollywood actor; Then you could go out and find a better actor than Duncan Regehr to play it, and you would not have to worry about the audience saying things like, "But he did not have whiskers in Captain Blood." Another flaw in this movie is that it shows Flynn as a two-dimensional character. Flynn was an intelligent man, well educated, well read. This movie only focuses on its funster image. <br /> <br /> Regehr is a disaster. The rest of the cast struggles with their scripts. Hal Linden is fine as Warner, and Barbara Hershey is a credible Damita, although Lili Damita did not believe it. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do with this movie is to forget about it and let it slide smoothly. far from oblivion. So, for what I am writing this, I can not imagine it.
