OK, I've seen Hershall Gordon Lewis movies before, but this really takes away the cake, it's really bloody and disgusting, not to mention the way the strippers are made, I'm talking about bad acting that makes the 9 plan from the Outside space looks like Hamlet, the only salvation is the late great Henny Youngman as the owner of the strip club, yes, take my wife ..., please. The stripteasers are really sexy for 1972, I think they used this same argument again in the Roger Corman movie; stripped to kill in 1987. I enjoyed the first HGLewis movie, 100 maniacs, which was a mini masterpiece of all kinds, but bad acting, there are no prizes here, but keep in mind that this is a splashed movie that paved the way for Friday the 13th and vi. In a disturbing scene, a half naked nude woman has her ass whipped with a meat tenderizer. Morbid things! HG Lewis attacks again. 2 out of 10
