You can not really blame the filmmaker for glorifying Che because the industry has to do with money. Most of the stories you hear about this "freedom fighter" are an absolute gut made by the Cuban communist government after Che's death. Che was a stupid assassin from the first day. Here is a list of the great things that Che did for Cuba 1) He executed thousands of innocent Cuban men, women and children to satisfy their lust for power. <br /> <br /> 2) Destroyed Cuba's economy and good position with the rest of the world. The Cuban peso used to be equal to the US dollar. Now it's basically useless. <br /> <br /> 3) Continuously failed in everything that involved diplomacy, economics and the military. He never exceeded his first year at the School of Medicine, and was only in a real battle, in which he surrendered with a fully loaded weapon. <br /> <br /> 4) He took over the largest farm in Cuba to set up for himself. It had a yacht, a 60 "custom-made television, a swimming pool and an ocean view, so far, to avoid the materialistic lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Cuba is today an absolutely destitute country , and you have no one to thank for Che and the Castro brothers.If you go to Cuba today you will not be allowed to leave the tourist areas.If you managed to get out of what you are supposed to see, you would find marginal neighborhoods, beggars and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> If you think something I'm saying is false, then do something to study, compare Cuban exports from 1950/60 to today, talk to people who survived or had parents on the call Cuban "revolution" of the 1960s, they read all the reports of the murdered innocents, they read the reports of people who served under Che and Castro and they fled because of how evil and unpleasant a human being was. <br /> <br / > And, please, always remember to read or look at EVERYTHING. Take everything at face value and THINK ABOUT THAT.
