I saw this movie last night, although I thought I would rent a horror / fear movie from the box office hits and I took it out. The initial scenes were so long that conversations between the characters seemed to lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> The line of the story seemed very poor, she gave him HIV and then she goes to meet another person, but the man who infected infected her (I think she could have done it for a long time) . time for different people) Then, when he throws the body, it turns out that it was the man he was going to meet, he was in the forest and saw him throwing the body. Then he chased them (did he ever finish burying the body?) And they got into a car and somehow found them in a different direction from where they came and killed the guy. <br /> <br /> I think the severed head was the only good thing in the movie, as it was quite realistic. And then, when the woman ran, she fell in front of him to stab her with a shovel! And then it's over !! <br /> <br /> What a relief, it was the most useless movie I've seen in my life ... please stay away, it's badly made, I only counted on 5 different people, and the scene in which it kills is very unrealistic and just swear in it and that's it. That is from me ...
