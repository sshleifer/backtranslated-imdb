If this movie had been directed by a man, he would have been imprisoned. While Adrian Lyne was chained to a lawyer in the editing room to oversee the disembowelment of a classic literature work to appease the censors, and to avoid coming into conflict with the Child Pornography Protection Act of 1996, a woman discards to Ripe and everyone applauds. Did I miss a meeting? Besides the blatant pedophilia, this movie is absolutely absurd. Has this woman never stepped on an active military base? Have you ever met a soldier? Whose army is this? The uniforms must have come from Uniforms-R-Us. Just put on some patches, who cares? Just make sure each and every one of them has a Big Red One. There is a little internal joke here that undoubtedly went over the head of the author, but possibly has been slipped by whoever supplied the military vehicles. Certainly there were no military advisers. The Army of the United States does not operate marginal neighborhoods. Temporary base camps in war zones in the jungle are cleaner than this. The Army of the United States does not put 14-year-old girls to work in military bases, nor does it allow them to use firing ranges or training courses. There is a lot of drama to be exploited in the majority of adolescent girls' sexual age. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with that at all.
