I'm Mike Sedlak. I co-wrote the score for this movie. And proud of it. <br /> <br /> And I love all the comments. Some have not gone far enough. <br /> <br /> The film premiered in San Francisco in the summer of 1973. The theater was full of friends and family. We all applaud. <br /> <br /> Five days later, it was removed from all screens in the Bay Area. <br /> <br /> If someone is interested in hearing some of the details from scene to scene, which could make the movie even more enjoyable, please let me know. <br /> <br /> We could start with the shot where Gideon Blake launches the toilet plunger to distract one of the evil henchmen who protect the radio transmitter on the deck of Bud's house. <br /> <br /> Or how Gideon spread the bomb in the original version. <br /> <br /> It did not help. Still bombed. <br /> <br /> Turn it on.
