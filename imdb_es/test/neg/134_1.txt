The "Sirena del Mississippi" by Fran√ßois Traffaut had an unconvincing argument. The script required too much elasticity in suspension of disbelief. The plot was at a glacial pace. It began in an interesting environment, but soon it was diverted towards melodrama banks that lacked logic or intelligence. What were the critics thinking? This is overrated even to be described as a loser. Even Catherine Deneuvue, who loved "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" and "Belle Doe Jour", managed to be simply annoying. <br /> <br /> We rented this movie at the same time we rented another Traffaut movie. We saw it first, and found that it was so bad that we sent the other without being seen at the same time.
