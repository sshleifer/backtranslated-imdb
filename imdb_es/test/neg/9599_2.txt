Okay, let me start by saying that I love the original RS for 64. The graphics were new, the boats were really fast and great. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to devise. The computer did not tell you every step of your mission, you could wander and explore. <br /> <br /> That's the first thing that's wrong with RL, everything you do is under a schedule and controlled by other people. I mean, should not you, as a leader, tell people how to handle each mission? <br /> <br /> And speaking of missions, why do they intermingle the original trilogy with a completely invented shit? No matter. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for this game when I knew they were going to allow you to fly through the asteroid field from Empire Strikes Back. I think that anyone who is a movie fan wanted to do this. So, they give it to you. It's the stupidest level of the game. Start flying through the asteroid field with ties that chase you, and your whole goal is to reach further into the field while firing the ties. You have to kill them all to get ahead. Hey, remember how many Han killed when he was in the field? None, all had poor piloting skills compared to him. I just wanted to be able to dodge the asteroids when they attacked me, but instead I have to use my automatic weapons to kill ties behind me. <br /> <br /> That was the biggest disappointment, you have no control. On your flight, everything is slow. All except the Ala-A, probably the fastest and most maneuverable boat in the entire fleet. But, oh yes, did not Han say it was the Falcon? Anyway ... <br /> <br /> you finally reach the battle of Endor. Here is the last level, you can destroy the star of death, the first instinct of all is to choose the Falcon and be the leader. But, of course, you get there and you have to do stupid pre-chosen strategies like finding (not to mention deciphering the difference between) the tie bombers. This is impossible in the falcon, for when you have seen a group, the frigate is destroyed. The only way to pass this part is to choose the A-wing. After this you have to attack the Star Destroyers and that is a real stupid task. This game makes you feel like you are the only one who defends the rebel alliance. <br /> <br /> After you frustratingly get over that "funny" fight, you get to the death star. And here, you could think 'yay! I can destroy the star of death, and again, as in the field of Asteroids, you have to do something tedious as you pass through the tunnels of imminent death. Your mission is to protect the ship in front of you, remember that about the Return of the Jedi? It's so absurd, because if you choose the hawk, you'll die because you're not maneuverable enough, but if you choose the X-wing, you have to keep blocking and unlocking the steel blades. So it's an option to kill the bad guys or try to catch up with Lando, who apparently does not know how to maneuver. In this way, die in the process. <br /> <br /> The bonus stages are not worth it, as each level becomes increasingly frustrating. It makes me feel like I did when I saw the three new films, annoying and with the need to kill something. Luckily for me, Smash Bros Melee exists. <br /> <br /> I hope that with the Wii you will find something much better and that you have the levels of the original trilogy to the fullest. I'm going to sell this game the first chance I have.
