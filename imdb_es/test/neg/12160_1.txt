I've seen this movie today. Very disappointed and wondered how he could be on the Oscar list. The saddest things are: <br /> <br /> 1. It's very slow. <br /> <br /> 2. How can you interpret Ghengis-khan, cruel and powerful emperor of Asia, a good actor with good eyes, throughout the film, except in one scene? <br /> <br /> 3. Many holes in the plot: there is nothing about how he became the emperor; Nothing where he spent 20 years between his childhood and his mature age. We see an ex-slave without money, power, friends or home. Click! - The next second, he is leading the huge army, with no reason to be a leader. <br /> <br /> 4. The magic of the emergence of Ghengis-khan is explained kindly only with the help of a wolf / god / whoever it was. <br /> <br /> 5. Can a man make love to his wife in that way after not having seen her for years? <br /> <br /> 6. Is it enough to win the battle of swords if you simply pass your horse through the enemy lines, sitting there with two swords and everyone around you dies? Does Ridley Scott know it that way? <br /> <br /> 7. Why after 20-30 years does Khan's mother seem no older? <br /> <br /> 8. What is the motivation for the main character? (None. Literally.) <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. Really. The work of the directors of photography is good; Nature is exceptional, but the film can not be done without a director and script. The real Ghengis-khan would execute the director in a second. <br /> <br /> Best regards.
