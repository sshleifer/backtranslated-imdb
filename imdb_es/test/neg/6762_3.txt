I once heard that this movie is described as if you love it or hate it. After reading some of the other reviews and ratings, I would venture to say that this is true. I'm standing in the crowd to hate him. I've seen some really bad movies, boring movies and even low budget movies. This movie is bad on all three fronts. <br /> <br /> The exeter of this island of the Earth (Jeff Morrow), returns to his roots of science fiction movie / b as Dr. Les (less giant head prosthesis). The doctor and his assistant Arnie (George O'Hanlon, also known as the voice of George Jetson), along with Les' assistant girlfriend, Vera, are tracking a meteorite. This is the crux of the cast and it's almost a double date. He has Vera and Arnie has his "Susie" (Synchro Unifying Sinometric Integrating Equitensor - also known as the computer). Let's say that the relationship between George and her robotic maid, Rosie (and her relationship with "Susie") is more credible than the cold and clam-like feelings that Vera has for Les (and vice versa). However, the object of all its interest is not an ordinary meteorite. It is really an art nouveau / art deco alien energy storage device, which moves like a 3-legged dog. There is also the little alien "energy" being that controls Dr. Hubbel (also known as the chief scientist there). The alien is obviously and from the beginning, malicious and evil. Is this the kind of science we are delivering? No wonder that the Explorers' aliens scared us. To see some of these movies, we shoot first. No need for questions later. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is synonymous with observing some really boring science experiments, like boiling an egg or adding vegetable coloring to celery. It is not the fact that this is a low-budget science fiction movie or that it is a bit corny and outdated. It is really very boring. The whole movie is about finding out what's going on. That's. Most of the things we learn about what is happening are through monologues and self-determination. Now add crappy dialogues, cheap cardboard and sets, and it will have the characteristics of an Ed Wood clone (by the way, Ed has also made some really boring movies, please avoid the Orgy of the Dead). The dialogue ... oh, the dialogue. For example: <br /> <br /> "... from under 2 miles of the ocean? <br /> <br /> Why not? It went through a billion miles in space." <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> "Do you think you will be able to respect a husband who has probably achieved the scientific erection of all time?" <br /> <br /> This movie is obviously trying to achieve a Forbidden Planet, this Earth Island, the Magnetic Monster or in the same light as the Outer Limits, the Twilight Zone. That is, a low-budget science fiction film (or television episode) that is convincing enough to overcome technical difficulties and strange situations. Basically, these movies are nice at some level (the story, the underlying meaning or the comic nature of the dialogue or situations). This movie does not have any of that. It's only 90 minutes of boredom. I could not even enjoy this on an Ed Wood level. I definitely recommend skipping this one and watch one of the movies I mentioned earlier. It's so bad, if my name were Dr. Forrester, I would never think of showing this movie to anyone ... except Frank, maybe.
