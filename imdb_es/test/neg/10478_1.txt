First I must confess that A separate peace is my favorite book. So, of course, I have some prejudice against any attempt to adapt it to a movie or a television movie. But when I started watching this movie, I was more than willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. The original version of the early 1970s, although it was filmed at Phillips Exeter Academy where the author of the book attended school, and although he remained as faithful as he could to the book, lacked a sense of real depth and failed to achieve capture the essence of the characters. The original seemed to simply go through the motions. When reading the triviality of the film, you discover that it was broadcasted mainly with actors who are not actors. Therefore, the original has an amateur feeling and, finally, fails. <br /> <br /> This new version, although I grant that it captures the appearance of the period better than the original one, seems to have launched the book. go all together. The scenes are reorganized, the characters are imposed where they do not belong, the characters created that were not in the book and no attempt was made to delve into the deeper conflicts that make the book so compelling. And the cardinal sin of all: the tree is not treated as the vital, almost central, character found in the book. This is an inexcusable carelessness on the part of the filmmakers. How could you minimize the role of the tree? Why was not it introduced immediately? Why does the dead poet start? And what, in the name of God, was Gene's accent? This film is, to be blunt, garbage. A separate peace should not be a difficult book to adapt to the stage or the screen. John Knowles wrote it in a perfectly fine and linear style. The filmmakers should have relied on the story as it was written; make changes, of course; beautify here and there, of course; Take some soft, clear dramatic license. But destroy one of the pearls of American literature in the process? What were you thinking? In their corruption of the story line, they cut off any possibility of suspense or drama. The whole film fails and fails miserably. <br /> <br /> If you're a high school student or university assigned to read this book and you're thinking about skimping and just watching the movie ... do not even think about it. This movie will not be of any help to you. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we'll have to wait even longer before a version of this story appears on the screen that really does it justice.
