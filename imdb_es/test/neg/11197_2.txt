Well then! This movie had great potential, but it is as if they had run out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole damn rest of the movie about 2/3 of the end. The characters begin to pour the full reasons for this film to other characters who did not request information in extremely weak locations. They also fall into some stereotyped behavior because it must be what is expected in this film genre. It is really very sad because this movie could have been much more. <br /> <br /> I really hoped this was a good movie. There was a good performance. Mark Hamill does an excellent job until the movie falls apart, as does Sally Struthers. It was fun to watch them work and succeed in their craft. Majandra Delfino was pretty good for a while until her lines became untenable. I felt sad for her because I had to say these lines that only gave credibility to the whole movie for any viewer who thought of a movie. Brad Hunt does an excellent job. He really has an amazing variety of talents judging from another of his films I saw recently, Lucky 13. (which was a piece of junk). This guy could be a star if he could choose the correct scripts and get lucky with the right director. <br /> <br /> I almost forgot it! The music was so hard that you could think that this project was given to a minor film school to qualify. I call this type of music "Teller Music" because you can simply say what comes next according to the music. Less is more sometimes. <br /> <br /> Cut out half the music in this movie, get a good movie editor, a little rewrite or two, and this would be a very good movie.
