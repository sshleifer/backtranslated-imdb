If I were British, I would be embarrassed by this portrait of incompetence. Can a Special Branch protection agent not defend himself against a sick, unarmed and untrained assailant? Does the Ministry of the Interior send a single "Scientific Advisor" to investigate a possible biological risk of Level Four, and that "Advisor" does not have the wisdom to wear a mask and gloves? London police officers totally unprotected working side by side with technicians in full biohazard suits? Does the "Counselor" and his bodyguard carry the lair of a sociopathic doctor experimenting with human subjects without any support? Puh-leeze! One wonders if the producers could not afford to hire technical advisors or if, for some mysterious reason, they consciously decided to present the directors as irremediably incompetent. Even my wife, who has no experience in medicine or law enforcement, was rolling her eyes in disbelief. After the first episode, I became discouraged; Now that I've seen two episodes, I give up.
