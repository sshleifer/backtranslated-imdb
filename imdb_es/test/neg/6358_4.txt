* Spoilers - I'm sorry! * The first word that came to mind when watching the movie is 'Gremlins'. It's the only movie of creatures I've seen in all four movies, but I enjoyed it. It was not as complicated as I had not seen the last two, but I thought it was a good movie anyway. <br /> <br /> Critters starts with a man, his son and his daughter stop on their way to the holidays (although it turns out that they end up in their own house, which I have no idea what the hell happened)) The girl is with a child (played by Leo DiCaprio) and they will hang out in a nearby forest. They meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and those things because of the creatures. It seems a bit psychotic and if I were in that situation, I would not talk to him. The bugs steal the car from the girl and the child and end up in their flat place. They hide in the basement and end up killing this lazy idiot. Then they almost kill this fat woman and the girl's father. They chase each other higher up the floor until they hide in the attic. The creatures eat things in the kitchen (parody of the kitchen scene of the gremlins ?!) And I can not remember (it's not a good thing) but I'm sure they have to come back for something / someone. Anyway, they end up coming out and saving themselves. The psychotic man returns and before killing the last two creatures he is told that he can not because they are in danger and that is why he sends them home. <br /> <br /> The ending was disappointing and it bothered me that only the lazy guy died as there were quite annoying characters that I personally would have killed. It is an exciting and exciting film that is worth seeing. But, if you're looking for a better version of this genre, I recommend gremlin movies. Sorry!
