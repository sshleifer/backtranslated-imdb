Making a film based on a true story, particularly one as incredible and frightening as the 1972 Andean plane crash, is difficult even for the best filmmakers. But the Mexicans behind this film of cheap and forgettable exploitation do not even try! The real names of the survivors and the casualties of the air crash of the Uruguayan air force have ALL been altered, the accident itself is organized in a very dazzling way, and the aspect of cannibalism has been unnecessarily played. Surprisingly, he made a ton of money on both sides of the border. Fortunately, the thought, fortunately has been forgotten. But the same people behind this later would give us the equally disgusting GUYANA: CULT OF THE DAMN! <br /> <br /> This cheap horror exploitation film required the creation of ALIVE some fifteen years later. That movie was a masterpiece. SURVIVING!, To put it mildly, it is not.
