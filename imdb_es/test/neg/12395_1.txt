College students (who are actually over 20) on the Boston campus (which looks oddly like the Isle of Man) are threatened by a fierce monster (reunited during an episode of Blue Peter). The new teacher must save the day (even though it's really ... Oh, who cares?) <br /> <br /> I'll start with the positives ... there's a good picture of the new galley of the Eastenders, Samantha Janus can in the obligatory scene of the campus shower with her best friend Katy Lawrence. A little curiosity: Katy was hired when she came to auditions with her sister, as well as moral support for her sister, but ended up getting a part. Oh, joy Selected from the darkness for ... flashes his pert buttocks in a scene with no added sense for excitement, and then dies 30 minutes for his problems. Her most recent (and only other accredited paper) is as Test Nurse # 5 in Atonement. I wonder if she took a look at Keira Knightly (if allowed to mix extras and stars) and wondered: where did everything go wrong ?! <br /> <br /> I'll give you some tips Katy: yes everyone The other members of the British cast are being asked to speak with an American accent in an attempt condemned to mass marketing, and the only person who can handle it is the veteran of the movie B, the native of EE. UU Todd Jensen. If you look at your salary receipt and only cover your lunch and your bus ride home, you will not be starring in a movie with a budget of a trillion dollars. If many of the family members of the fourth assistant director attend the opening and cause loud laughter when the stickyback monster slaps through the sewers, you should realize that this is not exactly Alien. Or even a Critters IV, now that I think about it. So, Katy, in your next life (I'm a Buddhist, you'll see) you may be a little more selective in your choice of the debut feature instead of impulsively jumping into the first pile of trash that is heading towards you. The flashing skin in your first film does not guarantee lasting success. Unless you're Sylvester Stallone. And I had the script for Rocky to back him up. <br /> <br /> For all intents and purposes, this is like a 0/10 movie like the one I've seen. However, by pure unintentional laughter and pure camp value, you get a 1. Well done;)
