There is no doubt that this movie is a stupid joke without grace, but to tell the truth, it is quite entertaining (if it is the first time you see it and you try not to analyze anything). In general, the film has good ideas but is poorly written. <br /> <br /> The story of the two losers, waking up to discover that they can not remember what happened to them the day before. Only to discover later that they are being chased by angry twin friends, aliens, transsexual strippers, alien nerds and some gang members. <br /> <br /> Is not it like Bourne's identity? Yes, yes, I know, how can I compare the two movies, but what the hell? Both have no memories; the people persecuted them and so on. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is stupid and it's only for the viewer who likes the stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Reason To Watch: · A lot of talented young actors, · Very stupid (after all, you know it's a stupid movie, why not do it extreme) <br /> <br /> Reason Not To: · If you like to analyze, then forget it, · Talented young actors become bad, · Good ones become really bad <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 (Rating: E ​​+) < br /> <br /> ------------ ------------ ---------- --------- - ------ --- --------- ---- <br /> <br /> 'Dude Where's My Car', wait, what did you expect from the Ashton Kutcher movie? I think almost everyone got the same answer for this guy: "A really stupid movie." Apart from 'That 70s' Shows', this guy really has nothing to offer his fan. (I should thank the series for its reputation). "Dude Where's My Car" is one of its distinctive features: "stupidity." Somehow, his movie is even worse than Adam Sandler's, (can you imagine that?). The movie is really meaningless, without plot, and without anything. Mara Sokoloff, Jennifer Garner, Alison Sweeney and S.W.Scoot should not have wasted their talent on this crap. It even occurred to them "seriously, friend where is my car". This shows how film companies are dying to earn money instead of quality. <br /> <br /> Max: 4/10 <br /> <br /> Recommendation: Loan it from your friends or just forget it
