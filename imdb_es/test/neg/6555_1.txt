I was telling a friend of mine about the time my grandfather really chose this horrible crap to see us one night in the theater. He never chose another one again! It was so bad! Anyway, my friend told me that her father did some of the writing for this garbage. I thought he was joking. It turns out that she was serious. He had never seen it before, and said that it quickly stopped his father's writing career. I told him not to waste time. But, if he really collapsed and saw it, he would see in the first minute why this ended his father's days as a writer. I mean, even for the 1980s, this shit is bad beyond description. I mean, Joe Frazier as Terrible Tucker? And why would the two policemen care a bit about a house full of ghosts? And the poster of the movie? A ghost with his tongue out? What is it about? None of this makes sense. Well, I told my friend that this shit not only ended her father's writing career, but ended with the careers of everyone involved. Or, at least, none of them recovered completely from being in this trash of a movie. Let's just say that I will always ridicule my friend for revealing to me that her father was a writer of this movie! That should only say how bad this is!
