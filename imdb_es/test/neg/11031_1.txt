This film is an example of reduced budget, star cast ineffective, weak plot and poor entertainment. These types of films are made for commercial breaks and not to entertain fans of Bollywood movies. I went to this movie because I thought that the previous gangster was tolerable, so this is also true. The only thing that I appreciate is the way in which the new actress is put in the film in a very bold way, it looks a lot like the Bollywood actress nandita das. She is good, sexy and acting well. She definitely rises in her career. Our mithunda was always good at her job. Therefore, it has something good in the movie. I did not like. Imraan for his role. I should recommend him to improve himself since he has made many films as a new actor and has been considered as an established actor. This movie has nothing but the bold scene of the new actress. Never try this movie.
