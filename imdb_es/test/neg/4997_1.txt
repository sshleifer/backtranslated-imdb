Hi, I'm a fan of movies so bad that good but there's nothing so bad so good in Rise Of The Undead. It's so bad and that's it. There is no redeeming cheese, there is no involuntary humor, nothing! - Zombie apocalyptic boring (The "Undead": some people without just makeup) nonsensical with boring special effects (if you can call those effects), silly argument and annoying actors. They also have the nerve to steal and quote other (best) movies (Resident Evil, Dawn Of The Dead and Night Of The Comet) and made me sleep on my side. However, it was Rise Of My Eyelids once the final credits were rolled. My advice: save money. It is not even worth renting, unless you want to say goodbye and / or put some people to sleep, then go ahead and give it a ride. You have been warned;)
