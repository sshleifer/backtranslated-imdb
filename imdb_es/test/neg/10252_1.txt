Is it possible for a movie to get worse than this? There are a lot of monkeys wandering around, muttering b ******, acting supposedly stupid and we're supposed to laugh? There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place. Even when women finally appear, there are no signs of improvement; The most anticipated things happen and by the time the movie is over, you may be sound asleep. Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period! I can not believe there is even a sequel to this! <br /> <br /> 1
