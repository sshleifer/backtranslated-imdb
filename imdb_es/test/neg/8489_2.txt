I liked a kind of movie, not good, but not the worst done. Although, everyone else says it's one of the worst movies ever created, I thought it was fine. There are many immature jokes. Sometimes it wants to be fun, but it fails. <br /> <br /> The story is fine. Although it can be a bit difficult to follow for younger audiences. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty bad. Jamie Kennedy is a horrible actor in most cases. In some moments, it is even ridiculous. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor here. It's funny when it's supposed to be, but some of its lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the worst thing about this movie that I hated was the voice of Tim Avery when he is possessed by the mask. The voice is HORRIBLE. In addition, the scenes in which it is found are so little fun, that they are almost unbearable. I'm sure they could have eliminated it, and that would not affect the film at all. <br /> <br /> In general, you can live without seeing this. However, it is a good movie to see if you have nothing else to see. They could definitely have gone without doing the sequel, but it's a decent effort. 4/10
