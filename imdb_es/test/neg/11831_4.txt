This is a semi-fictional memory of an "international man" who has witnessed various political upheavals in the last 30 years. <br /> <br /> I expected this movie to offer a unique vision of politics and war. I also hoped it would be touching and moving. However, I was disappointed in this movie. "Chico" seemed fragmentary, with the main character, Ricardo, who stayed in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. Unsurprisingly, you could not elaborate a detailed story in that time frame. The excuses that he moved to another place were often explained superficially. The result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips filmed in several countries.
