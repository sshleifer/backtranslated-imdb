It really is not worth a review, but I guess it's my duty to warn everyone, especially because there are some very good reviews of this Canadian bomb floating around ... Bad acting and a slow movement, absolutely excruciatingly boring. The story in which 3 children live turns around when a man who runs away appears in his clubhouse in the forest. In the first place, the boys are content with the intruder and, at a given moment, they even see him as a kind of model to follow ... However, all this changes ... and you still will not care. He will recognize Chris Penn, whose biggest cinematic impact is Corky Romano, and young Devon Sawa, whose career peaked at 'Casper'. I expected a '12 and Holding ',' The War ', or' Lie 'and everything I got was a waste of time. This film strives to maintain the attention of its audience and never makes an impact or keeps a note of anything remotely interesting.
