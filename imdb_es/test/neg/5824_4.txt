I think Purvis starts doing a gay "Gone with the Wind". If so, I'm sorry, Tag, it did not happen. It also did not happen like a gay sexploitation movie. I guess I'm confused; What are we trying to do here? As much as I would like, I just can not get where these characters matter to me. This film is effective to capture the flavor of the decadence that lives in the South; It does nothing to explain, illuminate or improve my understanding of a gay relationship, or the conflict that the protagonist seems to be dealing with.
