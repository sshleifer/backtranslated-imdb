After a long, hard night at the Walkabout in Islington, I needed a pick-me-up. My throat hurt, my wallet was empty and I ended up chatting with a drug addict at a bus stop trying to sell me some gas. Today, I saw "Red Sonja" and I can honestly say that I felt much better last night than now. Brigitte Nielsen leads a group of warriors who kick ass in various shapes and sizes to retrieve a green rock from an evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. Yes, it's that good. <br /> <br /> "Red Sonja" is not in a genre known for big movies until Peter Jackson came along with a certain Oscar-winning trilogy. In fact, the best movie of swords and sorcery that I could remember before "The Lord of the Rings" was "Willow", which is very friendly to the children of George Lucas. Maybe, in view of this, one should be a little easy with this movie. But I can not, it's badly written, badly acted (with the exception of Paul Smith, who is simply average) and terribly together. The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones, with costumes and scenographies apparently taken directly from Bedrock. Considering the source material of the comic, it is easy to forgive the various inconsistencies of the plot. Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying child, in this world or in that, is disconcerting. His personality seems to change from a spoiled brat to a polite gentleman at the push of a button. Schwarzenegger shows less charisma than a field full of cows and simply follows the movements, a perfect actor for his innovative role in "The Terminator". <br /> <br /> It's simple to kick a movie when you're down, but the fact is that this is not a good movie, by any stretch of the imagination. When Nielsen mourns the death of his sister and Schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then releases a harsh sound with that distinctive Germanic accent: "she is dead", then you know that a hard trip awaits you. Some smiles were raised at inappropriate points, like the priestesses of a temple who, when sent to die in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy the experience, at least judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to resonate. the place. If you have to watch an eighties fantasy movie that was not porn, look at "Willow" (but never take it as a sound signal). Actually, go to your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what a great job he did with "The Lord of the Rings". Trust me, 11 Oscar really means it's a great movie, unlike the bloody "Titanic".
