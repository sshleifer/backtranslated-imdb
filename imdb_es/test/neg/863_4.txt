By chance I have captured this movie on nightly television. I saw the opening credits and I thought this looks good. Well, I was very wrong. While it was not unbearably bad (it had some fun and tender moments) it lacked a sense of cohesion. <br /> <br /> It started well enough with the character of Kathy Bates having a mid-life crisis when her husband abandons her and His singing idol is killed. But Kathy has played these disaffected women very well before, think of fried green tomatoes. The problem was not Kathy, it was the clueless script that wandered all over the place. It was as if the writers should have been thinking about what we will do next. The script also felt very contrived. <br /> <br /> Some others who have commented on this film have wondered why it did not receive a film release. I think the main reason would have been to avoid the shame and that the critics would have killed her. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, I thought that the little woman who played Maudie was fantastic and stole the movie, not to mention how beautiful she is
