I just realized why the colors and sets in "Sakuran" were so flashy and flashy, and just painful to watch. The story is about a high-class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese. His kimono was always more striking and more striking than another kimono so that the oiran would stand out. But the director, Mika Ninagawa, had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character, or even the story. <br /> <br /> What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie gave me the creeps. You could not call him acting. It was nothing more than attending to his fan fan of high school. Hi Anna, good luck with that as you get older. Yes, of course, they will hear like a biker girl, vulgar and vulgar, prone to violence. Did not we see you already representing this character in a more appropriate film? <br /> <br /> The story was painfully boring and predictable. What is the story of "Sakuran"? A detestable bitch always stays true to herself, and that's just that: a detestable bitch. She finds that, inexplicably, men are attracted to her and that she has an inexplicable capacity to manipulate men and becomes a successful and upper class prostitute despite the fact that she speaks and behaves as if she were a member of a gang of motorcyclists There is talk of this so-called capacity for seduction of yours, but we never see it in action, probably due to the ineptitude of the main girl, pretended-false, I mean "actress". <br /> <br /> The main character in the film makes a rich and powerful man angry with her because she keeps him waiting while serving a much humbler client. It's not very similar to oiran, right? How could a woman like that become a oiran? Oh, because they heard her earlier, she killed herself and the house needed a whore who could demand a high price. Who would pay such a high price for such a cheap whore? The rumors circulate. How could there be no repercussions for what he did to the powerful man? Because the writers are dollars. They invented a lot of garbage. <br /> <br /> Then, an even richer and more powerful guy falls in love with her (why?) and she throws him for a man without money who is usually cold and distant towards her, but respects who she is really (what does not make sense, how can someone respect someone so useless?). <br /> <br /> Speaking of shit, it's as if the director crouched down and took a huge trash can of psychedelic color on the aesthetics, culture and society of the Edo period. What about things like sabi, unconscious monkey, wabi, subtlety, elegance, a rigidly hierarchical society? All done by a director who appears as a meaningless parvenu, rich in nouveau. The amazing thing is that many other Japanese people, watching this movie, crouched around the director and took steaming spoons of this fiery smelly shit and exclaimed how tasty it was. <br /> <br /> Argentine tango music with Violin and bandoneon as a backdrop for the Edo Period when Japan was totally isolated from the international world (except for the 3.7 acres of Dejima)? Why does not only Anna, the evil one hear from the motorcyclist, respond to his cell phone and the rich and powerful daimyo character disappears in a whistling attack on his red Ferrari? The music we had to listen to was discordant and anachronistic (just like the artistic design). <br /> <br /> Near the end, I liked that there were only two or three small flowers in the cherry tree of the sanctuary. But earlier, the second time he said he would leave the rooms when it bloomed, we all knew exactly what would happen. How boring, telegraph the ending so clearly. But what's the point of the old tree blooming? That rich and powerful guy already made the pleasure rooms bloom in cherry trees like the Yoshino mountains in spring. Did not that impress her at all? Of course not. I know that about whores. The guys who treat them well are kicked in the balls. It may bother whores that people idealize when they themselves know the truth of who they are: simply cheap and worthless. <br /> <br /> Considering the director's obsession with goldfish, the second scene should have been from a bowl of goldfish in an accidentally overturned gallery. Two fish fall in a stream that drags them to escape beyond the walls of the pleasure rooms, discovering how the goldfish get stuck in their bowl and can not survive outside (like the relation of the inhabitants with the rooms Pleasure). Otherwise, the talk about the fate of the goldfish does not make sense. <br /> <br /> In the final scene, the cherry trees were full of flowers, but the brevity of the flowers is something special about the cherry blossoms. I could not help thinking that soon the twilight would erase all the soft pink color and the heat of the scene. The sky would quickly pass from shadow shadows to deepening gloom, and night would fall. It would become cold, very cold. And dark That really was not a happy ending, right? Romantic love (in the Edo Period?) Could survive the terrible poverty and the fact that it was excluded while the cherry trees last. Maybe a few days, unless it rained earlier. But the unfulfilled romantic love we see here? The existence in this period is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Anna Tsuchiya walking in a shoes oiran? She could not do it. Literally. Take a look at the scene of your "walk" where it seems that you have the right shoes, but you have to cling to the shoulder of a boy to avoid falling on his backside. <br /> <br /> I was going to give you this. Film two stars for the direction of art, but then I realized what it was: sick domination by the director. Those colors and sets are exactly what the director has to shout: "I'm the most important here! Me! It's all about me !!!!"
