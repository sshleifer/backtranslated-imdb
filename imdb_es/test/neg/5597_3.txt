After watching the film in one of my classes and talking to the filmmaker, I discovered exactly why the film did a bombing like it did. The creators of the film did not intend to call the movie "8MM 2". Originally, the film was called "The Velvet Side of Hell", but Sony Pictures changed it at the last moment to 8MM 2 without the filmmakers having any opinion about it. In doing so, he took them out of the theatrical releases and condemned them to a direct video release with minimal publicity. <br /> <br /> Again, this is from the filmmaker's mouth, not mine, so I really can not say what is true and what is exaggeration. <br /> <br /> If you see the movie as "Velvet Side of Hell", it's not that bad. It's not great, but it's not a scary god. Basically, it would only be a B movie that likes to show boobs. But as a sequel to "8MM", the film fails terribly.
