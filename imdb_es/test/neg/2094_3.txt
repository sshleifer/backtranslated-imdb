Not to be confused with the highly touted vehicle Samuel L. Jackson SNAKES ON AN AIRCRAFT; SNAKES ON A TRAIN is low budget, has no actors (to talk about them), but has some pretty decent visuals. An attractive young woman (Julia "Rayanne" Ruiz) does not want to marry someone else's choice for her husband; therefore, they subject her to a powerful Mayan curse that has snakes that hatch inside her body, devouring slowly from the inside out. His only hope of survival is a shaman who lives across the border in Texas. Time is over for her; and they put her on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles. In a short time the snakes are leaving their body shattered by pain and rapidly growing in size. The passengers on board the train are now trapped and will soon be snake sandwiches. The final sequence is undoubtedly the best of this 91-minute film. They are also receiving acting credits: Alby Castro, Al GÃ¡lvez and Giovanni Bejarno.
