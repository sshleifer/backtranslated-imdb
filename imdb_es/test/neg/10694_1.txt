This movie is bad. It's not so bad that it's good. Simply bad However, it is hilariously bad. I looked at him with morbid curiosity and never had the intention to see him or any other Chuck Norris movie ever again. If you have to choose between this movie and death, you should choose this movie with pleasure, since it is a master class in the making of terrible movies (hence the hilarity). <br /> <br /> It is a constant depression for me, while doing my desk work, that some people get involved in the creation of films and decide to produce things like this. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10. Even better than "Starship Troopers" though.
