I recently went to a free screening of the telenovela where the filmmakers were present. Before the film they strutted laughing, taking pictures. I was excited to see them disguised in real life, and I could not wait to see the movie on the big screen. <br /> <br /> During the movie, the audience laughed. It was clear to me then that they were not laughing with the photo, but with the photo. This is purely a grade B movie with no logic behind it. Put a little nudity, some blood and whala! You have a movie! <br /> <br /> After the movie, I approached a group of filmmakers and asked them why they wanted to make this film. All acted in a serious way, as if they were serious filmmakers. Everyone told me something different: to make a controversial film, a funny movie, an uplifting film, a socially responsible film. Everyone mentioned something different. It was clear to me that none of the filmmakers knew what kind of film they were making, and now they were trying to get their money back by advertising this movie in any way they could for people to see it. <br /> <br /> Let me warn you: do not accept the hype! Unless you really have nothing else to do, it might be worth the time of a film student to study how a movie should not be made. Otherwise, you'd better save two hours of your life.
