Normally, I would not take the trouble to comment on a horror movie sequel, because it is generally assumed that they are BAD, and if you see them with a lack of healthy respect, they can be very funny and enjoyable to make fun of. However, this chapter of the Halloween saga in progress was about to put together everything that represented the original. In the first film, Dr. Loomis said (very punctually I might add), that Michael Myers was evil, and this tries to explain why (doing a bad job I might add). In my opinion, he was much more scared when he was just a bloodthirsty monster. Everything Gothic / cult was unnecessary and a desperate attempt to throw a new curve in the Halloween equation. The result was a boring and predictable movie that was not scary and was not bad enough to be fun.
