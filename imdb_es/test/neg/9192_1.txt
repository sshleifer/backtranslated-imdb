One of the worst movies ever made. Let's start with the superficial: Joaquin Phoenix is, first of all, too fat to be a novice firefighter. The NYFD does not recruit the boys from the Pillsbury crowd. John Travolta has a bad job of dyeing, and the strange gleam in his eyes throughout the movie made me think he was in a sort of extended Scientology hem. The plot hits on all the tropes and clich√©s of what the average Joe thinks the firefighter's life is really like: they all get drunk, get into fights, have difficulty expressing their emotions, their wives stay at home crying, all They have father problems, they all have a Boston accent, and so on. An execrable piece of schwarmerei that plays in our prolonged cult to the cultural hero of the firemen after 9-11, which was, by the way, a cult to the valid cultural hero. Unfortunately, this movie does not present believable heroes to worship.
