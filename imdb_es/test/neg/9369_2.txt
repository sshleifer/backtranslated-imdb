I usually do not write reviews for shows unless I've seen them in full. However, there were so many positive opinions of this show here that I felt it was necessary to balance it with a bit of realism. <br /> <br /> This show is hysterically bad. I do not think it was meant to be, but it is. I see that there is a lot of praise in the program, and I honestly can not understand why --- this program is so badly performed, the dialogue is so horrible and the frames are very thin around their holes. <br /> <br /> I think this show is interesting because it is definitive proof of its standards. Some elements of the show work, and maybe those elements are more important for some people than those that do not work, which makes the show almost incomprehensible to people like me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy making fun of a program as you see it, anticipating clichéd lines and so on, this can be a fun program to ridicule, if you have that kind of time in your hands. <br /> <br /> The pilot is a fairly fair example of the whole show. If the end of the saccharine cliché with no sense does not leave you in a silly shock, then this may be a show for you.
