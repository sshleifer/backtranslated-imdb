Last night I saw this movie, I am a big fan of the book and I was very happy with the version in which Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon starred. But this one, it's just horrible. Oh, my God, I do not understand how they dared to destroy this classic story and made the characters totally different, starting with the change of Beth as the younger sister and making Amy the third. And the interpretation of Jo, terrible, Jo was a young feminist, intelligent and somewhat angry, and the actress who plays Jo in this movie acts like a silly and very annoying girl. And what about Laurie's war? I agree with the fact that when a book becomes a film, some changes must be made, but not to rewrite the whole story. very very badly done
