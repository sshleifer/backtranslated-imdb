This movie is the worst thing that humans have created. Do you think that hands is the worst movie in history? He does not even come close to this garbage. I do not even know where to start. The "Russian" commander and the chic rebel are the worst "actors" that appear in a movie. They make the sister of troll 2 look like Meryl Streep. The silly faces that the chic does while she is in kung fu training have to be seen to be believed. Then there is oompa music during the recess of the prison, the love scene totally out of place, the stupid song that plays during the misplaced love scene, the false castro, the fact that everyone has a band for the head and / or a bandana. Some part of her body, the most ridiculous rape scene ever filmed, and the worst performance ever filmed. This movie deserves to be best known among fans of bad movies. Definitely the worst movie ever made.
