Maybe it's because I read Peter Straub's wonderful book before watching the movie, but this movie disappointed me a lot. In my opinion, the filmmakers eliminated everything that made the story interesting and unique, and replaced it with more common elements of Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> It is also very bad, since this film has an excellent cast, particularly Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman and the then unknown Alice Krige. They just are not given much that is worth doing. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was about to go halfway, but a friend convinced me to stay until the end, since I was sure I had to do it. best. He apologized to me during the final credits.
