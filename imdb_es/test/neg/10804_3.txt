Soultaker was written and starred by Vivian Schilling. It was also starring Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen and Robert D'Zar as the Angel of Death. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the introduction to Soultaker, played by Joe Estevez. We quickly learn what the role of Soultaker will be in this movie. <br /> <br /> Next, young college-age students are preparing for a summer festival, aptly named "Summerfest". In this film, the battle of the classes is omnipresent throughout the film. The girls come from a wealthy class and the boys are from the middle or lower class. Class roles seem to play a role in the movie for some reason that is not really clear or pertinent to the story. <br /> <br /> At Summerfest we learn more about the apparent class difficulties of why Zach is not. He encouraged her to go out with Natalie. Soultaker also makes an appearance, apparently with his boss, the Angel of Death. Here, the character of D'Zar points out who should die and who should take their souls. It is also revealed that Soultaker will have a character conflict regarding Natalie, and how he deals with her because of someone in her past. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Natalie is abandoned for her trip to Summerfest, and Zach convinces her. to ride at home with them. During the trip home, Soultaker takes an active role that causes them to horribly ruin at high speeds. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story surrounds the Soultaker who picks up the souls of the dead passengers, and Zach and Natalie try to outwit him back to their bodies so they can continue living. Class conflicts and character conflicts are in the story, but in reality they are never put in the foreground or resolved. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt towards the end to lengthen part of the drama, there is a lot of persecution and execution. that tends to be really boring. It really is not acceptable, and it would have been nice if this had been treated differently, in some way to increase the drama but not to bore the audience. <br /> <br /> The story and the acting are decent. The soundtrack is fine, and even the production values ​​are good. <br /> <br /> Robert D'Zar in his brief screen appearance does a good job as the Angel of Death. Joe Estevez does well, however, sometimes his role acts a bit flat. Vivian is pretty and does a decent job like Natalie, although she may act a little on some scenes. <br /> <br /> This may sound strange, but this movie could definitely have benefited from a meaningless nudity. Vivian bothers us a bit, but that was not enough. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this was a pretty serious attempt to make a movie. The results, it's worth seeing them. Just do not expect a perfect production. <br /> <br /> 3/10
