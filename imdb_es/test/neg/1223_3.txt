I looked at the three segments and I am very disappointed with the story line. Zahn spends so much time imitating Duvall that he does nothing else in the show. And Tommy Lee Jones would never be as weak as a young man, unpleasant, yes, but never weak. We never see how or why they're going to go back to Lonesome Dove ... which is a dirty hole in the original ... why would they leave Austin where they are heroes ... for not doing anything during the whole movie ... I was encouraging Blue Duck at the end of the movie and he was totally wrong. There is no warning about how many segments there are ... it just ends. This miniseries could have been "someone" ... tragic. It seemed to be run by the parrot and the Jaguar.
