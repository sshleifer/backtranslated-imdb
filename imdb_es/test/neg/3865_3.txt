This was such a terrible movie, almost a comedy sketch of a black movie. The budget was low compared to a blockbuster, but even higher than most. But that is where they decided to reduce costs, which is totally strange. Some actors are less competent, while others seem to have been dragged out of the street. One of them is the main actor, it's so bad that I got angry when he said something (he talks about the whole movie). Then there are the strange costume options. At the beginning of the film, all the characters wear clothes from the 1930s. They drive a classic car, but the bottom is a modern wind farm that is blatantly modern. And the costumes and some configurations continue to follow the theme of this year's black cinema. Then, BAM promotes a new climb with 24-inch wheels ... WTF. The same thing when a guy has a night scope on his rifle, he gets shot by sight. He's targeting a guy with an MP5 and tactician. In an even stranger contrast, the locations are bright, and they look like Ave Ave costs more than the rest of the entire movie. The camera angles / shots are very good, and they show these locations brilliantly in the scenes. The director has a good eye for a unique shot with good looks, but I have no idea how to do much more. . <br /> <br /> People who must shoot for this movie ▼ <br /> <br /> The writer The director The casting agent The costume designer <br /> <br /> The people who they must be tortured for death by their monotonous, monotonous nails on the board. ▼ <br /> <br /> Anton Pardoe - the main actor, writer, producer If you've ever seen the movie Hostel, I wish that would happen to this guy, but he does not run away
