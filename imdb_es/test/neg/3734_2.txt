The first time I saw this movie was with this pretty girl who attracted me. We had a lot of fun laughing and generally mocking us. So my impression was that it was terrible, but you could see it for its cheese value. Then, as part of our anniversary, we saw it together again on video. As a result, the movie is terrible and can not be seen. It's amazing how beautiful girls can change the appearance of the world.
