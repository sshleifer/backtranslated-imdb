Hercules ended up falling into the same category as many promising television productions that could have been a great classic, only to become a sad joke. <br /> <br /> I really like Kevin Sorbo and his cast, but I did not. Nor does it matter what direction the program took from its equivalents in the film. I think the program would have had a much more successful career if they had kept the same format they had for the movies. <br /> <br /> I saw it at the beginning and lost interest in the road. I came across the strange episode later, but my attention span was very fortunate to get to a commercial.
