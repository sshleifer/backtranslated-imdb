Nothing Carson Daly has ever said or done in this program has NEVER made me laugh, not even smile a little. I do not understand how this program has survived for so many years. <br /> <br /> Even the "funny" member of the band is like one of those kids in high school who thinks nobody is good enough to look at him. . Daly and that guy are just arrogant frat boys. It seems that they do not even try to be a little funny. <br /> <br /> BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL SAME show. <br /> <br /> Makes my soul cry <br /> <br /> I can not emphasize enough how horrible this show is. Do not look at it But if it is absolutely necessary, I recommend that you take your eyes out and cover your ears with cement beforehand.
