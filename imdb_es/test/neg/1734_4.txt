I rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh. Actually, the video store employee laughed at us because of our questionable movie tastes. Unfortunately, I do not remember the first half of the movie because all I did was stare at the giant metal braces Jane wore. and I did not hear anything either because of the incomprehensible raft. The other thing that was able to catch my attention besides its metal mouth was its questionable sense of fashion. This movie was made in 2005, but it seems that the costume people jumped until the year 2000 to buy clothes. If you remember the days when Aaron Carter was considered a "pop star" and you like high-waisted jeans, ankle-length socks and knee-length skirts, this little trip down memory lane is perfect for you .
