Too much footage (almost one third of this 53 minute movie) really slows down this one. Granted that the plot is that John Weston (John Wayne) is sent by Marshall George Higgins (George Hayes) to participate in a fixed rodeo (for example, "Ro-DAY-oh"), but sacrifices the development and interaction of the character. The relationship between Bad Girl (usually a Latina, even in the great "Duck Soup" [1933]) and the 'heroine' Polly Ann Young, a similar to Loretta Young (hey, it's her sister!) She could have benefited From more screen time. The happy ending is too abrupt, although this time John Wayne actually kisses the girl. <br /> <br /> The most interesting archive material was the long rodeo parade of real Indians, squawks and papooses. But when the best part of the movie is Mighty Yak's stunt work, Yakima Canutt, which jumps from horse to horse and several different horse jumps to a horse, you know we're in trouble. As others have pointed out, the final fight with the villain is very badly done. <br /> <br /> My copy of 'Platinum Disc Corporation' featured an additional, sparse, poorly adapted (pseudo-classical) stereo music track that ruins the authenticity of the original movie (the DVD case had ' 5.1 enhanced audio '). If you are going to modernize and color it, you should add a 'Western' sound score with acoustic guitars, 'klip-klopping' helmets, harmonicas, and an accordion. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have to say that this is one of the weakest efforts of Lone Star.
