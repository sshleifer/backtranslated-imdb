This cheap movie and trash is about a NASA test rocket that is sent into space with a shipment of animals. It disappears for a while and then returns unexpectedly, landing in a forest, unleashing a vicious mutant creature. <br /> <br /> Like many films of this type, Night Fright, has dumb teenagers who play the surf music of the 60s before. Being killed. However, none of the murders is remotely memorable, since we really do not see anything. However, one thing we do see is that one of the teens seems to be about 40 years old and has a pretty impressive haircut. <br /> <br /> For a creature feature to work, you really have to present your monster to the viewer correctly. In this movie, however, we only get the briefest flashes of the monster. It seems to resemble the Robot Monster alien. But I'm not sure; as the photograph was so dark that I simply could not tell what the hell was going on most of the time. Although, my intuition was that I probably was not missing much.
