I think it's the first time I enter a theater and I leave so disappointed. There were two reasons why I went to see "Astérix et les Vikings": first as a movie fan and second as a great Asterix fan. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie does not satisfy any request. . It is simply a great animated disaster and shows that the Asterix franchise goes from bad to worse. <br /> <br /> In fact, it has been this way since the death of the first screenwriter René Goscinny in 1977. His faithful collaborator, the illustrator Albert Uderzo took his place, but the following books clearly lacked the quality that was present during the Goscinny years. <br /> <br /> "Asterix et les Vikings" is based on the book "Asterix et les Normands", which was published during the reign of Goscinny. The basic story is the same: Goudurix, the 'nephew' of Abraracourcix arrives in the village and Asterix and Obelix must make him a real man, while the Vikings come to Gaul to discover what fear is, because it seems that fear It gives wings. . <br /> <br /> The similarities end here. What follows in the book is an uninterrupted series of laughs, jokes and funny dialogues with the result that the Vikings discover fear and flee from Gaul. The film is silly, not funny, fast-paced, corny ... Well, only the default name and has many possibilities to be applied ... <br /> <br /> The difference between the book and the film could be More acceptable if the movie was good. But new ideas simply crash into a bottomless pit. Even old Asterix films like "Asterix le Gaulois", which almost transfer the lines one by one without changing them, are easily better. <br /> <br /> Animation has the quality of other 21st century films, but it has its flaws. And any movie beginner could find the mistakes. The biggest example is the continuity error, where the day follows the night after a fraction of a second, in the same sequence. <br /> <br /> Imagine. They took animation studies from many countries and still can not make an adequate film. <br /> <br /> The changes in the original story are simply unbearable. And they could still be if there was not an original story. Goudurix, in the film, has a pigeon called SMS and acts as his cell phone (!). Grossebaf, the Viking leader, has a rebellious teenage daughter named Abba (!) And she constantly challenges the authority of her father. There is also a stupid Viking wizard, his mute and muscular cartoon son, Grossebaf's faithful wife who is obsessed with decoration (her name is Vikea!) And ... well, I can not take it anymore. <br /> <br /> We are far from the original gags of the original book. The biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring the images to the big screen, mainly because the biggest laughs in the books come from verbal jokes and visual gags that do not have the same appeal on a theater screen. I remember that the best moments of the book were Obelix laughing at the names of the invaders (that all end in 'af') and Goudurix tries to scare them ridiculously. <br /> <br /> And if it were not like that. Enough, someone from the advertising staff decided to write on the poster of the film that there is already a Céline Dion song that would already be included in the final credits. If it was a new song, I could have understood it. But using an old song is just another proof that the movie is so badly made that they are ready to do anything to attract the viewers. <br /> <br /> The only positive point of this movie is that it is so stupid and the ending is so bad that we can not leave the theater without leaving us alone. In a summer release, it just can not hurt ... <br /> <br /> The only other acceptable point of the film is how Goudurix becomes brave. His psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and is not credible, while it is best illustrated in the film and the point of motivation is more credible. <br /> <br /> So if you have not seen the movie yet, do not do it. waste your money on it. Take the book instead. <br /> <br /> Oh Rene, why did you leave us?
