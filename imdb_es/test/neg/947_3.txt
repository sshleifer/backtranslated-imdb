The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal fairs in "My Giant" is to say that this movie is for his career as "Ishtar" was for Warren Beaty - he did not ruin it, but he delayed it ... ..much. Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) never play in front of a child 2) never play in front of an animal 3) never play in front of someone who is almost 3 feet taller than you, is as innocent as a child and "act" like an animal. <br /> <br /> What is this story? A comedy? I guess, but I did not laugh, except in the scenes where Crystal is alone and not loaded with his ex-wife (what is his role in this film) or the giant mentioned above. Did I mention that there is also a child in this movie? Well, forget about him. We bring the son so that we feel sorry for Crystal, and we do it, but for the actor, not for the character. Billy Crystal is a funny man. If you do not believe me, look at it in old episodes of "Soap" or "Saturday Night Live". Go rent "City Slicker" or "Running Scared" or "When Harry Met Sally". <br /> <br /> "Giant" is more boring than the payment of fi-fo-fum. <br /> <br />
