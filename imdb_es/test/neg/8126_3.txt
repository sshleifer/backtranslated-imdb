The Realty television team is assigned to cover a hockey team from a small town high school that runs into a serial killer wearing a black mask and a hoodie. Many interviews in which the crew members (and some of the locals who live in the city of White Plains where most of this movie takes place) speak to each other's camera, those in the city of White Plains, its current situations, and the show side of their lives. The script is often acidic, cynical and caustic, and Killer Movie essentially makes fun of reality TV shows, with a cast of characters that can be found in The Real World. If this plot is attractive to you, cheer up. The characters seemed boring and the satire is an old hat. Outside the cast, Paul Wesley, the director who needs a great break, finds himself with more than he could negotiate, Jake Tanner, is a good guy, who is very kind and tolerant of the trash he has to deal with, considering the prima donnas. and immature people in their environment who often cause nothing but migraines. Particularly annoying is his producer Lee (Cyia Batten), a tyrant who constantly shouts orders to everyone, his poisonous attitude creates a lot of tension ... she is the kind of producer who wants to capitalize on an eruption in a small city with respect to the killer, using the cover of the hockey team. History as a front to exploit the tragedy that occurs in White Plains. Those who are familiar with Kaley Cuoco know that at this point she has perfected the spoiled princess, she got it because it is the only role we see her most of the time. Like Blanca, she is polarizing the way she demands attention, milking the small celebrity status she has up to the hilt, generating a lot of friction as she becomes a source of frustration, and has a dirty mouth (Cuoco may have taken the part only so that she could escape from her usual television comedy roles, allowing them to see profanities without restrictions) Cuoco, along with the full cast, serves Killer Movie as an eye game, but it is difficult to find a character that would not want to see torn with meat. Butcher Knife. Jason London is the type of sound / equipment, a real creep with a bitter attitude, which often torments others with their disgusting comments that are not necessary. We are witnesses of many clashes of personalities, observing how these Hollywood types absorbed in themselves are hooked on each other. The killer's identity should not surprise anyone, it's pretty obvious. A little bit of blood, but most of the violence shoots off the screen. Despite a bit of domesticated lesbianism, even this is not satisfactory. Leighton Meester appears in the film as a cute victim. The director / writer Jeff Fisher gathers a quite attractive cast, but I could not distinguish this from the innumerable slashers that have stocked the shelves of terror in the last ten years or so since SCREAM. While I've never liked any of Cuoco's characters, I never tire of looking at her, but in the end she has to devise a role other than her grooming, her arrogance, always complaining and complaining.
