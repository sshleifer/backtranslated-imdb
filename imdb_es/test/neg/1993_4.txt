Okay ... a few years later, Chayefsky's classic "Network" will be his true cinematic big run ... but for now, this dark comedy is not the classic he aspires to be. It's mostly horrible, though it has some good scenes: the first murder victim was found, the emergency room clerk responsible for billing patients making a surprise discovery, Drummond's delirious confessional and the last scene in which Scott's character regains his professional integrity and self-esteem. He also has some ridiculous scenes: the plaintive monologue of Scott's character during his first visit to the hospital's psychiatrist, the character of Scott who violates the character of Rigg, the horrible robbery of Dysart in his brief scenes and the O.R. doctor who rushes on the operating table to resuscitate the wrong patient because "I already have a claim for professional negligence." <br /> <br /> Chayefsky also tries TOO MUCH to throw all possible obstacles in this one hospital (ie murders, administrative procedures). mistakes, poor people protesting outside, etc). It could have worked better as a look at the industry as a whole. As for the acting: Scott is passable, Rigg seems grumpy, Hughes is inspired and Dysart assaults his brief performance. The rest of the cast is too one-dimensional.
