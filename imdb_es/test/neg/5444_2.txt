Of bad performance and badly directed, "Congo" tries to recreate without success the feeling of "Jurassic Park". But the truth is that the book was not so good either. Still, the first problem with the film is that Tim Curry's character was added; The second problem is that the talking arm was added; The main problem, however, is that the cast members do not create realistic characters. I guarantee that this movie will not make you think that there are murderous gorillas anywhere on earth. Also starring Laura Linney (happy birthday, Laura!), Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker, James Karen and Bruce Campbell; I guess you do not want to emphasize this movie in your résumés.
