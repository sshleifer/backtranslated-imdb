This is definitely the worst vampire movie of all time. I started seeing this right after Interview with the vampire and I was completely disappointed. The script of this film not only had craters as big as the Grand Canyon, but the film seemed to jump from one scene to another, leaving viewers completely baffled. The vampire Lestat played by Stuart Townsend was terrible. Having a good body does not make you an actor! The end of the queen was too easy and sudden, insulting the intelligence of the spectators. I'll give him a star because Aaliyah really did his best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good. Apart from that, I would advise Anne Rice to take an ax and start hacking those who destroyed her brilliant history.
