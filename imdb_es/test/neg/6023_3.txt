The promotions for "Clubbed" project a polished-looking film based on the scene of the clubs of the 1980s. What we ended up with is a film with identity problems. The subplots end up taking control of what the spectators would assume as the main plot, so the focus in this film is mainly on the "clubbing" and ends in the gutter. <br /> <br /> Boxing, depression Self-hatred, gangsters, gorillas and drug dealers accumulate hastily in 90 odd minutes. On no less than 4 occasions I had to verify the execution time of the film, as there was growing concern that this movie was going to disappoint. <br /> <br /> The club scenes we see are bland and repetitive, with about 3 extras dancing in what can hardly be recognized as a "club" that barely captures the vibe of the day. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie about the 80s club scene, something like what "Human Trafficking" did in the late '90s, forget about "Clubbed".
