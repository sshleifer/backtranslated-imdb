This movie premiered shortly after Conan's films, a kind of Conan woman, Red Sonja played by Sylvester Stallones' ex-wife, Brigitte Nielsen. She is not a very good actress, unfortunately as shown by Rocky IV and Cobra. The whole movie seems cheap, but strangely Arnold Swarzenegger appears in this film but not as Conan, although he looks, acts and fights Conan as Conan's two films, I do not know what it is about. Anyway, it only appears every twenty minutes and does not stay long. Maybe Arnold filmed this in his spare time to shoot Conan the Destroyer or something like that? Anyway, the movie is too slow and boring for an action movie, skip this and look at Conan the Barbarian.
