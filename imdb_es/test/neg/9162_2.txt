Do you know that the old woman saw about a train crash? How can you not look away? This movie is not so good. The only reason you are still there is because you brought your children and you can not leave them alone in the theater. You could take a nap. <br /> <br /> Tim Hill should never go back to work on the film after delivering this horrible piece of scrap metal. He manages to take a decent comedic actor in Jason Lee and turn him into a robotic and insecure actor in this production. <br /> <br /> First of all, I did not have much hope for this movie, I admit it. If it was not basically the only family movie I could take my son for Christmas, my wife and I would not have gone. God, I wish we could go back in time and stop. I approached my wife about 10 minutes to tell her how bad I thought it was, but she punched me. <br /> <br /> I'm not kidding. It is putrefying Only the excellent work of David Cross prevents that this review is only 1 star. <br /> <br /> The story is cloying, insulting and stupid, as might be expected in a film of this genre (although the recent "George the Curious" was wonderfully intelligent and nice). The performance is mostly poor. The decision to "update" Chipmunks songs for today's audience was not advisable at best and the bone head at worst. It does not work. <br /> <br /> The chipmunks of yesteryear were smart, naughty and cunning. These squirrels are dumb, somewhat petty, unpleasant and, as a surprise, needed to the point of uselessness. <br /> <br /> Whether as a retrospective, a tribute, or as a completely new production, this film is totally new. fails The final straw? My son could not wait to leave. Spend your money renting Curious George instead.
