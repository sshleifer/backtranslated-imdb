One commentator said that if you like Austin Powers you will like this movie. I liked Autin Powers and I was disappointed with this movie. The film works hard, maybe too hard for the laughs. Maybe it was that all the villains in this movie screamed as if the screams in themselves were funny. I get to where they were trying to go with this movie. A cross between Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel, but it just does not work. Austin Powers, though foolish but intelligent, Zorro the Gay Blade lacks the skill of Austin Powers, The Big Lebowski or Kingpin. <br /> <br /> I kept expecting a laugh and while I was waiting I was surprised that someone really paid for it. the script. My 15 year old daughter also thought that the movie was flat. My 17 year old son who selected this movie in his title, came out after 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> It seems that many people in IMDb liked this movie, but for me I did not have the good time or the jokes of a good comedy. .
