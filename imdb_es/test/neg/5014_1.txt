This movie was a waste of my money. It was disgusting and annoying. Honestly, I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Who thinks of a movie where a girl blows her dog? Seriously ... it was a waste of my time. I kept watching the movie, hoping it would improve and a plot would emerge, but that never happened. I would rate the movie with an F-. This film should have been classified R by its disturbing nature. I would never allow children of any age to watch this movie. this movie stinks this movie is horrible This movie was a waste of my time. I could have spent the night doing some of my time instead of renting this movie. This movie was a waste of money to get to the store and definitely a loss of two dollars to see it. more or less, nobody should see this movie. This movie should be banned and burned.
