"Beowulf" is like a very bad game: there are no characters, no history, no real dialogues, bad fights ... It's probably the worst movie in the history of cinema. It is deadly boring, a waste of time. I am very sorry for Christophe Lambert, who visibly does not know how to choose a role. If someone suggests that you see "Beowulf", believe me: run like crazy.
