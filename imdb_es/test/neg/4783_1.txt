I saw this movie with very low expectations. I did not know much about that, so I was not sure if it would be worth it. <br /> <br /> The story did a good job of making you curious about these ruins they travel to. The suspense continues when the Maya appear and force them to remain in the ruins. <br /> <br /> Then, the film goes from being a little suspense to useless. The amount of blood found in this film was not compensated in comparison with whether it was really necessary or if it was used more for the impact value. <br /> <br /> The fact that they did not try to fight against the vines of hell. They had fire and did not try to burn it or try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not. They quickly threw themselves into a victim role and their defenseless attitude was not real. It reminded me of the old horror movies where people just scream and scream and have no half brain to try to defend themselves.
