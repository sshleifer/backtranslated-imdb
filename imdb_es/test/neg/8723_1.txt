Lies. Total garbage. Writers should not have read the book or seen the David Lynch movie. It's not worth wasting your time. <br /> <br /> More time does not improve. While it is deeper than Lynch's film, it has a great lack of precision, and the key parts of the story in the game. <br /> <br /> "One night at the Roxbury" is more worth it.
