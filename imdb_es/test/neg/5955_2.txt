There is a reason why the world forgot these creatures: they are boring. This is a hammer production, which means that whoever made this movie should be hit with a hammer, several times if possible, and where it hurts the most. Most people think about taking a dumpster of what these idiots have done to make this movie. <br /> <br /> Really now? The movie starts with some cavemen hunting an antelope thing. Now, the antelopes must have evolved a lot since those prehistoric times because they actually attack and kill people here. After that, it's time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, some fashion models and even a couple of grandmothers and grandparents very old and gray. These old people, obviously, never heard that the people of the caves did not surpass the age of 30 years; They refused to submit to the will of the logical and prehistoric records, so they are still alive. One of the men in the caverns is not bearded; He is clean-shaven. Not as shaved as Tarzan, The Lord of the Humanoids Clean and shaved who roam the jungle since childhood and without a razor, but around. <br /> <br /> What follows is the obligatory destruction of earthquake / molten lava sequence that makes many of our not-so-furry friends meet their doom. It is interesting to note that before the earthquake fashion models showed more of their breasts. After that, they must have been shy or something, because they covered their chests for a while (maybe they were covered in ashes, so I mistakenly thought they were covered). Follow more action in the form of two fashion models fighting in the arena; The best for female mud fighting, I suppose. After a large part of the desert has crossed, our black-haired tribe finds, how else could it be, a blonde tribe. Yawn. <br /> <br /> More fascinating things follow. There is that red-haired model who is annoyed to see a teenager from the caves kill a hedge. There is also the scene of a woman who dies at birth: those cave fashion models are very fragile. Finally, we find a tribe of dark hair and darker fur, that is, an evil tribe. One of them becomes a WWF champion after he actually wins (!) A great bear thing in a wrestling match. 1,2,3 ... and it's done: the bear is the loser. We are also witnesses that a jealous caveman miraculously recovers from two important injuries: first he is stabbed with a large spear in the thigh, but he moves away from it as if it were a scratch. He is then thrown off a cliff (on a large rock) by the blond cave man with two shoes, however, he moves away from him as if he were thrown onto a giant sofa. In the end it is not clear if he dies by falling off an even higher cliff or by the destruction of that voodoo doll. Oh yes, voodoo was used in prehistoric times by white tribes that live in the desert and whose females were fashion models. It is always important to learn from movies. <br /> <br /> The message of the film is as insightful as it is educational: the people in the cave liked to fight for local power and also for their fashion models. As if any self-respecting caveman struggled to be the leader of such a pitiful group.
