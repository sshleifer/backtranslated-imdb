I thought it was difficult, if not impossible, to look, and not because of the horrors it represents, but because of the way they were represented. Imagine what Costa Gavras could have done with this true horror story. What I am opposed to is the idea that the need to denounce, to which I am subscribed, is sufficient. What do you think about showing it to us with the power of powerful cinema? I feel that the filmmaker's enthusiasm, perhaps even justifiable anger, did not allow him to see it clearly from a cinematic point of view. Or, if this was a cinematic point of view, I mean, a choice, then, I did not like it at all. I was more bothered by the way the film was shot than the film itself. Well intentioned, I'm sure, but, unfortunately, that's not enough.
