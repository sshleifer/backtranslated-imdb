I am a lover of bad movies. I own "R.O.T.O.R." and "Boa vs. Python" and I'm working to develop my collection with such great titles as "Troll 2" and "What's wrong with Superdoc?" But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to get to the list of wonderfully terrible movies. It's just lame. The guy who said he has had a better dialogue with his potted plants has it right. Everything about this movie is stupid. When the robot hits the car, it seems almost as if it knew it was going to explode, there was simply no reason for it to run in that direction. "Judge, jury and executioner", "The perfect policeman ... but they went too far", I mean, why do people bother to make these films? ROTOR. he does it because he's hysterically horrible, but Storm Trooper is just a movie loss because he's not bad enough to be so bad that it's worth watching. This belongs to someone's collection of home movies, something they can be proud of, but that's it. I'm sure he was on an HBO channel (with only 1 star, from what I saw) because he did not belong there. Even if you like bad movies, do not watch this movie. It is shameful
