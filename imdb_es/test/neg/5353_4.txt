There are other comments here that express similar opinions, but I still feel compelled to add my comments. The film is generally well made from a technical point of view, plus it may be too long. The performance is mostly very good, although Kevin Spacey is not given much space to explain the motivation of his character (apparently ambition rather than racism), and the only function of Sandra Bullock seems to be like a candy for the eyes, what she admits very well. /> <br /> At a fundamental level, the heart of the film is in the right place when opposing racism, and I have the impression that it tried to be a kind of definitive treatment of racism, maybe why so many celebrities. agreed names to be in it. However, it seems that the writers bit much more than they could chew (I have not read the book, so I do not know how much of that is due to Grisham). The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ends up defending the justice of the vigilantes. Apart from the fact that I do not agree with that position, I do not believe that such a vision actually helps the antiracist cause at all: it is more likely to apply to absolute white defendants who kill black victims. In the end, the prosecutor invites the jury (and the public) to imagine that the raped child was white, but he continues in that way and imagines that the accused is a white man who murdered black rapists ... in the end, the message seems It's okay to kill someone while you hate him enough. It is also convenient that the murdered man be presented as totally evil and his guilt had no doubts, which eliminates any moral ambiguity that may exist in a real case. <br /> <br /> Samuel L Jackson offers an excellent performance, but unfortunately, this also undermines the plot: he presents himself as someone with considerable integrity, but it is hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind a plea of ​​madness ( and in fact it does not, when the opportune moment arrives). We are supposed to think that it is because he faces the death penalty, but in fact, at some point he was offered a request for involuntary manslaughter, although if he blinks he may lose it. Why not take it, given that you should know that your chances of absolution are slim? Or if he wants to take a position in the court, why plead insanity? <br /> <br /> There are also less serious faults. The medical experts, on whose testimony the case is supposedly based, are jokes: both are discredited for highly improbable reasons, and none of them offers a real psychiatric diagnosis. The message seems to be that the expert witnesses will say what they are asked to say, and they should not be believed. The fact that the wounded policeman supports Jackson is moderately plausible, but it is still a little convenient (and if he had died?) I find it hard to believe that the KKK would march down the street in broad daylight. Other apparently serious crimes (riots, fires, kidnappings, assassination attempts) pass without any visible attempt to detect or prosecute them. And the scene in which the dog returns jumping is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> My final reaction is that they leave me feeling pretty dirty, like I'm a racist because I do not agree with the resolution. It may be that the film tried to explore different points of view and let the public decide, but if so, it seems that they have forgotten when they reached the end. The movie made me think about my points of view, read what other people thought here and added my own opinion, so at some level maybe it was successful, but I'm worried that it may have reinforced highly illiberal views in some people, which I hope is the opposite of what I intended. <br /> <br /> Final thought: try to see Law and Order, cover topics like this one much more deeply in about 38 minutes of screen time!
