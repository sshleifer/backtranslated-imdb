If a movie ever made Italians look bad, that's all. <br /> <br /> Duke Mitchell: what is an A - HOLE. Duke Mitchell, I'm in your grave. Seeing that virtually all the people shot dead in this film by the coward Mimi is black or some other racial or ethnic minority, it is hard not to convince oneself that, ultimately, the guy owes his allegiance to the Ku Klux Klan or skinheads . Awww, but he does not shoot the black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence, so that means he can not be that bad, right? INCORRECT. A typical and sentimental sentimental gut. <br /> <br /> While I understand why some people may be surprised and even, to some extent, admire the audacity, totally impassive of the film, no doubt about their own hatred and sense of self-involvement), but this does not change the fact that the main character, Mimi (and, by extension, Duke Mitchell), is a completely disgusting human being who does not gain a bit of empathy or interest, especially since Duke Mitchell is a COMPLETE BORE as an interpreter . But what do you expect from a man whose main claim to fame (apart from this dog and a movie) was to be a second-rate Dean Martin impersonator?
