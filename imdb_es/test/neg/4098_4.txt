Although I enjoy the work of Steve Carrell, Evan the Almighty, like so many other exaggerated films, turned out to be much worse than I expected. <br /> <br /> This turned out to be a cheesy family movie, the One guy who employs a famous comedian to improve his image, but who ultimately fails. <br /> <br /> Carell's usual humor is almost absent in the movie and, although he made me laugh a few times, there was nothing funny. about him in Evan the Almighty. <br /> <br /> His 3 children, although probably somehow important for a biblical character, were really useless in the film and terrible actors. Even his wife, it was something like a third stage for such a simple story. <br /> <br /> Spending so much money on making a comedy was a big mistake. Although, Carell's career could benefit from this movie, there is no real reason to go see it. <br /> <br /> If there was only a little less of his family, a little more of Carell, Molly Shannon and maybe some other SNL, it could have been a lot more entertaining. <br /> <br /> 4/10 for some laughs here and there.
