This movie had a couple of funny parts, but for the most part, it made me want to move on and change the DVDs and see "Malibu's" instead, which I had in my own collection. At least he would know that something funny was coming and that he had something to look forward to. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this very low budget movie. And I do not judge a movie by its budget. It simply lacked originality and was too predictable. I would not rent or watch this movie again, and I'm usually a habitual offender of the movie. The actors were forgettable. The story was half thought, and left me with an insatiable need to laugh. I ended up watching Jamie Kennedy's White Boy Gone Gangsta to get the comedy scratched.
