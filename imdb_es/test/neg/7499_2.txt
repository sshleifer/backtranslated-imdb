Am I the only one who thinks this is a bad movie? <br /> <br /> I admit that horror movies often lack things like a great story or a good performance or even good special effects. But the way these deficiencies come together in this movie is surprisingly regrettable. <br /> <br /> Miserable story: the idea of ​​a raped vagina that takes revenge by becoming a man-eater sounds pretty funny, but what the writer stressed is stupid. <br /> <br /> Bad performance: the actors move like puppets. They play and they look like people, who really try hard but do not act completely. <br /> <br /> Bad FX: especially the explosion of the Van seems inexcusably cheap. <br /> <br /> It's surprising that a director who made some good movies during his career changed to such messy things.
