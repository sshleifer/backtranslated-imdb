Amanda Bynes is an enormously talented actress, and I have enjoyed all her roles in the past, especially in the fantastic "She's the Man". For that reason alone, "Sydney White" was a big disappointment to me. The real reason I do not like this movie is the misuse of the characters. In a funny comedy for teenagers, it's perfectly fine to have a cast of all the teen characters based on reality. In "Sydney White", this idea is thrown out the window. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes makes a good Sydney, but she really lacks a lot of what usually makes her shine as an actress. I blame this on the script, which makes his character too insipid and sober, and in the hairdressing / makeup department, which gives him a detestable plastic look and an annoying hairstyle. The seven "fools" that Sydney befriends eventually are much worse. They are so stupid that it is impossible to like them or even respect them as characters. They are essentially repellent gag fodder. As is the "Charming Prince" of the story, which is completely amazing as a character and is as cheesy as possible. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest star in the film (with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes is Sara Paxton, who is actually very good as the intriguing Rachel Witchburn.) It's a shame the screenwriters did not put her a little more gray than black. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically that of "Snow White." What kills is that it is too forceful and obvious, a new imagination.The connections with "Snow White" are presented to us both as Throughout the film, which is ultimately annoying and exaggerated, Prince Charming is unreally charming, the "witch" is too despicably a witch, the seven "fools" are too stupid, and Sydney is too pure of heart. It does not mean that the film is bad, although Bynes is forced by the script, she still has her moments, as does Sara Paxton, who brings physical comedy to the maximum in her scenes. Dinky "is also very fun gone as a character. It's a somewhat funny movie in parts that, ultimately, is too cheesy and clich√©d to recommend.
