Childhood death and horror films will always remain a delicate and controversial combination, so it is my personal opinion that every film that shows the value of turning on this theme should receive additional attention from horror fans. Of course, as in the case of "Wicked Little Things", controversial issues do not always guarantee a good movie. Despite the potentially interesting plot, the atmospheric environment and the participation of the unpleasant video director J.S. Cardone ("The Slayer"), this is an uninspired film full of clichés that could not offer a single shock or surprise. After losing her husband and father, the remaining Tunny women (mother Karen and her daughters Sarah and Emma) move to a small, remote mountain town in Pennsylvania where they inherited a dilapidated old mansion. Their new home is dangerously close to the old ruins of the mine where dozens of innocent children tragically lost their lives in 1913. Strange things begin to happen, like the young Emma who befriends a girl (imaginary?) Who used to live at home The locals seem to keep secrets from Karen and her daughters. It quickly turns out that undead children still leave their graves in the mine at night to seek revenge on the descendants of the mine owner, Mr. Carlton, who was responsible for his death. "Wicked Little Things" is quite docile and extremely predictable. The script blatantly serves up one terrible cliché after another, like the wheels of a car caught in the mud at crucial moments, malfunctioning flashlights and horribly broken wrists. There is very little suspense, even less gore and makeup effects are disappointingly weak. Zombied children do not seem at all threatening. Actually, they all look like miniature versions of Marilyn Manson, with their black suits, pale faces and dark eyes. The emotionless ending is stupid and as derivative as the rest of this production without meaning. Lori Heuring is not very impressive in her main role as a mother, but Scout Taylor-Compton (currently a big star thanks to the remake of "Halloween") and young Chloe Moretz are suitable as daughters.
