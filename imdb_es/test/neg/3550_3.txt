It starts really interesting: the story develops around the main character, who runs a "cleaning business", specializing in the cleaning of crime scenes. As a former police officer, he finds himself in a strange situation, when a job suddenly "officially fades". In addition, he discovers a certain relationship with an investigation into police corruption. His "Columbo Feeling" is justified, the more he goes into the background of the story. The good actors (Jackson, Ed Harris, Eva Mendes) play in a suspense story with some turns, but only until the last 25 minutes. (up to here 7 out of 10 stars). SPOILER :::: Suddenly, the movie loses its touch and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shooting, involving the 14-year-old daughter, a betrayal of friendship and an unjustified justice in the development of the character ... Not having Cutler giving up his investigation for the sake of friendship? Or have the daughter discovering some facts? or ... you can imagine many possible better endings of history ... a final really lost!
