Great actors, good filming, a potentially interesting plot and what should have been a good dialogue. Nothing else is good about this movie. Maybe the writer or director thought they could make a movie that would provoke the reflection of annoying characters that are as deep as a cup of coffee. <br /> <br /> In 10 minutes I did not like Kim's performance so much by Caroleen Feeney that it became a distraction. While Kim is supposed to be an unfriendly character, I'm not sure I wanted to commit acts of physical violence against her. The first (of many) strange things that happen is that Wes (David Strathairn) goes from "I'm missing $ 50.00" to "She stole $ 50" in about 3 seconds. It was quite unlikely, since she (Kim) never had access to her wallet or was a master pickpocket, there simply was no rational reason to suspect her. Most people have lost / lost money and assume that ... we LOSE it. The same goes for Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be (I think) a look at real people. The character of Kim suffered, at least, a bipolar disorder. Wes had enormous problems of inadequacy, Nancy was simply bored and Matt was delirious (particularly about music). In fact, I turned this off about 2/3 of the way through. However, to write a valid comment, I forced myself to wait again with the hope that something would come together in this movie. No, I'm sorry, it was still wrong. Make a point to lose this one.
