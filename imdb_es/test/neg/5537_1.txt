How in the name of decency was this movie made? <br /> <br /> One presumes that the subtitles simply say 'horrible' in every frame of this truly bleak effort. <br /> <br /> Horrible performance, unfortunate dialogue and the lack of talent of all involved in this The nightmare makes an unbearable 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> General impression? <br /> <br /> A group of excitable drama students got lucky with a lottery scholarship and proceeded to make one of the most painful films ever made. <br /> <br /> This makes Hammer Horror television shows look like Oscar material. <br /> <br /> And for a second do not think that this falls into the category "so bad that it's good". It's not even that bad. <br /> <br /> But the scene of the lighting of the farts probably worth another look.
