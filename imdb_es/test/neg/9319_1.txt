Well, I remember when the studio fired Schrader and hired Harlin to re-record this movie, they had every reason to do it. <br /> <br /> Domain: The exorcist's prequel is just a bad movie, it's boring, it really is. <br /> <br /> It would be good to think that the studio put aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who with such big words condemned Harlin's version and praised Schraders, even if no one had ever seen him. It would have been fine. <br /> <br /> But they were not. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: Schrader has no idea what a horror movie should be, and it shows in big time. <br /> <br /> Fun, boring, unintentionally funny in all the wrong places and with a bad support cast. <br /> <br /> Save money and your nerves, do not see it.
