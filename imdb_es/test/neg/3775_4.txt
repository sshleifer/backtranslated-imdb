Veber is not known for his outstanding leadership skills. In fact, no one cares while laughing, many here to be honest, scattered throughout the process, thanks to the characterization of Depardieu's wit and the dialogue that Veber puts in his mouth. <br /> <br /> But this is not enough to make a great comedy, since there is no film outside the usual premise of Veber: a tough guy is condemned to team up with a very naive character. In L'Emmerdeur, La Chèvre or Les Compères there was a real story about fire against water. Le Diner de Cons, although it was a play, managed to create a real suspense about the next catastrophe that Pinon would cause. In Tais-toi, the background story about revenge is redundant and too weak to arouse our interest. In addition, the weights are loose both on the screen and in the script. <br /> <br /> Now what happens? Veber concludes this without creating any action, no rhythm. Instead, he systematically uses and overindulges (he probably met William Goldman in Hollywood) and "music" really emphasizes that lack of nerves and a backbone in the story. <br /> <br /> Therefore, you will have to be happy with Depardieu's performance.
