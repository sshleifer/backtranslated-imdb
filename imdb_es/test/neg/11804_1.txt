The characters are annoying, immature and scaly ... Madison is the most annoying of all. OOH ... a cold place! A threat so serious! Any ghost in that house would have fled in self-defense! To make a long story short, this movie is boring. Seeing a chair flying through a room can be creepy, but that is as intriguing as it seems. I saw it once and when one of my kids wanted to see it again, I was tempted to bring a baseball bat to the TV instead of seeing this crap again. If you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy, this is not it! The only good part of everything was "the cockroach scene" and, at the end of the movie, you ended up feeling sorry for the cockroach!
