I absolutely despise this movie. I wanted to love him, I really wanted to do it. But man, oh man, they were very much in agreement with Sara. And the father who lived was pretty corny. It came out of the Shirley Temple movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend THE BOOK. It's amazing. In the book, Sara is honorable and decent and does the right thing ... BECAUSE IT IS CORRECT. She does not have a spiteful bone in her body. <br /> <br /> In the movie, she is petty and spiteful. She does little things to get back to Miss Minchin. In the book, Sara is above those things. She opposes Miss Minchin. She tells the truth and is not intimidated by her. But she does not do the stupid and malicious things that Sara does in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's really quite unsettling to me that a lot of people here say they loved the book and they love the movie. I can not help but wonder ... did we read the same book? The main objective of the book was personal responsibility, to behave with honor and integrity, to ALWAYS tell the truth and face adversity with calm and integrity. <br /> <br /> Sara has a happy ending in the book, not the ridiculous survival of her father, but the union with her partner who has been looking for her. In the book, this new father figure captivated her and loves her and cares about her and Becky. And Miss Minchin is NOT a chimney sweeper, that part of the movie was really stupid. <br /> <br /> See all these compliments for this miserable movie bothers me. Are we praising a movie that glorifies petty and spiteful behavior with some hat tips to kindness? Sara, in the book, was kind to the bones and full of integrity. I do not even recognize her in the movie ... she is not in it. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Mrs. Burnett is not alive to see this horrible thing. It is horrible and unworthy to take the title of your book.
