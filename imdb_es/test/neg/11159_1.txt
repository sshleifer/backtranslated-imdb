Let's summarize how silly this film is with two details: Arnold al Antichrist: "Let's see who is the worst," he said with a serious face. And you can say that they did not try to be funny. <br /> <br /> How do you think Arnold will fight evil from all evil? <br /> <br /> Holy water, a crucifix, a priest. .nooo! with a bazooka, yes, nor did Satan expect them to be so intelligent. <br /> <br /> After an attractive start (which reminds you of the Devil's Defender) it is not going anywhere. Somebody give me back those two hours of my life. Never look at it, rent it, do not buy it. <br /> <br />
