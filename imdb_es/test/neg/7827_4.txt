Asia Argento is a beautiful and sexy woman who likes to walk naked, which is not bad in itself, but when her character talks about all the types she attends, and to see her with Michael Madsen and an Asian in the present time of the film, it made me feel like I needed a condom over my eyes to see this movie, as if a disease were going to infect me or something. <br /> <br /> The movie felt like it was a movie. Going for a love triangle / drama / action / ??? plot, it just seemed to go everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The performance was great, the plot, not so great. The director needs to at least choose a genre and practice, practice, practice, before trying to do something as complicated as this again, because obviously they are not very good at that.
