"Wild Rebels" was probably a second funny movie on a drive in the triple feature film 40 years ago. It has not aged very well, but it was never thought to age well; obviously it was meant to be a disposable and forgettable fun from the start. Taken at that level, it is a good example of the biker movie genre. <br /> <br /> Several elements help distinguish it from the dozens of similar movies that are being produced at the same time. The 'hero', 'Rod Tillman' (Steve Alaimo) appears as an unimpressive 'Everyman': he is not especially brave, strong, talented or handsome (although he wins a fight with a member of a gang of difficult motorcyclists halfway there the movie, and the female gang member decides to help him over the gang member at the end of the movie). The soundtrack is pretty well done, with a nice bass riff / drum style 'Ventures' that keeps things moving and saxophones and metal tables that animate things a bit. And although the script is quite superficial, all the actors inhabit their cardboard characters convincingly and with a lot of energy. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of careless technical errors: terrible "day by night" scenes that occur in broad daylight, screeching tires in a swamp, fire sirens stuck by mistake in the soundtrack instead of police sirens, a bank sign made out of duct tape on a ceiling plate, a Luger that sounds like a Winchester 30-06, shotgun blasts that cut people 100 yards away, a detective who kills a motorcyclist on a third floor that lands from the ground with a revolver with a 2-inch barrel. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of elements of ridiculous stories: Linda (the girl member of the gang) deactivates a bank guard with a syringe full of drugs, the final shooting takes place inside a lighthouse (!), the police blockades do not really block roads, the police apparently have never heard of ducking, and police detectives apparently never heard of planting bugs or having their man concealed wea connect a cable . <br /> <br /> But the plot sounds good, the cameraman knows what he's doing, the rhythm in most of the scenes is pretty good, and there are some very nice and choppy liners and dialogue changes here and there. that keep the energy level high. (My favorite: "Man, you're playing with private actions!" (That is, Linda) "So no, do not look for this or anything, but if a copy of the MST version should fall into your hands, you should have fun with something good and superficial, vastically superior to "Five the Hard Way" or "The Hellcats" or even "Girl In Gold Boots" (three other films of the cover culture).
