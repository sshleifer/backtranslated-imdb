Woody Allen (whom I confess from the beginning that I've never been a big fan) directed this quasi-documentary about the life of Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a jazz guitarist from the 1930s whose star apparently shone for a while, then quickly. colorless. Penn does a credible job on paper, portraying a complicated and somewhat neurotic man (not unlike Allen himself, which perhaps explains why Woody would be attracted to this project) who can not maintain relationships, and whose passions twins (apart from playing guitar) They would shoot rats in the dumpster and watch trains. <br /> <br /> There is not much coherence in the story. It is narrated in a certain sense by a series of "experts" of jazz today (one of whom is Allen himself), who relate their diverse theories and interpretations of different events in Ray's life. The end result is an extremely inconsistent account of the life of a fictitious man who seems to have received a rather interesting life story from his creators, who probably should have done a better job with her. <br /> <br /> Jazz fans and fans of Woody Allen will probably enjoy this. As for me? The best I can give is a 3/10.
