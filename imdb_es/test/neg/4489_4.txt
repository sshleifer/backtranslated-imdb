Having read this story a while ago, I was very excited to see the movie. I read the book again. It's one of my favorite books by Nicholas Sparks. What I think of what history does are relationships. That was the negative point for me in the movie because I think relationships were poorly expressed in the movie. I have no idea what is the point of changing the roles of the main characters (the characters of Tim and Alan). The film did not capture the relationship of John and Savannah at all. Maybe if you have not read the book, you would like this movie, but I thought it was so boring compared to the book. I thought that Channing was a great choice for John, but I had the feeling that he was going to take all the young adults to see him, so I think he was more oriented towards them. The ending trims the whole point of the book, so I was not happy about that either. I hoped the movie would be more like a notebook or a walk to remember and how they captured the books. I feel like I wasted a Friday night and $ 10 on a sappy love story, not the whole story I was hoping to see.
