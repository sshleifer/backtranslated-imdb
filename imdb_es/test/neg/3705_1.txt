This movie is, in all likelihood, the worst movie ever made. It's certainly the worst I've seen, and I've seen MANY bad movies. <br /> <br /> In this, nothing interesting happens throughout the movie. One could literally start the movie, take a short nap and then wake up safe knowing that nothing interesting has happened while sleeping. And I've seen this movie three times, I wake up all the time. I feel like I should be congratulated. <br /> <br /> The film goes as one might expect, according to a formula, without variation. Hunters capture the baby's big foot, are killed by their parents, and the nearby city suffers a deadly frenzy. This is surprisingly boring for a Troma release. <br /> <br /> So, do yourself a favor and skip this movie. If you have to see it, you will understand why.
