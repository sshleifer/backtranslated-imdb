Does not this seem like something familiar? Oh, wait, that's right. 90% of the jokes in this movie have already been made in the television series. What is the point of repeating, can you ask? Is it for the benefit of Americans who have not seen the program? The writers were left without inspiration? Or maybe everyone on the set suffered a sudden attack of amnesia, and forgot that they had already covered this terrain? Either way, for someone who has sat in the first three series, this was really boring. I had to turn it off during the part of 'tablets that make the water go green' ... yes, it's very funny, but give us something original for the love of God! Actually, if the best thing you can do is to make Leonard Rossiter's decision about the Saturday Night Fever, you can forget it. <br /> <br /> The guy they replaced the late Richard Beckinsale is very similar, but he's not half the actor. Personally I would exorcise the role, as a mark of respect for him. Or better yet, without bothering to make the movie, and just let the hilarity of the television series speak for itself. But no, they could not do that ... not while they had money to win. Really sad 4/10
