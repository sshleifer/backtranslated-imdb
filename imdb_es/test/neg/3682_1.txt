Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back! This is a horror movie, not suspense, not suspense, a horror movie. Yes, this movie is a horror. Horribly bad. After many years of lurking here on IMDb, I was moved to set up an account just so that I (as at least one other critic here) can warn people DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE! IT WILL BASE YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies so bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not smart enough to press the fast forward button. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice on an "enhanced" DVD (there's another horrible thought) to see what the hell they were thinking. The producers had to assume that there were enough imbeciles for the name of Val Kilmer to make this film at least balanced in international distribution. <br /> <br /> I actually had the misfortune of choosing this to watch movies. on request, which did not provide subtitles to the Russian dialogue. It does not matter that much. Trying to listen to the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) just to find out how boring it is, just add insult to injury. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie a "1" because I can not Give it a lower rating, and because it achieved one remarkable thing. Somehow it made an almost totally underground movie NOT feel claustrophobic. Now that is a dubious achievement. <br /> <br /> HERE IS YOUR SPOILER: And the end, Santa Madre (no pun) is as if they had run out of money and simply decided to stop filming. The "climax" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved with the simplest escape I've seen in the movie. Exercise your simple escape mechanism also if you are looking at this: the off button.
