Whoever has thought to have sequels of Iron Eagle must be shot. In this case once was enough. Iron Eagle was a good movie to watch. Although it is not realistic, it is still entertaining. Iron Eagle II has a meaningless plot and can be used to cure insomnia. I did not even bother to see Iron Eagle III, but when looking at the R rating, I assume it's more violent than in the last 2 movies. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the most inane sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. returns as the always charming "Chappy" Sinclair. Another Jason returns to complete the role of Doug Masters (the Canadian Jason Cadieux, who looks like Jason Gedrick since the first Iron Eagle). But wait (Here comes a possible spoiler) ..... Was not Doug killed in Iron Eagle II? The writers must have detached themselves from a story, so they revived Doug Masters by saying he was a prisoner of the Russians. This movie was the cheapest of all the Iron Eagle movies. Why do filmmakers consider it necessary to make unattractive film sequels? (eg films of the police academy). I have always liked the work of Gossett Jr. in these films. He was the only one who held this turkey together. Hopefully this is the last of the sequels of Iron Eagle. Rest in peace.
