Before seeing this film (in a screening attended by the director herself) we were informed that she had won the best short film award at Galway Film Fleadh. Surely this result will give the filmmakers hope, anyone can do better than this! <br /> <br /> How nobody can notice the flagrant scam of Donnie Darko in this I'll never know. The film is pure nonsense, the cardboard that acts, the ridiculous dialogue and the end, simply flat! The only crumb of comfort we enjoyed after seeing this garbage was to comment aloud how terrible it was, in front of the director! Yes, that was bad, but liberating! <br /> <br /> At least the Irish cinema can not go down any more!
