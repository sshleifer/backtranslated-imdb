I live in Rome where the Turkish director of this film lives and works. From my Italian friends I have heard many good things about his films ... so after seeing the preview I really wanted to see "Cuore Sacro". I am deeply disappointed, one of the most pompous, pseudo-religious, highly improbable and naive films. I love movies but this one is really heavy and bad. The main character is really crazy, and should be locked in an asylum ... made me sympathize with the negative character of an aunt, who runs a dirty business that only wants to make money ... and I consider myself an anti-capitalist ... that bad !!!
