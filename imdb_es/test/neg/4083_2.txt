Oh Mr. Carell! How far you have fallen! After a brilliant moment at LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, Steve Carell's film selection is beginning to contrast with what has been happening since then. Although THE 40 YEAR VIRGIN OLD was entertaining, it was dwarfed by its "Sunshine" character. Hoping to find something that would make me throw popcorn by the nose, I decided to rent EVAN ALMIGHTY and see what possible laughs could be expected here. Not much ... <br /> <br /> Given the cliche and cliché script, the whole film felt forced and emotionless. Evan Almighty, trying to value the values ​​of the family and the current decision making of the US government. UU., It tries to put a deep biblical moment in comic terms, but it fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone on Earth knows the story of Noah and The Ark. The wrath of God was brought down with 30 days and nights of rain that flooded the entire planet, while Noah, his family and two of each of His creatures on Earth came out of the humidity in relative comfort through the wooden ark Gopher . It was a great moment in the history of humanity (if you believe in the biblical text). <br /> <br /> So, why does God appear before a man and ask him to build an ark that would only transport animals of the world to a few? Minutes after breaking a dam? The simple answer is that He would never do it. The policy of the United States government was given too much emphasis and not enough in world events, making Evan Almighty a terribly short-sighted film focused on the United States. Although designed as a comedy, it never really reaches anything that comes close to laughter. Maybe some grunts and a smile, but little else. <br /> <br /> John Goodman (CARS) achieves another forced performance as the despicable congressman Chuck Long, whose sole objective is to create development opportunities on national protected properties. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 ITEMS LESS) as God can not help clean up this mess of soaked film. <br /> <br /> The only fun moments are between Carell and the animals, especially when Evan learns how animal magnetism REALLY is. The birds, literally, come to him. Flock of sheep around him. Lions take pride in being close to him (excuse the puns). <br /> <br /> The special effects were fun to watch but they were short (with good reason). The "deluge" was interesting because obviously the Ark was guided by His hand and pushed in the right direction. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, it is nothing but an insult to common sense and intellect.
