Princess Warrior is a science fiction action movie with a rather thin plot: essentially about the death of its queen mother, two sisters, one evil and another good, fight for control of the throne. The good sister is being hit by what escapes to Earth where she appears nude in a strip club in the middle of a wet t-shirt contest. The rest of the movie is basically a long chase scene, since the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger good sister. But the younger sister is helped by Bob, a good-hearted DJ, and everything is complicated by the participation of the police and the ignorance of the good sister of the customs and culture of the Earth. The older sister reaches her younger sister several times, but the latter manages to escape and race again. Throughout this action, there is a women's cult on the home planet that has some type of space age session to get the good sister back. Unfortunately, a good part of this movie seems to be pretty boring scenes of car chases while driving through Los Angeles (and what was the sound effect when the police car crashed?) The movie culminates in another physical fight between the Sisters with a predictable Final. <br /> <br /> It looks like it borrows elements from Star Wars (the lightsabers and the appearance of the planet of origin of the girls in the opening and subsequent scenes), Dr. Who (the phone booth as a means of transport) and some of the disguises (of the cult on the home planet) could have been taken from Star Trek episodes. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Dana Fredsti (the evil sister in the movie) in another user comment mentioned "the endless (and boring) wet t-shirt contest." It's seriously the longest wet t-shirt contest in the film history, and the only one where the contestants were wearing industry-resistant polyester and polyester shirts that defied all efforts to wet them and make them translucent. " I could not say it better. The only thing I would add is that the music in this scene is simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is quite exaggerated, but it seems to fit the whole style of the movie. The actors who played Vinnie and Vito were too much for me, I just found them annoying. Mrs. Fredsti (Curette) seemed to have fun and not take the whole thing too seriously, in contrast to Sharon Lee Jones, who acted decently, but seemed to be taking everything more seriously. All the cops were portrayed as clumsy idiots, presumably to add comic relief, which is a bit unnecessary, given that the whole movie was pretty comical. <br /> <br /> From the ratings perspective, this movie had a lot of foul language; some topless women and others dressed sparsely with straps, but do not have enough skin to satisfy those looking for nudes; a sex scene that was portrayed in an artistic non-graphic dreamlike way; and little violence, although there were threats of violence at all times, the scenes of sword fights and fights were exaggerated, and too camouflaged to be "offensive", although it seemed that the actors were having a lot of fun with it. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder who came up with the names of the characters? Ovule (a small egg), Curette (a surgical instrument used to scrape and clean), Exzema (suspiciously similar to a disease characterized by skin peeling and pruritus), Bulemia (an eating disorder with bingeings and purges) and Rickettsia (another disease) ? <br /> <br /> In general, this is a sci-fi action movie, bad, low budget, but it kept me entertained, although I might need a few drinks before seeing it again.
