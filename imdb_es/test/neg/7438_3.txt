This movie is a good example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a good movie at all costs. Only with this movie, it really is a near miss. Everything seems to be in place for Robocop 2 to be a worthy follow-up to the first innovative film. The entire original cast (apart from the victims, naturally) comes back and gives it the best. Pity that a trite script and an incompetent director neutralize their efforts. <br /> <br /> Irvin Kershner could have been the ideal candidate for George Lucas to lead the Empire Strikes Back. For a pedestrian filmmaker like Kershner, there's not much to ruin in Lucas's uninspired movie series. A worthy successor to a classic such as Robocop would have required Paul Verhoeven to return, or a director with enough talent to give him his own touch. Kershner does not know how to give his own turn to anything (Lucas hired him for that) and surely it is not Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Then, what we get here is a film that reviews all the movements to replicate the first film, but without the freshness, humor or audacity that the original had. Kershner probably thought he could beat Verhoeven by adding more bloody and gratuitous violence, but instead reveals how much he worked as a hired director instead of a passionate filmmaker. And that's a shame, since everything was in place to make this other classic. As mentioned, the actors do their best, but Phill Tippet offers some innovative stop-motion effects and there are some great ideas in the story of Frank Miller, who was born to write a Robocop movie. I wish the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to make all the potential manifest.
