When I was young, I woke up early every Saturday morning, not to watch cartoons but to activate the local channel for what was called 'Kung Fu Theater'. It was not as if these films were works of art. It was not as if all these films were from China, Japan, Korea or any particular country; If the story had to do with fighting? Is it a game of swords or punches? And if the fight did not look like anything that was happening in any kind of American gymnastics, then that was good enough. It was not as if they really were very good. They were simply excellent action movies with incredibly dramatic music, in which the hero reaped his revenge on a lot of bad guys, and then the credits would roll. <br /> <br /> "Sword in the Moon" is very similar to these films of my youth, possibly a bit of a thematic backlash given a nice twist to muddling the characters enough to make it increasingly difficult distinguish the bad from the good. <br /> <br /> Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as 'the human butcher'. He kills quickly and mercilessly in the name of the Chun dynasty, the chief bodyguard of an emperor who spared his life and that of his men in exchange for his service. However, an equally ruthless rebel and his charming companion appear on the field and begin to murder imperial ministers, and Yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them. His task becomes one of personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are Choi (a friend of his past) and his former love, Shi Yeong. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the "Sword" does not have much to do. Distinguish yourself from other action movies. Some dazzling cinematography is almost completely wasted in a poor quality edition, with parts of the film so freely united that it is hard to believe that what inevitably came to the film was what anyone intended. While the atmosphere and the story tend to gravitate towards a dark mood, the tone is almost sacrificed to the endless parade of flashbacks, as each of the main characters receives a healthy story arc. What should have been a quick and easy action movie is overloaded by too much personal baggage, and the film suffers as a result. <br /> <br /> I have read that this film marks Korea's first real foray into the world of art house action pieces, such as "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". Next time, I strongly suggest that the producers keep a little more "martial art" and a little less "art".
