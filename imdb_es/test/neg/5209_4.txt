The Island of Death is not really a good movie, from any point of view, but it is curious. Imagine if the Natural Born Killers had been made 20 years earlier, like a Greek porn movie by Eurotrash. That's what you get here: the picturesque story of a young British sociopathic couple making their way through the population of a small Greek island. <br /> <br /> I will spare you a detailed breakdown of the plot; it is not really important, except to create increasingly perverse or violent sex scenes, followed by disturbingly brutal murders, often lovingly photographed for posterity by our lovely young couple. It could have been brilliant, in its own sickly and unpleasant form, but instead ... <br /> <br /> Instead, I found myself impatiently reviewing the execution time and the chapter index to see how much more I was going to last the last parade. The slow rhythm and the apathetic and insipid performance make even the vilest perversities become pablum, and the connected scenes become an eternity of boring nightmares. Ah good. You can not win them all.
