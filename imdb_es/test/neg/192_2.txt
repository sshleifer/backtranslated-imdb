The sadness was the emotion I felt, after the screen went dark. Perplexed, it was another. Why would two seasoned screen veterans like Matthau and Lemmon join this putrid project? I have the impression that they did not read the script before the cameras began to roll. All the cast is wasted, in this movie without grace, uninteresting and unimpressive. Unfortunately, this was one of the last projects of the elegant Edward Mulhare, here as the heavy one. Dyan Cannon tries, Hal Linden looks bored, Donald O'connor recites some lines laden with blasphemy. (?? !!). I'm not with the "Legion of Decency." What I want to say is that they were thrown only because of the strangeness of listening to him using a faded language. It is a desperate attempt to infuse "humor" into an image. However, he actually provided the only entertainment snack of the movie when he started dancing on the dance floor. I keep my criticism tougher for drivers. Walter Matthau should have known better. He still offers great solo performances (IQ, Dennis The Menace, etc.). His character, although affable, is quite boring and one-dimensional. I've seen it once, I've seen it all. Jack Lemmon gives another of his trademark, tearful, "just too sensitive" male representations. When he starts that mode, indirectly I want to give him a box of tissues. OUT TO SEA is painfully inopportune, and whoever has produced this mess must be made to walk on the board.
