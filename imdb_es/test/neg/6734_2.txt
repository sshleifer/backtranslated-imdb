Since I am from Norway (one of the ten richest countries in the world), it was very funny to see how we used trucks from the 50s and lived in medieval houses. And since we have very strict laws regarding guns, it was fun to see how many guns there were actually in Norway during the five minutes of gunfire there. Mr. Direct-to-video even managed to bring his muffler in the short term, so he must have powerful friends in customs. <br /> <br /> Please do at least some research before going to an "exotic" country guys: you can hurt the feelings of the old fans. <br /> <br /> Sverre: fan of old hurt feelings.
