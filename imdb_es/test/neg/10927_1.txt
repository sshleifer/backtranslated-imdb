This conglomerate fails so miserably on all levels that it is difficult to decide what to say. It does not deserve a line, much less ten, but to comply with the IMDb rules, here it goes and probably will not be successful the first time and I have to write a bit more to compensate the acceptance of this presentation. LOL <br /> <br /> If I had seen this mess during the 70s while going through my mushroom phase, I would still have considered it unimaginative and superficial. The most exciting opportunity for me was the possibility that the elevator door would open and close. I was on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> A person here wrote that he had met the creator of this disaster. As if that was a day of red letters in his life. You can only pray for something much more exciting to happen in the life of those posters. Hold on, friend.
