My brother and I are big fans of Asian movies, so when I found this movie hidden in a store, I bought it on DVD, because it sounded very promising and I could not wait to see it. So I saw this movie with my brother and I must say that at the beginning it was very promising. Both of us really loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene. But I guess that was it. There are some interesting fights, but it's not an action movie, as he claims to be. Instead, it's a love movie ... with the cliche of love so extremely played on top, even Shakespeare would throw up in this title. I'm sorry for my language. By the way: the characters act as if they were picked up from the street and given 100? to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, my brother and I saw it until the end, because we think it can only be better. But, heck, he never did. This film questioned the number 1 spot on the list of "worst movies ever seen" of me and my brothers, only followed by "Fantasy mission force", do not look at this either.
