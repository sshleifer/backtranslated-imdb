This movie probably started with a good idea, but that's it. When I read the cover on Blockbuster, I thought I had a promise, but that was based on the general idea of ​​the movie. The movie started with a teacher talking about how in the future we can see creatures of other dimensions. There was no explanation of how that would happen, but it's okay, I thought it would develop in the movie. It was not In the next scene we see two young people lying on tables with tubes stuck to their heads. Next to each one there are two attractive women. Men begin to ask "Do you hear that?" Or "Do you see them?" We conclude that they believe they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seems invisible or that they are hallucinating. Women do not see these creatures. This was fine for the first five minutes, BUT THIS SCENE IS ALLOWED FOR A COMPLETE HOUR. It is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation with the so-called "plot" of the film. They also introduce us to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be terrorists from the Middle East. What is this about? We never found out The flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people, but we never understand why. At the end of the film, the terrorists finally do what the terrorists do. They exploit the laboratory, but why? What is the point? We have no idea This film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to list, but one more remarkable is the fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist enter and leave the room throughout the film and do not make a single only time to young people. Men try to escape or even leave the tables they are sitting on, even if they are not tied! The creators of the film also bring apparitions of cockroaches on several occasions, but once again we never learn what that has to do with history. I'm sorry, but this movie was a waste of $ 4 and the time I spent driving to the rental store and then watching it. Take my advice Do not rent it
