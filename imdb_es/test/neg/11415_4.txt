The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia's "Nine Lives" occurs when Sissy Spacek, hidden in a hotel room where she has an affair with Aiden Quinn, finds a documentary about nature on television, at which point Quinn notices the idea of such things. - Separate images are edited in a scene, predators and prey are thrown together to capture the moment, all to force connections where none really exists. The characters in the nine short films that make up this film occasionally extend to the stories of others, but none of them seems to really connect. A woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is then seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy. A man who meets an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been then hosts, with his current wife, a dinner for an unhappy couple. García organizes some of his characters facing each other, but none of the subsequent stories is really based on what came before. <br /> <br /> Garcia's first film, the wonderful, overlooked "Things you can count on just by looking at" In It, "it also had a short story structure and superimposed characters, but there were fewer of them and they had much more space to breathe and grow in. The sophisticated premise of "Nine Lives", which each of its nine stories is told in a single, uninterrupted shot in real time, never allows the film to accumulate any real dramatic tension or impulse. It's a pretty visually ugly movie, the interior shots are often dark and hard to see, while other scenes, especially one in which a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parents, becomes annoying for the work of the camera, since this is Garcia's third film and that has a respectable address history for television, the direction in this film is surprisingly García (son of Gabriel García Márquez), like his film partner and great writer Rebecca Miller, focuses on the aspects of writing and the character of his films, often to the detriment of the movies. <br /> <br /> The individual scenes are touching and even affecting. I liked that Jason Issacs kissed the belly of Robin Wright Penn. And Joe Mantegna whispers lovingly to his wife as she slides into sedation before surgery. And Sissy Spacek is stealing some happy moments of her life with Aiden Quinn before returning with a call from her daughter. But the movie (unlike "Things you can say just by looking at it") is more like an exercise than a real drama. We're just watching people act.
