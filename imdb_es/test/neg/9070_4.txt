The attractive husband and wife writing team Robert Wagner (as Joel Gregory) and Kate Jackson (as Donna Gregory) arrive at the spooky mansion of the actress "Lorna Love" (actually, the house of the silent movie star Harold Lloyd ). Mr. Wagner and Mrs. Jackson have a contract to write the biography of the silent movie star. Wagner has a personal interest in the project, since his father was once the lover of the famous star. Mysterious events develop, and Jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde, who is "perfectly preserved" in a crypt on the farm; Also, the evil woman seems determined to own her husband and murder Jackson! <br /> <br /> This is largely a variation of "The Dark Shadows Night," co-starring former "Dark Shadows" alumnus Kate Jackson, who knows and does her part well. Robert Wagner lacks the intensity of David Selby. Sylvia Sidney (as Mrs. Josephs) eludes Grayson Hall. Marianna Hill is no match for Lara Parker (or Diana Millay). Bill Macy (as Oscar Payne) is good in a role that would have been played by John Karlen (in a Dan Curtis production). <br /> <br /> There are cameos friezes by Joan Blondell, John Carradine and Dorothy Lamour. . The delivery of Mrs. Lamour resembles Joan Bennett, which raises the question: why the producer Aaron Spelling did not get more than the usual customers of "Dark Shadows"? <br /> <br /> Director E.W. Swackhamer was the husband of Bridget Hanley; He worked with Mrs. Blondell on "Here Come the Brides", and with Jackson on "The Rookies". "Death at Love House" has, possibly, a more closed story than the movie "The Night of Dark Shadows"; it differs in the angle of the movie star; and, in its finale of "Father Eternal Fire", it is more like the story of the TV series "Laura the Phoenix". <br /> <br /> **** Death at Love House (9/3/76) E.W. Swackhamer ~ Robert Wagner, Kate Jackson, Sylvia Sidney
