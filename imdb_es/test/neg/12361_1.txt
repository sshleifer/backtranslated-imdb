Somehow, I really thought that I would enjoy this movie because I love the images with mountaineering and a great mystery in the plot. I must say that the photography was fantastic and that there were some scary scenes that caught my attention. I thought that Nicole Eggert, (Diana Pennington), "Thank you, good evening," '01 played a very convincing role when she was a girl who suffered a tragic loss in her life and meets some characters who want her to lead them. Up on the mountain. Marc Singer, "Angel Blade", '02, played a very unconvincing weird guy and acted in many scenes with a bad temper that seemed comical. This movie was a big disappointment and it's not worth watching, unless there's nothing on TV to ENJOY!
