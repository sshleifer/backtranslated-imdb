A giant praying mantis wakes up from its sleep in the Arctic region and heads south causing havoc. Boats, planes and trains meet the flying creature. Before unleashing his full wrath in New York, the mantis finds its doom at the hands of the armed forces in a tunnel in New York. The special effects are, of course, raw by today's standards, but for a ten-year-old boy in 1957 this was very memorable. <br /> <br /> Protagonists are William Hopper, Craig Stevens, Alix Talton and Pat Conway.
