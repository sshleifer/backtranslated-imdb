An American family moves to the countryside of Spain to live in an isolated house. Regina (Anna Paquin), the teenage daughter of Mark (Iain Glen), who is ill and has some mental problems, and the nurse Maria (Lena Olin), points out that rare things are happening in the house and with her younger brother Paul ( Stephan Enquist), but his mother does not believe in her. Reggie decides to investigate with her boyfriend Carlos (Fele Martínez) the origins of the house, and discover that forty years ago, the place was the scene of the death of six children. Reggie decides to ask for help from his grandfather Albert (Giancarlo Giannini) to protect his brother from the house and his father. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD hoping to see a good horror movie of the haunted house mainly due to the names of Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Fele Martinez (from "Thesis" and "Open Your Eyes") and Giancarlo Giannini Also, I really like Spanish cinema. In spite of that, I found a terrible script, a horrible direction and a deplorable performance of excellent actors and actresses. The intention of the story is good, slightly remembering "The Shinning" at times, but unfortunately it is poorly developed, never being clear, for example, the reasons and reasons why the American family moved to Spain or the relationship horrible among the members Of the family, mainly the situation between Maria and Reggie. The direction is confusing, badly trying to use the darkness and the shadows to give a terrifying effect to the story. I love Anna Paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this movie. Lena Olin is a caricature of the great actress she is; and Stephan Enquist is too weak for such an important role. Only Fele Martínez has a good performance in his supporting character. I liked the open end of the story. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Sétima Vítima" ("The seventh victim")
