What else can I add? This is without doubt one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Terrible acting, a silly script, a tediously slow step, even visible microphones that hang from the top of the screen. I could go on, but I really can not be bothered. I watched this for 90 minutes before the feeling of losing the will to live became too big for me. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the first set of comments and votes were from people related to the promotion of this insult to British cinematography. <br /> <br /> And what's worse, I had to buy the Mail on Sunday to get it :-) The only reason why the DVD has not been re-implemented as a roller coaster is that it now occupies a place Featured in my collection of the 10 worst movies in history. <br /> <br /> Definitely, one that should be avoided.
