In my continuous search to find the worst movie of all time, my friends and I came across this little gem. It's a lot of fun, especially if you do not know (as we did not) that it's a semi-sequel to another horror series. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to enter the plot except to mention that everyone complains about the horrible snow storm that was coming (it was equivalent to the characters who just shouted "EXPECTATION!" to the camera and they waved their arms), and, in some strange twist of fate, the snowstorm occurs. I guess the budget problems. <br /> <br /> Add that to a magic door that opens or closes according to the effect of fear that the director wants to create and the electricity that is being cut until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with lots of soap. I admit it I had trouble breathing at some points. <br /> <br /> The only really decent part of this movie, it turned out, was from the original movie Slumber Party Massacre. It's much more fun now that I know. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * The end, where it is revealed that the killer did it because his drunken friends stumbled upon her and a friend who kissed and then A friend who drives a train or something is probably the origin of the most funny psychopathic killers in history, accentuated by the fabulous use of blurry images and archives. I'm glad that all the friends of the slasher forgot the incident completely until a flashback was necessary. <br /> <br /> Run, do not walk, to pick this up and see the hilarity. Of course, the continuity editor should receive a prize for all this, if they were not caught in that horrible snowstorm ...
