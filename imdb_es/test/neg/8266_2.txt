Definition of a documentary: a work, such as a film or a television program, that presents a political, social or historical theme in an objective and informative manner and that often consists of real news films or interviews accompanied by narrations. The keyword here is informative. I love They Might Be Giants, and I barely learned anything about them. <br /> <br /> The interviews with all the celebrities were pretty useless. I do not care what Sarah Vowel thinks of anyone and Syd Straw was downright irritating. And is it to listen to people recite TMBG lyrics as if they were supposedly fun / interesting? It was not any. I think that was the problem: the film spends some time discussing TMBG's love for coffee. And that?? Millions of people love coffee. Was the presentation of the material fun? Do not! There were indications that both men are married, but never discussed. And what about the solo material they did? What motivated them to do it? These types of questions are not addressed or answered. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on with the negative aspects. I found the segment in Dial-a-Song very interesting. If you want information about They Might Be Giants, just buy some CDs and listen. Seriously. This movie is a gigantic disappointment. I can not believe that so many people have given him an 10. Incredible.
