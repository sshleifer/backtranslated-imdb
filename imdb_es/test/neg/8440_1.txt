This was the most tragic movie heap I have ever witnessed. Not only was the name a completely wrong name, since the film has almost nothing to do with piranhas, but the performance is as hollow and ancient as the attempt to make some kind of argument. When you watch this movie, you can not avoid passing the second interrogation when you have had enough and it is time to turn it off. Unfortunately I waited until the end in my case. They are two hours of my life that I can never recover.
