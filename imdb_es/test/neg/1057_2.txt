(Warning: some spoilers ahead). <br /> <br /> What an incredibly horrible movie. It makes Iron Eagle 2 look good. <br /> <br /> The story goes like this: Captain Holiday (Rutger Hauer) is shot down by his friend Banning (Robert Patrick) to prevent him from toppling an Iraqi plane full of innocent civilians. Six years later, Holiday returns to take revenge. Among other things, he, sitting in a tank, pursues Banning (now colonel) and his pregnant wife in a field. He manages to shoot shells and drive the tank at the same time. After the bazooka blows up the tank, he miraculously survives and steals a fighter plane. With it he topples several Allied fighters before attacking NATO headquarters in an attempt to kill Banning's wife. <br /> <br /> An additional advantage is that Major Baxter (whom Holiday hangs in his office) has put the Badge rank on his right shoulder backwards. Elegant.
