I managed to avoid reading Hemingway in college. From what I could see, along with his reductivist verbiage, he offered reductive narrative lines. This film-transfiguration of AF2A in a simplistic, gray and elaborate narrative, does not deter me from my suspicions: a boy who hardly sees action on the European battlefield (Hudson) meets a nurse (Jones), and they conspire to spend time together. The great contribution of Hemingway to the narrative was the romantic trip? Who knows what these two lovers have in common? They are so completely generic. The film never shows the absolute irresponsibility that is needed to leave the front in favor of an adventure of lovers. Both have a season in the Alps, directly from a J. Crew catalog. A series of better scenes are undermined by a conventional and corny melodrama elsewhere. The film continues to accumulate tiny details, improbable and unspecific that fight the epic treatment. The cavernous hospital in which Miss Barkley works is practically empty, so that no secondary plot can possibly divert attention from the weak main story. Complicated, it is not. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is better than average, with some amazing location photographs. Director Charles Vidor (or maybe Huston?) Does amazing things in the first hour with a wide-screen camera in place ... there are no copies of the second unit. Vidor shows huge panoramic paintings, trays on a line of hundreds of soldiers that cross the mountains; and then, with a 90 degree turn of his camera, he reaches Hudson's ambulance falling on him. <br /> <br /> Hudson looks great. It is a better actor than it is credited, but with material without form like this, it can become very mechanical. Mercedes McCambridge plays a one-dimensional shrew. Jennifer Jones is swollen and moody in mediocre female leadership. The movie is better when it is off the screen. The scenes of love are as affective as a coffee commercial.
