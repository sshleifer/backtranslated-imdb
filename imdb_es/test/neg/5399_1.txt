Was this supposed to be a comedy? The black cape and the skeleton mask are hilarious. There is like zero plot. The movie starts with an archaeologist and his assistant. They make a small mention of their dig site being cursed. And then, behold, here is ...... in drops Man Halloween costume, dressed in the shiny black cape, with a skeleton mask, holding an ax. Then, he kills these two people. Then we go out into the forest with a bad imitation of Predator, only the Halloween Commander is hunting the commandos and now he's riding a horse! More commands appear, but these people are supposed to disguise themselves as a group of hikers. Yes, the production probably ran out of command suits. Can you say, under budget? Anyway, they run into an old lonely Indian sitting in the woods. It's too funny. And he starts babbling about something, but you really do not know what he's talking about, so they remember that some Indians were killed. None of that really makes sense. And then we go back to our commands, where they kill more of them. And that's basically the plot. It's so ridiculously bad, you really can not look the other way because you want to see how low it sinks. You can make the same movie with a camcorder, a Halloween costume and a group of friends with fake weapons. Do not see this if you want a horror movie. If you want a comedy, maybe? Or simply omit it and get something like the real Predator.
