I saw this movie on video with my younger brother a long time ago, despite the fact that I was a child with a hearing disability. I did not have the subtitle decoder hidden at that time (it was 1986, the year of The Transformers: The Movie), but I could follow the plot and understand what is happening. It was not my fault to have seen the animated film aimed at the girls. My father rented the video to show it to my other younger sister. <br /> <br /> A decade later, and I rented the video (for 50 cents) to see it again with activated captioning. My memories of this movie were completely destroyed by nothing less than a WRITTEN WRITER. I have seen many poorly written films (such as COOL AS ICE and JASON GOES HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY), but I have never seen (or heard) such bad dialogues, just flooded with enough madness to make your head turn from laughing in Hysteria and screaming for the pain of enduring the torture of sitting through this movie. Despite the good plot and intriguing concepts of the story, the script must be ONE OF THE WORST WRITINGS FOR THE SCREEN, NO BAR! The incompetent Howard R. Cohen should never work as a screenwriter, professional or not. I can not believe that, in the first place, they allowed the terrible script to produce a movie like this one. Did the Japanese producers read the script, in broken or translated English before they knew what they were? Even garbage like G.I. Joe The Movie and My Little Pony The Movie have redeemable values ​​compared to this abomination. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of the 80s animation, or you're just making a nostalgic trip, BEWARE OF RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER! It does not matter if you were outraged or traumatized by the movie carelessly animated with a horribly written script, or if you have not seen the movie, STAND OUT OF THIS MOVIE. The film should be watched with the precaution of learning NOT to write a bad script.
