I never saw the other two "Ninja" movies and, as far as I know, they know each other, but for some reason I saw this one. This starts pretty fast as this ninja goes on a super kill. It is almost unstoppable, since it takes a lot of bullets to knock it down. However, he is not out for counting, since he ends up owning a woman and then continues his ways of killing, using her as his tool. Another ninja enters the fray and, apparently, the only way to kill a ninja is with another ninja, so he volunteers. This leads to a great battle at the end when the dead ninja returns to his body and they have him in a total war. It sounds better than it really turned out to be, but at least it was not boring.
