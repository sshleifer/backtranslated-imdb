Oh my. Oh, this is a really bad movie. The acting is absolutely atrocious, the script is frightening and the photography is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie stand out, however, is that you never worry about a single soul ... Good or bad boy, alive, dying or dead, in the full 87 minutes. "Oh, did he die? ... I thought they would." Was the best reaction I could muster after each murder. The characters are so white or black that with the volume turned off, you could still find out who was who. While the voices of the cast had a strange monotonous quality, their faces give the impression that you are watching an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow movements, exaggerated frowning and "pensive looks". Each character is a pony of a single one-dimensional trick, without humor and without passion. once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco that demanded its creation, they are summarily dismissed. <br /> <br /> It made me think vaguely of what would happen if Thomas Borch Nielsen (director / writer of "Skyggen", American title: "Webmaster") decided to make a low budget version of "American Psycho" and It distracted on the way. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly frightening movie; The cold and passionless cast assures that. It is not an offensive movie; The director plays it so sure that nobody could find it like that. It is, simply and, after all, a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. We were not so lucky and we really paid to see this pump in Pay-per-View. As part of my penance, I am writing this review. <br /> <br /> I already said.
