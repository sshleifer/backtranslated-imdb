The acting was very bad. You had Costas Mandalar acting as the brother of most Rangers of Triple H, a resemblance to Scott McMahon as his representative whom I suppose you should worry about, but there is no emotional involvement anywhere. You have the stupid lesbian, I have nothing against lesbians, not just the stupid ones who keep running with a grunge-style shirt and hat that keeps asking if anyone saw their lover dead. <br /> <br /> The villain could be scary and there is a morality story somewhere about trying to fight against age and death, but he is lost in this movie. Costas Hurst Helmsley points out that the next victims will be the way back to the city, while obviously there are city lights behind him. <br /> <br /> Also a bad pronunciation of Ed Gein, but Gine pronounced it. As a citizen of Wisconsin. We have had our share of Monsters Gein, Dahmer and McCarthy, but if you are going to use it, pronounce well. <br /> <br /> God, why do I see all these terrible movies? Oh, yes, I am a glutton for punishment and I see them so you do not have to.
