Spoilers ahead JEEEEEEEESUSSSSSSSSSSS .... I have a saying: "Insecticides kill insects and Moronicides kill imbeciles ..." The "ghost" in this movie kills imbeciles. Several of the people who die in this movie are actually REQUESTING to be killed, upon encountering abandoned houses, chasing ghosts, etc. ... <br /> <br /> In a strictly cinematographic aspect, this film is really bad. . The three lines of the story are shown parallel and, suddenly, we learn that they are separated by at least a few days. It's a cheap shot ... <br /> <br /> Also, "emotions" are so cheap, they're laughable. Even "Nightmare on Elm Street" did not fall so low as to show that someone is being attacked by his own sweater ... it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Save money, stay at home and you will not have anything. A grudge against the filmmakers ..
