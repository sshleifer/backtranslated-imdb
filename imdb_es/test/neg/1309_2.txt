Miscast, misdirected and atrociously written, this can be seen if you have an hour or two to kill or you are suffering from insomnia, but only fairly. Robert Carlyle fully realizes his potential as an actor of supreme mediocrity with a single expression of his repertoire (that of a soccer hooligan with chronic constipation who looks after a paralyzing inferiority complex), which he sometimes manages to alter slightly by raising his nostrils and a row. of slanted yellow teeth (this indicates rage, tenderness, pain, surprise, horror, hilarity, compassion, etc.) In his role as "the best marine engineer in the United Kingdom" and the son of a university professor, he is as convincing as the My neighbor Tom Courtenay's cat, equally grumpy, dragging his feet and messing up every line, seems to be permanently loaded with his eyes, and it seems that he would no longer be able to distinguish a flood from a puddle of his own urine if he were standing on it. All in all, another foolish attempt on the part of the British to imitate the pulp of Hollywood in its greater waste. Dialogue is a series of badly thrown cliches; the action is disjointed; The plot is useless and amputated; and the characters, if you can call them that, do not even become the basic two-dimensional sphere of their American counterparts.
