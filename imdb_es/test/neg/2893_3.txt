This is a really bad movie. However, it is good to laugh at horrible ideas and "special" effects. The plot centers around an EU space agency that discovers a tenth planet orbiting directly in front of Earth. They send a manned mission (they have been on Mars and have not yet discovered this planet? Is someone stupid enough to fall into this?) On the planet and you can believe it, it is the mirror image of the planet from which they come. Almost everything is predictable from that point. Honestly, from the title of the movie you can guess almost everything. The only surprising thing here is a manned space program managed by Eurpoeans :) There really can be no excuse for the concept of plot or execution. So it's good to laugh or maybe if you're in an altered state of consciousness.
