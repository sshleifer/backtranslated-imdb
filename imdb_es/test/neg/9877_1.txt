I'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here. The first is from the point of view of whether someone sees the movie and never reads (and may never read) the book. The second is from someone who has done it. <br /> <br /> (Film without a book) From the point of view of a movie, it was a good movie. Nothing as good as any of the hells, but much better than the UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking about the plot either. The visual effects were doubtful in many of the parts, although the transformation of the wolf was very pleasant. The characters have very little development and Vivian did not seem to mind that her "love" killed what was left of her kind. Some of the other characters may have had more time in the air, like The Five. The plot was similar to Underworld for my tastes. <br /> <br /> (Film WITH book) As many have said, apart from the title, the names of the characters and some minor parts, the film and the book are nothing like it. In the film, Gabriel was much older and was the father of Rafe (therefore, Astrid was his companion). In the book, Gab was around 24 years old, had never paired with anyone since the wolves mate for life (Astrid is trying to win her affection) and Astrid was Ulf's mother, not Rafe's. Another important thing is the location. The book took place in Riverview, Maryland. Also, why they moved from West Virginia is very different. The movie has to be Vivian's fault and her whole family was killed because of that. In the book, the original leader of The Five, called Axel, killed a girl from his school. The hunters tracked the wolves and killed many of them (including Viv's father), forcing them to move. In addition, Viv's mother, Esme was a main character. <br /> <br /> One thing in the book that would have improved the movie would have been the "bitch dance". For those who do not know, is the test in which all the bitches (females of the pack) fight to see who is the one who will be the companion of the new leader (since before there was a fight for the males). Vivian won it, trying to save her mother from Astrid (who is a horrible evil woman in the book) and therefore she was supposed to mate with Gab. There was no prophecy! Anyway, if you've read the book and you liked it, I suggest you DO NOT watch this movie.
