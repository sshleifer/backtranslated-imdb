This was obviously a low budget movie. It is shown in each scene. What is good to see is where it was made. Much of the film was shot in Columbia, CA, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, near Sonora, CA. Part of the film was also shot in Jamestown, California, very close to Columbia. There is a railroad museum in Jamestown and they used some of the old trains in the picture. "High Noon" was also shot in Jamestown, as was "Back to the Future III".
