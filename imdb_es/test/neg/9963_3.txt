I'm working on the Horror Classics 50 movie package collection and THE MAD MONSTER is one of the movies on set. <br /> <br /> I am sure that George Zucco was a good actor; but, this was only the second movie I saw, the first was DEAD MEN WALK, in which he played two parts. However, even a good performance could not save THE MAD MONSTER. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays a mad scientist, Dr. Cameron (who was expelled from the academy due to his unethical and inhumane experiments). He believes that he can control evolution by highlighting the characteristics of one animal in another. <br /> <br /> In this case, like many others of its kind, it is a transfusion of (I guess) wolf blood into humans. Its goal is to create an invincible army, which he can control through the antidote. The subject of his experiments is his hand contracted, a delayed gardener, whose dialogue slows down this classic snail rhythm to almost a point. <br /> <br /> Beyond his experiments, Dr. Cameron also plans to take revenge on those who discredited him, using his transformed gardener. However, he loses control of his subject, who begins to transform without transfusion, alas! <br /> <br /> The werewolf transformations are Hollywood's classic action / makeup effects. Without a doubt these were the pioneering techniques of the time; But, in today's digital age, it is difficult to imagine audiences scared by this.
