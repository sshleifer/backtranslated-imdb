This movie can not be serious because it has a nerdy-looking boy named Curtis who is killing people. The other two psychopathic children are a little cute, but that boy Curtis is so ugly because he wears these huge brown and ugly glasses. The actor probably wandered on the wrong set and was really supposed to go to Revenge of the Nerds. <br /> <br /> Another thing I hate a lot about this movie is that Curtis takes his sweet moment of shooting people. I kept my finger on the fast forward button because it took too long and what was going on with his voice? It sounded like he was fourteen years old and not ten. Another thing he hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and that did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Then they put that annoying child in the freezer and somehow found a flashlight there. That did not make any sense and neither did the music. The music did not fit any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, boring and a waste of time. Watch a different movie on your birthday.
