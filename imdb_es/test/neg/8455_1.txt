This movie just happened to be on HBO yesterday, so I saw it. This was a mistake. I guess I got caught and kept looking, although it was like a train crash, terrible, horrible, but somehow you can not look away. shaudenfraud I suppose! ; ). <br /> <br /> This is the story of a photo shoot for models on some Caribbean island. One by one, they are all killed. One drinks liquid to clean, one is blown up in a waverunner, one goes down a cliff ... so they are NOT accidents, but for some inane reason the police are never called and nobody thinks that maybe they should "wrap" the filming and returning home, not only out of respect for the dead, but perhaps out of fear of their own lives. No. They just continue with their shooting because THAT is the most important thing. Forget the dead models, we have a magazine to produce! <br /> <br /> One of the secondary arguments is the owner of Evil magazine, played by Lee Majors, Rex is his name. He is the most obvious suspect and every time a model is killed, he turns his mustache and says "well, I can not say that this is not good for sales", so it is very absurd. Another secondary argument is when it is revealed that Rex is one of the models of baby daddy, only when he found out about the baby that tried to convince the girl to have an abortion. She did not, but she always bothered to suggest it. <br /> <br /> They try to give you false clues and point to a guy named Raule, apparently because he is the only one with an accent and "looks creepy". <br /> <br /> At the end (sorry for spoiling it, but this movie came out years ago, so if you have not seen it already ...) one of the women was found face down in the pool. THIS was the last straw !!!! Vanessa Angel, forget her characters the name comes to Rex with a gun, they fight, the gun shoots and now SHE is also dead. While she is lying on the floor, her business partner tells her that with all this bad press the magazine will be worth it. yes and everything is your fault. He has him sign the magazine for him. Once it does voila! All the dead models come back to life and you discover that everything was a trick to go back to Rex. <br /> <br /> Oy! What a ridiculous movie. As someone else said; If you want to see something like this, April Fools Day is much better!
