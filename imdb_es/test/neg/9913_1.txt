Anyone who complains that Peter Jackson is making movies too long should participate in this CBS "event". There are about 45 minutes of history with 2 hours of unnecessary subplots, with clich√©s of television series. Bad science is a staple for the fucking climate disaster films, so I'm not going to complain about that. Silly science can be fun to see if it runs in a fun way. What kills this movie is that there are 10 subplots ... all of which could be eliminated without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot. The only character that is entertaining to watch in Category 6 is Tornado Tommy, despite being a very annoying stereotype. <br /> <br /> Please note that I did not bother commenting on special effects either. Its quality should not come as a surprise. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
