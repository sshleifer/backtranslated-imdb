Although Humphrey Bogart obtained the invoicing of a star in King Of The Underworld, I am willing to bet that he did not thank Jack Warner for it. In fact, this movie was a hollow crown. <br /> <br /> King of the Underworld was supposedly a remake of Paul Muni's movie, Dr. Socrates, but since Humphrey Bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer in the person of James Stephenson. <br /> <br /> Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a pair of married doctors and Eldredge performs some complicated surgery on one of Bogart's henchmen. Bogey is a man who appreciates the good work done in his name and gives Eldredge $ 500.00 and there is more where he came from if he plays his cards correctly. Eldredge who has a problem with the game sees a good way to get an undeclared income. <br /> <br /> But when he was killed in a raid on the gang's hideout, it is believed that Francis is also involved by the law and the American Medical Association, no matter how much he protests about his innocence. It's not good, and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to get away from notoriety. <br /> <br /> Of course, the notoriety and Bogart and an itinerant as Leslie Howard as a writer in Stephenson meet her again. But Kay is brave and witty, to say the least. <br /> <br /> The character of Bogart was ridiculous, it's no wonder that the poor man was screaming for better parts. He's a gangster who shoots people mercilessly and gives his henchmen just for laughter. He worries about his image and, therefore, kidnaps the writer Stephenson to write his autobiography and, of course, confesses enough to burn it in the 48 states. And then, Kay Francis teases him completely, it's hard to believe he was the king of anything. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the minor works for any of the stars.
