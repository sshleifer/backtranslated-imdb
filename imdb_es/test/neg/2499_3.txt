D'Amato's hardcore / horror hybrid really does not live up to its extraordinary title and its intriguing premise, in which several insensitive contemporary monsters are attacked by a monster in an atoll previously used for nuclear experiments, but in general the film It is very slow, the action is so sad and the cast so clearly rejected for having to have sex with each other that the film becomes a difficult task to watch. <br /> <br /> This is a shame, because the movie creates a promising idea. . A naval officer takes a group of scientists to the Atoll in a small boat. The scientists ?? Three women and two men? they are an intriguing cross section of sexual types, suffering in varying degrees of nymphomania, co-dependence and frigidity; There is even an intriguing foray into the world of female sex tourism, where one of the women stops in a brothel to be served by two Caribbean tacos to rent. The creature itself? a native islander shattered with a horribly scarred face and an unbearably long pizzle? it has some affinities with the old Creature of the Black Lagoon and is the kind of nuclear nightmare that has been maintained on postmodern man since the cold war began, even though in the West we have retired to hedonism and relativistic science. <br /> <br /> Porn Holocaust is certainly a movie that shows Westerners of the post-sexual revolution that they find their mirror image in a nuclear monster, but the awkwardness with which it develops really leaves aside the ferocity of the idea. There is a promising interaction of action shots with POV shots, suggesting that the monster (which looks / advances as the horror monsters of its POV position tend to do) is similar to the voyeur in the audience that gets out of sex between "beautiful people." The sight of the monster that forces a beautiful young woman to suck on her large member no doubt throws the ugly fantasies of the target audience on her face. But D'Amato has developed similar ideas better in other films, and Porno Holocaust is a potentially fierce idea disappointed by the execution (even D'Amato's usual cinematographic abilities disappointed him with much camera work).
