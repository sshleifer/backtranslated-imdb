I found this movie on a DVD discount shelf for $ 10. It was not worth it. Some of the works and dialogue of the camera seem and sound as if they were made by a film student. Sandra's performance was credible, but the film was predictable and the action was irregular and dragged. However, one thing that I will give you. Unlike most action movies, the people in this movie actually ran out of ammo and saved dead bodies in search of new weapons and ammunition.
