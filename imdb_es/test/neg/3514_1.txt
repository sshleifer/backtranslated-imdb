I must begin by saying that this is one of the most annoying movies I've seen in my entire life! Annoying factor number one: Never see the face of the "son" (for the whole movie). And the infinitely more annoying factor: that phone that sounds incessantly ... nothing but listening to the phone ringing again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again ... you understand my point. The old man was being harassed but the VISOR was too! At first, the movie interested me, but it deteriorated VERY quickly. It is possible that the film was good as a short film, but it was definitely not enough to maintain something that is close to the length of the film. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the message about racism (which finally appeared in the last two scenes of the film) is secondary to the harassment of this old man. Who cares to sit and look at what really is nothing more than an old man spitting obscenities at a joke that calls him? If you've never seen a movie that just gets under your skin and drives you crazy ... take a look!
