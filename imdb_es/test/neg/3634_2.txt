I've seen about five or six episodes of this stupid show, and most of them forced me to see them. And I did not like the episodes I saw. What happened to Dan Schneider? After giving us such impressive shows as Drake and Josh, why did you decide to create such a stupid show like this? My problem is not only with Dan, but also with the guys who nominated this show for an Emmy, were they drunk that day or what is the problem? Drake and Josh were not nominated for an Emmy, but it is much better than Zoey 101. The creators of this show should be ashamed of the existence of this program. Let's hope your pregnancy knows who will affect the program, or better yet, it will be canceled.
