To be fair, I did not see much of this show. Probably because it was not as good as the original M * A * S * H, but I seem to remember that they moved in the weekly program. Some programs are not worth following every week. But I really tried at the beginning, so it was not so bad. Maybe I just hoped it would improve, but I can not give a 1. to this show. Honestly, I can not give more than a 2. <br /> <br /> It was not MASH (I'm not going to write those stupid * 's every time). And I was trying to be MASH without any effort, as if it simply happened magically. Well guess what? There is no magic. The best thing I can do here is to compare it with other shows. <br /> <br /> Trapper John, M.D. It was a much better show. However, they should have called it B.J. Hunnicut, M.D. because Pernell Roberts looked exactly like an older BJ, but nothing like John Trapper. Keep everything else the same, just change your name and the name of the show. Presto! After MASH, it was not the only sequel that bombarded and completely dishonored the original. Archie Bunker's Place was a lame follow-up of All In The Family. Did not he have a heart, or conflict, or depth? all the things that made All In the Family so memorable. Similarly, MASH was fun because the doctors were reacting to the impossible absurdity of the war. Eliminate the war and eliminate the unit for 99% of the humor. Potter can not shout at Klinger for wearing a dress, because Klinger is not wearing a dress, because he is not trying to be expelled from the Army, because he is already out of the Army, because the war is over. (breathes) All the jokes were forced because there was no motivation at all. The least motivated was the viewer, to stay and watch the show. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, the whole show seemed to be Potter, Klinger and Mulcahy just standing there unnaturally, in front of the audience like a trio of vaudeville artists. It was reminiscent of Good Times, where they spent 90% of the show standing behind that couch and talking to the audience, trying to make it look like they were having a natural conversation. They were not And he felt even less natural in After MASH. <br /> <br /> Another random fact that I remember is that the people who created MASH never got royalties from the split. The studio used the absurd excuse that After MASH was really a consequence of the movie MASH (which was theirs) and not the television series. Nice try, but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie, and he was never deaf. I guess studio executives will do anything for a dollar. Anything other than a sequel worthwhile, that's it.
