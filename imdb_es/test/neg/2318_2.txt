Although I'm sure the idea looked good on paper, and I was attracted to it the first time I heard it, this film often moves forward and falls, and when I see it, I just want it to end. The beginning and the end of the film about Lou that has to take care of a problematic person is, at best, devised, although I found that the top part of a policeman was comical. However, I found little to laugh at with the bottom of the barrel script that was released for these two great comedians. I thought it was a mistake to put them in a musical, and it stinks of a "Wizard of Oz" scam (with the songs and format in black and white and in color). I would not recommend this movie to anyone except the A & C fans. Any other person will be disappointed, and they have many better movies.
