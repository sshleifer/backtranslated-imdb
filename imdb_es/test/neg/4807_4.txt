I'm a big fan of prison dramas, which is reflected in OZ being my favorite American television show of all time. I guess the attraction lies in a kind of presumptuous voyeurism wanting to see how bad things happen to bad guys' backgrounds, but I think Don Siegel's RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11 is pretty disappointing. Well, I already knew, since it was done in 1954, it would be devoid of bad words, graphic nonsense and gang rapes, but it's still a pretty weak movie compared to the representation of the prison in previous films like EACH DAWN I DIE and WHITE HEAT. The problem lies in the preaching tone of the film and riot leader Dunn is something of a prison reformer. Yes, that sounds ridiculous, as it is a violent antihero instead of a hug of loose dolls that do well at a salary, but that is what it is in essence, wants to see rehabilitated prisoners to join society in place to suffer. There is also a problem of making a B movie with such radical themes (it is quite ironic that Siegel then did DIRTY HARRY where the only good criminal is a dead person) and that is the cast that is not very good with Emile Meyer as guardian. Especially irritating in his performance. like I said a disappointing movie
