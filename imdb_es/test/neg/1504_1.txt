An objective lesson on how to make a bad movie that passes itself off as Horror. Without going too close, I imagine that this is the result of a group of students from the film school who added parts to the story and then ACTED on it! It's like a film workshop of some kind and it's a movie that needs an editor, in which case it would have lasted 10 minutes! The director of this garbage probably had more money than sense. Consider the number of scripts submitted or even unpublished films that would have benefited from this. The so-called Grandmother, who was killing people in pretty stupid ways, looked like Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future, or maybe the musicians Johnny Winter / Edgar Winter. It starts with 20 minutes of boring and gross nonsense thrown by students, something about paranoia. Give this garbage 1 is because you can not get less. It does not have a single redemption feature, and when one of the girls thinks that the body on the floor covered in blood is the type she is engaged in, she has to REALLY STOP the red stuff before she knows it's not a tomato sauce . It is an insult to the intelligence of an idiot.
