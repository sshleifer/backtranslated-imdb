This was the next appearance of the latest film by Jill Ireland, who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well-known actress and producer. Ireland made a lot of waves in the press when she left her then husband, David McCallum, in 1967, beginning her long relationship with Charles Bronson. It's a great irony that Bronson, probably the all-time leader in number of screen deaths, has had one of the most enduring marriages in film history. <br /> <br /> 'Murder' seems to be a film that was included in the Cannon production program by Bronson and Ireland. Ireland already suffered from cancer-related diseases in 1987 and one can almost imagine the two actors who want to do "just one more, for the good old days". The 'Murder' is done carelessly as a whole, showing the lack of refined and reduced funds that would put Cannon in 1990. But there's a kind of nostalgic value in seeing the couple one last time and the movie makes you wonder what It helps exactly one relationship to survive in the chaos that is Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Bronson plays Jay Killian, a high-ranking Secret Service agent assigned to protect the First Lady, Lara Craig (Ireland). The president's wife has a reputation for being difficult, for controlling the agents of the Service and for wanting to do things her way. Let all the changes, however, when attempts are made in your life and she should travel with Killian by car, train, motorcycle, and believe it or not, dune buggy to escape from possible murderers. There is no surprise here, since Killian believes that the murderers are part of an internal job, perhaps arranged by the President himself. Along the way, Killian and Mrs. Craig develop a tacit affection for each other in scenes between Bronson and Ireland that are really fun. <br /> <br /> What really excites me is how this movie was promoted after its release and how it is still made to look like a DVD. The original trailer gives you the feeling that 'Murder' is another of Bronson's shots. However, much of this film, which by the way is classified as PG-13, is comical, in the line of a romantic thriller like Bronson and the Irish western "From Noon Till Three". Even the DVD case shows Bronson with a rocket launcher, ready to blow things up. What he does, but to a lesser degree than his other potboilers of the 80s. <br /> <br /> In general, the 'Murder' is a failed Cannon job and he does not really know what kind of film he wants to be. In addition to deviating from the action to the romantic thriller and back, there are serious errors in continuity, the values ​​of the properties are cheap and the effects are terrible; Many of the explosions seem like a matte job instead of being performed in the place. Robert Ragland, who had demonstrated good compositional skills in previous films, joined Valentine McCallum in a score that is mostly synthesized and better suited to television. <br /> <br /> Richard Sale's script has a real dialogue dialogue, with the Conversations between Bronson and Ireland the only bright spot. There is no explanation of why the First Lady is called 'One Momma' suddenly, or why Ireland keeps her British accent when the character is a Wyoming native. Jan Gan Boyd, Killian's principal assistant, has a kitten-like personality and is a very bad federal agent. Stephen Elliott (former Tony Award nominee who died in May 2005), Randy Brooks, Erik Stern (as killer Bracken) and Michael Ansara (Senator Bunsen) are acceptable in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, This was the last film that directed the concert of Peter Hunt, who entered the scene with 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' in 1969 and collaborated with Bronson and Lee Marvin in 'Death Hunt' 'in 1981.' Murder 'is available on DVD through MGM. Home entertainment; It is presented in dual panoramic format and standard format with subtitles in three languages ​​and theatrical trailer. <br /> <br /> ** of 4
