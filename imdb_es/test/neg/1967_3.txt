Yes, in this movie you are treated to several small snowmen in the attack in a seemingly very hot weather, so yes, this movie definitely should not be taken seriously. In fact, it is a much worse movie than the original one, since at least with all the production it seemed to cost more than a couple of dollars and make a video camera. It has its funny moments, but really playing the cheap of your movie and making it your desired laugh is a kind of weak movie if you ask me. You can not create a good story, its effects will be really bad, they allow us to make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible phrases and we have our movie. The first, at least, had a fairly credible story, since the snowman attacked during the winter and it is not a resort. It also had better effects, this is just one or two steps ahead of "Hobgoblins" when it comes to monsters and you really want to be more than a step above a bunch of hand puppets. Even so, it compensates for all this with a super finale that shows a large maritime vessel being pulled out by the powerful frost. Actually, I'm kidding, but it was actually the funniest part of the movie.
