A young doctor and his wife are suddenly expecting a child. Both are disturbed for a period of two hours on the night of conception. Interesting twist in a trite story. Very good F / X and interesting edition. Jillian McWhirter is outstanding in a cast that features Arnold Vosloo, Wilford Brimley and Brad Dourif. Brimley brings normalcy to the extravagant. Congratulations to director Brian Yuzna.
