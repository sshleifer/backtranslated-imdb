I have always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism and my film teacher validated it in the university. This is not as bad as the Star Wars holiday special, there is nothing lower in the lunch box than that mistake. This Fantastic Four movie, complete with Doctor Doom, who has no idea why he has excessively changed his fingers, is at the top of the list of colossal mistakes. Doom dialogue "Kill it! ... Let it go!" It is classic, since it is amazing in its hilarity. The editing is good, and the director of photography is not so bad ... those are the positive aspects. I can not, however, submit all my friends to see them in their entirety, but if I have the opportunity, I show them that "can Jonny and Sue come to outer space with us?" scene I do also include the scene of the final scene, where Redd Richards in his dress of FF for some reason, next to his girlfriend Sue in her wedding dress, gets into the limousine ... the reward is the extendo arm of farewell while they walk away. Most people are in complete disbelief that something like this exists.
