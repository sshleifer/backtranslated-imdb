It is one of the imponderables of the realization of independent films of low budget that so many with so little real talent imagine themselves. The lack of talent that these extravagant aspirants show is there for the whole world to see. Case in point: THE FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (or, as I quickly learned, SHITE OF THE LIVING DEAD). There is nothing wrong in paying homage to the heroes. I have done it many times over the years, myself, in many different ways. In fact, in the book of books THE NIGHT RIDERS, co-authored with M. Kelley, I dedicate it, in part, to "the six writers whose work still inspires me: Richard Matheson, Harlan Ellison, Shirley Jackson, Edgar Allen Poe, HP Lovecraft , and Robert E. Howard. " If it had been a movie, I would have dedicated it to the directors whose films have inspired me over the years. George Romero would have been very high on that list. It is nothing less than a real pity that the creators of this film were not as inspired by Romero as his title suggests.
