I saw him late at night on a minor channel and I put him waiting for a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comic actor and I thought he could be a good comedian / actor in the style of Richard Pryor. <br /> <br /> I could not have been more wrong. This concert was horrible. It was full of racist comments directed at white people, Muslims and people from India (Muslims and Indians are the same in Lawrence's narrow mind) and the philosophy of clich√©s (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, can not resist). the need to preach when we are given a platform. Do we really need a conference on Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights fight during a stand-up comedy show? Then there were his flattering comments designed to ingratiate him with women, which made my skin crawl listening to him. <br /> <br /> The worst thing of all is that the show was just not fun and I found it boring. I turned around halfway and turned to find him preaching or continuing and talking about the birth of his son (there was no humor in the story of his son's birth and he was self-indulgent on his part to bore us with the details. much to say or would have cut this section of the program). <br /> <br /> This program was silly: Runteldat!
