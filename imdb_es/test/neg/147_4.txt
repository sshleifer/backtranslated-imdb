Usually, I enjoy watching Laurel and Hardy, but obviously this is one of the movies they made when they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple and is mainly based on a joke What strange skirts and plaid are. And that's it. Well, there are other jokes, but I did not find them very funny; They are outdated and (I guess) were not very entertaining when the movie premiered for the first time. <br /> <br /> Even so, the film has two of the most charming faces in history, and they make the best of the best. An uncomfortable story (which I hope has been filmed without an adequate script) and that the landscape is nice to see. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, seeing this is only worthwhile for Laurel and Hardy fans, other people should stay away from it.
