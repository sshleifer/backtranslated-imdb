When I saw this movie, it was an afternoon after I got home from work. I love horror movies and I've seen some very cheesy, but this takes the cake. The plot presented to the viewer at the beginning of the film seems a little intriguing, but as the film progresses, the script takes a wrong turn with horrible clich√©s and poor presentation, which in turn makes the film completely boring and boring . I do not want to continue criticizing the script and the plot, because believe me it is not the worst part. I have to say that the acting was not terrible for the beginning actors, and I was impressed by Taylor Locke, this being one of his first films. The worst part of the movie was the special effects. They reeked of low budget and really ruined the entertainment of the spectators, even if he had been remotely interested in the plot. I recommend you watch this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot. Only then can you really appreciate good writers and directors.
