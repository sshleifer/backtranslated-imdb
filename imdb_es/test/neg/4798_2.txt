I just saw Coronado ... Over here, the only line they came up with is "the FX team behind Independence Day." I think that says a lot. There is no talk of writers, directors, actors ... <br /> <br /> It's a nice story of adventures in a banana republic in Mid America, but the story is thin. <br /> <br /> All Throughout the movie, I kept thinking about how this movie looks like cuts of scenes from a computer war action game. Although the FX are good, all too often they are visible. Like the cut scenes in CG style like Command'n'Conquer. <br /> <br /> Almost instantly you know that that particular truck, backdrop, bridge, castle or fighter never existed. The appearance is smooth and pleasant, but it is not up to what is expected of Action Adventures today. The film lacks a lot of obvious footage in the place. <br /> <br /> The interpretation, the story is below average and the effects are good, but they are not up to the standard of the film. I'm not surprised that this has gone directly to the video / DVD. <br /> <br />
