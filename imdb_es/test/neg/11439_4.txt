A pretty soft horror movie; If it were not for a couple of sex scenes, it could easily have been a television movie. The orifices of the plot abound (an example: why would there be an eighteenth-century secret passage that led from the upper floor of a house that was burned to the ground and a new building placed 200 years later?), Cardboard, characters making things that anyone with an IQ greater than the size of their shoe would not ... <br /> <br /> It has some fun moments, but overall it's a film below the average that got Roy Scheider because his bills were due. If you are looking for a predictable and extremely formulated movie that can provide some laughter, it might be worth watching. If not, then this is not for you.
