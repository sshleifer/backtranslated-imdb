First, I must say that I have seen the '39 version at least 100 times; Know all the dialogue and read the game of '36, which is different from '39 and contains its own gold nuggets. This version is as flat as a movie for life in adultery. There is a reason why you have not seen an expensive campaign of television ads. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the catty tone of the original and how women spent all their time fighting each other. GUESS WHAT??! That was Booth's intention. It was a theatrical and gossipy version of gossip, adultery, and bites in the back among a group of wealthy social groups in Manhattan. The crowd that made this new version did not intend to honor the original material. They choose strangely, putting half a scene here and half a scene that come from the first version. Bette Midler (who is in a few scenes and acts the old part of the countess in a broad and smiling style) has no context in this version. She mentions going after "Buck", which is a key element in the original, then never mentioned again. This movie is so boring that I'm not going to analyze it in excess, but here are some things that I found incredible:> Mary Haines boasted about her domestic staff: "I can take my nails out of a board!" Right. Great script Norma Shearer could have read a line about that and gotten an Oscar nominee, right? > A compassionate Sylvia Fowler !!! ??? Annette Bening got what she wanted, and the movie simply withered. Claire Booth used Sylvia as the comic engine that toured the work. As portrayed immortally by Rosalind Russell, she was an ignorant and spiteful woman who recited reams of petty, ridiculous and irresistible dialogues, which are still classic and easy to cite. She was not over biting Paulette Godard's ankle. The 2008 filmmakers decided that this character should die. When they killed her, they killed the movie.
