This revision contains spoilers. I had no expectations about this movie. I took it off the shelf of the video store with the movie, "White Noise." <br /> <br /> First, the credits for this stupid movie run in about 5 minutes. The pace from start to finish is slow. The main heroines do not like to wear a bra and the director seems to enjoy the jiggle effect when Anna Paquin comes down the stairs. If you like piquero movies, this has a low interest factor. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is good that the film extracts elements of Lovecraft and other mechanisms of the horror genre, but in better films, there is at least some rational or systematically irrational behavior. This stinker tries to establish a certain sense of modernity and reality, but then there are situations in which nobody calls the police even though they have discovered a treasure trove of potentially incriminating forensic evidence, and otherworldly rituals are well explained in a Complete book about another world. Rituals as in Buffy. I expected Miles to appear and give some advice on how to kill a certain type of demon of such and such a thing. <br /> <br /> The premise is that it is possible to open an era of darkness in which creatures that crawl on the roof can cut off your throat or turn the effect of meat grinder. Ho hum. To do this you need to have a circle of sacrifices and then have seven children who must have cuts in the throat by people who love them. This opens the world to the era of darkness. At least that's what it says in detail in the book of ancient occult rituals. Which raises the annoying question of, uh, well, how they knew who wrote the book and, if this is what happens, if you really leave this information in a book that can get out of the library, much less get. from a library in a world that is not already covered in Darkness, a time triggered by lunatics who could have done this as long before using the "Hidden Practices to Bring the World to Darkness for Dummies, 2nd Edition"? It turns out that the father in the story is the seventh child, the one who fled the ritual 40 years ago; He was released by his father, who is the doctor / grandfather in the film, who wanted to try the ritual with presumably other stupid parents, who just wanted to see if that fool likes that this opens the world to darkness really works. The grandfather let the father go because "he really did not love him". Aduh Stupid stupid movie written by a stupid director who seems to think he is a kind of Eurofilm Auteur. There is also a scene in the film where the child appears with large welts on the face and the mother grabs him and has this total lack of reaction. The whole movie is like that. People who see something really strange are happening and do not react in any normal way. The plot and the address must be bad. <br /> <br /> Anna Paquin does her best to play her character realistically without showing a mocking smile, and is squashed in a sleeveless shirt, but at several critical moments in the story, her the character does not bother to call for a backup. You know, more of the same, "I will enter into a probable diabolical demonic situation without any knowledge of defense or help from others who carry flashlights or firepower even though I feel imminent death." And even though it seems more stupid, even if you bring the age of Darkness, these creatures that make you bloody can not attack if you have a source of light, but they appear as people you know and tell you to turn off the light source. It reminds me of the video game "Alone In The Dark"; Maybe this movie is a scam of the concept of that game. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the film are the girl and Anna. Both die at the end. The whole family dies. The creatures of the Darkness took them to their death, but in reality, the stupidity of the family characters was the main cause of death. The other adults could be interchangeable with any other actor in the fine film series of Red Shoes Diaries. <br /> <br /> So to finish, the worst thing about this movie is the stupidity of the characters that move blindly. an obviously abnormal situation, the really fucking plot (there is an old architect in the story who designs a house with a sacrificial altar hidden in it, the architect has suspected from the beginning that there would be hidden sacrifices in the house but nobody says it because, well, there is no real reason, they could not find the children, but he did not bother to tell the authorities about the HIDDEN ROOMS that he designed in the house, but he likes to stay in the house for a period of 40 years because worries about what is happening inside ... derrrrh ... duuuh), the trite use of fear mechanisms (more children standing in the dark or only appearing in photographs, and blood in the wallpaper) , and the selfishness of the director that when you see it In the DVD features that describe his shitty work as a new and original interpretation, he makes you understand where the real horror of this movie is. <br /> <br /> Is it entertaining? At a 2x speed on a DVD player with activated subtitles, it can be entertaining, until you reach the end and you realize that the movie is crap, otherwise, it will disappear. The cinematic equivalent of a fatty shake; The empty calories are horrible. <br /> <br /> The film gives the impression that the director must have seen "The Ring" and wanted to try to create something similar in the mood, that in this respect, the film fails miserably, and then, too, , in this respect, Jaume Balaguer√≥, it is my opinion that you suck at what you do.
