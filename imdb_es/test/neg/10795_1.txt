I have seen both the MST3K version and the uncut version. I rather enjoyed it. Either way, it was not so bad of a movie. Of course it moved a little slow at times. I liked. <br /> <br /> As regards MST3K, they only made the films for which they could obtain the rights. Not all the movies that destroyed where bad movies were, it was so easy to make fun of them. Take, for example, SoulTaker. <br /> <br /> The characters of Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar were so inanimate and boringly stupid that I could not help but laugh. I could not take them seriously. However, it really created a unique feeling. <br /> <br /> Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script. A better world than 95% of garbage in today's theaters. His role was played well. Not too loud, not for men, but fair. The camera really likes her in this movie. I would have chosen her for that role after having prepared the script. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie deserves a little more credit than it gives. Please see the uncut version if you see the MST3K. He deserves a lot.
