Last week, on Friday, I went to see "Snakes on a Plane" with my friends. It was amazing compared to this horrible movie (however, many of the scenes were ridiculously funny). Basically, a woman has a Mayan curse where she vomits innocuous harmless snakes that, instead of attacking, crawl inside her victims. The girl with the coca bag is pretty hot. On the title screen it says "100 passengers ... 3,000 poisonous snakes!" Fear, I know. There were not even 100 passengers on the train. Only a couple of drug addicts and other lost losers. It is worth the five dollars to see the woman become a huge CG snake and devour the entire train and then be absorbed by a huge vortex. It's just sad that someone does everything they can to make a fucking movie, just to earn a few dollars because of the madness of "Snakes on a plane."
