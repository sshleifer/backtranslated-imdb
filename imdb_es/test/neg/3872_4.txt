B. Kennedy tried to make a sequel by exaggerating and amplifying a gigantic Western left (not as leftist as the sequel to G. Kennedy, who came after it). <br /> <br /> This is the ugliest film of The two sequels are very ugly. It is a slapdash. B. Kennedy did it by amplifying, but without having the genius for that. Hundreds of laborers, hundreds of Mexican comics, hundreds of women, a desert, arid landscapes, a storm on the largest scale. <br /> <br /> Everything in this clumsy sequel, nice only in a strange way, is false. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is very ugly. Brynner, who did the best part in the first movie, does not look good in this one. <br /> <br /> King plays a priest; He will be a political leader, Quintero, in the next sequel to the franchise. <br /> <br /> It's true that when you have so many characters you may not need a very interesting story; sometimes. For example, Brynner knows McQueen; then they choose other compadres; or, B. Spencer meets Coburn; etc. It is fun to see where and how you will meet the rest of the crew, etc. But you need at least these various characters. Unfortunately, Burt Kennedy's fee is not very good at that. <br /> <br /> The Return of the Seven (1966) begins with a bullfight. Vin and Chris are there; They decide to rescue the third survivor of the original Magnificent Boy, who belongs to a huge group of 300 peons kidnapped by the Mexican bandits. We learned the name of Chico's attractive wife, is Petra. Chris must re-constitute a small army and here we have a treatment of Dirty Dozen Chris chooses his men from the convicts. Another member of the command is a womanizer, who will take good care of the wives who are left without husbands. Sexual humor is especially unpleasant and unpleasant in this movie. He strives to look smart and spicy; It is simply rude, silly and disgusting. <br /> <br /> The election of the members of the small army was one of the greatest joys of the McQueen film. Unfortunately, in the first sequel there is the most memorable of the three crews gathered under the name of Magnificent Seven. <br /> <br /> Robert Fuller makes a lousy "Vin"; Oates is the smiling womanizer. <br /> <In this nice giant attempt, a Mexican revolutionary leader has a gigantic plan: he kidnaps 300 pawns and uses them to build a town and a church in the memory of his lost children. (It is useless to say that this revolutionary Mexican revolutionary does not equal the role of Wallach in the first film). B. Kennedy bet exclusively in the camp and on the most important things: ugly landscapes, an electrical storm, a gigantic lightning bolt, a desert. A great battle between the emancipated peons and the revolutionary cowboys. Of course, Return of the Seven (1966) completely abandoned the good sense of the McQueen movie. <br /> <br /> What is particularly surprising is that this sequel came quite quickly after the original movie. However, everything changed in the meantime. The way to make westerns. <br /> <br /> Both sequels seem strange.
