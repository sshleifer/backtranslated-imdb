Well, the episode I just saw had the biggest "Gastineau Girl" complaining about why people keep mentioning her husband (Mr. Gastineau, a famous football player apparently). It seems that she is not willing to accept that he is the only reason why she is not turning hamburgers, she married someone famous and that is why she has cameras pointing towards her. <br /> <br /> When an interviewer challenges her to explain what she really does. , she gave a wonderful circular reason why people should pay attention to her: "I work very hard in my reality show". Then he said: "I'm not a celebrity ... I'm a personality." <br /> <br /> I'm not sure who this series is for, except for people who have had all their intelligence removed. It certainly is not a role model for anyone, except gold prospectors, since the two stars do nothing but spend money, and all they are told about the rich is that they do not have money problems.
