I have seen the first 15 minutes and I can say that there was no consultation with any kind of military personnel. The character of Judith Light (an officer) has her hair loose on her shoulders! One of the first officers who greets her when she enters the medical facility where she works is so overweight that her pants open! No, there was no military advising them in this movie. Even an enlisted former soldier could have helped here.
