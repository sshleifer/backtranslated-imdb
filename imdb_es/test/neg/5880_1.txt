I saw the * star * of this movie on The Daily Show, and I thought I could tune it (the movie premiered on Comedy Central, then went to theaters). Oh, Vey! <br /> <br /> This makes "Shakes the Clown" look like "Citizen Kane"! Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. Not a laugh, not even a smile. This movie will make your face come out in pimples and your eyes explode like the last remants of "Raiders". I can not even think of a worse movie, either "Hands" or "Ishtar". As the pythons beckoned, they flee, they flee! Why did someone give the green light to this unless he used his own money? The horror is that there is not A good line, nor A good joke, and only ONE bad thing ... the making of this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel that, had it been done correctly, this would have been hilarious. As it is, I need a new pancreas to vomit so hard. Damn anyone involved in this farce.
