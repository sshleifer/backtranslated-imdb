From the creators of Underworld, we have, by far, the worst werewolf movie I've ever seen. It is basically a reconstructed version of Underworld, but without vampires (not a big problem), great effects (a BIG agreement) and, in general, almost everything that can be done correctly to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy ( the greatest agreement of all of them!). A twenty-year-old lycanthrope chocolatier named Vivian currently resides in Romania since her family was persecuted and executed in front of her years ago in the United States for being werewolves. There, she belongs to a small society (or herd) of werewolves and is apparently chosen to marry involuntarily with the leader of the pack, Gabriel, whose son, a toad with a British accent, is engaged in hunting outside the herd. Apparently, they have been discovered in other countries before and want to remain settled in Romania avoiding negative attention, so, of course, such activity is considered prohibited. Vivian ends up falling in love with an American artist who ignores his participation in the group of bloodthirsty predators. When they end up discovering the secret relationship, things get complicated when someone is killed and the human is forced to participate in a deadly tradition in which he is released into the forest and is hunted, which gives the herd the opportunity to Become your "wolves" yourself. All this really consists of a big jump before they light up and land like a wolf. Very happy effects. The whole movie is like a tame underworld with some romantic montages and very little action. Seeing this in the theater, I could not wait for it to end. A devastating and boring disappointment. Avoid!
