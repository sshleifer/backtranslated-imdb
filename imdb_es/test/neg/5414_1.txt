Where to start? A guy has an Indian pot that he is cleaning and, suddenly, Skeletor attacks. He hits a woman in the neck with an ax, she falls, but then gets up and apparently is unharmed. She runs into the forest, and it turns out that there is a basement of a shopping center in the woods. She meets a public service worker and Skeletor attacks again. Fortunately, like any good public service worker, he has a gun and shoots him. It does not work, everything starts on fire. <br /> <br /> Cut to some people who walk through the forest. Although they have been walking together for some time, they sit and present themselves. Would not they have done that when they met? Anyway, they are members of the "Delta Covert" team (undercover, I suppose, because that way they do not have to pay to wear them with uniforms). Pretty girls are several things, like a sniper school instructor and, oh, I can not remember the rest. No matter. Finally, everyone takes out their weapons and immediately begins to point to several things. ? Anyway, they meet an old Indian who is sitting in the woods. He wants beans You know, like pork and beans? He mumbles some things, I can only assume that it is the premise of the movie. I trusted to have listened to the premise of the commercials, because you really can not understand anything of what it says. <br /> <br /> Then, they walk through the forest a little more. All dialogue is a load of quasi-military, BS males. I mean all that, as in every word. Like "This reminds me when we were in Kabul" or "This reminds me when we were in Laos". Skeleton attacks again. Let me give you a summary of a basic attack. One of the female characters is crouching behind a tree and she points her gun at the guy who approaches the horse. For some reason, she does not shoot, but she screams several times for another person. Then, when Skeletor approaches, he jumps from behind the tree so that Skeletor can hit it with his spear. Then everyone starts firing. The bullets make the sparks fly from the trees. Apparently, the people who made this movie never fired a tree with a bullet. They do not make sparks. <br /> <br /> Then, suddenly, Casper Van Diem is driving a semi-truck, trying to run over Skeletor. He fails, and the truck slides to a stop. Van Diem is wounded, apparently slid on the seat and hit his hip with the window handle or something like that, so he crawls out of the truck and explodes. Later, he is dying in the forest and everyone says a group of quasi-military, BS males. They meet with a couple of guys in the forest and blow up their "undercover" status by immediately identifying themselves as members of the Army. They hit the boys for some reason, then they leave. <br /> <br /> Other things happen, people mutter, the camera shakes, etc. <br /> <br /> I think it's an End eventually. <br /> <br /> My theory is that the Science Fiction Channel is bothering a bit with everyone who criticizes their films, so they put this to remind us all how bad films can be. Do you think our movies are bad? Well, you have not seen anything wrong. Here is the bad !!! Well, now that we've put it aside, the rest of our movies are pretty good in comparison, right? <br /> <br /> Well, it's just a theory.
