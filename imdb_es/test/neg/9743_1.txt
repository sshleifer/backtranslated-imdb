I vaguely remember this movie. I remember it for the sole reason that it's the only movie I've ever come out of! and since then I have never seen it available to rent ANYWHERE !! I can not spoil it for anyone because I can barely remember it! Thinking, looking at the cast, it looked like a winner, with John Landis directing, but my God, they must have paid a lot for this nonsense! All I can remember is that the father disappears and the family tries to look for it, when trying to place a real photograph on the disk drive of a computer. I left after half an hour of this. However, I must confess, I would love to see if I can get a copy, just to see if it really was that bad! <br /> <br /> I would not be surprised if this was on the list of all the actors, list! I mean Christopher Lee was in this? The legend of all the bad guys, who had been in Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings? Like I said, the movie on the blacklist, the stupid ones!
