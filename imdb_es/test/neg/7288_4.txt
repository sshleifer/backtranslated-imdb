My main criticism with the film is animation. I totally agree with everyone else, I was very poor. Some of the characters seemed to have darker skin tones than in the first movie, which is much better. Also the background colors seemed rushed and somewhat static. It is also a shame that Michael J. Fox did not express Milo, did a good job and James Arnold Taylor was not sure if he should sound like Milo or Aladdin. I have also taken into account the lack of a good story. the third story was confused and awkwardly told, and the second story suffered from poor writing. To make things worse, the first I can not even remember, apart from a fishing village that is being persecuted or something. However, there was good music and good voices by John Mahoney, Cree Summer, Clancy Brown and Tom Wilson, who saved the film from total disaster. In short, a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good movie. 4/10 Bethany Cox.
