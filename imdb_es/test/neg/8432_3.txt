An art teacher finds an old wooden bed made of gingko trees and places it in his apartment, but he has a terrible history and is persecuted by an ancient spirit that sustains his human form by ripping people's hearts out. <Br /> <br /> Is this horror beautifully crafted? Well, it's actually more fantasy / romance than anything else, which causes chills and provides stunning images, but the plot was not interesting enough and the script did not have any kind of life. The problem was that I spent most of my time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button. Surely it would have accelerated the slow pace of the movie, but it would not know anything about what was happening either, which was reasonably difficult to understand or maintain interest in the first place. The performances were either too melodramatic or just plain boring, and that's probably because these characters are not convincing, outdated and comatose inducers. The background story of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and messy, with too much focus on a flimsy romance, being ridiculous when it should not be and in general it is built in a normal way that just lacks strength. Or condemned to carry the movie. What compensates for the deficiencies of the story are really artistic images, which seemed great, but the use of some images left me a little stunned with respect to what they really mean for the film. What strikes you is the colorless color scheme, but sometimes the actual screen will look very grainy or snowy. Although, from that, it shows the gross intensity of the production valves, but also adds some nice polished effects that combine with the calming but sometimes disturbing score. The work of the camera was quite diverse (although he did not add too much to the function), but during some of the more optimistic scenes there were too many close-ups or a dark illumination that made it difficult to understand what he is seeing. It also shows some nice moments of blood and blood, but not openly grandiose or distinguishable from most other movies. <br /> <br /> Film lethargically strange, with luminous images that look like they came out of a painting, but still not particularly attractive. Beware, I could put you in a deep trance!
