Oh dear gods, this is horrible. Stay away, just stay away. If you think you've seen bad movies, think again. Never before had my brain hurt as much as I did after seeing this movie. The performance, if you can call it that, is enough to cause internal bleeding inside the head. The story is so thin that it's barely there ... no, wait, record. There is not a complete story there, but from time to time, there are some fine lines that stand out from all the horror, and believe me, those few lines should have shot up. The best way to enjoy this movie is to drop the napalm and see the cozy fire from a distance. <br /> <br /> Some may call me sarcastic in this review, but I'm just trying to avoid some of you from a serious headache. However, if it is you, what I like to call, a visual masochist (like me), please go ahead and observe this monstrosity.
