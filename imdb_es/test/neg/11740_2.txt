* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel was an incredible film, unlike all previous ones. Each shot, each angle of the camera, each nuance was PERFECT. Not only did he break the rules, he invented a whole set of new ones. <br /> <br /> Here is the spoiler: there is absolutely nothing new, different or original in this movie. Gus Van Sant not only pays tribute to Hitch, but he swindles all ideas and does so in a less original and more conventional way. I had nothing against Gus Van Sant before watching this movie. I liked Drugstore Cowboy and I thought My Own Private Idaho was a very interesting movie. The question that burns in my mind when it comes to the new version of Psycho is: "Why did you do it, Gus?" <br /> <br /> In my mind, there are only two reasons to make a new version: 1) The original was a good story, but the movie stunk. 2) The original was a good movie, but someone has thought of a new and fresh approach to the material. None of these factors is present in the Gus Van Sant version of Psycho. Apart from the fact that it is in color, and there is a scene in which there is a montage of disturbing images related to the possible internal dialogue of the title character (which I did not find necessary), there is nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Also, I found that the casting left something to be desired. Anne Heche was fine as Marion, but lacked a certain vulnerability that Janet Leigh portrayed in the original. I did not feel so sympathetic to her character, because the choices she faced seemed much less limited as a woman in today's society, unlike the choices she would have faced as a single woman living in the early sixties. Vince Vaughn laughed at playing an incredibly na√Øve Norman Bates, but I think Anthony Perkins' timing and nervous, tormented looks were much more spooky. The only performance I enjoyed better than the original was the character of Lila Crane, played by Jullianne Moore. It was excellent as always, and brought a new strength and intelligence to the character. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there is a beautiful camera work, especially during the famous "bathroom scene" in which Van Sant takes advantage. of his use of color to show the murder in vibrant shades of crimson. And yet, throughout the movie I had this irritating sense of deju vu. Have not I seen this somewhere before? Oh, wait, I've seen this somewhere before! Almost all scenes seem to be copied shots for shots of the original. You almost have the feeling that the director made this movie as a school project. "Look, I can also make a Hitchcock movie." <br /> <br /> If you have not already done so, go see the original. It has been maintained over the years, and it overcomes this part of mediocrity, no doubt. You will not be disappointed.
