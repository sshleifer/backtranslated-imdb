As a Spanish tourist in Los Angeles and a movie fan, I made a terrible mistake. I went to see "Women" The new version of one of my favorites of all time. I have seen the original many times, in fact I own it. My rush to see the remake was based on Diane English, the woman responsible for "Murphy Brown". My thought was: how bad can it be? She must know what she is doing. Well I dont know what to tell. I do not understand what happened. Botoxed women is a pretty depressing affair. Meg Ryan or whoever played Mary, looked a bit like a grotesque version of Meg Ryan ... another actress who might be wearing a Meg Ryan mask: she does not give the character anything Norma Shearer did in 1939. The new it is a tired and unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce. The "friends" Annette Bening, Debra Messing, Jada Pinket Smith are as disconnected as anything else I've seen and if that was not enough: Eva Mendes as Crystal, the character created by Joan Crawford in one of his best and funniest performances . . The casting of Eva Mendes is really the sign of the poster of how badly this commercial attempt was conceived. I did not respect Candice Bergen and Cloris Leachman
