How on earth can you have such fantastic actors in such a miserable creation? This is one of the most stylized garbage pieces I've seen in a long time. Not only is it poorly written, but it is a poor quality address and editing product. The cinematography is terribly manipulative and unoriginal and the montage was confused beyond belief. The real ideas behind the plots (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are fine to start, but where the production / management team takes them is a large pit of garbage, like the one you see in an episode. And this is a scientific series? I'm a doctor and all I can say is that the science in this movie is crap, almost embarrassing to watch. I really felt bad for the actors involved since they were all extraordinary.
