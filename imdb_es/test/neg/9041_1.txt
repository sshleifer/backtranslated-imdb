*** SPOILERS *** This movie, called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK, is possibly the worst movie ever made and is brilliant just for that. A rich and sexy girl joins a man of tough action to look for his sister in the jungle of New Guinea. What follows is an indescribable mixture of cannibalism, crazy cults and religious maniacs that must be seen to be believed. The scenes of cannibalism are quite horrible, but they are so badly organized and acted that they are quite funny. The cast is horrible, except Janet Agren as the female lead who is excellent. Beware of the scene where they strip her and cover her with golden paint! My rating - 1 out of 10.
