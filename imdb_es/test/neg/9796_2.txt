Some "bad" movies are quite nice (like Norman J.Warren's Inseminoid), some "bad" movies are just bad (like Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes), but the "bad" movies that the postmodernist tries to do be deliberately Evil must always be approached with extreme caution. Many people think that the Terror Firmer of Troma is a masterpiece of bad taste, for example, but I suppose that anyone over nineteen years old will consider it useless nonsense. Then there is the dark star of John Carpenter. Yes, it is picturesque, and it is certainly a product of its time, but as a film it only has two levels above nothing. This British comedy of horror-black comedy without budget tries to achieve a satirical tone, with its endless references to his fellow splash films (including Psychomania, Horror Hospital and virtually anything Pete Walker), but due to poor results by second TV actors (the protagonist looks like Amy Winehouse), a script that seems to have been written on the back of a beermat peeled by two 'boys' without understanding how the film comedy works, Dean Friedman's directional (intentionally ?) The elevator-rock soundtrack and the production values ​​never rise above the mediocre, the net result is a film that can only laugh at AT instead of CON. If your idea of ​​whoopee is anthropomorphic turds, Chinese food called Fu King and references to TV ads forgotten a long time ago, you will enjoy this, but do not wait too long.
