This is possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Everything about him, the acting, the direction, the script, the cinematography, is terrible. The alien (a human in a bright suit) claims to be from a nearby universe; The screenwriter was supposed to mean "galaxy" but did not bother to get a dictionary to verify its terms. A better title for the film would be "It left the planet of the arguments of the plot". The plot is excessively silly and almost non-existent. All humans receive magical MacGuffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions only to move the nude plot. Any thought over time is ignored. Now it's a couple of days after meeting the alien, then BAM! suddenly there are only a couple of hours left until the zero hour. Do yourself a favor and miss this movie. You will be stupider for having seen him. The ending is particularly silly, and should have been accompanied by someone who says "Ta-Da !!!!" as the scriptwriter simply pulls something random from his butt. I think the real alien plot is that this movie is so bad that it will give you cancer watching it. If you can see the last 10 minutes without shitting yourself ("enemies of freedom", honestly) laughing, you're late.
