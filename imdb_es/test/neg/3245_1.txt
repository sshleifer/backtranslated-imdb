If you've seen this movie, you'll know it's one of the worst Bollywood movies ever made. Bollywood is known for copying hollywood movies. Who would know that they will copy Terminator 2. The difference between the two film industries is that Hollywood spends millions and Bollywood spends 100 thousand (average). That's the problem with this movie, if you want to make a T2 movie, do it correctly. The director added a false fantasy story about a reincarnated snake that finds his lost child (in the previous birth) killed by 2 men, but the fault is 10 people. Suddenly, he reincarnates in a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people they blame for his death. Not to mention that the villain or villain Reincarnated has some kind of super powers. He can transform into anything, can fly, disappear, the power of fire, the energy of the wind, whatever it is, has it. He even goes crazy and survives the T1000 style. You are probably wondering how he survives. It is better not to ask, and it is better not to waste time and money in this movie. It is better to forget that this movie even came out. I think it's a shame to use a great starcast for this outrageous movie with a meaningless story.
