This film is a completely inaccurate representation of the real story of Noah's Ark. Probably the producers did not even read the Bible. This is the worst movie I've seen! Noah's wife was never mentioned by name in the Bible, but the writers of the film "gave" him the name of Naama. This movie describes the destruction of Sodom a good 1000 years before it happened, and what about Gamorrah? It was also destroyed at the same time that it was Sodom. (Maybe the producers thought that not including Gamorrah in the story and showing the city of "Sodom" as what is known is what would cause more eyebrows). This film is a complete filth and mocks God and the Bible. It is a wonder that any true Christian wants to participate in the production of this abysmal, disgusting and reprobate mockery of the Bible.
