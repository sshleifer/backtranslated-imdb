I give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called Haunted Houses. But this child and his friends conduct their investigations as total idiots. They assume that there are ghosts from the beginning and if they ever find rational explanations behind the experiences, they have to kick drugs and scream to admit it. But beyond that, the full format of the program is incredibly annoying. Although many of them seem to be written, the college-educated children who make up the cast can barely speak English but still insist on trying to use "big" words they obviously do not understand. And the ridiculously important voices of lead researcher Ryan make me want to throw the TV out the window. (And he seems drugged all the time). In short, this group makes the guys from TAPS on Ghost Hunters look like MIT scientists!
