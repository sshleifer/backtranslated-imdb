I used to think that it could not be worse than "Army of the Dead" but this load of shit makes the movie mentioned above look like "The Godfather". Special effects are HORRIBLE (Makes the original Nintendo graphics look like an HDTV). When it comes to acting, said this way, I went to a play with my 6-year-old niece and gave a performance worthy of an Oscar, compared to these actors and actresses of the D-List (and that's very nice) . . Basically, if I had a gun to my head and another to choose between watching this movie again or cutting my own arm with a dull knife, that's a difficult decision! You know what, who needs two arms anyway?
