Seeing QUINTET is no different than seeing a group of people playing a word game in Portuguese, or some other language they do not understand. You have the idea that they are playing a game, and if you look closely enough, you can begin to understand the rules. But why bother? Since it is clear that you can not join and that you would not want to do it if you had the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Director Robert Altman is not one of those who beg an audience to like his films. , let alone understand them. Sometimes it allows you to slide into the image to be part of the crowd, like in M ​​* A * S * H, NASHVILLE and A WEDDING, movies so full of bustle and orchestrated chaos, one or two more bodies on the scene would not I make a big difference. And other times, he seems to resent the fact that someone may be watching his movie; as in IMAGES or THREE WOMEN, where the stories are almost personal monologues made for an audience of one, Altman. With QUINTET, Altman seems to intentionally challenge anyone to get involved with the narrative. <br /> <br /> You can not depend on Altman doing the logical or the expected, which is sometimes what makes his films so iconoclastic. But sometimes doing the unexpected is not daring, just dumb. For example, in QUINTET, we are introduced to a young woman who is apparently the last person in the world able to get pregnant and, in fact, is pregnant. This last ray of hope in a decomposing society is extinguished almost immediately; Altman does not even wait until the end to play his last depressing letter in this elaborate nihilistic and pessimistic account. He lets us know how empty and meaningless life is from the beginning. Brave? Perhaps. Stupid? Insurance. Without any purpose, try to build a story about an iceberg that is melting rapidly, while reminding us how useless the effort is. <br /> <br /> For the record, QUINTET, at least can pretend to be prophetic. The story centers on a treacherous game played by several boring characters. It is a form of TAG (the murder game): a handful of people point to each other for their elimination, each as a possible murderer and each as a possible victim. Two or more can form alliances to kill a third party. As they die, new goals are assigned. Who lives, wins. All this happens in an exotic and inhospitable desert. It is, to a large extent, an extreme, sci-fi version of "Survivor" - minus the commercial plugs and the "fake reality". <br /> <br /> It's not a bad concept for a science fiction. epic. A post-apocalyptic environment, a microcosm of the world (the cast is clearly multinational), a game in which you can not trust the on or at least not for long, and where nobody really wins. Literally a cold war. A staunch director with a taste for dark humor and violent invention could have a field day. The mystery in QUINTET is not in the game or in how it is played, but in why everything exists. If the game "Quintet" is a metaphor of life, then Altman, seems to see nothing in the material, but the opportunity to show that life is an empty and meaningless game, a conclusion as obvious as it is false. Given the living nature, although cynical of the rest of his various films, I do not think Altman believes in QUINTET either. And if Altman does not have faith in his material, why should we?
