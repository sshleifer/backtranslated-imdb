I really wanted like this movie. The previews seemed slightly funny, but I thought they put most of the fun things in the previews. In this case, they not only did that, they also twisted the clips so that they looked a lot more fun than they were in the real movie. I like John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, The Rock, Cedric the Entertainer, etc., so I wanted to like this movie, but it never seemed to do anything. <br /> <br /> I saw Get Shorty and I did it. I'm not particularly interested in that. Too slow and without grace for me. This movie is certainly not better and, in any case, it is worse. There were many opportunities for some good comic moments, but it did not cost them anything. <br /> <br /> The performance was fine, but even John Travolta seemed subdued. Cedric was fine, but he was too kingship to be really fun. Vince Vaughn and The Rock were pretty good and they were ready to be fun, but they let everything pass by. I wish they had been given the opportunity to go ahead with the fun things they set up, but instead, they went back to the same old thing and reconfigured Vaughn and Rock to be fun (although they were never allowed to deliver that ). punchline or comedy). <br /> <br /> In general, this was a very disappointing movie and I'm glad that I only saw it on video. At least it was cheaper than the theater.
