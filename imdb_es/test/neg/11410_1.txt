I've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times, and it really gets more fun every time. Perhaps what I enjoy most are the tired character paradigms that the film offers us: the grim American male protagonist, his blonde girlfriend, the theater nerd with glasses, a brunette girl, the antagonistic athlete and the brunette girl # 2. , then we are presented with two martial arts experts from magicians with mullets driving a convertible. If someone can explain it, please contact me. Among other highlights is Bobby Johnston's portrayal of Jock's character, Dell and his trademark line: "That's why I keep it close." Seeing Johnston's performance, it's no wonder that his career quickly descended into the soft-core porn arena. (SPOILER) Also, after several visualizations, I STILL have absolutely no idea what the great demon says at the end at any time; It's just electronically damped noise. Oh well, that's probably for the better. And finally, why are all the demons so slippery? Is wet skin more scary? It certainly did not help in this movie.
