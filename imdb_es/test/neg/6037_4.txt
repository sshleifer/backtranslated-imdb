This story of a good boy against the evil tyrant, set in nineteenth-century Russia, may have been an attempt to extend the career of Steve Reeves beyond those "Hercules" movies. However, despite the different costumes, it is still a "Hercules" movie with the usual forced dialogue, random dubbing and cardboard characters. On the other hand, there is a lot of action, the rhythm rarely marks the flags, and Reeves can do another one of those scenes in which he undid his waist, tied with ropes and was given a vigorous whip that, needless to say, , has little effect on his challenging character.
