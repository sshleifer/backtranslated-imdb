They did it again: they ripped out the title of an old program and then destroyed the nostalgia with boring "re-imagined" things. The caricature of the 60s was one of the funniest of its time, a satire of comic superheroes of good character. The character was drawn as a half way between animal and human, as is Mickey Mouse. Here they use a real beagle; that's almost the same as making a Mickey Mouse watch with a real rat. <br /> <br /> Most of the smart list that made the original show fun was missing in this movie. Instead, we have a clumsy former police dog that is even dumber than the cad. And some pet owners that do not add anything to the story. Effects of cheese (the animation of talking about the dog is shameful). Poor scripting A stereotyped dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister. The guy in the gravel noise box they hired to express to Underdog is painful. One would think that at least they got an impressionist voice to approach the humorous voice of Wally Cox for Underdog. But no. There are, at least, some affective references to the source material (such as the rhyme lines), which elevate it to a 4. <br /> <br /> Only young children who love dogs can enjoy this. Everyone else should get a DVD of the original cartoon series. Look at this alone in despair.
