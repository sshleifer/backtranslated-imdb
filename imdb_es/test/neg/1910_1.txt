I had been looking forward to seeing this movie, but when I finally had the opportunity, I felt very disappointed. I had to stop halfway (or was I in a room?) Due to bad script and direction. Not to mention the poor cast! Josh Hartnett is the only one who can act, and is much more suited to be the hero of the story. <br /> <br /> Well, basically the story is about a loose girl from the country who cheated on her for a long time. -both decent boyfriend just to have nonsense sex with a spoiled rich brat. This movie did not manage to attract my sympathy, not even when the writer intended to do so. I wonder where the moral values ​​will go. <br /> <br /> The actors are so rigid that when I replay the movie (a few weeks after it was interrupted due to its boring nature), they still did not pay attention to me. The pampered couple can only dislike me! What movie! <br /> <br /> I think all the people involved in this production need to sit down and review them together so they do not make the same mistakes next time. And next time you could consider Josh Hartnett as the protagonist ...
