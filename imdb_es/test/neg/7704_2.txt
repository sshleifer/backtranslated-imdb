This movie is played as an insane episode of "Where Are They Now", or "Behind The Music" by VH1. In the first half of the film (which represents her "glory days"), Abbie Hoffman is involuntarily portrayed as a kind of delirious rock star. You know the guy The lead singer, the nice guy, who did not write any of the music, he has no idea, but he gets all the glory for nothing and the free chicks. Consequently, he takes his success for granted, mistreating him and, ultimately, destroying him with himself. In fact, Hoffman's glory days ended abruptly when he was arrested for dealing in cocaine, bailed, and hid. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film is about that hidden time. In it we see Hoffman as a pathetic crybaby who incessantly blames everyone, everyone, himself for his fall. Eventually the times pass completely; and he can never face that. How sad. THE END. The final credits end and OH NO! We learn that Abbie Hoffman finally committed suicide in 1989. <br /> <br /> I am sure that this is not the image that the filmmakers thought for Hoffman when making this film. Given that Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefcourt were involved, I am sure that this film was a tribute to the life of a man who, after all, was an icon of the 60s and the movement against the war on the left. In this they have failed miserably. The film presents Abbie Hoffman as a meaningless caricature. We are never told what drives it. How did you come to your points of view? How did you manage to capture the imagination of an entire generation? How did you organize such a vast movement? Why at the height of his fame was he involved in dealing with cocaine? Why? Who knows, and since the filmmakers do not seem, ultimately, who cares?
