How could someone who liked JP's previous films, even stand to sit during this hour of nonsense? There are so many stupid things about this movie that it's amazing! I remember when I went to see JP as a child, it was my favorite movie and franchise, the performance, the SFX the Music, the direction! all fantastic, JP2 in my opinion was fine, almost the same, apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast kicking a raptor ... please!) but in general an observable and reasonable cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> But the third one has no point! It is supposed to be a continuation of Carry's from JP2 and, nevertheless, magically includes new things in the franchise that would have been impossible to lose in the 2 previous films. for example: 1) The "new" mega Spinosaurus: seriously, what the hell! This follows them everywhere they go, they can not escape from their presence and yet, in The Lost World (the same island), do they see it once? Do you hear? Does anyone even mention it? DO NOT! It's ridiculous!. The star character in the 2 previous films was, and always will be the T-Rex, so, what does the d (urr) director "Joe Johnston"? Kill him! As soon as you see the huge T-Rex in all its amazing glory, it dies and you never see it again, a new Dino in the city is the excuse ... where did it come from? Not a single explanation! And do not make me start with the whole satellite phone thing in Dino-belly! 2) Just when you start overcoming how stupid Spinosaurus is, you see the Raptors, apart from their new "Punk" haircuts, they look pretty believable! * Phew * will make this movie visible, right? ... INCORRECT! Now they talk to each other !! and the excuse for them to speak in this film and not in the First and the second are ... wait ... Evolution! - yes, the process of millions of years in just a few months since the second movie ended, incredible! For now they should have grown opposable thumbs and created tools. Okay, I'm not going to say anything about the plot because it's raising my nose, so I'll take care of this: Jurassic Park is a classic, JP3 is bad luck for any of the original followers of the series, my favorite franchise I was well and truly dead after seeing this monstrosity (I did not intend to play any games) Avoid this movie like the plague
