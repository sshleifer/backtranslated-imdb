This movie is a great movie ONLY if you need something to sit down and laugh at the stupidity. As a geologist, this film is mistaken in most important events and uses actors who are too young to even be considered at the top of their fields. It is interesting how the lava that erupts in massive caves below the surface of the Earth is shown. It is also curious how it is shown that the seismically active areas have a massive destruction of an earthquake of magnitude 6.5. They seem to forget that the construction standards in these areas would be higher and they would need a bigger earthquake to cause a lot of damage. It's also funny how much they make the coastline of the state of Washington and also of Oregon look like beautiful beaches in Southern California. The jelly donut analogy is very entertaining, even if the way it is used is incorrect. The director does a good job adding more comic relief with the 2 "supposed" PhDs.
