This is probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Independent or not, solid writing is a must. The same goes for direction and acting. I know that these actors can act (I've seen them in Sporanos and more ...) but this movie is very bad, very bad. Maybe it's the script, maybe it's the director. Probably a bit of both ..... Probably a lot of both! Technically good, just bad, bad, bad ... I have a theory that the sponsors of this movie also own the Poker magazines, because I saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines. "Hey, we did it, so it has to be good, right?" Not so fast Bucky. I know it takes a lot of work and money to even make a movie, let alone sell it and distribute it, and that's why I congratulate these people. But the final product leaves a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> P.S. I won a free rental and I chose this Blockbuster movie. Tomorrow I will recover my money.
