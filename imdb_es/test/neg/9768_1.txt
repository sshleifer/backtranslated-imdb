This movie is absolutely horrible! I thought because I had good actors like Gabrielle Union, Hill Harper and, of course, the infamous Billy D. Williams. The film is long, and it is prolonged with a documentary style of showing Gabrielle Union, who died in the movie, talking about her family; which by the way is a confusing family because you never know who is who and who is related to whom. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I wish I could return it from where I got it. I fell asleep once in a while from boredom. Do not waste your time or money on this movie. I could have been more faithful to life with more drama and less boredom.
