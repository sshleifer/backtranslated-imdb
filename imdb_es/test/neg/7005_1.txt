I had heard about this movie through a friend, it was supposed to be a thriller, but what I saw was not a "thriller". It was more like a weak attempt of one. Amber Smith was a bright spot, that could be giving her too much credit. The scenes in which she was in bed with the actress Erika Michels were also lame. The two actresses did not seem to click on each other at all. Amber Smith was out of this girl's league, and she definitely showed up on camera. She did not seem in those scenes at all. I was disappointed because a friend of mine, of course, had encouraged this movie to be something "great", but in reality it was more like watching pornography from a ten-cent shop.
