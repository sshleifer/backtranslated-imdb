The film begins with a cult leader who tries to resurrect a dead member with his followers singing for his rebirth when the sun hits them in the desert. Reanhauer (Bill Roy) believes with all his heart in his power, and he gets so nervous that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack. Unable to keep him alive, all involved, doctors and nurses, are sentenced for attacks with the demonic spirit of Reanhauer invading the curvy body of Nurse Sherri (Jill Jacobson, big-breasted), pointing to each of them, using it as a tool of revenge. Forced against her will, without the memory of having caused such damage, the murders of Sherri's body selected the victims. Fortunately, Sherri's co-worker, nurse Tara (Marilyn Joi) begins a fairly flourishing romance with a blind patient, Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden), who was once a football star player, whose mother was a practicing voodoo. Through the knowledge of Marcus, transmitted by his mother, Tara discovers the possession and how to possibly save Sherri before murdering everyone without knowing it. Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond (Geoffrey Land) worries about his current state and well-being. <br /> <br /> Well, this was my first Al Adamson movie and I must agree with its detractors that, just for this movie alone, it seems that it keeps them together with clips and Elmer's glue. The animation with which we see that the spirit takes control of Sherri is more than horrible and quite ridiculous. A little soft core nonsense like stuffing, a demonic possession thrown into the mix (Sherri actually speaks to another voice when she's possessed), with a naughty nurse behavior (... the three nurses focused on the movie are sexually active and free) -spired) and a little violence / gore. The film is essentially recorded in small rooms with boring dialogues of a fairly mundane cast. Sexual situations are not that hard and Al often shoots them without revealing too much. The film seems embarrassingly cheap and there is an absence of emotions, although the chilling score (... that sounds like something from Dark Shadows) helps a bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass (... like Nurse Beth, who seems to be a nymphomaniac, if she dares to ruin a madwoman, always complaining about diseases she does not really have, with enough chest hair to declare it Neanderthal ) They are not It looks bad, and the plot of Adamson, although fragile, is somewhat coherent (... it seems that rarely directs the films that are). In general, the movie seems to cost $ 5 and Adamson simply can not overcome the budget constraints (... or, in my opinion, create a sufficiently unpleasant environment due to a sometimes submissive narrative and tedious scenes that do little for the story ). John F. Goff has the role of psychiatrist at the hospital who wants to commit Sherri, without believing the idea that she was possessed, he always fights with Peter for her. I saw the "lost" version without qualifying that I think it's the real version to see from Nurse Sherri.
