The acting was bad, and the plot, well, I do not think there is one. <br /> <br /> A fat blond guy who is always dressed in a dinner outfit, kidnaps a kind of a nightclub, I think he kills a copper then. then fights happen without meaning The kidnapped girl is put in a cage in a boat, why? An intransigent trained martial arts policeman shows up, speaks bad English and does things that do not make sense. Your full gut. But he has a good car. Christ on a bicycle, this movie was a waste of 90 minutes.
