It was not long after Halloween had started the rise of the pitchers for the category to be cursed by the continued mediocrity. Already in 1983, the genre was already struggling to launch more than three decent offers per year and, in 88, the harassment and the film cut had become virtually the scourge of horror movies. By then, all major studios knew that repeating the tired formula was no longer a lucrative direction, leaving independent filmmakers and mostly inexperienced ones to continue the legacy that John Carpenter had created. Although there were still an impressive number of features on the shelves at 88, most of them were produced weakly and, on the whole, were eminently unattractive. That said, there were a couple of gems in the rubble. Scott Spiegel's Intruder in its uncut form was a magnificent classic, while Evil Dead Trap proved that the cycle had not yet been completely without style and style. William Lustig's Maniac Cop was successful enough to launch a franchise and two years later, Dead Girls and Mirage proved to be the last breath of life in the sick category. <br /> <br /> It was Schlock's continuous release as Berserker Blood Lake and Rush Week, which cursed the slasher movie to eight years of darkness. Finally, he took the great budgeted extravagance of Wes Craven's cry to provide the necessary resuscitation. Since I had not heard anything about the Demon Warrior before I discovered it unexpectedly, I instantly assumed it was part of the low brow debris that led to the fall of the slasher phase. But with that said, the film has an intriguing premise that sits comfortably next to Scalps and Camping Del Terrore as another welcome addition to the catalog with Native American influence. <br /> <br /> A truck stops on a wooded road and leaves. Two ridiculously dramatized rednecks. Hillbilly's lumberjacks are only on the screen for about ten seconds and then are killed by an invisible threat. Next, we find a group of five young adults heading to the same place for a target practice spot on some of the local wild animals. The area is owned by Neil Willard and has been transmitted through three generations of his family. His grandfather stole the land from an Indian healer who was rumored to have left a curse on the property. According to the legend, every ten years a demonic warrior with an extreme hatred for humanity lurks the forest harvesting revenge on those he considers responsible for the theft of the tribe's house. It would not be much fun if those myths were a falsehood, as regular as the clock of a maniac killer appears with a taste for blood. Can children stop this ghost killer ??? <br /> <br /> Demon Warrior is best described as a new (but unfortunately cheap) budgeted image of Fred Olen Ray's Scalps. The ghosts of both films are virtually identical and the director even releases a sequence to confirm my suspicions. Things start in a promising way with a little Friday, the first-person cinematography of the 13th style and a couple of shakes that were delicately composed by director Frank Patterson. Thomas Callaway did a good job with photography and the tribal drum score makes a refreshing change from the more traditional synthesizer trash of the late eighties. The suspense sites are juxtaposed with a pair of credible leadership ornaments and there are even some attempts at humor. The killer was seen with spooky success in demon clothing and the inclusion of a bow and arrow as the main weapon for the murder was a skillful touch of the director. <br /> <br /> The notorious killer of Fred Olen Ray was notable for his marked and credibly disturbing atmosphere. Unfortunately, despite being produced with double the budget, Demon Warrior never comes close to the film he emulates so desperately. It is rumored that most of the actors were selected from the University of Texas Baylor and that they were not even paid for their inclusion in the show, so, of course, it goes without saying that the dramatic ones are appropriately abysmal. Especially I enjoyed the hilarious John Langione ?? An "Italian" Native American (do not ask) that portrays as much emotion as the trees in the surrounding forest. Warrior started with some credible views of the director's attitude, which actually made me believe that this could be a welcome inclusion to the slasher index. Unfortunately, the poisonous cocktail of atrocious performance and an ending straight out of stupidsville seriously changed the initial plan he had in mind for a qualification. It is a pity that the dramatic ones were so dragged from the bottom of the theatrical canyon, because sometimes Demon Warrior showed flashes of potential. <br /> <br /> In general, is Patterson's film a mixture of ideas? some of them were good, but for the most part they were surprisingly mediocre. Because this was launched at a time when the slasher genre had been diluted to avoid the happy censors of scissors, there is really no gore worth mentioning. Even the scalping sequence is relatively moderate compared to the graphic representation of Olen Ray. Demon Warrior has the strange moment of credibility, but not enough to justify a purchase. It's not as bad as the aforementioned Berserker, Blood Lake et al, but it's not really that good either ?? ..
