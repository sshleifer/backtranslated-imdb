I received this movie as a birthday present because all my friends know that I am a big fan of low budget horror movies. Kaufman's studios have always made the gory bloody movies they delivered. I loved watching his movies at home on rainy nights with my family ... until I saw Bugged ... WHAT HAPPENED? <br /> <br /> This movie started with a pretty good concept about bug mutation and it was even added. a bit of comedy, but in general the writing is bad and that was the number one mistake. Ronald K. Armstrong should learn to be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker. After reading the Credits, we discovered that the most important role in the film was given. two words Mr. Director "Classes of action" Okay? Mr. Armstrong joins the ranks of other writers / directors who throw themselves into their own films and that is the number two mistake. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I thought saved this film was the artistic work of the camera and the musical score, (let's hear it for the team!) The cast of other actors that at the beginning of this production seemed like a A little cold, really warmed towards the middle and at the end of this production. They all came together and helped to make this movie. Ronald Armstrong may lack the talent to become a decent director or actor, but, I will say this about him: he seems to know how to organize people to join and start their productions. <br /> <This film, I must say, can be an inspiration for any young filmmaker who dreams of making his own film, because if Mr. Armstrong was able to achieve this, anyone else can do it too. If you have the opportunity to see this movie, look at it to inspire you and make "Better" in the future. Hollywood needs bigger and better Horror movies to keep this genre coming back from its grave.
