I love TPBs, but this was a boring episode. I did not have the same feeling as the series or the movie. It seemed he had hurriedly gotten up. I did not enjoy it at all. The so-called performance was horrible. The cast appeared as if they knew it was an episode of hoarding money to get to the market quickly. I hope we do not have an Easter special next because that will be all for me. The writing of this episode was definitely the worst of Mike Clattenburg in the history of this show. The management left a lot to be desired and I almost felt bad for the cast and crew of this weak attempt at a Christmas special. Like I said, I love TPBs, but this one goes to the trash.
