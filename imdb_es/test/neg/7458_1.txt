Everything about this movie is bad. all. Ridiculous haircuts from the 80s. Ridiculous mustaches. Ridiculous action and fight scenes where you can see that the adversaries do not even hit each other. Bad, bad, bad music from the 80s. Repeated scenes of people running through the woods. A bad boy with a silvery plastic hand and silly hair. Stupid dialogue. The performance is non-existent. Everything seems extremely cheap. This film even exceeds "Plan 9 of outer space" in its complete evil. <br /> <br /> It's not "funny", it's just bad.
