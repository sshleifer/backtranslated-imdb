Oh wow, the character shares my name name! Nick! This movie is as bad as the first, if not worse. Well, at least there is a real octopus in this movie. A real octopus that makes a better appearance in this film. For the better, I mean, "longer" the performance is quite dry and it is difficult to sit through. Just so you know, when I finish this ninety minute movie, not only will you be released from your couch, but you will have the ability to breathe. Not only that, but you realize how stupid you are and then you kill yourself, realizing how horrible life is after watching this movie. It really shows how desperate horror films are today, more things are being done like this and where the hell have the true masters of horror been lately? This movie should have been the final straw, so we can recover movie geniuses in horror movies, which could make some GOOD modern horror movies, this movie is bitten.
