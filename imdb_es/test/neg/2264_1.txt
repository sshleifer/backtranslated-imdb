As an avid Gone With the Wind fan, I was disappointed to see the original movie and see that many important characters had been left out. Luckily, the movie itself was a wonderful piece. When the book Scarlett came out, I read it with the hope of following two of my favorite literary characters further on their journey together. Although the book lacks true quality, it is still a good story and, while I was able to separate it from the original, it was and still is pleasant. However, I consider that the six hours I spent watching the "Scarlett" miniseries were some of the worst hours of my life. By discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder and ill-formed relationships of which even the book Scarlett stayed away . The cast of many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and the film, and even took place in the second book, and again put aside at least one character incredibly crucial. In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her ex-husband, Rhett Butler, to Charleston on the pretext of visiting the extended family. After reaching an "agreement" with Rhett, she agrees to leave and reconnects with her relatives O'Hara in Savannah. Finally, she accompanies her cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood, to Ireland, to further explore the "deepening roots" of her family, and is eventually called "La O 'Hara", the head of the family. While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her city of Ballyhara, Scarlett delves into the world of English landowners, and instantly becomes a guest at many of her parties. She, having been despised by Rhett again and again, eventually agrees to marry Luke, the Earl of Fenton, until Rhett appears in a cliché "night on white horse", as a ransom. The miniseries "Scarlett" does not even do this justice. Violated by her fiancé and despised by her family, the series shows Scarlett imprisoned after being accused of a murder her cousin committed. <br /> <br /> I advise all who are thinking of spending the day seeing this to reconsider this decision. .
