Like 'Singin' in the Rain ',' Cover Girl 'has a trio of two men and one girl. In 'Cover Girl', Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief. It corresponds to the funny man part of Donald O'Connor in 'Singin in the Rain'. In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in 'Rain', it's Debbie Reynolds. That's where the comparison ends. <br /> <br /> While "Singin 'the Rain" is a classic American musical film,' Cover Girl 'is an embodiment of mediocrity. The story is not very complicated. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a dancer at Danny MacGuire's low-cost nightclub in Brooklyn. Rusty decides to participate in a Cover Girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher, John Coudair, who did an unsuccessful play for Rusty's grandmother years ago. Coudair introduces Rusty to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton Danny feels underestimated when Rusty starts being late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club and go to the road entertaining the troops along with his partner Genius. At the last minute, with Rusty. At the altar with Noel, she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to Danny. They live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly has the least developed role in the film. All we discover about him is that he owns a nightclub and is crazy in love with rusty. Coudair and Wheaton act like teenagers in love with Rusty and Phil Silvers offers some completely ridiculous but ungraceful tricks. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. This prefigures what happened to him in real life. Anyone who has read his biography will learn that he did not like Hollywood, that he regretted having a normal home life that he could never reach, but eventually he began to drink and ended Alzheimer's throughout his life during the last years of his life. <br /> <br /> Almost all Cover Girl songs are outdated and not very melodious. Gene Kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that is the scene where she dances with her "alter ego". Before, the trio has another number that is a pale precursor to 'Make em Laugh' from 'Singin' in the Rain '. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way Rita Hayworth puts herself on a pedestal. A couple of decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. The two actresses later in their careers always tried to find scripts that showed their acting skills. They wanted to be known as "actresses" and not as "pinup girls". Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.
