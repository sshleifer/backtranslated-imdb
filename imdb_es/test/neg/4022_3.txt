What was this, a Zucker brothers movie? I do not mind a bit of humor in my Holmes (I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder's "The Private Life of SH"), but this version of "The Sign of Four" feels like an episode of Grand-Guignol-esque's " Murder, She Wrote "(from the opening credits, which are the worst possible type: a montage of scenes from the film), as directed by Mel Brooks. Ian Richardson is a good actor, and he certainly seems to be the role (he's crazy for The Strand's drawings!), But his interpretation of the character is totally wrong and too humorous, because of the silly smile he often shows (I thought La The drug that Holmes was using was cocaine, not the weed, his expressions of comic rigidity in the carnival sequences, not to mention that when he disguises himself as an old man, it is so exaggerated that in spite of the fine makeup, we recognize him instantly. Healy is not memorable but, given the circumstances, Watson is acceptable and not a buffoon too ... at least no more than the rest of the characters Cherie Lunghi (Excalibur) plays Mary Morstan in an exaggerated and naive way directly from a vaudeville from the 1930s. <br /> <br /> As for the story, there are some nonsense additions (like giving vampire Tonga teeth, an appetite for raw meat and a carnival hole as a place for live, turning it into a rejection of the Island of Dr. Moreau), and we are even denied the pleasure of discovering the mystery with Holmes, since we are well informed of everything before Holmes discovers it. And this is full of tired clich√©s: not only do we receive the famous slogan "Elemental, my dear Watson" (which, as any Sherlockian will know, Conan Doyle never wrote), but we are exposed to places as common as Hindi music. Appears out of nowhere when Holmes goes to see a white man in Hindi clothes. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: in Britain, in the 1980s, two rival television companies tried to create a long series of Sherlock Holmes adaptations, and produced initial TV movies as potential pilots. One of them starred Ian Richardson, the other starred Jeremy Brett. Fortunately, the one that made its way into several episodes was the good one! <br /> <br /> 3/10. Parody.
