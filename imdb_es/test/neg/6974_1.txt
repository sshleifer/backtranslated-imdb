"Glen or Glenda" was Edward D. Wood Jr.'s first attempt to direct a film. For this, he chose a theme close and dear to his heart ... transvestism, the "art" of a man who wants to dress in women's clothes. To his credit, Wood tried to deal with a subject that was largely taboo in 1953. Unfortunately, Wood had neither the budget nor the knowledge to make the film. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a Bela Lugosi prologue that makes little sense and then moves towards the discovery of a dead Glen / Glenda transvestite (Daniel Davis, also known as Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot) with the help of psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell) tries to understand why a man would want to live (and die) in this way. <br /> <br /> Glen is engaged to Barbara (Dolores Fuller) and refuses to tell her about his obsession. And that is. We see countless archive footage of all sorts of things, from highway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach, interspersed with shots of Wood walking down the street dressed as Glen or Glenda and looking nostalgically at the clothes Women in the shop window. Poor Bela, who had bad luck and became friends with Wood, continues to appear throughout history. I'm not 100% sure, but I think the Bela scenes were added by their name value after the body of the film was completed. <br /> <br /> To add to the confusion of Lugosi's narrative, Farrell as Dr. Alton also provides off-screen narration. Lugosi keeps saying, bevare, bevare ... take care of yourself, take care of yourself, as well as, some bad words about snakes and snails and puppy tails. <br /> <br /> The story is also about a successful transvestite. sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and the characters of Wood. The dream sequences are laughable. A wedding sequence in which someone appears disguised as a devil is a good example. Wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors (?) Completely dressed but leaving little to the imagination, risky for 1953. <br /> <br /> This movie, along with other "classics" by Wood, was so bad that they became Embraced by the public as cult classics over the years. For that reason, they have survived to this day.
