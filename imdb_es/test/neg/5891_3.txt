I honestly expected more from this movie. That may have been the problem. There was not a single time when the camera was motionless. In the close-ups, the camera trembles, the subjects move and my head hurts. The cuts are so often and so fast, that the viewer often finds himself wondering what just happened. (BEWARE, SPOILER ALERT) And at the end of the movie, when you expect to have a happy ending after having gone through so many useless thoughts to understand what happens, you end up losing. For me, this was a basically terrible movie, ruined by a cameraman with ADHD and without a meaningful significant plot.
