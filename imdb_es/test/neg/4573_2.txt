I love the strange animation, I love many Asian films, but I did not love this particular product from Japan. The Fuccons are supposedly an American family (they are all mannequins) that have moved to Japan, and are, in a way, a sitcom family of 50, with feelings a little more modern at times. The DVD presents several very short episodes (like less than 5 minutes each?) And it did not seem fun or entertaining, not even in a strange way. I'm not sure what the appeal of this is. Yes, I caught a satire here and there, gosh, who would not, but satire is usually a bit funny, is not it? And nothing that I saw or heard was qualified, even with a small smile. I chose this used and it certainly sounded appealing, but I guess either I'm missing the point or it's just LAME. The box even says it's hilarious Fuccon, right there in the front, but I allow myself to disagree. 2 out of 10
