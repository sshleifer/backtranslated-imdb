4 realz son my game iz mad tite I can not wait 2 go up to the program and roll it up in da club n do it real 905 wit style crazy models n bottles, son! <br /> <br /> No, I'm a joke. This is a sad spectacle, created by, and for the enjoyment of, sad men. Men who are so neutralized by modern existence that channel their frustration towards the clubs, where they perform a fleeting self-validation that takes advantage of the chicks with the hope that their little ones will get excited to try to put out the ardor of loneliness and Make them feel, even if only for one night, as if their seat on the Board of the Sausage Party in Toronto is a little less permanent. <br /> <br /> I read some comments here saying that this program represents Canadian television sets that have finally stood up to be on par with American TVs or something else. Well, that's not short at all. It's like, yes! Give yourself a pat on the back, Canada: finally deciphered the elusive formula for innovative US content such as "Studs", "Change of Heart", "Elimidate" and "The Fifth Wheel". Look, the real creation here is to hit "... meets Candid Camera" on the pitch. Genius. And there is nothing that extends in that thin line between fratboy camaraderie and latent homosexuality as a group of adult men who are recorded on a hidden camera, admiring the "game" of each one in the club. The love of the man on display here is so palpable that you should really consider going back to playing it "Keys to the steam bath". <br /> <br /> On a side note, how interesting that the people who gave this show seem so brilliant to have registered an IMDb account for the express purpose of doing it (I guess I am guilty of using the same means to do the opposite here). My personal favorite is the only enthusiastic reviewer who claims to be from "United States" who says "It is now clear that talent in Canada has the ability to produce American quality television." <br /> <br /> Soft. <br /> <br /> But why bother making buzz online? After all, you really can not be canceled: you're on Comedy Network in Canada, baby! The public that sees it will continue to ignore its program for years to come. Most likely, he's fine, comfortably navigating the proverbial plain of mediocrity with most of Comedy Network's original programming.
