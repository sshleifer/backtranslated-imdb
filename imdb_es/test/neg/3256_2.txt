When a hardworking businessman from a prestigious country club is turned down, a battle begins between the members and finally the purchase of Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and turns it into a theme park / golf course where everyone can join. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, but sometimes it's a bit funny. Almost all comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes except for Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase plays one of his best roles as Ty Webb for the second time and makes it great. Not only is he the funniest character in the movie, he is the only funny character in the movie. Even Dan Akroyd fails to humor this film, which aspires to be a great sequel to a classic comedy, but falls into rubble with others shown on Comedy Central. The film could have been better if Ty Webb (Chase) had a more important role, but instead it was reduced to a secondary character and the star became Jackie Mason (Who ??). They should have recovered the entire cast and made a sequel. right way! This is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to a great movie. In general, Caddyshack II is comical but it is a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
