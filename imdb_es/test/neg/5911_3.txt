I just read the other comments here, and I was a little surprised to find out that nobody had said anything about the performance or the plot. <br /> <br /> Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy can offer an incredible stand-up comedy show. Great actors are not. It's enough. <br /> <br /> As for the plot? Oh man Every time the film tries to "trick" you into believing that good guys are going to lose, you know those scenes: "What, good men lose? Oh ... I see, it was just a trick", is done . So terribly bad, you can see it a mile away. <br /> <br /> He had 2 or 3 fun moments, but not enough to save the day. <br /> <br /> It's a bit silly that these comments should be 10 lines now. Many people will fill it with garbage, to be eligible. Being short is an art.
