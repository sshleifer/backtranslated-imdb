This movie is supposedly a comedy. So, where did all the laughter go? He forgot to put them in the version I saw. Like a football movie, it's a little entertaining, I suppose. Maybe it's a stick in the mud, without a perceptible sense of humor. Or maybe this movie is not funny. It's also annoying, with that way above the "you're a winner" musical score. And the strange thing is that the team surpassed it. Most of the season, only winning the last two games, and the last game did not mean anything since they were not in the playoffs. What is the point? Are they celebrating mediocrity? I do not see it. If anyone knows, let me know. Anyway, this movie is not very good or very good.
