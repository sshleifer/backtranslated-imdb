In short, I was very surprised. I'm a big fan of Asian Horror, and I can see the originality (I myself enjoyed "The Red Shoes" and "Phone"), but this was just bad. <br /> <br /> The film has many elements that are very high quality: photography is striking, the image is great, the direction is inspired, the performance is quite good, the music is easy for the ears and the CGI is incredible. But, since it is a horror movie, we are expected to be afraid, which will not happen with this movie. As with most South Korean horrors, this is not original almost from beginning to end: there is the characteristic vengeful ghost of long hair, sinister clusters of thick, black hair and puddles of water, and almost at the end, a twist that * almost *, but this does not make much sense (the spin is easily one of the best qualities). And to the irritation of the viewer, when the film is not recycling (sometimes, so accurately that it could be easily nicknamed as plagiarized) the images of other movies, makes you jump. Much. And, by jumps, I do not mean that things jump or nothing, just VERY loud noises and shrieks in the soundtrack that is used to make the audience increase six feet in the air (there are even some moments of "jump jump" which are simply infuriating). And when it's not a scam to other movies, it's boring and hard to read. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame, because "Ryeong" could have been really good, and has everything to do. It's good, but it's the annoying excessive use of completely predictable and scary noises that finally ruin the movie. A perfect example of how good it could have been: there is a moment when one of the characters is looking at a corpse, and without a sound, the corpse looks back. It is totally predictable, but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant. And unfortunately, that's as scary as the movie gave me. <br /> <br /> It is true that "Ryeong" has some good characteristics, and even a couple of jumps that are not so predictable, and they work. There is a very good and sad background story that is used to explain the events, and the turn is quite unpredictable. Those are the only things that separate the movie from any other Asian ghost / horror movie. But the problem with this is that, although they work, they have been used before (J-Horror fans will easily realize that the great revelation was inspired by "A Tale of Two Sisters"), and take the story background as a good idea. Fifty minutes to start. <br /> <br /> So in the end, "Ryong" really seems like a really wasted opportunity. Tae-kyeong Kim hoped that the plot's spin and other good features would act as deviations, so that the audience would not notice the huge flaws. But he failed, and well ... We realized everything. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10.
