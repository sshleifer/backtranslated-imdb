I like most of the Full Moon Pictures, so I ordered this movie from the USA. UU., Because in Germany you can not get it anywhere. I thought it would be as nice and fun as the subspecies or the Puppetmaster series, because they were full of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was glad when the movie finally arrived. <br /> <br /> But after watching this corny movie, I was very disappointed. The actors (I think you can not even say actors) are boring and without talent. The story was a poor performance and even the set and the monster were very cheap and miserable. <br /> <br /> I hope no one makes a sequel or a new version of this terrible movie. :-)
