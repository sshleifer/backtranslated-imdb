European films may have a slower pace and be less plot-based than American films, but this takes too far. It also shows a lot of sketchy characters drawn doing unexplainable things. It is not a fantasy, it is not even surreal, it is simply uncomfortable and bad. <br /> <br /> What is the message here? That people in France are pensive and look morose a lot? What do you like to see other people having sex? Do they shout or spontaneously touch a stranger in their neck? Do not use a watch when you watch this movie, as you will be surprised at how little is explained or learned in large stretches of time. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a "superintendent of police" who is deeply concerned about the brutal murder of a girl, although in reality he seems worried before that. Not only is he bothered by his personal tragedies, but he is apparently mentally quite slow, behaving like a six-year-old with learning disabilities. He stares hard, walks with rigid arms like a small child, speaks in a docile tone, timidly, behaves quite strangely in all his interactions (although no one seems to notice or worry, even when it is supposed to be a matter of police ). He is not a policeman with problems, rather an outpatient. Imagine the character Latka by Andy Kaufman in Taxi, but without humor. Not only is he not credible as a policeman, he is not credible as an adult. The fact that he has won a prize for this interpretation of his character is really amazing, unless he interpreted the paper as it is written and it is the fault of the rare people who wrote this. The plot is clearly secondary. Do not expect to see anything as remote as what the police would do if a murdered girl were found. This is not so important, although the implausibility of his behavior is somewhat insulting. The problem is that the rest of the movie does not make sense either. That leaves the long and persistent close-ups of the fields, orchards, faces of people, etc. The ending seemed especially ridiculous to me, totally without the support of the events that preceded it, unless I thought: "What is the worst way this film could end?" <br /> <br /> There is a lot of sex and nudity, which is supposed to mean something. Do you want vaginas? You will see vaginas. Do not worry, it's art. It has a profound meaning, of which I am not sure. And the protagonist, despite his innocent rarity, seems to have some sort of homoerotic neck or double chin fetish. Finally, the subtitles are blank and often appear on a white background, very difficult for many to read. from them. On the other hand, there is not much dialogue, so this is not a big problem. There is also very little sound, not even the ambient sounds that you would expect to hear, in the movie, which contributes to the emptiness of the whole experience. Old Woody Allen would have had a field day parodying this work. <br /> <br /> That this is an award-winning movie is sad. I would hate to see the lost movies. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
