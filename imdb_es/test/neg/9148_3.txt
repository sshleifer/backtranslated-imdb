The positive aspects: it has exploded quite well. It has some interesting peripheral characters. Nice main character (although weak). <br /> <br /> The bad: plot / story. Edition. Wasted characters. Jessica Alba <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of sappy movies, but this movie is indifferent. I do not understand how anyone can deliver $ 12 million to this Guy Jenkin. And before I move on, I just want to say that I do not dislike Jessica Alba, I really wanted to like her in this movie. However, Jessica Alba in her fake accent and her model poses made me miserable. He has absolutely no presence on the screen in this movie, and ruins every scene he is in. It goes without saying that romance is not so credible (not even a little). <br /> <br /> All I saw in all was the actors flapping their wings, trying to get this out of the earth with what little they were given, but unfortunately, all that this movie does is sink. There is no emotional connection, there is no emotional conflict, and nothing is gained. It's a pretty empty movie.
