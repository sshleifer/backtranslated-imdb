Grosse Pointe Blank was really a movie below average. His hit man theme is very dry and is more of a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller. The acting is very normal. The performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters that seem very 'eccentric' and that really bothered me. The whole meeting and the 'Wow, I have not seen you in 10 years!' Element is extremely cheesy and many scenes are simply prolonged, especially when they are in the meeting and the characters go through each of their former classmates, one by one, greeting them. Everything just seemed very vulgar, useless and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd's role as a 'rival' killer is very slim. It seems that it only appears once at the beginning and just at the end in a "final show down" that is greatly promoted but does not appear at all. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very mediocre. . Most of the songs found in this movie are directly from the 1980s and with the exception of two or three, they are very bad. Listening to duff songs throughout a duff movie adds to the negativity that surrounds this movie. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on about how small the annoying and very bad things were, like the few action sequences. that came and went very quickly, the lack of development of the character and how badly everything was built in that department, in the way that half of the time he forgets that Cusak's character is even a hit man, since the element It is so nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Even the way that comedy thinks it's fun; but it's not. I did not laugh once during this movie. Sure, maybe I smiled from time to time, but my only point where I felt really good was when I realized that the movie was almost over. <br /> <br /> Please, do not waste your time with 'Grosse Pointe Blank' even though you have high IMDb Rating (but badly incorrect). I've seen movies that are better than this movie that have a lower rating on this site that tells you there are better movies out there. Just do not bother with this.
