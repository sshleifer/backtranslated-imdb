This is the only movie where I can think of where, after it ended, I was furious at the loss of time and money from me and everyone involved in doing it. No wonder Alan Moore refused to have anything to do with V for Vendetta (a phenomenal movie) after this debacle. <br /> <br /> It's not bad in an entertaining way, like Showgirls. It's bad in a way that makes you want to take your eyes out. Draw holes the size of planets. The worst script in memory. Horrible acting by decent actors. Images that should be great, but somehow flop. <br /> <br /> It could have been so good ...
