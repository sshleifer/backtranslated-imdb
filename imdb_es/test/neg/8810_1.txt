Danny Glover and Carey Elwes obviously forgot how to act when they made this movie, the acting is absolutely atrocious. The payment is even worse. I'm sorry for Danny Glover, I hope you've been well paid for this because it makes you look completely dumb, the same goes for Mr. Elwes. Negligible. This is probably the worst acting show of veteran actors I've seen. I wonder if they bothered to look at the script, or if they did, they should have said "forget about everything you know about acting" because this makes them look ridiculous. For two experienced veterans, acting in this way is frightening, I hope the paycheck was very big, I thought that, at first, it was a parody. If you can find satisfaction in this movie, then you will have more power for yourself.
