A film about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town in your ear should be a fun, romantic and simple entertainment. Instead, this film is more about things that are not said or expressed, so it reaches the point where you are grateful that something is said, even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - <br /> <br /> When the relationship that says more is the one you see the least on the screen (Danner and McEwan), you know you're in trouble. But those two actresses are a very welcome image in a movie that screams at some genuine people. <br /> <br /> END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> Capshaw has the task of creating a character of not much and she is not entirely successful. As I said before, the issue seems to be repression and I understand that It is an element of life and love, but I do not want to see a movie about it either, at least it is not. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this at all, despite the talented cast that are allowed to fend for themselves.
