The sound in this movie is a nightmare. That's the best I can say about this movie. Any chance of a good story is lost once this movie begins. The premise of the movie sounds good. A playboy who reaches an agreement with the people around him. The plot is predictable and very boring. The wet t-shirt contest may be the worst scene I've seen in my life and it's almost worth seeing in a Mystery Science deal. The sound is sometimes difficult to hear and the main actor seems unable to speak clearly. His accent makes it very difficult to understand. The only brilliant sport is the performance of Penelope Ann Miller. Her role is poorly developed, but she does it well. In short, do not waste your time.
