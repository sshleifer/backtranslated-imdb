I only saw this again last night and, to put it bluntly: "Style instead of substance". We can already guess that there had to be much more for Jerry Lee Lewis than shown here. The character of Jerry Lee Lewis in this movie is not represented as a real human being for one minute over the entire hour and a half plus execution time, but, again, all the other characters are just a pencil stroke be total cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> Let's take the beginning. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin, Jimmy Swaggart sneaking into the black jazz club and we see that Jerry is inspired. It could be possible. We see how the two cousins ​​choose different paths in life (it is also possible). Then we cut Jerry Lee playing the piano as an adult (now played by Dennis Quaid) and it's exciting and a little scary. Cut to a scene where you are for the first time with your second cousin, Myra. From that moment, everything becomes a recapitulation of certain events that take place in a style consistent with a high-speed newscast. <br /> <br /> It's not that the movie is not a little entertaining and it's great to listen to new versions of the songs that Jerry Lee did. Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart is also a reason why he should at least take a look at this, an indicator of his greatest successes in the coming years. Winona Ryder as Myra is the most famous character in the movie. She teases, sobs, chews gum and plays flirtatiously and that's it. Never, for a minute, is she given a reason why she ended up being the third Mrs. Lewis and talking about wives, where are the first two? That's why this really can not be classified as a biopic, but rather as an inaccurate news reel. We see Jerry perform his first song on the radio, we see that his second single goes to the top ten, we see that his third song goes to the no. 1 and so on. Then comes the inevitable fall. Absolutely, there is no basis in reality. <br /> <br /> To conclude another minor fight: the film takes place from '56 to '58 and still Myra says: "I only have 13" until the end.
