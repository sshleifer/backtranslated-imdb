Risably horrible. One might think that all the renowned actors involved in this movie would at least make it credible, but they do not, this is a stinker. <br /> <br /> Characters can run without a good reason. to know where they are going, or stand up with constipated faces when they should run for their lives. <br /> <br /> Verify the functions of your upper brain at the door if you intend to try to watch this movie. Or gather a group of your smartest friends and give the treatment "Mystery Science Theater 3000" to this. That's what I was doing during the second half of this turkey. <br /> <br /> AND PLEASE, do not confuse this with the excellent film "The Day of the Jackal", a suspense film far superior to that of 30 years ago.
