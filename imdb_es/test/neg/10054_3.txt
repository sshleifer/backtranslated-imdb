The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most absurd War Time scripts I've seen. Apart from the performance, which is made of wood, no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice tidy rows, in the middle of the roads, and with troops grouped with their unprepared arms. The constant suicidal behavior triggered my "tilt switch", so it was often impossible for me to enjoy the movie. Apparently, the writers and directors have never gone through a real war and have never bothered to bring an expert who has done so. This film is the antithesis of the excellent details of Saving Private Ryan. Unless you are under 7 years old, I recommend seeing something else. <br /> <br /> GB
