I just read an extra long review on the cover of this movie on this site and he explained in detail that this movie is only worth watching on the TV show "Mystery Science Theater 3000 !!!!!" And yes, I find that advice really useful! I mean, a movie that tries to be so good and exciting is not what that movie wants to be. So yes, watch this movie like you see on that show and, instead of giving this movie one star out of ten stars, you can give this one ten stars! Until then, my review of a star is only for the real, pure and untouched version of this movie. Do you have that now?
