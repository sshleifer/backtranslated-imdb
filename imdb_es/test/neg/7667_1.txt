There is a special sky reserved for people who make the world laugh. Along with Chaplin, Stan and Ollie, The Marx Bros and ..... (fill in your own special favorites) you should make room for everyone who is related to "Airport 80 - Concorde, the movie". Robert Wagner, in particular, exceeds all expectations that give the comedy of a lifetime. I never would have thought I had it in him. The only way it could have been more fun would have been to wear a red nose and a swiveling bow tie. The British moviegoers will recognize the fat Cannon and Ball who claims to be a Russian athlete, a good trick if he could have done it but, tragically, he could not. I have a 14-year-old labrador more athletic and almost as fun. George Kennedy, bless him, has a part that requires him to speak and move at the same time, and my God, triumph! The forehead wrinkled with an effort that pronounced a timeless dialogue, each word polished with love to become a cowardly shine. Only once in twenty years, Hollywood makes a movie like "Airport 80". All the years of work and struggle, sweat, tears, lessons with Lee Strasberg, living with suitcases, born in a trunk, etc., everything. It will create a work of art that will last as long as there are movies and machines to show them. I think I'm ready for my medication now.
