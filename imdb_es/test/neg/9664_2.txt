I do not think it really matters too much about the plot of this film, the most important thing you will notice is the lack of interest in the whole production. The performance is what you would get if you chose people randomly on the street. The sound is really annoying: a medicine cabinet closes with all the enthusiasm of a shot in your ear, while at the same time the dialogue is perhaps a fifth stronger. Several sounds on the set dominate the soundtrack to a large extent, and the dialogue occupies a distant background. The theme of the music sounds as if it had finished a quarter when the film was released, since large portions of the film do not have any music. Working with the camera can best be described as a knotty mess, with close-up shots where a medium angle would be much better, cameramen walking and pushing the camera in all directions, paying no attention at all to framing any scenes, they just filmed everything from any position it was more convenient for the cameraman to stand up. If the cameraman was a foot taller than the actors and you end up looking at the heads of everyone's head, well, so be it. The edition is just a butcher's job; Everything is pulled as abruptly as possible, nothing flows or transits in any sense of the word. I do not know if this was filmed on video or perhaps on a rented video camera, I tend to think it was the last thing. <br /> <br /> I only managed three quarters of the way before turning it off, I was so angry about the low quality of the production that I could not take it anymore. It's like a ninth grade audiovisual class project.
