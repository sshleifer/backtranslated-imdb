The script of this film is indistinguishable from others, especially The Core, another bad movie. It's pretty clear why Luke Perry does not have a lot of work, but seeing the beloved Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) resigned to something like this is simply sad. <br /> <br /> I really can not think about that. A plot twist you can not see coming a mile away. That is not an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very poor, even by TV standards. The lava flow at the beginning of the film that signals the global disaster that is approaching, initiates things at a very amateur level. And it does not get better from that moment.
