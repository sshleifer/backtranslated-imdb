There are so many things that are wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Weird accent by Jeff Bridges. <br /> <br /> Rita's ability to decipher the code of the password <br /> <br /> The complete script <br /> <br /> The end - especially the last scene when two coffees are brought to the table for Jeff and Rita and the editor. J & R laughs and says "We do not drink coffee anymore". Well, why did they order it then? Obviously they did it. If they did not and the waiter brought them coffee by default, there would have been three coffees. <br /> <br /> Total Tosh.
