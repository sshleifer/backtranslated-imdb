Okay, make no mistake: this is a pretty horrible movie, but actually I thought I had a couple of spooky scenes and got over their pathetic budget from time to time. At the very least, unintentionally, it's fun in some places and has a definite air of chill and discomfort (a scene that burns the face, the part with the disfigured girlfriend). <br /> <br /> This baby falls into the category "so bad that it's entertaining" for me, and that alone would give it a star. The effects are terrible, the performance is abysmal and everything seems to be shot in a day. You must also love that toy ship at the beginning! It brought back childhood memories of watching this on television at night many years ago. While the print of the Alpha DVD seems weak and as if it had been recorded directly from an old television broadcast or something like that, I actually liked that in this case!
