I love low budget movies. Including those that are intentionally or not intentionally funny, excess fake blood, violence, etc. <br /> <br /> This, however, is beyond stupidity. Once you see the ending, you'll say what the hell was the point of all the murder scenes with no one nearby (except in a couple) to witness them. And how the end really came about (I will not give the WHOLE story away for those stupid enough to really see this.) Grandma is like a psychic Jason First she's outside the window with a body and 15 seconds later she's in the fabric of the living room, all this is a configuration for a newcomer, they achieve graphic slaughter scenes, the knitting needles in their eyes, that only Chris Angel Mind Freak could achieve, and again, the ending was posterous 56 min of lost time I've seen one of the directors of other films and it was almost so bad Give me 20 thousand and I could do better This really deserves a big fat 0
