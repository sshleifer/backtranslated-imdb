I saw the MST3K version of this movie and it's a bad movie, but it's not as bad as its low IMDB rating (currently 1.8 out of 10). At least the movie has a few production values ​​and apparently had a competent editor (unlike the movies that are really horrible). The main problem with this movie is that it did not have any attractive character at all. The main character, Marv, is so pathetically grumpy, he practically asks about all the bad things that happen to him. And he is not very smart either, or he would have imagined staying away from the deceptive Betty girl. And even more pathetic that Marv is his father, who is nothing more than a drunken loser. The highlight of the film is the final robbery sequence, but even that is so weakly executed, any emotion that might have added to the film is completely absent. At least this movie was a very funny episode of MST3K, since Mike and the 'Bots do a great job making fun of it.
