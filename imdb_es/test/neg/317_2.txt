Three criminals disturb the grave of an ancient sorcerer who, after invoking Jack-O (a pumpkin-head figure less than threatening) to send such thugs, continues with his sworn revenge to kill all the deceased of the family that killed him. offended That includes young Sean Kelly and his horror-loving family. Of course, it's up to Sean to find a way to save the day. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid, low-budget B movie. The acting is atrocious and the plot is not much better. Launch an extremely lame killer, a possible pedophile who laughs too much and a couple of stereotyped "conservative" cardboard cutouts and you have this movie in a nutshell. It really is not worth saving time to see how well Linnea is aging. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Linnea Quigley is always good for some T & A and does not disappoint here with a long shower scene; Rachel Carter is also topless (although it could be a double body) <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
