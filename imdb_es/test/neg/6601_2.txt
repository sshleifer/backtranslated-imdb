The main word that comes to mind when considering this movie is "dubious". This is a low-quality film biography of one of the most iconic artists of all time. The glove deserved better. <br /> <br /> Before entering into the background of my thoughts on this biographical film, I must say that there are two things that seemed effective to me. First was the use of recordings and real interviews of fans at certain points in the film, especially in the scenes that represent the first set of accusations of child abuse. I feel that this contributed to a certain authenticity that was "severely" absent from the rest of the film. The second was the sequence that represents the courtship of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. I will not comment if I believe that the marriage was a farce, but according to many reports, it was a relationship in which there was care and affection between the two parties involved. That really was found in this movie; Flex Anderson and Krista Rae had enough decent chemistry to do it. These successful points are enough to keep Man in the Mirror away from the 1 star status. <br /> <br /> That said ... there was very little else here that worked. Very few of the actors resembled the people they were supposed to play, especially those who played Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson and Diana Ross. Also, the absence of Jackson's music was a great loss. How can you effectively tell a story about him without his music? I understand that they could not guarantee the rights of the same, since it is an unauthorized and low budget production; However, it seems that if you can not have the music of the man in a movie about him, it is better that you start and go home, because you are missing an extremely important part of the story of his life. <br /> <br /> The characterization of this Jackson movie also bothered me a little. I will not argue that he was worried and may have missed a bit of a valuable meal, but here, it was described as something akin to a mental disability. I do not think Jackson, known to have been a shrewd businessman, would have been as naive about how the adult world works as he did in this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the way this movie was written was nothing short of dishonorable. Many lines or exchanges of dialogues were extremely cheesy, such as the exchange of "Tinkerbell" by Michael and Janet, or nonsense, such as Michael's "Blanket of love" comments. Also, screenwriters do not exactly have a gift for subtlety. There was a lot of telegraphy of upcoming events ("What could go wrong?") And the extremely open hammering of the themes and motifs in the movie (if I had heard the word "believe" one more time ...). . This is what, ultimately, hindered the film as something that could be considered incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> Maybe when we are a few years, or even a decade or three, removed from Jackson's death, someone will be able to bring His story to life in a more deserving movie. By then, we could have a better perspective of his life, and someone can present a truly reflective examination of who Michael Jackson really was and what it meant to the world of entertainment. This very unreliable biopic was not that movie.
