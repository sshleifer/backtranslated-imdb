"Clubbed" is another 'will to do this'? He enters the British genre Fisticuffs and is sure to keep gamblers entertained who do not wait too moderately for ninety minutes after a few beers. However, for anyone looking for intelligent and quality entertainment, it is better to avoid it. <br /> <br /> There are so many wrong names in the heinous script that even an actor of Colin Salmon's caliber stares stupidly. The action takes place in the 1980s, but it is never clear why, especially when they have not been able to achieve any convincing sentiment of that decade: more than a few 80s soul records are needed on the soundtrack, the zoot suit Occasional and A handful of 30-year-old cars. Then we see central characters who study texts like "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu and talk about how violence should be a last resort, while the same characters seem to be too willing to start handing out blows with all the thoughtless abandon and fed testosterone. of a group of chavs fighting over a bag of chips. <br /> <br /> Character development does not exist in "Clubbed". Neither the irony, the subtlety or the pathos. This is a film that exchanges good memories of Guy Richie's first gangster films, which despite their flaws certainly have much more ingenuity, better editing, a more agile dialogue and a more emotional blow than this little saga. Anyway, they already have a decade. Is not it time we stopped emulating them?
