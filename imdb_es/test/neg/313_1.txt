I can not believe I lost a NetFlix rental in this complete piece of CRAP. How long did it take to make this movie? 15 minutes? With a budget of what? Fifteen dollars? I can spend a few hours with my Sony camcorder and create something better than this treacherous bundle of bile, and it's even available on DVD! Something very sad to think that the classics like The Stepfather have not been released on DVD, but this piece of steaming dung comes to the format. We hope that my UNO UNO ONE rating will make the overall pathetic rating (already) of 2.5 go down.
