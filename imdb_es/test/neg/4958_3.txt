I have seen many horror movies, splashes, monsters in my life. And, of course, also many monster movies from the 50s and 60s. When I stumbled upon this, I thought that this was from the 60s until I recognized it was 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, the character of Jack Brook is interesting and the acting together is for a film sprinkled. Well, but ... I expected a splash film and not a dramatic story about an aggressive duster. The movie lasts 80 minutes and I think the first murder is after 65 minutes. Although it takes hours to explain the story, the reason why the monsters come takes at least 3 minutes ... we have another 20 minutes of boring dialogues and, finally, a well-handled splash sequence, in my opinion. Although we have Robert Englund starring here, I only recommend it to true fans of horror.
