For years I hesitated watching this movie. Now, I know why. Not only is it a comedy that is not even remotely fun, but there's nothing to laugh about * about * the movie. It was even worse than I expected. I rented this sucker and I still felt cheated by time rather than money. I had never seen a movie that bothered me so much. It's a movie about stupid people who are doing stupid and terrible things. Nor do I really know how someone with common sense could act in this type of movie. I have used IMDb for some time, but I felt compelled to sign up just to help keep poor, unsuspecting people from renting or, worse, buying this shit! Really a waste of time and money. I must say that the plot is horrible.
