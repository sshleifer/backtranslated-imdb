It may be, although two or three are still missing. This film constructs an interesting nocturnal urban landscape, that remembers many scenes of fog of the films of Sherlock Holmes, and the one full of sinister characters, Kafka-esque. In between them, the film drops Mia Farrow, who looks like she's still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to be repeating her nebbish role of Play It Again Sam. Are we supposed to laugh at his stuttering and wringing his hands? I guess I would, if the rest of the movie was clearly a comedy, but it is not. At least I do not think it is.
