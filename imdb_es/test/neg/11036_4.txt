A pretentious collection but, to a greater or lesser extent, observable of "stories" mostly meaningless. <br /> <br /> But let's start at the top. <br /> <br /> Kaurismaki: If someone has ever wondered what the Finns love / The romance was like, maybe this boring little rarity is a clue. Controversial feelings, not emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing perspective of moving from Finland to Siberia. I guess the continuation of this story will be "For our honeymoon, we moved from Siberia to Greenland." Aki, obviously, had no idea what to write for this little movie, so he just invented a "story" not centered around a band that he especially likes (or maybe they are his friends) because we can see them and listen to his music more than the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Erice: First of all, I've never heard of this guy before. and now I know why. Good black and white photography and almost nothing else, unless bored as a fool can be considered an asset. But you'd be surprised how many movie critics and film students love boredom in movies, so I recommend Erice's snooze-fest to those two humanoid groups. <br /> <br /> Herzog: It's not a movie, but probably a portion of his documentaries about tribes in South America. This is not a short film but a report, but considering how boring the first two entries were, the Herzog bit is almost refreshing and has some interesting moments, and if nothing else fits very well into the pretentious "time" concept of the movie. <br /> <br /> Jarmusch: As expected, this filmmaker, who was once interesting (with the brain of a peanut, a talented wise idiot), serves us another wave of uselessness. He has become lazy and can not be bothered to write anything interesting, neither for his own films nor for a collection like TMO. The only positive side of watching a silly vegetarian actress spend 10 minutes in a trailer is that the lovely Chloe Sevigny plays her. Otherwise, skip this nonsense. Oh, and by the way: I do not think any young actress listens to classical music; Jarmusch was trying to be surreal by making Chloe listen to that kind of music? Lindsey Lohan maybe listen to opera? Maybe Drew Barrymore is a jazz fanatic? Who am I to say they are not ?! <br /> <br /> Jim Jarmusch is an imbecile. Oh, right ... I already mentioned that ... <br /> <br /> Wenders: Here's the real surprise of the whole movie: Wenders can really do something good !!!!! Everything else I've seen of this overrated charlatan has been boring and pointless so far. However, this little story is done with style (it's kind of atypical) and it's the best part of the movie. It leaves us wanting to see more, even if the story has a resolution. <br /> <br /> Spike Lee: Oh, dear Lord? What can I say here? Lee makes anyone look talented by comparison. Like Herzog, do not you choose a story but present a report? And a left political propaganda report on that! CNN, but in black and white, and unilateral, of course. Naturally, "We Wuz Robbed," the retarded title of this little dream inducer, is about how the poor, gullible, and infinitely idealistic democrats WUZ ROBBED of Bush and his team EVIL EVIL of THIEVES. This is by far the dumbest and dull entry in this movie, and I had to use the fast forward button to not fall asleep. Spike Lee is truly a product of Affirmative Action. God knows how many really talented directors (blacks) never had the opportunity to make films, because this small and pretentious and without talent continues to have opportunities after others to make them. And he is wrong EVERY TIME! Now that requires some kind of talent, right? <br /> <br /> Kaige: Chinese history has a solid premise. It's fine, nothing more. <br /> <br /> In general, there are many and much better movies in which you can spend your time, but if your time is not as valuable (as the case seems to be with mine) you can watch this little movie. <br /> <br /> "Ten minutes can surely be an eternity in the hands of the anti-masters of cinema, time is precious, lose it in better films". - Fedor Miklowitz, 1588
