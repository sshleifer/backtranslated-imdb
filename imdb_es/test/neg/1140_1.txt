The other night I saw the first 30 or 40 minutes of this movie on television and I can agree that this is by far the worst in the series. It's not funny, nor can Randy Quaid save this mess. Eric Idle was not funny at N.L. Euro. Holidays, and he's even worse here. The only funny scene is when they are at the airport and a guy dressed as Santa walks through the camera shouting "Did someone lose this?" while holding a prosthetic leg ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 star out of ****
