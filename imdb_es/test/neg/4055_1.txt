Every time I watch a video like this, I have to ask myself how it was financed. HBO or Showtime or whatever, they must pay the production company to make the motions: hire someone who may or may not speak English to get high and forge something that is close to a plot, to pay the strippers with scary jobs of boob to bounce and down in torsos of very waxed uncles, to find people who design and light ensembles, to buy the rights of techno cheesy music, etc. But I have to imagine that this has to be a vanity project for whoever is the executive producer ... He had to have nailed all those girls, right? And the brother is not wrong with the "Spanish-looking" girl, but calling the police "awesome" is terribly generous. In fact, I would dare to call them something much closer to "horrible" or "ugly". Seeing these women writhing, sometimes * clearly * junkie, was so far from being erotic that my testicles actually went up inside my body. Stupid. <br /> <br /> Why waste your time with this when there is so much hard porn available for free on the Internet? I wonder if the popularization of video on the Internet will slowly kill the softcore video industry ... One can only wait, right?
