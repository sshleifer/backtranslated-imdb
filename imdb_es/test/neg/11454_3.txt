Like many films from the early days of sounds, Cimarron must be seen more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment. Hammy's performance of leader Richard Dix, nominated for best actor, can be excused as a relic of the silent film acting school. However, even giving benefits of the doubt, Cimarron is a piece of badly formed drama, a swollen movie that goes from a sequence unrelated to a sequence unrelated to little dramatic impact. Officially, the movie is two hours and four minutes; It feels like four hours when you're watching it. There's no reason to waste your time on it unless you want to see all the Best Movie winners or have a great interest in the early days of sound. In my opinion, Cimarron is the worst option for the best movie in the history of the Academy and the award should have been for City Lights or Little Ceasar. Cimarron is barely remembered today, and would have been remembered at all if it were not for his Oscar win.
