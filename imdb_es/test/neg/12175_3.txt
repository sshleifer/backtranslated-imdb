The appeal of this film has to be the artistic style of the euro, because there is absolutely no substance. Many things happen that seem to go somewhere ... but never come. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find a total of 10 comment lines, because this movie is a totally empty experience. . There are a lot of nice photographs of a cemetery, some really weak zombie effects, some glimpses of what could happen with surreal humor and a weak existentialist ending. These elements undermine each other. Just when you can be enjoying the spooky humor, there is some nonsense with bouncing heads or zombie sex. To avoid screaming with boredom, he clings to the minimal story line, and disintegrates into a ridiculous illogical. It is as if someone took several B movies in a half-oven and threw them in a blender. <br /> <br /> What comes out is mainly a movie * about * lack of meaning - and * not * a good one. Clearly, it will impress that category of fans of the art house that sees the vacuum as indistinguishable from the depth. Everyone else should stay well clear of this sad mess.
