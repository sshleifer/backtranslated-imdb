This is, by far, the worst movie I've seen in my entire life (I'm close to 47)! The description on the back of the cover was the same as the scroll text just at the beginning of the movie. The additional plot was null and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their "performance." I saw it in all its extension and I felt really relieved when the death of the last character marked the end of my suffering! The location was a kind of vaults or a dirty beach. I suppose that the domestic video equipment served as a camera and the lighting was lower than the standard. The dialogues lacked inspiration and lacked meaning. As were the faces of the actors. Which brings me to the subject "makeup": for its appearance, they got it as tricks in the magazines of some teenagers "my first makeup" or similar. What made me buy the DVD was the name "Lovecraft" printed on the cover. The only connection with the works of this brilliant mind was the use of the name "Necronomicon", which was erroneously translated as "Book of Light". The 4.70 EURO that I paid for this DVD was a total loss, since the DVD went into the recycling box without further ado.
