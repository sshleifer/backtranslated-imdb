Three young employees of the movie theater are entrusted with the task of reopening an old and closed cinema room, in which many years passed before a series of horrific murders occurred. It seems that many more murders have occurred since then, but all this remains unknown to these three young newcomers who hope to finally succeed on their own. As they approach the great night of reopening, things become increasingly strange and more disturbing with the objects that begin to move on their own without any visible help and a scary old man apparently harassing the facilities. <br /> <br /> Oh, this is really horrible. In fact, if it were not for the character of Mary Woronov's secretary being an empowered young woman so fiercely independent that she steals practically every scene in which she appears and the incredibly sexy girl who played the incredibly skinny but totally sexy Selina, this would be a total loss. The only good thing I have to say about this movie is that some of the murders in the movies are done in a truly inventive, though not excessively bloody (a preference for me but not necessarily for others) fashion. The rest simply wallows in a constant sordidness (so extreme that few can rarely find humor in it) and runs through the predictable killer that kills the annoying characters one after the other.
