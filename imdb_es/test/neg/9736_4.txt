Although he worked for the worst government of the twentieth century, Erwin Rommel is generally considered by historians and fans of World War II as a knight, a soldier soldier and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare. If only Hitler had given him the troops and the material he had wanted in Africa, according to the argument, things would have been very different. And that is probably true. Rommel was, in fact, a military genius and, for that matter, an honest and honest man. <br /> <br /> But this movie does everything possible to show it as a close saint. He does his job, trying to win the war for Hitler, but constantly the Fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders, with which Rommel (James Mason) expresses amazement, but in reality he rarely asks and never, never disobeys. Only when it is obvious that Hitler is leading Germany to ruin, Rommel thinks of the betrayal against him; This dilemma is presented as the main theme of the film, a good man in bad circumstances who tries to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Mason is fine as Rommel, but it is not a memorable performance like, say, George C. Scott as Patton. Of course, Rommel was not as colorful as Patton, but this film is meant to make him look like a decent human being who forgets to make it interesting. Occasionally he falls into some heat when he is with his wife Lucie (a young Jessica Tandy, well chosen), but Mason is usually asked to offer a tough British performance. as if the British were trying to claim Rommel for themselves (although to be fair, all Nazis have an English accent, except Hitler). <br /> <br /> Made in a cheap way, with battle scenes that wipe out archival material and the beaches When Southern California turns to Tunisia, there is nothing that particularly recommends this film. A remake could be interesting (I would choose Ed Harris just for a slight physical resemblance and, well, Harris can act) if it had been improved a bit, but this movie mostly showed me how much more demanding we have become the viewers. in the last fifty years; Such a bland biography would never cut her off anymore.
