This film has to be one of the historical minimums of Michael J. Fox's generally respectable career. I should have known how horrible this film was when I rented it and found that the film had only been half-seen and had not been rewound by the previous tenant. Never a good sign! Fox plays an adult child star who is now an agent of other children in the entertainment world. His character is delirious because he still believes that everyone should love him for being Mikey. His great opportunity comes when he meets Angie Vega, a talented girl. Vega is abrasive and not friendly. In fact, the only sympathetic character in the entire movie is Cyndi Lauper as a Brooklyn-accented receptionist for the agency. One of those movies that makes me want to post a post-it note in the box warning others not to waste time!
