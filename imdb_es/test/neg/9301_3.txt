This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hitman for some Russian mobsters based in Buffalo. He is also a furious alcoholic, and this has caused his work performance to decrease. After falling asleep in his car during a possible blow, his uncle, the mafia boss, sends him to San Francisco, where he will attend AA meetings and get a job as a brigade assistant. If you think that this does not make any sense, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> It gets worse. Well, it actually improves, but not before it's much, much worse. Frank suddenly becomes a mortician teacher despite a total lack of training, but his reactions to people at the funeral home and AA meetings are interesting. The viewer begins to encourage him when he notices positive changes in his life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition as a sponsor of Frank, although he has almost nothing to do (his character tells us he is gay, but this has no meaning). The film is immersed in idiocy with the introduction of the character Tea Leoni. She is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest for Frank, since the two actors do not have chemistry together. The moment she enters the scene, Frank becomes much less absorbing as a character. Its characterization is apparently random; There is no consistency in their behavior. The comedy is discreet and only intermittently funny, especially disappointing considering the comic pedigree of the cast. <br /> <br /> Problems abound in this. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. Alternate between Italian, Russian and Hispanic. Throughout the course of the film, Frank tells many people he is a hit man (including an entire AA group), but nobody seems to care, or wants to do something about it. The film is based on clich√© scenes to carry out through its final act, especially when the unbearable Leoni character pursues Frank at the airport, just as he is about to take a flight back to Buffalo. <br /> <br /> Although it has a solid premise and an interesting first half hour, the film quickly becomes a total disaster and becomes a complete nonsense. At the end of the film, Frank celebrates a year of sobriety. I hope to celebrate many, many years of not having seen "You Kill Me". <br /> <br /> My degree: D +
