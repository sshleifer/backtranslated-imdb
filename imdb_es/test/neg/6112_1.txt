A good friend of mine said one: "A monkey is fun, anytime and anywhere." There is an exception to this: GO TO BANANAS. It's just the WORST MOVIE I've seen in my life. It is worse than PLAN 9, worse than THE FLOORS OF THE YUCCA BEAST. It's terrible. The gag of the talking monkey ages after about three minutes, and believe me that's all there is to it. Make sure you have a group of people to relive after going through TOXIC SHOCK by GOING BANANAS, the worst movie in history.
