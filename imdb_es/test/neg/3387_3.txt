Last night, I'm sitting in my TV room, beer in my hand, a bowl of pretzels on the television tray and I decide to put the movie "Monster Man" on my reliable VCR. Waiting for a movie full of fun, bloody, shock and party. What do I get instead? One of the most stupid, stupid, inflexible and predictable movies in which I have had the displeasure of sitting. And what's even worse, all during the "sex scene" (and I use the following phrase in a general way) the girl keeps all her clothes on! I'll make this summary short and sweet: mix "Dude Where's My Car" (about a good 1/2 of the movie) with a very diluted "Hitcher", add a version of the "I Madman" antagonist as the main villain and, finally, a bit of mumbo and incoherent black magic, and you'll get an idea of ​​how bad this movie is. It is also completely predictable at all times. The only notable factor of this movie of friends disguised as "horror movie" is that some of the moments between the 2 men (although the "hero" is an annoying geek SENIOR and the other is a clone of Jack Black) are quite funny (Simply mediocre, that is, like most SNL parodies). Apart from that, "Monster Man" is a tangled monster! 3/10 (This will be distributed on Halloween, I only hope that after the person sees it, it does not compensate my house or worse)
