Oh, my God, it seems to me that Alfred Hitchcock (North by Northwest, Spellbound, The 39 Steps) could end this nasty surprise. Do not bother looking for deep depths or deep meanings, there is none. This is just horrible, seedy and cheap. The only redeeming characteristic is the life in the home of the inspector who directs the investigation: his wife imagines herself as a gourmet cook and constantly serves her disgusting culinary experiments on her poor husband. This is fun, and it almost saved me from putting the movie on the "horrible" stand, but the movie as a whole is one of the most unpleasant I've seen in my life. I think this was the last Hitchcock movie, maybe someone was trying to tell him something.
