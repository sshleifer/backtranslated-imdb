This film suffers horribly from its direction "Julian Grant", and its incompetent protagonist, Steve Guttenberg, who is striving to win an imitation contest of Bruce Willis! The writing is reckless hollywood action thriller; Sean Bean, one of my favorites, David Fraser and Kim Coates give a decent performance. The movie is definitely below average. 3 out of 10! I wonder what the Hollywood studios thought, actually giving the nod, to a weak director like Grant. And I would say to Sean Bean "what were you thinking, even considering participating in a movie like this, after such great movies as GoldenEye, Ronin and Patriot Games!
