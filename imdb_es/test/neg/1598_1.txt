In general, I can tolerate twisted movies, but this is really an obsessive and obsessive film that absorbs itself! <br /> <br /> First of all, the writer / director is a totally self-absorbed guy, full of jokes that are not all funny. Secondly, he is also a sick pervert who manipulates and poisons children's minds! I can not believe what I hear when I heard the sick monologues and perverts that children talk about! <br /> <br /> I really feel sorry for Zane Adlum and Devon Matthews. Both are very talented, but fell prey to the dirty and little-known film by Eric Schaeffer! <br /> <br /> And what the hell happened to the attractive face of Eric Mabius? I mean, he met this girl he was supposed to marry, but he was not at the wedding! In fact, there is a bald guy in his place! Did time really fly so fast? <br /> <br /> Anyway, do not waste time to watch this movie, unless you want to be poisoned and manipulated by a sick Eric Schaeffer!
