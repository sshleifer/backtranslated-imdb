This horror movie starts quite promising and there is a moment when I thought "this is going to be really good". However, it gets pretty boring pretty fast in the end. The acting is pretty good, as is the location and the story starts pretty well too. The problem, there are not enough deaths on the screen and an end where you have the monster basically spinning the tail and running. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene in which I thought that the film was taking over and that I was going to be a winner. Unfortunately, after that, the movie showed very little to the monster and the back of the DVD lied when he told me that the desert underneath people literally came alive and was able to devour their flesh ... now it would have been a movie, almost unavoidable situation. Of course, that would have bothered the viewers and could have increased the tension, but that's what horror movies are supposed to do! Instead, we have very few shots of the creature or creatures and, when we see it, it is mainly on the defensive. However, it was not all bad, just needed more horror, less hunting and chewing.
