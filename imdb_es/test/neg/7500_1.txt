So, umm, this woman has a vagina that attracts people when they do it and there's a guy who follows her everywhere ... and uhh is in love with her and she can not love him again for that. her little thing Well, her little thing starts talking to her ... more or less ... she simply says that she feeds me again and again and tries to give him sausages but that does not work because ummmmm she wants fresh meat. So this woman goes to the red light district, where she collects tourists, but only the really sordid ones because I suppose they deserve it and, after a while, this guy comes to look for her and although she is like there, she does not see her so he eventually gets involved with twins together, but he only likes one of them because the other is a real asshole. This is not as good as I thought it would be because the novelty disappears in the first hour and a half and lasts an hour longer. I think he killed a few brain cells because I sat through all this and now I have some brain damage. Either way, this is the worst man-eating vagina movie I've ever seen.
