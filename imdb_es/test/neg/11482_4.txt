I expected much more from this movie. The preview seemed interesting, so I decided to take a look. The conclusion is that "The Adventures of Sebastian Cole" had only one decent thing: Adrian Grenier. <br /> <br /> I really like Grenier and I found his performance very pleasant. The character is well designed, but everything else moves throughout the film. Clark Gregg is really good, but I do not think his character has been very well explained. I mean there's not much to explain; He wants to be a woman. However, something was missing. <br /> <br /> The obvious budget of the movie was nice to watch. I liked that the film was filmed in a script (a bad one) and only in some actors. It was a nice change. <br /> <br /> While the main idea of ​​the movie was actually fine, it was disappointing to see many scenes that had nothing to do with it, just thrown here and there. As I said, the script seemed promising and I must say that I was interested in where the director Tod Williams was going, but it was basically a very slow movie with a not very good dialogue. <br /> <br /> "Sebastian" started to look good towards the end, but again, he fell back into a hole. The acting was mostly good, the writing needs some work, but the budget of the film helped in the long term. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to someone if I wanted to see a silence. Film with a strong main character, but other than that I would stay away. Personally, I would not see it twice.
