Let me start by saying that this remade version of one of the best movies ever created "Psycho" (1960) has been nothing more than a good example of bad direction, poor performance and poor distribution. The best way to describe this film is by comparing it step by step, acting acting and processing by process with the original. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock, one of the best film directors of all time, intended to shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time. Okay, it's possible that people in 1960 have not been accustomed to bloodshed or horror scenes as much as we are today, but that did not stop people from liking and being nominated for 4 Oscars. Gus Van Sant had absolutely no reason to throw this in color, except that the year was 1998. What should have been in a realistic color was not. After the shower scene, Norman washes his hands, it is easily understandable that what was used for the blood resembled a kind of red wax. Once you wash the blood, your hand is red. <br /> <br /> About acting, maybe there could not be a better cast of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the original. Perkins adapted well to Norman and was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger. Hitch wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked well. In this version, I personally think that Vince Vaughn looked perfect, handsome and strong to play the role of Norman, unfortunately his performance was nothing short of terrible. In the motel office where Norman and Marion have a long conversation, he had no expression on his face and his voice and face never change. In the original scene in the same scene where the asylum is described, we can clearly see the sudden change in expression on Perkins' face and he looks terribly angry, though not aggressively. Vince Vaughn here resolves the entire conversation as if he had had his memory lines. Once again, terrible performance. The same goes for Anne Heche. In the initial scene of the original, we can see how tense and nervous Marion (Janet) feels when driving to Phoenix. She was happy to get the money, but at the same time scared for life. That's what I call acting. In the remake, Heche has no signs of fear and smiles periodically to get the money. I do not think anyone is "happy and smiling" when he has just stolen $ 400,000 and all the state police are behind them. In the shower scene, Janet in the original grabs the curtain, turns around and dies after being stabbed. In the remake, Heche is stabbed, turns around, then swings to the other side, has a silly expression on his face and manages to die with great effort. Once again, a terrible performance. <br /> <br /> There are also some changes specially introduced in this film from the original that seems to have nothing to do with the plot and the current situation. In the scene where Arbogast is killed, two scenes flash between the stab wounds. One with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. Many people, including me, are not sure if the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever. What the heck does a beast or a naked woman have to do with the murder of an investigator! The changes were inappropriate and unnecessary. There are also a couple of changes in the final scene. <br /> <br /> Let me add some (and the only) positive points along with that. I felt that Julianne Moore did her job well and played a good character of Lila. And William Macy acted well, that was almost exactly how the character of Arbogast should have been interpreted. <br /> <br /> It is known that the purpose and intention of a film remake is to make the current generation realize a movie. that has a good classic plot, and to try to make it look better than the original. And if something has happened here according to what I have just said, it is directly the opposite. Unfortunately, many people like me were not impressed after watching this movie unless we learned of an unforgettable original version. <br /> <br /> Please, do not look at this movie, it is not even close to the original and the original will always remain one of the best movies ever created, if not the best.
