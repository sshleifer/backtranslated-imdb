This movie makes more of the CGI, I mean that science fiction really made the original "BATS" better, it does not use CGI as the sequel. in this movie are the simple people who flee from mutated killer bats. And really bats in Afghanistan? The plot involves the soldiers of the US Army who find a terrorist and are attacked by bats and die <_ <, but the reason I gave this film 3 stars is because the camera focuses on the soldiers. the acting is bad and this does not even look like a horror movie. In all this movie is a pretty good television movie for the science fiction channel. but if you like science fiction movies, you will like this movie because you like channel 43 and if you fall asleep during the movie, do not be surprised. Oh, I'm sorry, I think I give it 2 stars instead.
