A bad scam by Quentin Tarantino, at least I hope it's because of that, because at least that way I could respect the director for admiring Tarantino. A scene, a "singing" scene with Rose McGowan, is very well done and is great for this film and could only be found by mistake by this director. So, in addition to his inspiration of Quinton and Rose McGowan and his only good scene, this movie stunk. Some of the most horrible dialogue I've ever heard, I'm willing to bet why McGowan does not talk much because of how horrible his dialogue would have been. Try to be fun, it never is, try to be dark and it is not, try to be elegant and it is simply tasteless. Who spends the money to make films like this, I hope it was all the directors so that no one else's money is wasted. If it were not for McGowan, the whole cast is horrible and when McGowan is your best hmmm, I wonder.
