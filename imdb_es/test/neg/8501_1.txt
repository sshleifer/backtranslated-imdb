How did this film enter the Berlin Film Festival? I understand that you entered the Panorama section, but still. <br /> <br /> This movie featured: <br /> <br /> 1. No plot. 2. Horrible performance. 3. The atrocious videography. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever captured on video. <br /> <br /> The decisive factor that explains most festival acceptances is the presence of that ancient resource: homosexuality. That's right, the only thing that happens in this movie is that a graff artist takes another and takes it away. Then it feels weird about that and they have a boring old "break" conversation that you might expect to hear from your first crush in high school (with lines like "First you kissed me, buddy"). Oh, and by the way, this is not a crying game ... you see the gay angle in the first ten minutes of the movie. Apart from that, they are mostly just bad labels, badly dressed "undercover" cops, some skateboarding and a train ride. <br /> <br /> If the topic is of interest to anyone, I recommend searching the web for some underground graff videos made by real graffiti artists. There's a lot out there ... and they're a lot more entertaining than this shit.
