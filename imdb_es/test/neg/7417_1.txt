This is definitely similar to the "amateur" hour. How this piece of garbage was thrown, is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc. Everything is wrong. Why Lance Henriksen accepted this will remain one of the great mysteries of cinema. Maybe he was in dire need of money or maybe he was under the influence of some illegal drug. <br /> <br /> It is useless to try to explain what this movie is about. It is about the legend of the big foot but done in the worst possible way. In fact, this stench smells like a direct video release. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at ALL costs! 0 * out of 10 *
