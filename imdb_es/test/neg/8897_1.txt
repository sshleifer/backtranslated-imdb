My only reason for registering on this site was the opportunity to write a comment on this movie. I felt that I had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it down. <br /> <br /> The movie "Babas bilar" must be the worst movie I've ever seen. I really think that the script could have been able to become a pretty good movie or at least well, but somewhere along the line something happened. What makes it even stranger is the fact that the model seems to be pretty good on paper. Putting into practice both the script and the cast are not delivered. There is a lot of action, it happens to many things and you can not help but wonder why it happens. And then the cast, the actors make such a poor effort that you almost start crying. <br /> <br /> If you have a lot of time at hand, I would say you can see it. If not, do not do it.
