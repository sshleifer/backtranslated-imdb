Well, that was sure a waste of Dave McKean's talents, right? Do not get me wrong: in terms of graphic design, Dave McKean may be the best in the world right now. The layered and textured look you can achieve with just a few lines of pencil on rough paper makes the efforts of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher look like what they are: tricks. McKean has been the godfather of a revolution in the aspect of comics, cinema and even magazine ads that borrow the distinctive collage effect that has been pioneering. <br /> <br /> But this movie? It's garbage Complete garbage The story, by Neil Gaiman, is, unfortunately, exactly what Gaiman has been giving us since he cheated Clive Barker for the first time: a pseudo-myth and exaggerated dream landscape, populated by characters that have titles in all capital letters instead of names Everything is allegory, to the point that it is impossible to obtain any human drama, emotion or empathy from anyone involved. People make concise postings, speaking with riddles that remind how Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead would have sounded if Tom Stoppard had suffered a debilitating blow in half of his composition. Really, Gaiman, surpass yourself. You are not a prophet. You are a fan <br /> <br /> McKean's direction does not help: his pace is deficient, taking half an hour to accelerate for the main picaresque plot, and then he simply provides a sequence of events, none of which has given weight. Monsters do not threaten because they are not announced, simply thrown on the screen. The plot does not get involved because we really do not care about the small stale protagonists. Half the dialogue, mumbled on the fronts of shirts and ubiquitous masks, is unintelligible. <br /> <br /> Some of the images are pretty, and I'm sure the fanboys will lick it. Pity. Think of the amount of really good work that McKean could have produced if he had not been stuck with this unconvincing project. <br /> <br /> Grade: D / D-
