Solange is not a great Italian thriller. Prepare for the spoiler: the main suspect, the teacher, did not. But is it really a spoiler? No, because you know that the murderer could not have been from the beginning; He and a student witnessed the first murder. So, there is absolutely no suspense as to whether the teacher is the murderer or not. There is a long and tedious preparation for the final explanation of the mystery. The solution is interesting, but it comes out of nowhere. The rest of the movie (and it's not a short movie) is not exciting enough to keep her interested. Even in the tradition of "wrong accused man" fails, because the police never accuses the teacher and the killer never pursues him. Bored, bored, bored.
