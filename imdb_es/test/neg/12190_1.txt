This movie is simply atrocious, how the talent involved made this go beyond human belief. I suppose they should have been drinking when they thought about this idea, I feel like they took 2 hours off my life. Harvey Kietel will try and distance himself from this garbage, it should have been a great crime movie, but it turns into a bloody chaos of vampires. I would recommend this movie to people who like to sleep through movies, you will not miss anything. Humor is ready to attract For the most common domain, movies can cheer us up and remind us that life is worthwhile, this movie simply depresses you. As DeNiro said, in a film the saddest thing in life is the waste of talent. This movie is a perfect example of this statement.
