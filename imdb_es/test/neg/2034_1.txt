It is the early morning of our discontent, and some of my friends and I have just seen "The Wind". Truly a disaster movie. Not in the sense that the forces of nature wreak havoc on an unsuspecting population, but rather a horrible movie that wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting audience. To give you an indication of how frustrating it was to see this particular pump, I will give you an example cited during my first pain visit. If I am given the option to watch this movie for the second time and, let's say, boil it, I am afraid to say that the option will not be immediate. But instead of just ranting "ad movie" with sleazy phrases, I'll be specific as to why exactly my friends and I are exploring this particular movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, I like low budget horror movies. I even like artistic and low budget horror films. I liked "Cold Hearts", "Midnight Mass", "Jugular Wine", etc. Films that were ambitious and daring, even if they lacked production value, execution and even acting. In general, an interesting premise, an unusual camera technique or just one or two well-done scenes will save a movie that is running a little rough around the edges. With these conditions in mind, I would like to say conclusively that I hated "The Wind". <br /> <br /> The movie was probably the most disappointing in the sense that it was incredibly frustrating to watch it. From the actions of the main characters, to the flow (?) Of the plot, to the great portents insinuated by the opening that finally aspired to dust (and did not even logically adhere to what happened in the rest of the film, and left the viewer, waiting for something more, with a sensation of a lot of noise for nothing). The dialogue was, at best, irregular, clear and completely unreal. By this I mean, no one in any of the situations in which the characters found themselves would have reacted the way they did, or said the things they said the way they said them. There was an obvious lack of vision and direction that would have corrected this problem. <br /> <br /> The interaction and development of the character was abysmal. Claire, the "lambent sex goddess", or therefore the aggravating, passive-aggressive fanatics in the movie's thought, was so manifest in her manipulations that she might as well have targeted the characters. However, she was the highlight of the movie. The other main characters (with the exception of Mick's Milfy Mom, which was not terrible) are so indistinct that they may have been played by the same actor. Let's see if I missed something: borderline personality, submissive thugs with deep feelings of sexual confusion and inadequacy, stimulated to attacks of childish fury through the ingenious orchestrations of a loose-lipped bimbette, suddenly and unknowingly turned into Caligari. No, I think that covers it. <br /> <br /> The lack of scope was also problematic. How is it that those involved in the making of this film expect the casual viewer to realize that this was the beginning of the end of the world from this pentagon of amateur lust, incredible, badly portrayed (well, what would you call it? ?) Largely in the woods in the middle of nowhere? There were no witnesses to the "atrocities" presented. There were no witnesses anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> The credibility problems derived from this lack of attention to detail extended even from the point where the plot begins to get sick. Case in point: if that guy Bob took that route through the forest to go home from the gym, and here's the key, **** every day ****, there's a good chance that someone else has I was around to see something sometime later, while the perpetrators argued energetically about the crime scene. One would think that with the murder of a young man in the forest, it was said that the city would have been in an uproar, that the characters had been interrogated, etc. But instead, there was no witness in sight (apart from Earl, the closet psychopath without internal monologue). We suggest that there are no witnesses * for * this movie. <br /> <br /> As for the quasi-homosexual meanders present, I do not have problems with them either. It's not as if they were a surprise, considering that we had been screaming about the situation of most of the male characters since the second scene. Again, it is not problematic in itself, but thrown out for the wrong reasons. It was completely unnecessary, thrown by pure value of "shock" and / or "dangerous art", and neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any perspective. What we had in its place was an uncomfortable attempt to exchange a boring and clumsy film with a boring and clumsy plot. The badly implied sexual tension, which only insinuated itself with a strong hand before this flaccid scene of snobs, only pushed this film below the totem from the "mediocrity that justifies criticism" to "the movie sucking so badly that it lacks the inherent the grace to suck enough to mock and harangue properly. " <br /> <br /> The same goes for most of the film, with a lot of artistic awkwardness, very little meat and a lot of irritation. It's not that we do not understand it. Oh, we have it, it's fine. We just do not want it. Look, the very fact that we were cheering the beating in the final scene as the * only * picture that made sense on his face is an indication that something was terribly wrong with this movie. Instead of moving energetically along what its name suggests, this film runs languidly forward like the track of sweat that extends to the side of your nose while your hands are full. Argh. That feeling sums up pretty well the heartbreaking frustration I've seen at this train crash. There is no fresh air with respect to this film, only the stale miasma of the bad ideas badly made, rotting before coming to fruition.
