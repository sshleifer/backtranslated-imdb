This movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my small town. Now I have many friends who are guards at the Dixon Correctional Facility, and I myself worked for 3 years in the SuperAmerica store next to the Krogers store where the old woman was. However, this is still the stupidest film ever made, destined to be presented by Gilbert Godfreid or Rhonda Shearer, if he has not already done so. A little bit of trivia, Illinois does not even have parole hearings, and Dixon Prison is a medium security facility that houses vending machine thieves and vandals. The classic clucking / seduction scene is perhaps the most fun piece of writing I have seen, especially with the accumulation of suspense.
