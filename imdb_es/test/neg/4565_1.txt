I thought I could get some laughs from this long movie, but unfortunately I was disappointed. This film is about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passing grade without even trying to open a book or achieve something. The film also described the teachers and the director, Mary Tyler Moore (Mrs. Stark), "Labor Pains", 2000 as complete idiots. I know this was supposed to be a comedy, but it never made me laugh and I thought the whole movie was a waste of COMPLETE time. However, all the actors gave excellent performances and had the difficult task of making this film a fun and entertaining MOVIE. Simply studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to go!
