Although sometimes it can be VERY tedious, this movie really is not that bad. The performance is pretty well done, if it is stereotyped, and the production values ​​are quite high considering some of the science fiction movies that would come later in the decade. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with this movie are some of the very outdated characterizations in it. There is the boy from Texas, the "professional" scientist, and the worst of all, the scientist who finally realizes his status as a woman. For a film that seeks to make a statement about humanity, it loses part of its impact by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes.
