I will give you a two because it has a lot of music, otherwise it would be one. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time tonight and it is the first "Road" photo I have seen. seen I expected much better. Robert Osborn says that this is the best of the Road movies. If that is true, I do not need to bother to see others. The best thing about this movie is that it has many songs in the first half, but that is offset by a single production number with dancing throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie. . Neither Hope nor Crosby met so well, their characters were not very charming, the movie was not funny, most of the dialogue was simply unconvincing, there was not much action, there was not much show. br /> <br /> The movie was not what I expected. I expected more "Camino", but not much. They quickly arrive at the palace and then most of the film takes place there, until the end. I also expected much more from the famous "road" style of breaking the fourth wall, where the characters speak directly to the audience or comment on the plot. There were only about 4 cases of that. One of them is an example of the non-humorous humor of this script: <br /> <br /> (Hope recapitulates the argument so far to Crosby) Crosby: I know all that! Hope: Yes, but the people who came to the middle of the image did not. Crosby: You mean you missed my song? <br /> <br /> Those are two weak lines, but at least they're jokes. Much of the rest of the script does not even have jokes. An example is: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning. (Hopefully call Hope a rat). <br /> <br /> That's not funny at all, it hardly qualifies as a joke, but that's the kind of joke-free dialogue that takes up most of the movie. Many of the scenes do not even come so close to a joke, just use a generic dialogue without interest like: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Hey, why are you taking me? Do you think you can throw me to the dogs? Esperanza: Well, why not, you did it to me, right? Crosby: Yes, but that's because he was taking care of us. You are not looking for anyone Hope: oh yes? Well, then, why did I pay the check? <br /> <br /> (The above is only from my memory, it is not exact, but it illustrates what I mean). <br /> <br /> And so on ... just a generic dialogue without jokes. <br /> <br /> My qualification: a waste of time.
