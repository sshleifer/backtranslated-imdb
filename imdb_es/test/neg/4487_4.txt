I really wanted to see two bright young actors appear in "Dear John", but it was very slow; and I felt that both the script and the direction hindered the flexibility of the main actors. I usually enjoy the film adaptations of these novels. Ironically, I thought the film did an excellent job of representing a realistic military action. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was very good in segueing through love letters, focusing only on one word or key phrase in each letter. I felt that Channing Tatum got stuck in what became a series of "hung dog" expressions in response to the loss.
