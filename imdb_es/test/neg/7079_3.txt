This had the promise of being an interesting movie. The subject was certainly promising: the excesses of the Catholic Church during the counter-reformation. However, not only this did not develop (apart from an introduction of two paragraphs), many things were not explained, that is, the gypsies, the Anabaptists, the inquisitors and their relationship with the only true church. Neither were the policies of the time explained, that is, the relationship between the Catholic Church and its supporters as the Holy Roman Emperor. Although this may have been evident to an Austrian audience, the lack of explanation makes it confusing for Americans. <br /> <br /> But maybe it's good that they did not emphasize the story because what they showed was pretty inaccurate anyway. The instruments of torture, bloody executions, witch burnings and heretics, great bright swords and beautiful golden reliquaries are the stars of the film. It could have been so easily one of those Conan-type sword and witch movies, only in period costumes ...
