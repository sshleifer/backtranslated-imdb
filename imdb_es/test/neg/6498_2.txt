This movie had the biggest publicity campaign of any movie in Russia. "Epic film about Russian culture", "Great saga of the Russian spirit", endless articles and interviews. For me this movie was the biggest disappointment. The main character played by Oleg Menshikov is an immature and stupid child ready to train his companions because of a woman who does not even look like a lady. What is there to admire? In the first part of the film the story does not develop at all. The scenes of the festival of the people seem to boast of Russian audacity. <br /> <br /> I respect Mr. Mikhalkov for his previous work as an actor and director, but this film only demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the "czar" of Russian cinema. .
