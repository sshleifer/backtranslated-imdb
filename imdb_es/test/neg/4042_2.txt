Words can not express how poor this film is. <br /> <br /> There is no argument, the acting is atrocious, basically the whole movie is a joke. <br /> <br /> With a duration of 97 minutes, it is approximately 96 minutes too long. <br /> <br /> It may have been fine as a brief sketch in a comedy show, but the premise is too weak to work that amount of time without getting bored. br /> <br /> Avoid this, go rent a good movie instead!
