The film was slow, the dialogue between actors and actresses felt "flat" and, basically, there was no development of the characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps slips away with an angry expression on his face all the time, pouting and basically looking annoyed with everyone. The Danes have no magic on screen, and the character of Ribisi is a goober with whom nobody would want to hang out, even if they were paid to do so. <br /> <br /> Launch the rare scene in which Epps has to dance. an older man, and you have what you COULD possibly BE the worst movie in movie history. <br /> <br /> I saw it by satellite (thank God I did not pay it), and I wish I had not. . <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go order your underwear and the sock drawer if you need to do something, but you are tempted to watch this movie when / if it comes on your TV. Horrible movie if you ask me, and I usually have something good to say about almost any movie.
