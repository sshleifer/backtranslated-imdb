I have also been the wife of an abusive husband, even if in my situation the attacks were psychological, not physical. He presented a very respectable, responsible and generous personality to anyone who saw us together, which, unlike me, resulted in others treating me as boring and unstable. Initially, I felt incredibly flattered that someone like Gus (who worked at a bank and had great confidence) would even give me the time of day, and I completely fell for the IDEA of him, instead of the person he was . If I had had a straight head and had gotten to know him much better, there would be no way to marry him. However, that is my mistake. It was not my mistake to be abused. I did not deserve it, nor did I see it coming until I was involved in mental games, criticism and isolation. He acted as if I had nothing to do with an opinion that differed from his, in fact he went further. If he did not agree, he assumed that he did not understand, and he simplified his writing more and more ... by the time I finally lost my self-esteem, I was unable to recognize the problem I was in, and I had to be shaken to reality. By outside influence. My dad said that Gus called me a bitch. Well ... it was still half a year before the fury that started at that moment finally exploded and I packed some things while he was at work, and I left. ... and it was still another several months before I could understand the fact that I had been abused, and that it was not my fault that he was doing the things he did. ..... so, please, anyone who assumes that it is the victim's fault, THINK! If a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner when, in an anxious situation, he has an accident on the carpet, does he blame the puppy? for when the abuse in a relationship reaches an obvious violent level, the target of the abuse has been hurt and depersonalized (as in the Nazi concentration camps) that it is almost impossible to judge the circumstances accurately, because by then the victim believes that everything horrible things spit by the abuser. Have a heart, people. Labeling victims of abuse as stupid imbeciles is like kicking someone who is already terribly beaten. -------> and this helps like ???
