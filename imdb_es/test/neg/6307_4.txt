Dennis Quaid is trying to prove to us that Jerry Lee Lewis was a dumb guy. And he is doing too much to prove it. The television sequences are very good, like a photocopy of old black and white films. Music is also good, because Lewis himself is singing. But the rest is just the Hollywood B-Movie style, with the Happy Days complex of the fifties. I think the only good thing about this movie is seeing the young Winona Ryder.
