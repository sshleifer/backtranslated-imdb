Normally, I'm not even inclined to see trash like this, but since role playing is a hobby for me, and that was the subject of the movie, I did it. It was garbage in so many ways that I do not know where to start. I prefer to sit in the "Plan 9 from outer space" marathon than to watch another minute of this vomit. At least Plan 9 did not have an agenda. How the media could capitulate and irresponsibly represent an extremist agenda, since the fact is beyond my reach. It is a frightening moment when a whole group of people can be defeated without ceremony without defense and without real facts presented. I know that this comment was more social, but it could not be avoided, since this movie begged for it. Imagine that a pro-Nazi film is strictly reviewed for cinematic merit. It will not happen As they are, the people who made this film are fascists, and maybe they should move to a communist enclave where propaganda is accepted.
