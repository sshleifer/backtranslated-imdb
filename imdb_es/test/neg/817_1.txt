I say this. If you want to see art, you go to an art gallery. If you want to see a movie, you go to a theater. Trying to interweave art and film is disastrous in "Where is the heart". An interesting cast is totally wasted in this shame. You like Dabney Coleman, watch "Short Time." You like Crispin Glover, see "Bartleby." You like Uma Thurman, look at "Kill Bill." Especially, if you like Christopher Plummer, consult "The Silent Partner", because his character here, is a terrible shame. In fact, all this production is a shame. Of course the human work of art is intriguing for a few minutes, so make a short film, but do not subject an audience to nonsense without meaning, masquerading as filmed entertainment. - MERK
