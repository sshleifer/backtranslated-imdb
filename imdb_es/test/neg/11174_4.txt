Well, I expected to have heard badly about this movie, since I'm a big fan of Ruggero Deodato and I really did not want to see him fail; but unfortunately, this supernatural load of Giallo-style nonsense is as bad as I'd been led to believe it would be, and that's pretty terrible! The plot does not work at all, since the film tries to mix murders and a supernatural theme through a telephone and everything feels very forced and silly. Also, the plot does not make much sense at all, and you have to ask yourself "what is the point" several times throughout the movie. The plot centers on a young woman who lives in an apartment block and is terrified by a telephone. The best thing about the film is, undoubtedly, the presence of the beautiful English actress Charlotte Lewis, and unfortunately the positive points practically stop there. There are a handful of death scenes, some of which are bloody; but all those who are incredibly stupid, the one who sees someone killing himself with coins stands out especially in that sense. In general, I really can not recommend this to anyone; It is unlikely that fans who do not belong to Deodato are impressed, and it is likely that Deodato fans will find the movie depressing. Avoid!
