Two teenagers in the northeast of England are desperate to raise money and buy seasonal tickets for their favorite soccer team. They go through a series of "comic misadventures", but finally they smile. <br /> <br /> The trailer of this movie sells it as a comedy and includes most of its happy moments. However, the tone is increasingly grim and the end result is a depressing story full of family stereotypes. The two "heroes" have no problems with lying, cheating and stealing. His adversaries are an insensitive teacher, a pantomime villain of a father, a psychotic skinhead and a well-meaning but incompetent social worker. The other female characters are a teenager addicted to drugs, a pregnant schoolgirl and a battered wife who seems to be smoking to death. There are no pleasant characters, and the public can only feel pity or contempt. Local actors Tim Healy and Kevin Whateley play against guys like bad guys, but the writing and direction of their characters are so one-dimensional that they have nothing but novelty value. <br /> <br /> Chris Beattie and Greg McLane give good performances in the two young protagonists. However, they are an error, because they have the wrong accent. For anyone from the Northeast, it is obvious that both come from the Sunderland / Durham area and, however, we are expected to believe they are native to Newcastle. Like Geordie, I can assure you that the accents are not the same at all. Take the phrase "Let the poor boy talk." We say "Let the pooa lad speek" while saying "piwer lad spiyk", with two clearly different vowel sounds. This discrepancy creates a ridiculous double irony in a scene on the Sunderland soccer field, where the two boys are trying to disguise Newcastle accents they do not have, and "pretend" they come from Sunderland, which is obvious. In a gentle comedy, this kind of criticism could be seen as a simple idea. However, the gloomy tone of the film makes it clear that writer / director Mark Herman points to harsh realism: that means "close enough" is actually far away. <br /> <br /> I had expected the humor and optimism of this movie. , and instead they find tired old clich√©s. Tyneside is not a gray desert populated only by losers, and by saying yes, Herman should have known that it would cause offense. It is interesting to compare the film with the "Little Voice" of the same director, who is also largely unenthusiastic and populated by one-dimensional characters, "Little Voice" at least has a talented heroine and is not immersed in misery to the same extent . I've listened to "Belter" next to "Billy Elliot" this year, but that movie is a much more pleasurable and life-affirming experience. <br /> <br /> By the way, I may be too old, but having lived In Tyneside, for 42 years, I never heard anyone outside this movie use the expression "Purely Belter".
