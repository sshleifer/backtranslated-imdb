Man, I went to this movie because of the big preview. It seemed like it had a great story and nice special effects. <br /> <br /> The boy was wrong. I wanted to leave the theater for those horrible special effects. A dino of cartoon, of cartboard, would do even a better job than this one. The story was fine, if it had been taken over by a great film producer. Who would bet more money to make the effect more like life? The only thing I liked about this movie is the plants that appear everywhere. <br /> <br /> Even worse where the cars, in one scene, 2 characters walk down the street. If you look at those cars, you will see the following: Taxi, car, motorcycle, tripod, large bus. And about 4 times in a row! <br /> <br /> And then there is the "death of the butterfly" that would establish all of the "evolution changes" in progress. If that guy did not step on the butterfly, the next dinosaur would have eaten it anyway! So that's absolute bull. So, if you change something in the past, the future will be different at the same moment. Not in those "time waves" they did. But hey, if the future changed in a split second, the movie would be even worse, but more realistic. This is just one of those movies that you should see when you want to laugh a lot. I spent a lot of money on this movie in the theater. And then they tell me that this movie had a budget of $ 80 million. Where did all that money go?
