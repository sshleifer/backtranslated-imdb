I totally agree. This is "Pitch Black underground" and a well-worn plot. The best scenes that I thought were the divers that explored the caves, crossing impossible underground passages, some of them were throbbing. The landscape was great. If they had dispensed with the "evil" extraterrestrials of the CGI "strangers", the film would have been much better. All they would have to do is not show monsters, but everyone is wondering and follow Jack's descent into madness, and this could have been a first class Hitchcock thriller, maybe prize material. The acting is not bad. But those rubber bats simply reduce it to the standard rate.
