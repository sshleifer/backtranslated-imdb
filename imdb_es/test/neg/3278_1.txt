1 Bolo Yeung is in the film ten minutes in total, even when he is serving ice cold drinks to his boss. 2 A lot of street thugs, who look like junk rangers, are instantly outmaneuvered by the Asian superhero who talks like an illegal alien who just came out of a dung truck. 3 (thug) Leave this to me, t-shirt, gay model like muscles, heee-haaw! hee-heeew! hap hap! - He is dead on the floor with his neck, elbow, chin or broken balls - 4 cheap scenes of blended sex in which the white width comes out of nowhere and digs the Asian superhero. 5 Norton (ex-star of the C-action movies) does nothing but pose as an eccentric smuggler of fashionable weapons who traffic white wives hand-picked in a nightclub where they voluntarily follow an idiot who pretends to be a millionaire who hits them (you reap what you sow) 6 yes, the captain of the local police is involved and yes, the first policeman killed is the former superhero patrol partner (yaawn!). 7 action scenes are fake, like A) hee-haw! Chinese tries to give a revolving kick B) thin leg of Chinese to the throat of the black hooligan C) end the death move too much to his head like a ranger of Walker Texas fake action 8 final titles finally <br /> <br /> absolute trash . Those people are good enough to stand or bend their body in other C movies and be credited as MORE collectively as "team of specialists provided by the county jail."
