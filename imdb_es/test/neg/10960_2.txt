I'm not a director or writer or anything related to a movie. But watching more than 1 movie every day has given me the idea of ​​what a good movie is or not. So here it is: the quick and the undead is a rip-off of the quick and the dead. I was thinking that it could be a little parody of a great movie with many beginnings in it. But oh no, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the movie stinks. I'm a big fan of gore movies, but this one just gives you gore here and there, but they're not that consistent. <br /> <br /> But I have to give them credit in the creation of dreadful characters that have given me a bit of twisting. <br /> <br /> If you're a big zombie fan, look at this. If you're not ... better look for other Rob zombie movies.
