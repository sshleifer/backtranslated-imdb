If you thought that NBC 10.5 was stupid, you'll be glad to know that FX came to the bowels of hell made for TV and crushed your fingers in this pseudo post-9/11 poop. The plot was not only stupid, it was a total scam of 24 and a bad scam. The style of filming was the aspect of "docu-action", which is now overused, and is completed with the cuts of grainy images of "rawcore" in black and white. I'm not sure what that means, but it sure sounds like something the DP told the director before filming. I do not know what they were going for here, but it reminded me of the person in the office who thinks that PowerPoint presentations with "fly-ins" and "animations" are "great". <br /> <br /> The story is that 6 "terrorists" take a nuclear power plant in Southern California. That's right, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work, where there are safety precautions up to the ying-yang. For the sake of reality, they put 2 CHiPpies out of service in the mix. Because they could stop 6 people, right? Six. I mean, even Bruce Willis had to deal with more terrorists in that stupid Nakatomi building. <br /> <br /> Leslie Hope (Teri Bauer, of television) plays a CHP officer who has trouble talking on the phone after she was shot in her bulletproof vest. His voice sounds like a television ad by Sally Struther, plaintive and monotonous. Her character is just a plot device, and after she does her little duty, she is quickly eliminated. Yes, Teri Bauer is dead! <br /> <br /> Bruce Greenwood plays the FBI S.A.C. Tom Shea, who continually points out how he hits foreign diplomats in the face. Your boss is out, so nobody in the Department of Homeland Security believes your forecast of the situation. It is the most sensible of a group of paranoid public officials who fear taking responsibility for any type of catastrophe. He is calm, he is strong, he is BORING. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing that redeems or entertains about Meltdown. Okay, well, maybe the death of Teri Bauer was quite unnecessary and funny, apart from that, nothing more.
