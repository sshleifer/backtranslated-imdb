The film was supposed to be released in 2002 and was highly anticipated due to promotions, but was finally released in 2003 after the producer died. <br /> <br /> The movie is good in some parts, but in general it is not excellent. <br /> <br /> The scenes between Rani and Ajay are fine, but the other scenes are not well managed. <br /> <br /> The movie is too similar to BOLLYWOOD Hollywood and, although this was planned before, it was released for the first time, so originality is lost. <br /> <br /> Milan Luthria disappoints in general after KACHCHE DAAGE <br /> <br /> Music is good but there are too many songs <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks tired and his appearance reveals that the film was delayed and his performance looks boring too Rani is good Sonali is also good also rests are fine
