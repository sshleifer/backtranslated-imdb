The case of the cover and the premise they write there is so promising. As a maniac slasher I expect a lot from this. But what the hell is going on? The film is horrible The direction, the plot, the suspense and the act of the releases are so amateur. I even thought they were using a video camera to shoot. Lucky that even so I managed to give me some good moments that make me want. Thanks for the bad package called "Camp Blood". <br /> <br /> 1/10
