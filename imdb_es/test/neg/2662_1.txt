Did you ever see the movie "Marathon Man"? The part with the dentist? I'd rather have that happen to me sitting through "Random Hearts" again. It was not simply disinterested, or without incident ... It was horrible, painful and agonizingly BORED. In a moment, I momentarily lost consciousness. For the average layman, it might look like he was sleeping, but the other sponsors of the film knowingly realized that they actually turned the FLAG OFF. I thought I was going to die. When the film finally ended (I think it lasted twelve hours, but I'm not sure), I let out an exasperated "Thank you Jesus, it's over!", To which all the other spectators applauded. If I had to listen to the drone Harrison Ford in a second more with that monotonous moan, I would have been forced to look for something sharp to jam my eye to divert my attention. This is 136 minutes of my life that I will never go back.
