Oh Gawd. I want to travel back in time to Monogram Studios and strangle someone in their 2-room main office for this sloppy musical. It's one watt above the flat line for 60 of its 61 minutes and then it really shows (for a minute, spread out in milliseconds in the hour) that there are real-life talents that are badly photographed. I just do not do it. see the point of taking some trouble to make this film that could be easily energetic and fun and let the lethargy be the main thing in sight. The odd story shows the ill-tempered vaudeville group Grace Hayes blasting her way to a college where her rat-bag son is a rich college clown. She's going to fix her playboy ways, no matter what. His real-life (strange-looking) son Peter Hays plays his screen son. His real-life wife plays his secretary. Talk about nepotism. I suspect that this talent pack was almost the rationale for Monogram to fund this musical musical produced by the Schlockmeister resident, the extraordinary Sam Katzman. As with other Monogram musicals, it seems more like a reason to shoot new purchases of furniture and lighting fixtures to show other studios that Monogram's images are "luxurious" in their grade B qualities. Take a frightful look to SWING PARADE OF 1946 to have a genuine proof of this: they simply built this gigantic nightclub and then found an excuse for the film actors and the musicians that surround it. History? Any. Anyway, ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH than BOOM. Where were Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when Monogram really needed them? Probably standing at the door of the pen of PRC Pictures wondering if it seemed safe to enter there. Roland Dupree, the jive jive junior, comes alive with his teen legs around two wobbly dance numbers, especially at the end of the "big show" in the new and expanded set of malt avocados / clubs. The usual wrinkled curtains hang loosely on the back wall, and the setting of the mismatched curtain set even has a dark main rag that is pulled back and forth as each amateur sequence advances beyond the previous one. The choir girls and their very simple-looking partners in this ending only look like the Monogram office staff borrowed (from typing and carpentry) for the morning of filming. They have absolutely no talent for dancing and they are so common on the screen ... ALL the girls look like they are called Joyce. There is even a costume calamity in which they wear shorts with ruffles ... only on one leg. Everything is so horrible and unpleasant ... and really annoying when a further improvement on the part of everyone involved would result in ZIS being FUNNY. The only thing strangely interesting is the dialogue between Grace and her son-in-law: she surrenders so casually that it really works despite the script and logic. It has a very similar presence to life, which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be a bit convincing. The child Dupree is the true star. He really can do something ... despite looking like a Liberace barrel dancing teenager ... You read it right.
