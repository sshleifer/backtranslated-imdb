After the General, a film that romanticized the life of the gangster general of Dublin in such heroic proportions that it made the average person in Dublin sick, along with Kevin and his attempt at interpretation by Mr. Lynch or Martin Cahill, also known as the General , the acting is so bad that this criminal drama becomes a comedy for the native Dub, and a tragedy for the Kevin Spacey fan. In short, it's worth watching the movie ... No, unless you like to act badly with the "proper and funny Irish accents, you're sure to be safe". The story is torn from the successful commercial 'The General' which, despite its glorification of a well-known animal from Dublin in Martin Cahill, is still worth seeing, on a domestic scale because it shows the real working class of Dublin, and internationally . due to his true Irish performance and the cast of assassins, including John Voight. In general, 'Ordinary Decent Criminal' is anything but a decent movie. Avoid.
