Dear SciFi channel: How have you been? How was your summer? I have been fine, but I feel that our relationship is no longer the same and that we are separating. I do not understand why you do not love me anymore. I just finished seeing your original "Skeleton Man" from SciFi Channel and, once again, you have shown a lack of respect for my feelings by killing all the girls in this movie! I mean, I understand you're just in this for instant gratification. All you care about is producing a movie where people are cut and cut by a spirit / creature / legend / whatever is a murderer from India. So you really do not have time to think and strive for something else, like finding a costume for Skeleton Man that does not make it like Skeletor's gay lover of "He-Man." Seriously, his tunic looks like a satin blanket and his skull is smooth as a baby's behind, it almost looks like a Halloween costume for a 6-year-old while marching through the desert in a homicidal racket. So we throw you a bone, because we're not looking for Oscar-winning performances, intriguing plot or realistic reactions of the characters to the situations in question. Because we realize that although Michael Rooker, Caspar van Diem and all the girls are supposed to be trained Special Operations agents, all are mysteriously transformed into Keystone Kops that can not shoot or see directly every time the Skeleton Man appears. And we also fully expect nothing (bullets, explosions, electrocution, nothing) to kill Skeleton Man until there is a minute in the movie and we have to find a way to tie things up carefully. We hope to see blood and guts. But you have the ability to take the least attractive actress in the cast and make her the only woman who survives. And, honestly, I think you do it just to get mad. Because this movie, foolish as it is, has the potential to be a classic "so bad is good", and ending all the beauties ruins everything, and forces me to lower your rating. All I ask is that once, just once, you take into account my feelings and let the sexiest girls survive the movie. Please.
