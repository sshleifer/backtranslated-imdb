Naach would have won a Razzie for the worst movie in 2004 (it may also be global) if it were global. When it comes to acting bad (also known as attitude / yawning / about (not) acting) Halle Berry is no match for Antra Malli. While the cat had a history, supposedly a hot actress with a microscopic suit and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all. <br /> <br /> One of those movies that makes me wonder why IMDb allows one to classify a movie as 0/10. Once again, I think the movie does not even deserve a 0. It has to be something negative or less infinite. <br /> <br /> What about the outline of the plot? He is a generous, arrogant choreographer, full of attitude who finds himself with a useless idle and without skills that aspires to be a tale of actors. The story is so short that if it were just another phrase, IMDb could forbid me to write a spoiler. About storytelling? It's like a group (sorry 2 people for the most part) of people moving in super slow motion. Do not try this movie if you bought a new DVD player. You would end up believing that the DVD is in poor condition or that the DVD player is hit. It is not your fault at all. <br /> <br /> At the end of it all, you end up giving some credits to the director. At least he realized that both Antra Malli and Abhishek Bachan (at least at that time) can not talk about the dialogues convincingly, so there are not too many dialogues in this movie. Then, at least you can sleep while listening to the movie, with some annoying noises from the Antra-malli song sequences. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're new to Bollywood Cinema. Once you've tolerated this movie, you can watch any Bollywood movie and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> There can not be a worse 3 hour torture than this one!
