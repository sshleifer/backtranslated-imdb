"Graduation Day" - <br /> <br /> I bought this movie last week and I waited for a moment where I could rest, relax and see some "good" 80's slasher gems, I got this and "Xtro" Look I have never seen any of them. I just saw it and I realized that my external speakers were also on. Can I imagine what my neighbors thought when "Felony" came to sing his only 10 minute hit? I'm sure it was noisy and I'm sure they think I'm weird, with that and the sound of the chainsaw and the screams of other movies. <br /> <br /> This was a pretty sub-slasher movie, without suspense, there's no story, some great deaths, they almost seemed on the amateur side, I usually like movies like that, but they just did not fit in with me, Now I will see "Xtro" for the first time and I will have a margarita! <br /> <br /> DJ Eric Austin TX
