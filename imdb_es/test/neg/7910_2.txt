After a humiliating experience on a plane, Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) sued the airline and used the money he earned to start his own full-service airline. What makes it different is that it has attractive hostesses, a dance club on board and nothing less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cabin. <br /> <br /> Soul Plane is a very racist comedy, except that occasionally it's fun. Soul Plane has been described as an "urban" version of Airplane. The problem is that Soul Plane does not even get close to achieving the Airplane laughs. The jokes on Soul Pane are too offensive and mostly unoriginal. I would be lying if I said I did not laugh as there were some fun times. However, I expected more and left the theater disappointed. <br /> <br /> I would compare Soul Plane with Airplane 2. The latter was just a rehash of the first movie, while the first is just a rehash of obsolete. Jokes raw. There really is no creativity behind the movie and there are only a few fun places. However, I do not think Soul Plane is "top 100" bad. At this time, the movie is ranked at number 82 and that is a little hard. I'm not saying this is a good movie, but it's not terrible either. The execution time is only 86 minutes, so it is not too painful to watch. For stupid comedies, you can do much worse. <br /> <br /> No one in the cast is very good, but everyone seems to be having fun and this helps. Kevin Hart was very annoying like Nashawn. He had some funny lines, but he is a very poor man. Snoop Dogg, who was a little funny in Starsky and Hutch, flies here completely. Tom Arnold was really tolerable and that was the biggest surprise of the movie. The most annoying person in the movie was Ryan Pinkston. It was not fun at all and never will be. The funniest cast members were Missi Pyle and Mo'Nique. They gave the best phrases and made me laugh more. In the end, Soul Plane can fit the requirements if you're looking for a stupid comedy, but it would probably be better if you just skip the movie. Rating 4/10
