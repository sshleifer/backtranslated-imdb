I picked up this movie a few years ago, one night, and it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. However, as it is supposed to be an action movie, I can not give more stars since the humor was not intentional. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris plays a trucker who comes home from the road to see his family, and in the first five minutes there is the conflict that leads Chuck to seek revenge for the rest of the movie. Something good too, because the performance below the par of all involved was beginning to age very fast. Actually, the judge was pretty good, but I can not really describe what makes it work, he'll have to prove it for himself. <br /> <br /> And Van Chuck Norris's custom units are horribly classic!
