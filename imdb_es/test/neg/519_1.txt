This movie has to be classified down there with Ed Wood's films. A terrible and bad script, bad acting. <br /> <br /> A machine gun fights in front of the glass windows; The minutes pass before someone is hit and no one has coverage, no window breaks. You would think that after a firefight like the big U-Haul truck could be riddled, not a scratch. <br /> <br /> Do the CIA agents and the government contractors = shout? Party with hundreds of people around. <br /> <br /> There is not a single actor that you care about; all are superficial and basically unpleasant. <br /> <br /> A 747 bound for Hawaii leaves Los Angeles and crashes twenty minutes later in the Pacific "... in 100 feet of water ...". Little time passes when the stewardess announces to the other five passengers that they only have two hours of air left; In a 747? <br /> <br /> The next day, the rescue teams show up and, amazingly, the six passengers are still alive. <br /> <br /> A film that starts mediocre and goes from bad to worse. . <br /> <br />
