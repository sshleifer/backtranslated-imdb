I woke up and it was a beautiful day; The sun was shining, the birds were singing and I wanted to get a movie, something new, maybe a horror movie? Like many other critics, I found what can only be described as a piece of poop in a gold wrapper. The cover is great, and the comment on the back is fascinating: "it will scare you a lot" ... oh, how I chuckle when I remember so much naivet√© and ignorance. <br /> <br /> One of the many things that scare more than this movie are the acting skills of these "actors". I think not, I was really happy when they were cut by these "scarecrows", who wore classic costume costumes. I used to drive pretty fast through the corn fields as they seemed pretty scary at night, but after watching this movie, I almost got wet (through so much laughing) upon seeing it. <br /> <br /> I have seen tortillas of fear quite honestly, although not mine, I am an expert in cooking tortillas, and if someone associates this movie with my tortilla, let's say that it would create a situation in which They would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row. <br /> <br /> If someone has a good corn movie (not pop culture) that they can recommend, do not hesitate to inform me. It's a great comedy if nothing else, it's fine, it's nothing more. Enjoy, but a little advice: before pressing the play button on your DVD player, throw it out the window.
