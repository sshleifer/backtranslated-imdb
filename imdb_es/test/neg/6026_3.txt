It seems that I found the trailers better than the movie. They did their job and made me interested in seeing UNKNOWN. The interest faded early. A simple premise in the landscape. Five men wake up in a chemical store without knowing why they are there; let alone know how the hell they got there. Confusion and paranoia bring fear and distrust. The men learn that a kidnapper is on the way with plans to kill his hostages. Now the men measure each other trying to distinguish if all are victims and who can be one of the kidnappers. The cast includes Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Bridget Moynahan, Barry Peppper, David Selby and Adam Rodriguez.
