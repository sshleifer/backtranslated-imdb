Amando DeOssorio never let the lack of budget get in the way of telling one of his stories. His "Blind Dead" series started very well, but he had some really fun moments, like the shots of a small model boat in a water tank for "The Ghost Galleon". In "The Sea Serpent", he hits bottom and takes some notable actors with him, telling the story of a monster of silly socks that brings the terror of Google to some water tanks and miniature aquariums. <br /> <br /> A vague sequence of opening sets the stage and demonstrates an aborted military mission in which American pilots, for some unknown reason, throw an atomic bomb (with cheeky cartoons in the frame of the movie) somewhere in the ocean off the coast of Spain. The military commander gives this order from an office that features a prominent American flag and the portrait of a deranged-looking Ronald Reagan, one of the few things that makes this movie really look like that of the eighties. The other two are the hilariously inept subtitle that states that the year is "1,985" and the outdated hairstyle of Sheena Easton, which would have looked great next to some neon sweats. <br /> <br /> One of the most showy monsters you will ever see rise from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. We learn that the roving atomic bomb has killed a lot of local fish. Unfortunately for our cast, it has no effect on the Sea Serpent, which descends rapidly on the coast of Spain due to a miniature chaos. <br /> <br /> Now, when I say that the monster is not realistic, I am not exaggerating. . It is not just "a kind of" false aspect. I'm sure the filmmakers did the best with the ten dollars that seem to have been allocated, but most of the time it looks like it was made with Crayola markers, a ping pong ball and an old sock. Not only that, she has this sinister music that accompanies her wherever she goes, music that sounds as much as the song "Jaws" which is a wonder that nobody has been sued. <br /> <br /> Along with Tyria Power, Timothy Bottoms and Ray Milland are trapped in the slums, and the dialogue could not have been more grim. Through a series of plots, our main actors come together in a search for ... well, I'm not sure what the purpose is. The funds and the power have to show that the snake is real to save its butts (it is blamed for a shipwreck induced by the snake, it is locked in the container of crazy people after a sighting). None of this matters, because at the end of the film nothing has been resolved. Nobody admits that the snake is real, and it is not even dead. In addition, power and funds are still waiting for the law. <br /> <br /> As illogical as it may seem, only our heroes know that the snake exists (in spite of numerous disappearances, a shattered beacon and a crushed railway bridge), and embark on an extended non-adventure to track Down and drive away the monster ... do not kill him, since they know they are no match for him. His great plan is to use flares to scare him away. Although its scheme is flawed, the snake causes a huge explosion in the water after it attacks the support of a bridge (do not ask), and the giant sea serpent is so frightened that it moves away. The critical viewer would wonder why the snake was not scared before in the movie when it caused a couple of big bangs after crashing into a pier. But it does not matter. He walks away, and our heroes are sure he's gone forever. End. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine the horror the stars felt when they saw the full movie they had just finished working on. A lamebrain script and a couple of faint reaction shots could never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing screen time with a beast of stop-motion puppets / stop motion. At least the supporting characters had fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed by a giant snakehead. I'm not sure what was going on when they made this movie; The monster is cheap, but there are some pretty elaborate miniatures games, so someone spent time doing them, not to mention the stop-motion animation involved. Apparently it plays straight, although maybe the sense of humor of this film crossed my mind. In the end, the film is no more than an easy target for a drunken comment. Look at a party to get better results.
