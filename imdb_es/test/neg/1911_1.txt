Well, if you leave aside the fact that this movie presents an abysmal performance; and, if he leaves aside the fact that history is confused and veers off in five different directions without ever deciding in what way he really wants to go; and, if you leave aside the fact that I did not find a single scene in this film that was remotely interesting; Well, if you leave all that aside, this is still a REALLY terrible movie! <br /> <br /> I suppose this is supposed to be a love story about a rich man and a poor girl. I never understood for a moment how this romance between Kelley (Chris Klein) and Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) began. The inexplicable romance is compounded by a complete lack of chemistry between Klein and Sobieski. The script (by Michael Seitzman) is boring to the point of astonishment. How Seitzman managed to write the thing without falling asleep is a miracle; To think that someone would want to pay to see this is incredible. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that this is a REALLY REALLY terrible movie? <br /> <br /> I would give it a ZERO, but the IMDb does not provide ZERO votes. So I give him a one while I grab my nose.
