Milla stands out in this film because of her personal sense of style and the way her clothes hang. I learned to hate that wrinkled, three-year-old face he makes when he pretends to cry. It highlights any point that she is trying to make while a serious actress falls quickly. Of course, in a movie with a BALDWIN and Denise, she still shines as a mature actor. David seemed to be doing Woody Allen through Howdy Doody. Not a single word or gesture in the whole movie seemed sincere or even sincere. "How Harry Harry Sally" and "Two Weddings and Funeral", including "Sleepless In Seattle" had scripts, locations and ACTORS. The script seemed to be a series of bad and raw jokes separated by a lot of talking. The locations seemed to be a few blocks from each other. There are only two actors in this dislike of an independent film, Mile and the lady who played the girl who was in the stars. I saw most of this through the first time with the sound off, just looking at Mile. That gag subscript was old the first time I saw it and it's a nonsense of a song in "How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying It".
