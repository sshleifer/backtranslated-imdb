Linda Arvidson (as Jennie) and Harry Solter (as Frank) are enjoying a romantic date, when she enters her father Charles Inslee; furious, pursue Mr. Solter out of the house. Undaunted, he goes to his balcony and begs her to run away. Mrs. Arvidson agrees, and will pack. Then, the thief George Gebhardt arrives to steal the place. Although he does not get much in the way of the booty, the thief Gebhardt manages to use Arvidson's trunk to escape the police. <br /> <br /> An invented comedy. Keep in mind that, during the balcony scene, Solter gets out of the chamber, so the thief Gebhardt can enter the house without being detected. And, Arvidson travels very lightly, since there does not seem to be anything in his heavy trunk; Maybe he just wanted to cheer up Beau Solter? Director D.W. Griffith, Robert Harron and Florence Lawrence are illustrious extras. <br /> <br /> ** A calamitous escape (8/7/08) D.W. Griffith ~ George Gebhardt, Linda Arvidson, Harry Solter
