I would love to sit down and write an intelligent and thoughtful review. However, I think I will spend more time in the writing process than the filmmakers. I live in Los Angeles and I regret to say that the characters seemed so similar to ACTORS underemployed and overly inflated by the ego. There was not a moment in the movie where I could escape the feeling that I was watching the conversation of unemployed actors in a hipster cafe in Los Angeles. One of the worst "indie" movies I've seen with so little to recommend that listening to them won at Sundance has effectively eliminated any previous interest you may have had in attending, let alone considering that a post-Sundance review is meaningful. Look at your own risk.
