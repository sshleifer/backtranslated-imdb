I am a fan of the 1950s and, 20 minutes into this new version, I began to think that it would be as good as the original, but it was not. The motive for the murders was incredibly stupid. Two of the lovers of the movie turn out to be brothers and sisters, excuse me while I'm throwing up. The main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex, which makes no sense considering the situation he is in. If the filmmakers wanted a sex scene, they should have put it in the movie earlier than the main character (played by Dexter). Dennis Quaid discovered that he is about to die and that he is accused of a crime. There is a reason why the sex scene develops. At the beginning of the movie, Dexter does not live life to the fullest, so he is not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan. I still feel that it would make more sense that the sex scene had been cut or earlier in the film and that the two brothers were not lovers. <br /> <br /> One of the dumbest parts of the movie has to do with a gun fight, a couple of people dying and a person run over 15 yards from a crowded carnival, and yet, NO ONE IN THE CARNIVAL WARNINGS! Also in the scene is the base of the University where the film is developed. . If you fall into the tar, you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds. Not only is it hard to believe that things would sink so fast in tar, but the most important thing is who builds a university in tar pits. I would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is, but I do not want to put a spoiler on my post.
