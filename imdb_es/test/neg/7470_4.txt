This movie was just an exploding gay cheesecake. It was not an "art" movie; just an excuse to show several free, exploitative and exaggerated scenes with a wide male genital nudity. There was a wardrobe scene with more than a dozen naked men. The camera approaches the asses and penises of men, since they are portrayed for several minutes with their cocks in full screen. There are several scenes in this movie that show penis after penis. It quickly becomes redundant REAL and makes it impossible to take this movie seriously. I was wondering if I was watching a Playgirl video by mistake. If these same scenes were filmed with women (for example, totally naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly), it would quickly be discarded as just soft pornography and an excuse to show many eye candy ... that's all this movie is. Any artistic merit was discharged from the gay ghetto mentality. The themes of class distinction, homosexuality, longing, etc. they were simple and superficial; no more developed than one would expect from a freshman philosophy student. Just cut out the hunt and rent a gay porn instead.
