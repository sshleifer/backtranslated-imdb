Yes, I admire the independent spirit of all this, but it's like Road Trip with a bad deal and no budget. <br /> <br /> I laugh when I see American comedies, I do not laugh. This movie made me laugh, but only because of the abundantly obvious attempts to simulate high school American high school / pot-pot movies. <br /> <br /> If you want a good independent American comedy with pot references, go see Kevin The Movies of Smith or Richard Linklater or something like that. Do not waste time on this piece of the movie. <br /> <br /> I mean, how can you take these comments seriously when most people complain that the characters do not smoke marijuana? <br /> And by the way: in Norway it's called "Dude, Where's My Pot"!
