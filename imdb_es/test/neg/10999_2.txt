Susan, without realizing it, stumbles upon a drug smuggling network, while her real estate agent has a flat tire while taking her to see a house. The leader of this gang of drug dealers, Mongo (who only has a week until retirement), thinking he knows a lot more than this bubbly blond, actually seeks to make sure he does not tell anyone anything and, therefore, begins a of the most sensational movies that I have sat down. <br /> <br /> All the actors in this movie can not act in the least. Susan is a pretty ineffective hero for most of the movie (she would never escape several times if it were not for the fact that apparently everyone in the movie wants to have sex with her) and does not take the offensive until the last 20 minutes of the movie . When it does, it issues a generic line of "I've had enough", preaches about the sister, that same thought went through my mind several times when I was watching this <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
