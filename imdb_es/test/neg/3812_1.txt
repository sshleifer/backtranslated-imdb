Harry Knowles has an appointment on the cover of the DVD that says "The Next Icon of Horror." I have heard many exaggerations about this but I was not totally convinced. However, I am a big fan of horror and I will give almost any horror movie an opportunity. Regardless of the budget or qualification, you never know where the next gem will be. Not here. No Hatchet. Hatchet is badly conceived, badly acted and funny. Just because you have the actors who played Freddy Jason and Candyman, and a topless Buffy chic with tons of blood does not make you a horror expert. Sorry. I do not even want to describe the plot because it's so idiotic. Honestly, my money is in Rob Zombie. There is a man who knows the horror of the old school. Forget this garbage.
