The last attempt to revive the series is actually based on a pretty good idea but without the gore fx / violence required for this type of thriller, and therefore ... BORED !! Good special effects, games, costumes, etc., but the movie is simply silly and almost a waste of time ... hopefully the next installment will solve this problem.
