I do not think it is necessary to outline the plot for you, because the site and other users have already done an excellent job. Having said that, here is my opinion. This is by far the worst movie of 2005, and there have been some really bad ones. I do not even need to go into detail because there is nothing redeeming about this movie. Bad acting, bad plot, bad direction, bad special effects, whatever. If it is not only the worst movie that has been made, it is linked to some other piece of trash. I would be ashamed if my friends knew I was in this movie. But hey, most people who will see it will do it no matter what comments they receive, so more power for you. When you feel the empty vacuum between your neurons two hours after your evening, do not blame me.
