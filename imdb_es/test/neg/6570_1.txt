When I saw it for the first time 9 years ago, when I was 9 years old, I thought I had plagued myself. I'm 18 years old now and I still think it sucks. I mean, it lacks special effects or something, it was boring and a little anti-climatic. My cousin looked once and George Takai (Sulu) kept talking about how it was supposed to be much better, but they kept cutting the budget. It would have been a great episode, but it was a terrible movie.
