Get the CD instead. The show is docile, and the edition stinks. The crowd has too much time on screen, like Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time in the same child shaking their heads in the same way (which leads me to believe that it is exactly the same shot) as during Richard Kruspe's solo in Weisses Fleisch. The scenes change so quickly that it is impossible to know where the camera is pointing, and the repetitions are simply redundant. It is not worth the tape on which it is recorded.
