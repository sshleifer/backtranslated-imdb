I bought this movie in plain sight without being seen at a science fiction convention and got what it deserved for doing something so silly. Simply putting this movie is unlikely, boring and you can not see it. <br /> <br /> I was so bored and disgusted with the lack of development of the plot that I turned it off to see a replay of Mythbusters. I understand that this was a very low budget movement, or at least it seemed a very low budget movement, but that does not justify the horrible performance, the terrible plot and even the worst camera work. It seems like something that a group of college students did between classes and getting drunk. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the villain were not so ridiculous and the plot was something that could really happen in real life with respect to the law the application could become so bad that it's funny. This movie is not funny, it's just bad.
