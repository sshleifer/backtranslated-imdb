In general, political messages are broadcast on television, so if you are a big fan of environmental correction, be attentive to its content. Most people go to the movies to entertain themselves, not to sell political nonsense. The hook here is the big name cast. Unfortunately, the sum of the performances amounts to a full movie that went nowhere. The two best performances, Chris Cooper and Richard Dreyfus, have a minimum screen time. In short, "Silver City" should be avoided as entertainment. It is nothing more than a political exhibition, non-documentary and itinerant, about illegal immigration, pollution and any other cause that does not belong anywhere, except on the small screen. - MERK
