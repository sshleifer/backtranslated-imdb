This movie is just trash. I have to say that I am an expert in garbage films. I reserve the rating of "1" for movies that are garbage, but funny, but this movie is tedious and certainly not a crap in a funny way but a crap in a horrible way. You get a "2", so those of you can distinguish between those that will make you laugh and those that will make you fall asleep. There are scenes in this film in which the actors look at something, their expressions are of amazement and there are wide open eyes and loose jaws that tell the audience that what they see is going to be profoundly amazing, this is simply not just Wardrobe or even more desert. It has to be pretty damn horrible for me to leave, let me tell you, I left and many people too.
