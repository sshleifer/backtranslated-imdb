I lost enough time in reality LOOKING at this task of a movie, I do not want to waste more by writing a great review. Not once did I smile. ALL the jokes were boring, forced and lacked some kind of ingenuity. He kept saying, "where's the punchline?" Almost all the characters were an unpleasant stereotype and all the situations were clich√© and half the time there was no solution. Things just happened to the next scene. For my life, I can not understand how this got as many good reviews as it did. If you like the awkward acting and the badly composed movie, Fat Girls is the movie for you.
