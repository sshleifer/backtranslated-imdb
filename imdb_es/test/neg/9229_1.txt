Yes, it's me again! Sir 'I sit in the middle of the shit so I do not have to do it'. <br /> <br /> What do you think this is about? Could it be a woman who calls a sexual line and organizes a meeting with singles in a secluded area? So your transvestite boyfriend comes and cuts his throat with a razor, before they leave with his money? Wow, what a guess! And if I tell him that the policeman in charge of the case is forced to join a sexy assistant, DA, to catch these fools, what conclusion will come? Do you think that the sexy DA will go undercover with a flimsy red dress to an attempt to meet the drag queen, but then end up being kidnapped and will have to be rescued by the dissident officer? (who has already delivered his weapon and badge) ZING! You get 10 points! <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie bored me to tears. Why do people insist on making this kind of garbage? It's a waste of our time, its time and, nevertheless, they continue without importing ... to film a film that nobody gives an apex. If it has any redeeming characteristics, there is the fact that it has some of the most beautiful women I've seen in a movie for a while. I hope you have spent the meager wages you earned on a lot of botox and colon irrigation. They would look great on the cover of Vogue, or placed on top of a car in a bikini. They should only let the professionals act (like Shannon Tweed). <br /> <br /> Speaking of future careers, I met the director the other day. Surely he prepares a tasty chicken burger meal. I must also say that the uniform really suits him. I asked him about 'Party Line', and his eyes went to the floor before he muttered something about extra fries. Oh, well, I guess it did not work well. It does not matter, they are letting him take charge of the car trip tomorrow! Hurrah!! 1/10
