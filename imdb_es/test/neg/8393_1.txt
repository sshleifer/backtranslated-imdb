If it is an art and essay film, there is not enough art, not to mention the essay. <br /> <br /> If it's a thriller, there's not enough thriller. <br /> <br /> If it is a drama for teenagers, there is not enough drama, and as far as teenagers are concerned, there are not enough NOFX and too much Nino Rota. <br /> <br /> I thought it might be a trailer for the next Tony Hawk movie, but there's no Tony Hawk, so I guess I've been tricked: it's not a biographical biography of Tony Hawk. <br /> <br /> If it is an action movie, it lacks explosions, which would have added something of interest, or at least it would have made the sleepers jump to their chairs. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem to be dead inside, but it's not a zombie movie. In fact, if it's a movie, there's not enough plot. If it's not a movie, it's too long to be a music video. <br /> <br /> If it's a music video, well ... it's an album that I will not buy
