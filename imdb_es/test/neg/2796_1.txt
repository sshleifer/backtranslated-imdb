Now, I'm going to do this without putting spoilers if I can. My cousin and I were renting movies the other weekend, and we ran into this, with the big scarecrow on the cover. It looked great, so we rented it together with Kungfu Hustle. <br /> <br /> Wow ... Simply ... Wow. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the movie was horrible. Now, the art of the box, the initial scenes and the music were well done, but the film itself is horrible. The performance is unsatisfactory (Sean, the protagonist, barely shows emotion and / or effort in his character), the scarecrows do not look anything like the ones on the cover (false advertising, perhaps?), And the shots and angles of the camera was that of a bad fight event. <br /> <br /> And believe me, I'm a fan of wrestling. I know bad camera angles. And honestly, this is up to Gigli and Pootie Tang. It gets so bad that it amuses me. Makes me laugh. So, somehow, this movie takes its place as a good comedy for me. <br /> <br /> But, to be fair, it serves as what to do and what not to do in movies, especially from the genre slasher. I recommend that people see this, just to have an idea of ​​what to avoid.
