A comedy of biblical proportions! Those masters of hyperbole, the writers of the film's label line, do it again; The sequel to Bruce Almighty of 2003, barely rises a giggle. The only thing that awakens my interest in this film over total indifference are its Christian dogmatic nuances. I'm sorry, do the harmonics. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrel, ignoring Jim Carrey's good sense for rejecting retaliation, plays Evan Baxter, the presumed news anchor of Bruce Almighty, who has just been elected to Congress. With a new life in Virginia and the stress of moving to a house the size of the Acropolis, the pressure of all the change affects your family. His wife (Lauren Graham), evidently transported by air from Stepford, and their three children (Jimmy Bennett, Graham Phillips and Johnny Simmons), who do an arduous job of looking sad at the accompaniment of a piano, pray for the family to come closer more and almost out of guilt, also Evan. <br /> <br /> In what must be the greatest impact of all time, God (Morgan Freeman) actually appears, but he does all the annoying work in mysterious ways all over the place by telling Evan to build a Ark Noah-esquire in preparation for a big flood instead of just giving him a pool table or an X-box or something. And in the true mischievous deity style, he also forces Evan to grow a beard, long hair and wear worn and crappy robes. Now, back in the day, I'm sure the razor blades were hard to come by, so the beard was inevitable for Noah, but I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with spirituality. The same with the tunics; A massive construction job is surely made even more difficult by this so impractical clothing. Could not God have conjured a pair of steel-tipped boots and a helmet for the poor? Apparently not. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Bill Hicks, I find that the idea that God is playing with us is disturbing, and so is Evan, who fights against him every step of the way. And who does not? Essentially, God dismisses him, expels his loved ones, turns him into a laughingstock and, at a given moment, threatens him. Of course God is right, and the rational and hardworking family man who was getting along is only forced to eat a large portion of sweet and sour bittersweet pie. It's almost as if God left him alone, Evan had to tolerate him and make him funny. What kind of message is that? <br /> <br /> Evan Almighty has a very commendable environmental bent, with the underlying theme that the federal government is blind to the damage that is being done to the world around us. It is also the first film to offset its carbon emissions and this should surely be considered a historic achievement by a Hollywood studio. If it were not for the trivial and condescending flag of American Christianity that flew far above it, Evan Almighty could have been a harmless family movie, with an environmental record worthy of praise. But with its confusing religious dogma and its relentless message of 'blind faith', it ranks as one of the most disgusting films of all time.
