My reasoning behind seeing this movie (even though it was free), was more or less out of curiosity ... slight, slight curiosity ... I was not so familiar with this "biographical" direct to the video account of Mr. Gein and discovered during the initial credits that presented the horror icon Kane Hodder in the lead role. My emotions passed not only out of curiosity, but now by a flash of slight anticipation as to how his representation of Gein would turn out. Also in the credits (among some grim photos of Ed's crimes) were Michael Berryman and Priscilla Barns. "It's okay," I thought to myself ... "This can be fun." As the movie started and progressed (slowly), my microscopic confidence (or as I call it, "micro-hope") for this film completely vanished and I was stuck with an overwhelming sense of humiliation when I died a little inside Seeing this. heap of manure. Hodder, who is widely known and respected for his past work as an unstoppable serial killer, inaccurately puts this into play, turning Eddie Gein from a well-mannered inmate into a large-scale killer. Stalks at night, killing the caretakers of the cemetery, her grave steals from her friends and teenagers, leaving Plainfield in panic, as the local Sheriff's Department seems to do nothing to adjust the dangerous situation in the least. The assistant and his mother have a small and warm relationship that gave me a blurred feeling inside (or that could have been the cyanide pill that I swallowed in half a turkey). I'm not sure what the objective of this film was and, obviously, the director did not know anything about the subject he was working on. There are already a lot of movies related to the Gein story that, unless the "Ed Gein Snuff Video" is discovered, I do not want to see more of these on the shelves. If you want a more authentic film of this nature, check out "Ed Gein (also known as In the Light of the Moon) of 2001".
