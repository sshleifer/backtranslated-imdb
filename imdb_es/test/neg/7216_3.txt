The original Road House is by no means an award-winning film. But it is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time. It should not have been so hard to make a sequel. There is no need for a big budget, big stars and spectacular visual effects. Even the story did not have to be original. All I needed was a good vibe of time, and some great fist fights. I do not mean "wire-fu" in the Matrix style, just some choreographed fights at the bar. Many of them. There are a couple of decent fights in the movie, but none of them is memorable, and the focus is more on the weapon game. Also, the way it relates to the original movie is ridiculous, almost insulting. Johnathon Schaech plays Shane Tanner, an undercover agent of the DEA who is good with his hands and feet. But here's the kicker ... he's the son of Patrick Swayze's character, Dalton! What what????? Let's see, the original Road House was made in 1989. So, for Dalton to have a son in his last 20 years (maybe even 30) in 2006 ... well, you get the idea. They give him a cheesy explanation that he lived with his uncle Nate (Will Patton) while his father "traveled a lot". Oh please. That in itself almost justifies turning this movie off. But I digress. Schaech is completely out of his element. Of course he can throw a couple of kicks, but he has nothing as an actor. In addition, the bad ones are referred to in the movie as "pretty boy". I've never examined men so closely, but I do not think this guy is so handsome. He looks sick. His face is too thin and his sunken eyes make it look as if he will faint at any moment. I had never heard of him before, but I think he should stop acting and go back to his daily work. Jake Busey plays local drug broker Wild Bill. Busey is not a terrible actor. He was good at Starship Troopers, and he even became a menacing villain in Hitcher 2. But here, he just chews the stage in the standard bad guy mode. Even his "threatening" dialogue is a worthy yawn. We're supposed to buy it as the man who has the whole city in his pocket. But why? What does he do? Why do you want to buy a Patton bar "by any means necessary"? Ellen Hollman has the symbolic bride role. A woman with a secret. Pity that the secret is as difficult to understand as 2 + 2. She is the teacher of the local primary school who turns out to be a former Army soldier. Guess what that means? It means that, while it may tremble in fear for most of the movie, it will be ready to break heads when the skin begins to fly. Oh well, at least she is good. Actually, the fight between her and the Wild Bill girl is the best in the movie. It's fast, brutal and entertaining. Which brings me to my next problem with the movie ... the fights. Like I said Schaech knows how to throw a punch. The same can not be said of who faces in the film. Obviously, the film will be reduced to Schaech against Busey. Busey is an actor, not a fighter. He does not possess the skills to pull a movie fight. Swayze may have been a trained dancer, but his athletic ability gave him the means to perform well choreographed fights. He also faced a pair of worthy opponents, and had a murderous move (literally). None of that here. With a couple of exceptions, the fights are forced, poorly organized and routine. The punches sound as if someone were hitting a 2X4 on the concrete, and there are even a couple of parts where the sound does not even match the hit. It is shameful. There is not even the good southern / redneck music of the original. Road House had Jeff Healy Band, which at that time was a somewhat popular band. This film features a singer named John Otto, whose music is lukewarm, and his acting is even worse. He has given a line in the movie, which was probably inserted to appease the fans that may have out there. Either that or someone owed him a favor. My final complaint about the film is the one that arises from being demanding ... continuity. The films are recorded out of sequence, and then the editor's job is to put it all together. Well, someone should give a little push to the editor of this movie. The problems range from small things like people who do not look in the same direction when a shot changes, to RE-USED images at the end of the movie. At the beginning, they present us with the bar, The Black Pellican. As the camera moves through the bar, you see the band, the gorillas and the people dancing. At the end of the movie, when the bad guys have been defeated, we have another photo of the same bar, with photos of our hero sitting in the bar with his girl. The problem is that the images of the people in the bar are the SAME images from the beginning of the movie! It is not a joke. They are the same people, standing (or dancing) in the same places, wearing the same clothes. Do you want to know the most fun part? You see the gorillas in the shot who were KILLED earlier in the movie. Do yourself a favor, do not watch this movie unless YOU feel the need to go out and hit someone. This movie will make you angry enough to do it.
