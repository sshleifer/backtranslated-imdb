When I bought 4 DVDs for Â£ 5.oo at a local store, I should have warned enough that this movie was not at the usual level of David Selznick Productions. With a cast that contains names like James Stewart and Carole Lombard, I expected real pleasure. As many other commentators have said, it is a strange mixture of plot and scenes that is not entirely convincing. HOWEVER, I am so happy to have seen this movie because now I have the memorable saying: "Never let seeds prevent you from enjoying watermelon". live by This should summarize everyone's life. Choose those seeds or spit them out or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon - life itself.
