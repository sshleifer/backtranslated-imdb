This is a stupid movie. Like many of these karate movies, it is poorly written, uncomfortable and, sometimes, simply stupid. The action really is not everything and the film in general leaves much to be desired. Everyone here is talking jive, doing bad karate and doing a very bad acting job. <br /> <br /> Look out for Scatman Crothers in a small role, it's too good for this movie in general. Jim Kelly is good at karate, but he is a terrible actor. Gloria Hendry is really bad. They are all, there are so many parts in this movie that do not make any sense. The supposed love / flight scene with Hendry and Kelly, what the hell was that? They destroyed that man's guitar, for no reason! <br /> <br /> And then there were the obligatory girls on the trampolines! Now what was that? They were in the movie for five seconds, so you never knew about them again !!! Then there's the whole racially charged element of the movie, which is great and everything, but in this movie it's not going anywhere. Like I said, this is good for laughing once, but do not see it again.
