I'm sitting here writing this review and the movie is not over yet. In fact, I just verified, and there are 45 more minutes left. But it does not matter, there is no need to take it to the end. I'll just write this review and I'll laugh while the movie plays in the background and stumble upon a presumably horrible conclusion that I'm not interested in seeing or knowing. Hostility to this movie? The characters are not credible. The plot is not credible. The pretension of the film is disgusting. Basically, every element of the movie sounds fake. Obviously, Buscemi thought he had something to add to the dozens of films that had already explored the issues of dysfunctional families and the apparent lack of meaning in life. However, Buscemi was very wrong, because this movie does not contain anything new. It tries to be very depressing, but fortunately no one can really get depressed, because it is obvious that there are no people like this in the whole world. This film was voted several undeserved awards. Disgusting!!!! Conclusion: stay away from this film without value at all costs.
