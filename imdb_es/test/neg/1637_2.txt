This was the second MST3K movie I saw, and it still holds a place in my heart as one of the most hilariously horrible movie experiences I've ever had. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe (sp?) is in this, using his chiseled physique to get another payment on his condo mortgage. It is rigid, wooden and unconvincing, but it still appears as a nice and nice guy, and at least it is photogenic. It's the only decent thing I can say about the movie, so I thought I'd get it out of the way right in front of it. The fact that he is in the film adds another point to the score and saves it from being "1 out of 10." <br /> <br /> In no particular order, some examples of how bad this movie is: <br /> <br /> 1) Well, the clone of Tanya Roberts (Mila) is heading to the confines of the earth. 'to find Ator, who takes 3 minutes of screen time, including the time he spends dying by a poisoned arrow in his shoulder (which I suppose would have slowed it down a bit). So Ator heals her, takes Thong, her trustworthy help, and goes back to her castle ... and proceeds to take the next 50 minutes of the film recovering the land Mila went through in 3 minutes. How does it work??? I know that the intrepid crew is being harassed by magical forces and enemies, etc. on the way back, but still ...! <br /> <br /> 2) Apparently, the writer / director felt the need to add "depth" to the film by adding an ongoing debate / Socratic dialogue / 20-question game between Zor (the aspiring John Saxon) and the sage Akronas (the aspiring Richard Harris). But apparently, Joe Damoto received his philosophical training with Hallmark cards, t-shirts and bumper stickers, and does not understand the rhythm, rhythm or timing ... and neither the actors. (Crow's observation during one of these exchanges is the tag line of my entry). The scenes with these two crawl over and over again, which stops the film and kills any impulse or emotion generated by the sword fight and the search for the heroic trio. <br /> <br /> 3) Once Ator arrives at The Castle (and is captured), things go even further downhill. Zor decides to feed a group of female victims, along with Ator and Mila, to the Serpent God that he keeps in his basement. This scene had some potential for excitement, so the director immediately kills this potential by instilling the scene with all the drama of people waiting in line at the DMV to pay their traffic tickets. Ator proceeds to have a great battle with the Serpent that is hardly more convincing than the Battle of Bela Lugosi with the rubber octopus puppet in "Bride Of The Monster". <br /> <br /> 4) The climatic scene, in which Ator invents the hang glider with twigs and animal skins, is so obviously silly that it makes the spectator leave the film completely and make you roll on the ground . laughing until your sides hurt. <br /> <br /> 5) Oh, yes, and the filmmakers decided to include images of an atomic explosion at the end, with the moral that Ator decided to destroy the 'atomic nucleus' McGuffin that drives the film because humanity was not "ready". ("Zzzzip! MESSAGE COMING !!!") Like "Bride Of the Monster" again, come and think about it. All he needed was a viewer to observe: "They manipulated God's dominion." <br /> <br /> 6) For some reason, the version of the movie I saw had introductory and closing features of homoerotic credit sequences that have absolutely NOTHING to do with anyone or anything else in the movie. I have no idea where this recording came from, but it's actually WORST than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Look at this only if you're a big fan of Miles, or if you like the way MST3K plays material like this.
