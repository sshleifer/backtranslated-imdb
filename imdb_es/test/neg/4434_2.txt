I assumed that I was actually expecting a new Bollywood version of "The Fog" from the title, but it's actually more a Bollywood version of "I know what you did last summer," with some "Scream" elements, something like , something like not a very good one either. Apart from a couple of very entertaining song numbers and dances, this is pretty terrible. Obviously, it has a decent budget and, however, is wasted on reheated leftovers that were not so tasty to begin with. A young woman is threatened by a spooky boy not to participate in a beauty contest, because she wants her sister to win (she, fortunately, does not seem as scary as her brother), but she goes in anyway and wins, and of course A creepy guy pursues and dies, after which comes an exciting game of "hide the body." Of course, the body disappears and nobody seems to know why, but someone knows it, and they are waiting for the end to reveal a ridiculous twist to the plot. Interested with all this tired rehash there are some ingenious dance numbers, especially the number of celebration dances in the party for Simran, the girl who won the beauty contest ... it's very colorful, it's well made and it's downright funny , and it is completely wasted in this terrible movie. I would rather see an old Ramsay Brothers movie than this garbage, even though someone has felt that it is not necessary for them to be available, for the most part, which is a crime in itself. But it's not a crime as big as this movie. I took one for the team that was watching it, so take my advice, do not bother. 2 out of 10
