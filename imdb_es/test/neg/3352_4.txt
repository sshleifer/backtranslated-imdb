I had never heard of A DARK NIGHT until someone mentioned it recently on a horror message board, and reading, I gained interest due to the participation of Meg Tilly and recognizing that it was an early concert for Friday THE 13th VI: JASON LIVE The director Tom McLoughlin. Unfortunately, it's sad to say, it's nothing special. The premise has a familiarity: a college girl must survive the night in an old mausoleum until the morning to join a sisterhood of women. That girl is a young Meg Tilly, like Julie, who wants to show her loving and affectionate boyfriend, Steve (David Mason Daniels), who can turn her cruel and deceptive ex-girlfriend, Carol's sisterhood (Robin Evans), regardless of the tactics. She pulls to see her fail. Along with Carol's gang is Kitty (Leslie Speights), always with a toothbrush in her mouth, and Leslie (Elizabeth Daily) who really does not want to cause Julie so much trouble. While Leslie insists on leaving Julie alone while staying in the mausoleum, Carol and Kitty plan to torment the poor girl. Meanwhile, Steve looks for her, while Julie, Carol and Kitty meet with an evil they could not imagine ... the corpse of a recently sick "psychic vampire", whose telekinesis was of a dangerously powerful degree, will try to drain them force of life. The only one who can help these girls is the daughter of the dead man, Olivia (Melissa Newman), who is equipped with the same psychic power that he has. <br /> <br /> I think what many will find exciting is the unusual evil that threatens the girls in the mausoleum, it certainly is different from what is normally seen in the slashers that were out at the moment. Like the character of Adam West (... he was Olivia's cynical husband, who considered the idea of ​​his father's power ridiculous), it took a lot for me to adapt to the cheating plot, and personally I never found anything inside. the movie to get excited . For me, the mausoleum was never so creepy (... it does not really achieve the same kind of PHANTASMO captured of spooky quality) and the corpses that are used to attack the girls are ridiculously unconvincing (... there's a great scene in the one that the face of the corpse melts). I have a weakness for the low budget films of this period of time, but I could never really find a reason to get involved when you have this unsatisfied undead corpse shooting electric beams from your eyes, which causes other bodies to break free from their crypts . Obey your master. It's too silly to take it seriously. Carol is your typical blonde bitch who wants to punish a good girl who is dating an old flame. Steve is your typical American boyfriend, handsome and tender, who becomes the hero who seeks to save his girl from the sinister forces that are at stake. To make up for the small budget, director McLoughlin tries every trick in the book to thrill the audience, using a series of ooga-booga effects like the corpses that chase the girls, the chairs that tremble and tremble, the doors that close suddenly and the objects that levitate. by themselves. The movie obviously has a lot of fans, and I'm glad I had the chance to see it, but I was a little disappointed that ONE DARK NIGHT was not the dream of horror I expected. Adam West has a very small role as the worried husband who expects his wife to come out of her depressed state regarding a father who had nothing to do with her. Melissa Newman is the worried Olivia, who recognizes that she must stop her father once and for all or that she will continue to take advantage of life. Donald Hotton is Dockstader, an associate of Olivia's parents who informs him what he was. Tilly's performance here did not particularly impress me (... she was scared most of the time), but I would have the opportunity to prove her worth more as of this moment. Undoubtedly, this will be of some value to those who saw it at that time, for reasons of nostalgia could seduce the fans of the films of this era.
