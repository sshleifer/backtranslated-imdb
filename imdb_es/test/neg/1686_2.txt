I never really started watching the program until it was canceled and I started showing reps. Actually I enjoyed it from the first to the third season. Once I saw the fourth and the fifth, I was beginning to get angry. The first problem was that they made that scenario irrelevant, of the history that is repeated (Jr has a son like his parents). The second had to be the one in which everyone got together with someone (for example, Katie and franklin). The third was when Jr was made even more idiotic than before, which was beginning to be tedious and disconcerting to the point where he wanted to get on TV and get stupid until he was unconscious. The room had to be that foolish enthusiast Clarie claimed as a boyfriend. The fifth had to be Katie, she was starting to be too good for herself and was treated with her "boyfriend" Franklin as if she had. Last but not least was Noah Gray-Cabey !! Franklin, Franklin was just scary. It was like watching a terrible combination of Urkle and TJ Henderson just more annoying! They seriously jumped the shark when he came to the show. There was little or no realism in his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious strength that showed that Noah can not act. Every time I saw that child made me want a slap, silly. However, B.F. (before Frank) this show was fun and very entertaining.
