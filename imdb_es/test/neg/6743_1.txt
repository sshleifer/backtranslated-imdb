Absolutely nothing is traded for this total garbage, and the only thing worse than watching this movie is seeing it in English class. This is literally one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. He ignores and totally contradicts any topic he may present, so the story is really really boring. Thank God, the 80s are over, and God save any man who was born as "James Bond III."
