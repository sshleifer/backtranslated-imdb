What could have been in Irene Dunne's mind when she accepted the role in this unpleasant tale of a woman of negotiable morals? Certainly, the Irene Dunne of the 1940s, whose reputation as a loyal Roman Catholic who publicly abhorred people, and rejected film scripts or Hollywood society, could even remotely be considered a corruption of public morals, never A dubious project like this would have been associated with such. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, Cardinal Spellman of New York, in his private audience with her, gave her a good dress on this paper. Probably we will never know, since she never spoke of it in later years, although she denounced her 1932 film, morally suspicious (although quite successful), "Back Street" as "trash". <br /> <br /> Certainly, when he received the distinguished St. Robert Bellarmine Award in 1965 for exemplary public Catholicism, the general public no longer withdrew "Ann Vickers". <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that "Ann Vickers" does not work either as entertainment or as a social comment. <br /> <br /> Miss Dunne's role as an adulterous sleeping social worker (between reforming prisons and writing a bestseller on correctional rehabilitation) does not fit her temperament or screen behavior, and one still suspects that all this is a kind of ironic joke (what else can we think when we witness a montage of Miss Dunne's sympathetic beatific gaze superimposed on a shot of a prisoner being whipped?) At last the movies, she has resigned to his professional career in favor of marriage, (for no less than the condemned Walter Huston, and what kind of madness would he conceive to unite these two romantically?) <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne's completistas will no doubt wish to see this curiosity, if only for the opportunity to hear his promise to rehabilitate a cocaine addict in his charge: "I'm going to get you out of the snow!" <br /> <br /> Well, if it's nothing so sordid, present its light years of its usual atmosphere of operatic trills, gauze and strawberry phosphates, cocaine addiction is not the first issue that one associates with the irreproachable. Miss Dunne.
