The only thing that makes you see this is Corey's performance as the crazy assassin on the loose. What remains is the most impossible account of revenge and matrimonial discord. During the walkie-talkie scenes I had the feeling that Cotten was squeezing a sweet potato and not a communication device. Another interesting thing about this is that Alan Hale (the patron of the "Isle of Gilligan") is still not so fat, and can still lower his arms below the waist. Apart from that there is not much to recommend here.
