Roger Spottiswoode is not the worst director, and did a good job in the underrated sci-fi thriller "The Sixth Day" (a.k.a. "The Box Office Downfall of Mr. Schwarzenegger"). However, "Air America" ​​has to be one of your most inept projects. <br /> <br /> It is presented as an amalgam between drama, comedy and the war movie; It is not a very convincing mix. In fact, I discovered that it was overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, Jr. (during his heyday) stars as a recruited pilot in a secret organization of the CIA that operates during Laos in the Vietnam era. Mel Gibson plays his copilot and stumbles with the knowledge that they are trafficking drugs, and what not. <br /> <br /> The film was promoted at the launch because it starred in two famous faces and Aerosmith re-recorded The Doors classic "Love Me Two Times" for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The remodeling of the song is quite poor, which fits the film.
