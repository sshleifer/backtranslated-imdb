It almost requires that a "good boy" movie have moons, car chases, a story that has a vague resemblance to the "plot" and at least one very pretty country girl, barefoot in short shorts and a low blouse. The pretty girl is here (dressed in designer jeans), but the hustle prerequisites stop there. Jimmy Dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman, but as a tough man as the former sheriff, he falls short. Big John is great, but does not convince with the "bad" part of his nickname. Jack Elam, bulging eyes, is a scream as always and Bo Hopkins has played this same role for decades; Ned Beatty also does his part in a small role ... but there is no HISTORY. It smells more like an episode of In The Heat Of The Night than a feature film. Cornball Cornpone with easily predictable feeling. Perhaps the most obvious problem with this movie is that Charlie Daniels is singing the theme. You know the one; He became famous for ... Jimmy Dean.
