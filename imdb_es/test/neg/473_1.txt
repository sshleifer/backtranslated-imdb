Let's get one thing out of the way. I'm a big fan of Bruce Campbell, I have the Evil Dead series, I have the action figures and I've seen Bubba Ho-Tep. I'm a fan of corny and ridiculous horror movies, and I know how to appreciate the whole "it's so bad that it's good" deal. <br /> <br /> I wish I could say the same about this movie. I saw this movie with great expectations, I wanted it to be good, campy, something of the BC that we have all come to know and love. It started being promising enough, but after the first 20 minutes I decided to see the rest of this sorry excuse for a movie as if I had been shot with tranquilizer darts. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is not bad; Two men, do not get along, both killed by the same psycho-woman, half of a man's brain are transplanted into the head of the other, discuss, disagree and comedy occurs. <br /> <br /> What killed me is how extremely disorganized and boring it was! It had potential, even as a camp movie to be much better than it was. The plot was boring, even Bruce's bizarre physical slap could not make it work. <br /> <br /> Word's can not even properly express the ridiculous robot in which the brain of Bruce's wife ends up getting involved. Easily the worst looking robot I've seen anywhere (even for a B movie). The whole idea is stupid. <br /> <br /> What the hell was going through Bruce's mind when he made this steaming pile is beyond me. Why was not Ted Raimi running to his older brother, asking him to put some sense to Bruce and not mentioning some lessons on how to make a nice movie on a budget? !!!
