One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Yes, I know that I am not the target audience. The target audience is women, whether in college or middle age or any other person, I suppose. I'm none of this, so the creators do not care if I do not like it. But that will not excuse the fact that the dialogue and the plot are horrible. The protagonist, Phoebe, travels to Europe to discover what happened to her sister, Faith, who committed suicide. Phoebe is an inane character with whom I hope no one identifies. Faith is also a character with very little credibility. Wolf is the only person who seems to be reasonable. As I said the dialogue is boring and uninteresting. The plot does absolutely stupid things at times. The worst of all is that Phoebe and Faith's father is an artist, but his paintings are completely terrible. There is nothing new, interesting or refreshing in this movie. If you are a boy, you will pray for the end. If you are a girl, you could sit through it but it will not impress you.
