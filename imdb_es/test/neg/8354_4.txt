The daughter of a wealthy businessman, who as a child contracted rheumatic fever and now suffers from shortness of breath, discovers that her marriage to a charming was never well arranged by dad (whom she affectionately calls "Darling"); worse than that, she may have a few weeks to live, leaving her husband free to marry his intriguing romantic rival. Pure litter. The screenplay of Paul Osborn (through the thin story of Jerome Weidman) goes through the redundant flashbacks in the second half instead of moving forward with the plot, which plunges the already soapy stage into a somber talk. Why go back when we can discover what is happening for ourselves? This is a "weeping women" without faith in their target audience, so the configuration is simplistic. Dorothy McGuire, wrapped in furs for most of the picture, is not a clever and clever heroine; when it is upset, it becomes interior and stony. Realizing that her marriage is basically a farce, she turns away from her husband as the consummate virgin (well, that's a possibility, she and Van Johnson sleep in separate beds after all!). Ruth Roman has the best moments of the movie as a shark of society with his trap set for Van, but what exactly do these women see in him? Johnson can be charming when required, but put him in a melodramatic environment and he also becomes stony. The production of MGM only values ​​the regular level, however, the director Gottfried Reinhardt tries to add some visual flavor to the flashback segments and tries an animated rhythm during the initial half hour of the film. ** since ****
