The problem with making a film like this, however, is that the end, the cr√®me-de-la-creme of the film, the battle between the two improved boats, must be done well. Disappointingly, this scene in Ironclads is obviously done entirely with small models of boats in a weed-covered tub. There is no tension, little explanation of exactly what is happening and what is the time period of the confrontation. <br /> <br /> The film is riddled with the history that surrounds it, as do all true stories when they are converted. to a film, like the traitor of the Union and more notably that of Betty Stuart (Madsen), a belle of Virginia. <br /> <br /> He resorts to making a possibly decent movie that involves an interesting story about forest rangers to preaching about the evils of slavery. It was out of place in this historical drama, and it was a cheap tactic to attract viewers. It only managed to mitigate the positive aspects of the film.
