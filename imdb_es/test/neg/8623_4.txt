George Sluizer's new version of his own film, Superior, is a complete waste of time. Why was it even attempted? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who only has a small amount of screen time) was kidnapped at a gas station by Barney Cousins ​​(Jeff Bridges). Now, Barney is presented as the kind of person no one would trust a month of Sundays: he walks like the Frankenstein Monster, but without the sympathy, and Bridges' performance is totally horrible. Sutherland is a bit better when his character becomes a detective with the help of the new love interest Rita Baker (Nancy Travis). <br /> <br /> A major problem with this version of 'The Vanishing' is its obvious need to cater to the Hollywood public, avoiding the somber end of the original film. Here the ending is happy, it seems forced and incredible, and completely destroys the story. However, at this point, the damage was already done when Jeff Bridges turns the bad guy into a big laugh.
