In general, it was a visible movie. I did not pause him or stop him to return to him, a clear sign of a boring movie, so he passed the first test. The best of all is that it quickly got into the story, it is not boring and unnecessary for the characters. <br /> <br /> It will never be a great movie. Not like a great B movie. I would recommend this movie to slasher / horror fans who do not care directly about the video releases. <br /> <br /> Unlike some movies of its style, there is no nudity, only moderate language and a fairly moderate gore. Although there is violence. The deaths were quite dry and unimaginative. The special effects of the computer were actually quite good. The way the 'creature' handled its chains in some scenes reminded me of the 'Spawn' and 'Ghost Rider' comics. <br /> <br /> A small pet complaint ... It is set in Lousinia, but nobody seems to speak with any accent. I had to see the credits to realize that it was filmed in Lousinia. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget movies, there is little nonsense in the shooting. The lack of time and money would be the main factors for the nonsense. For example, in one scene, he went from mid-afternoon to black in seconds ... during a short car trip. The other instance was that the double for the 'creature' that did not have the makeup of the 'creature' when falling off the crane ... also seems to be wearing a shirt on the scene. <br /> <br /> In summary, I did not hate this movie but I did not love it either. I will probably never rent it again, but if a friend owns it, he may see it again in a few years.
