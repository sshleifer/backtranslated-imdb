Like his almost contemporaries "The Great Race" and "Those magnificent men in their flying machines", I always associate this film with my childhood, especially in the New Year. On New Year's Day we visited my grandmother and after lunch, while the adults talked, the children watched TV where, invariably, one of these three crazy racing movies would appear. <br /> <br /> For that reason alone, I really wanted to mark "Monte Carlo Or Bust" well, but I'm afraid I can not, because the child is not the father of man this time. With what I mean, I can clearly see his failures and although I was tempted to smile from time to time, I really wanted all the competitors to reach the end of the race long before they actually do. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is dated by its stereotype of the nationalities and the woman as the weakest sex and I did not care much for one or two extravagances, certainly mild vulgarities that occasionally arose. However, more than that, the cast, despite having put it in a scandalous way, has not sold the film enough. Tony Curtis, in a test race for his turn of "Yank Abroad" in the television series "The Persuaders", seems too old to play the young gallant, Terry Thomas is not bad enough, Eric Sykes is amazing as a dirty When remembering Lothario, while Gert Frobe is an exaggerated Teut√≥n, it is rare to do comedy in the camp when you remember that he was Bond's best villain, Goldfinger. In any case, the English look better: Susan Hampshire is at least attractive as a "bright young woman", appropriately gamine like an elegant fin and although chained to the script's belt, Pete and Dud offer the most fun as army types. rigid upper lip. , although even then the "Carry On" team did this much better in "Carry On Up The Khyber Pass". <br /> <br /> Director Annakin tries his best to evoke the "Golden Silents", with slapstick ties, mistaken identity, capers, acceleration of camera shots, possible dramatic acrobatics and a bit of romance , but there is no real tension for such a famous race and, anyway, the race at the end seems another spark. <br /> <br /> Actually, it would have given him another brand if they had stuck to the alternative title "Those gorgeous men in their crazy crazy things", but in truth the animated series "Razas locas" did this much better.
