I really tried to like this movie about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young woman if he can reach an agreement with the death of his wife. I guess it was a light and strange romantic comedy, but the subject is a bit uncomfortable for me. <br /> <br /> But leaving that aside, I found that the dialogue was too much like a play despite being based on a novel and also, the mediocre performance was shameful, especially by the young leader Vincent Spano . <br /> <br /> I've been trying to catch up on all the films of the eighties that I missed during that decade. I liked that fans of nostalgia of the eighties seem to focus on the same central canon of the films that usually presents the actors and actresses of the brats and neglects the other films like Creator that have plummeted. But in the case of this feature I have to say that I can understand it. Not all of these eighties films were magical and the Creator is proof of this.
