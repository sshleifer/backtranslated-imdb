I rented this movie with the hope that it would provide good entertainment and some knowledge or interesting stories about poker. What I got was a documentary look at the life of an average man who turned out to be very good at letters. Do I want to see romance with his wife? NO Do I want to see everything that happened in this guy's life, except poker? DO NOT. Well, that's what you get with this movie. The performance is good for a garbage of such low budget. The film never tries to break the mold or do anything original. Simply the dream makes its way through the script. The ending is disappointing and never really looks deep in Ungar's mind. Instead, it focuses on what was already obvious. He was a drugged card player with an average life not unlike any other average las vegas girl. The film focuses on aspects of his life that were extraordinary from the UN instead of the extraordinary. The poker scenes throughout the film total approximately 4 minutes of images. Ungar's achievements of winning the WSOP 3 times seem life after life. A 10-year-old could do a better job directing this movie ... or maybe it was a shit from the beginning that condemned this joke of a movie. Movie about the betting game Rounders. At least it has style.
