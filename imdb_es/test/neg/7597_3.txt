Since Roger Corman attached his name to this production, I had high hopes for this film. Corman directed many memorable low-budget horror films in the 1960s. I particularly enjoyed his adaptations of Poe's stories, such as "The House Of Usher", and "The Pit And Pendulum" and "The Raven", starring the late great Vincent Price. These films had a solid performance, an atmosphere, suspense, a strong characterization, an intriguing plot development and produced some chilling moments. Unfortunately, 'House Of The Damned', for the most part, sacrifices these qualities instead of low-budget special effects, gratuitous nudity and mindless gore topped with quick edits and clichéd camera angles. <br /> <br /> `House Of The Damned 'starts in an interesting way with some beautiful photos of places in Ireland, but it's directly downhill from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending time creating an atmosphere, creating characters that may interest us or create suspense, the director chooses to start counting corpses. After a brief introduction to the main characters, a young couple and their daughter, the audience spends the rest of the film bouncing from a "spooky" event to another that, in this film, replaces the coherent development of the plot. The main characters are so poorly conceived and so badly acting: the audience does not care what happens to them. To make matters worse, "creepy" events are cliché or are not convincing due to low technology - low-budget special effects. The soundtrack has been lifted from 'The Omen'. The plot, what little there is, is inspired by 'Poltergeist' and 'The Legend Of Hell House', but it lacks the qualities that made these films convincing. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in seeing well-made films of haunted houses, I recommend you take a look at classics like 'The Haunting (1963),' The Innocents (1961) or watch the first American International films of Corman and broadcast 'House Of The Damned' unless you are masochistic or meaningless. <br /> <br /> 3 ½ of 10. <br /> <br /> Rob Rheubottom <br /> <br /> Wpg, MB.
