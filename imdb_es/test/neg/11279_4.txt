For a film made in Senegal, based, I suppose in general on Carmen, the book, by Prosper Merimee, this film does not achieve a mere resemblance to the story that has become famous as an opera and other films. <Br /> <br /> Ms. Gai as the title Karmen is very good to look at. His ardent dance burns on the screen, as is the case of his torrid love scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a Karmen that aims to please all genres, but it is a true Carmen, she is No! <br /> <br /> We would like to see Ms. Gai in other films in which her talent is better used than here.
