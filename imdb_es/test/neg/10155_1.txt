Oh, boy, this was really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw it on a videotape. <br /> <br /> In the scenes that had soundtrack music, it was difficult to listen to the dialogue. When people were on the phone, it was difficult to listen to the person on the other end. It seems that at least two different types of movies or videos were used, because the colors and the focus sometimes changed drastically between editions. And there were many out of focus shots that did not seem intentional. <br /> <br /> A budget indicator (one of many) was when a news report appeared on television. There is only one "news flash" title card superimposed badly with a video effect on a television screen and a voice over on a news anchor. Could not you shoot the images of a news anchor and then show them on television? <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a killer who wears robes and surgical masks, wielding a scalpel. He is supposedly a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to avoid a lobotomy. <br /> <br /> School vacations are let out and three young women decide to have a slumber party. Three boys decide to go to the party, and a geek named Science decides to do it too. The pajama party is quite boring, and the boys keep appearing at random wearing masks, taking off their masks and then disappearing. The mother and father (the surgeon who was going to do the lobotomy) of one of the girls also continue to appear. The murderer hits the men in slices without really realizing it. The apparent advantage of the movie is more or less steps of dreaming through the movie. Maybe it was a bad performance, or maybe it was intentional, since so much of the movie is a nightmare, and in part it's a nightmare in a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The ending is also really horrible. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the stylized United Home Video VHS box art, which was revived for the release of the DVD (a double feature with Terror in Tenkiller). Honestly, I can not say if it's a photo, a painting or a combination of both. The women that appear on the cover are not in the film, and the clothes they wear are much more revealing than the women they wore in the film. Cutting the throat on the cover is more frightening than those in the film, where people tend to affect a ridiculous appearance. For that matter, that's what the murderer has most of the time: with his head cocked and his eyes bulging, assaulting the camera. Often, the scalpel remained close to the focused camera, while the face covered by the killer's mask was in the foreground but out of focus in the background.
