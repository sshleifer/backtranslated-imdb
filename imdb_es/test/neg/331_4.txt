I bought this out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) appear in a movie made in 1995? Thanks to the miracle of the unused movie, it is possible that they were filmed on a shelf somewhere for ten years, that's how! It can be said that the film used to film his scenes does not match the film used to film "Jack-O". Ed Wood's curse lasts. The good thing about Carradine and Mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you hope to find in their two films. The same goes for Scream Queens Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith. <br /> <br /> The stage is Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween, and some kind of curse is thrown when stupid teenagers and beer drinkers break a grave. The result: a great assassin with a scythe and a large plastic pumpkin on his head! He (???) Chases the healthy Kelly family for revenge (and kills others who get in his way). The father opens an enchanted garage for the children of the neighborhood. The son (Ryan Latshaw, son of the director) has a continuous and perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and a hilariously misinterpreted dramatic scene in a tomb. At least it's a boy. The mother's eyes about getting out of her head as she struggles to read her dialogue. There is also an annoying woman who appears to explain the things she seems to be trying to pronounce with phonetic all their dialogue. <br /> <br /> So, what about the name actors? You see Stevens, Wildsmith and Mitchell briefly on a TV screen (they are used to spending time). Linnea has a more important role as a nanny, and does exactly what she can with her. His enthusiastic performance helps a little. There is also a laugh out of nowhere when an ultra-conservative couple who sees a clone of Rush Limbaugh on television bites him. The woman slides on a carpet and stabs a toaster with a knife. She is electrocuted and the final result looks like a flame-roasted Muppet. <br /> <br /> All and all, pretty entertaining things! I was not bored!
