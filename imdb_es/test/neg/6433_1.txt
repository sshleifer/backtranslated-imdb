"War is in your blood," says Rambo at the beginning of the film, "do not fight against it." What what? Is the screenwriter taking Mickey out of Sly? It is impossible for a person with primary education to miss the joke here. However, Stallone pronounces it without a hint of irony. <br /> <br /> The same lack of humor applies to the movie. Rambo IV is an exaggerated and idiotic activist who would have been fun without intention if it was not terribly violent. A phantom fantasy of the lowest class where the villains are such villains, is not it enough to kill them? You have to dismember them with pleasure. Stallone does not stop at any blue-collar clich√© to express his opinion. It is not enough for the main villain to feed the pigs, throwing the babies to the fire like a sadist. He is also a pedophile homosexual. <br /> <br /> What is happening in IMDb? Is it assumed by the rifle society? How can this odious excuse for such a high gross exploitation rate? I like a good action movie as much as the next man, but this is not entertainment. This is a pornography of violence that trivializes and, ultimately, denigrates the true tragedy of Myanmar. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly does not take off his shirt. For this I will give you a star ...
