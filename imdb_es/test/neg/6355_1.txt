Following the matrix, this parody of a film with loose connections to virtual reality has been reissued with the line of the label "The Matrix just had Deadler!", In a box with a cover very inspired by the matrix (Still called "Wait die" though). However, due to the choice of the font, the line of the label looks like it is "Beablier". Anyway. <br /> <br /> To complete the transformation to wannabe Matrix, they have mocked a VR fight scene with a Morpheus-a-like on the back of the box. It may be important to know that this character IS NOT PRESENTED ON THE MOVIE. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is a parody on all levels. Jalal Mehri is a horrible actor and does not impress with his martial arts. However, his partner Stone is played by Evan Lurie, who in this movie is simply the worst actor I've seen. He was clearly chosen to make Jalal look good in comparison. The worst movie I've seen in a long time.
