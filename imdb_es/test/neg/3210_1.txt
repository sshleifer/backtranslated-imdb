Now, this is a real turkey for the overrated director Franco, who gave us classics like "The Vampyras / Vampyros Lesbos". Yes, I think bad movies can be very funny. I love the funny howlers of Doris Wishman, Dwain Esper and Ed Wood jr., But this turned out to be too much for me. It is the first movie I rate 1. Where should I start? The script is idiot to the fullest. The dialogue is incredibly bad. The address seems to be nonexistent. The best musical signal (used repeatedly in this film) was taken directly from the movie "Der Hexer" (1964). And it's boring! Poor Shirley Eaton and George Sanders! In one shot, Sanders reads a Popeye comic while his henchman tortures a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this movie). The only thing that puzzled me was that Franco quickly showed female nudity whenever he thought the film would benefit from it. This is a true ability to direct! However, I am afraid that a film in which the actors intend to shoot with machine guns shaking them is not worth it.
