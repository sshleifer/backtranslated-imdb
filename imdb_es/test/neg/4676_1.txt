The cast played Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare lost. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that this is trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses, but why spoil something so good? <br /> <br /> Is it because 'The Scottish Play' is my favorite Shakespeare? I do not know. What I do know is that one Rev Bowdler (therefore, he tried to do something similar in the Victorian era). <br /> <br /> In other words, it can not improve perfection. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to write, but since I have to write at least ten lines of text (and the composition in English was never my forte, I will just have to follow and say that this movie, as it says said, simply do not cut it.
