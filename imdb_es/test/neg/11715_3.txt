A couple of friends and I visited the video store a few years ago and we were in one of those moods to rent some unseen cheesy movies. My friend took the head of the family and was greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. Well, that made us laugh and we decided to make a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie. Well, you guessed it, it was me !!!!!!!! I've never been so muddy in all my life. We got home and we put it on and rolled around the floor laughing for 45 minutes because it was the funniest movie in the world. I can not remember much about it, but one thing I do remember is that the blonde girl got a guy in the back of a store every 5 minutes. That head made me laugh and when I look at the comments of other people about this movie, it makes me laugh even more. The head of the family is very good and the head is fun and I'm still laughing, ha ha ha ha ha ha
