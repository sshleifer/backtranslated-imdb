I am trying to see 3 bad movies in a row to see if watching 3 bad movies in a row can cause amnesia. I have a copy of the English version of this movie. Now let me go for the points Music score: poor quality, but at least it adapts to the story: it is a man who goes to a city and meets his sheriff brother and they fight for land of farmers of a greater and Ally with Mexicans to lead them and Trinity and her brother try to teach them how to defend it. The final scene of the climatic fight will confuse anyone about who are the #### who are the good guys. Conclusion: better than I thought, but I need to continue with this. I'm going to see the movie "Universal Soldier" by Dolph Lungren and Jean-Claudde Vanne Damme praying for my sanity
