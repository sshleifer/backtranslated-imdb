Flatland is one of my favorite books, so I looked forward to this movie. Unfortunately, the movie is absolutely horrible. The dialogue is so bad that it sounds like improvisation half the time. The new story makes me think that they took the book and a couple of newspapers, threw them in a blender and used what came out for the script. It is a shame for the book and the making of independent films. The only reason I managed to get to the end of the movie was my hope that it would improve. Unfortunately, it only got worse, reaching the climax in a very delayed ending. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that EVERYTHING about the movie is bad. The CG is acceptable, in a "reboot" of the 1990s that I assume is what they were looking for. And I guess you can not go wrong with "people" cut in half and spilling blood everywhere.
