"It's supposed to have good reviews," says the g / f. If so, I can not find them. He goes to sleep and I endure. Michael Douglas as a good boy, now there is a new one. Matt Dillon all fucked up. John Goodman losing his cool. Paul Reiser running in BDSM leather. Oh, it's a riot, it's okay. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you will probably lose interest very soon. Liv Tyler plays the fatal woman and critics complain that she might not have the record on her part. But it is immaterial: this film is not about the development of the character. In fact, I would dare to say that there is no character. What you are supposed to appreciate here is the plot. <br /> <br /> No one is "bad" in this movie. Some people wonder why all these "stars" (Reba even here, for the love of God), are enrolled in a scrap metal project. Most likely, they thought it would be fun. Maybe they had fun. Who knows? Hey, maybe they paid well too. <br /> <br /> But you have to shell out money one way or another to see this turkey. And that probably is not a good idea.
