We found this movie almost impossible to see. With such a great cast, it's a pity that the writing and the direction were so horrible. The unbearable rhythm to which the story was told was maddening. The flash-backs were clumsy. The characters were one-dimensional. The metaphors of heavy-handed, the river, the cat, were repeated too often. <br /> <br /> The movie Nobody's Fool, based on another Russo novel, was infinitely better, probably because it was written and directed with greater precision. <br /> <br /> The photography in Empire Falls was lovely. Too bad it was not a travel journal. <br /> <br /> I read the novel and enjoyed the writing style, but I had some doubts with the novel itself. I would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars. Perhaps the writers and the director were so impressed by the reputation of the novel that they felt they had to include everything in their film. This was supposed to be a television movie, guys, not Books on Tape.
