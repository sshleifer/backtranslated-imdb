Anatomie is not very unique in the horror genre, in fact, it is not even scary. It reminds me of your American cousins, terror slashers. It's just a copy of any other horror slasher and, like a German movie, it's too American and has nothing to add. <br /> <br /> Actually, Anatomie is too predictable and boring, her plot is not intact and consistent. It has stupid scenes that do not even fit into a genre of horror movies. Fun sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear. Why do they need to have everything in one movie? They should have made a cheap German adult movie instead. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone because it is too boring.
