"The beautiful country" is a big disappointment. It does not reach my expectation. Bihn, a tall, muscular man, is the son of an American GI and a Vietnamese woman during the Vietnam War. We were told that Vietnam was treated "less than dust" in the early 1990s, so he traveled to the United States to look for his American father. <br /> <br /> Does it look like a broken-hearted material? Maybe, but it is shown in this movie. I find it difficult to connect emotionally with Bihn, because the film is full of clich√©s and I just do not understand it or believe it. The writing of this movie is a total failure. The plot is full of holes. It seizes some events when necessary, trying to stir the emotion of the audience. We are not so stupid and it does not work that way. Let's see what the movie is trying to do. So, you do not feel like Bihn's boat trip (yes, it was in a boat!). It's hard enough, we have a storm during the night and let the boat shake a little. Still does not touch you? Penalty fee! Make a young child suffer heat, hunger, illness, violence with adults on the boat, hopefully the trick to touch the audience. Still does not touch you? Heart, SOB, come on ... Well, I do not want to hurt the movie, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> The movie is really long and slow. He never tells us why Bihn did not go looking for his mom and dad, so far in the movie when he went out to find his mom and dad. What have you been doing for 20 years before going to Saigon to find your mother? And guess what? You are lucky and everyone will tell you where to find the person you are looking for, and you will find anyone without a scratch. I really believe that the Department of Homeland Security should hire those Vietnamese who helped Bihn. The beautiful country? Which one? Both Vietnam and the United States look like hell to Bihn.
