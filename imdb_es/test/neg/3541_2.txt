Do you think you've seen the worst movie in the world? Think again. The person who designed the cover of this box must be accused of false advertising. The cover makes it look like a good thriller of suspense and terror. But no. What we have instead is NIGHTSCREAM. A movie that makes a "sweeeoooowww !!" Noise every time a credit flashes on the screen. The biggest name in the whole movie is probably Casper Van Dien, who almost does not have a part. <br /> <br /> I voted for this one just because I could not vote lower. If I could vote something like five thousand negatives, trust me, I would have done it. So, for now, I'm going to give NIGHTSCREAM 1/2 * out of 5 just because it's over.
