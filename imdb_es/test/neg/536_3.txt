This movie sucks mostly. The only reason I gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi lovely. It is a total disregard for a plot and the lack of superficial development even insubstantial makes it look like a lot of beautiful drawings. This is by far the worst anime that came out of Japan. I can not believe they really put their names on this garbage. What scam selling this thing for $ 20. If you have not seen this do not bother. If you have, I pity you.
