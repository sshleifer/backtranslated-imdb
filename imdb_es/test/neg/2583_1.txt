I saw this at the Inter of Toronto. Film festival in September 2005. The description seemed intriguing: how wrong I was! This could easily be the worst movie I've seen in 50 years. I see that the director is my age (born in 1948) and lived with Nico of the Velvet Underground, which brings us to Andy Warhol, who, it seems, is the one who thought while watching this: films over 24 hours Warhol in which nothing happens. This is not art, this is boredom. <br /> <br /> Specifically: black and white. Okay, maybe ... but what is the purpose here? Surely they had color in 1968! And there is no contrast with the present. And yes, the subtitles were blank, naturally. I do not think I missed much, but that made about 20% of them illegible. <br /> <br /> Next, it is a pure chronological order, but with apparently random events. What is the purpose of the conversation with the old man at the table? It does not add anything to the movie. There were many similar scenes, almost as if someone took a camcorder and filmed people at random and spliced ​​them into a movie. <br /> <br /> Parcel? Any. The "mutiny" consists of some figures in the distance that occasionally raise a rock off the screen. For the most part, it is an unbearable period of time watching people (in the distance!) Stop around. The repeated consumption of opium is just as boring. When the main character got a nice girlfriend, I was encouraged, but no, she was also bored! This is perhaps the only French film I've seen where no one takes off their clothes. They were probably too bored to bother. <br /> <br /> Romance? Any. The girl seems totally indifferent to everything, maybe her sculpture has some interest, but if she does, we are not shown that. We are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters because they are all unattractive. Maybe that's the point of all this?
