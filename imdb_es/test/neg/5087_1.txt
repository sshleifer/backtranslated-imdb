Apart from the beautiful images thanks to the director of photography of New Zealand, Alun Bollinger, this movie is not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The story is so fragmented and lost that it is difficult to know what happens at any given moment, and just when you think you are following, the direction changes again, like a lost bipolar puppy. <br /> <br /> The musical score is horrible, relying too much on extremely emotional pieces that try to force the audience to feel a certain way, as if the instruments acted like a tail of emotions? 'I feel sad here'; 'Feeling impacted here'; "Feel fear here." On top of that, repetitive samples used over and over again leave the audience on the verge of laughter. <br /> <br /> Are the silent film days over, where the musical instruments were the only representation of the voice? but I would not think about it while watching River Queen. <br /> <br /> The voiceover was so used that one has to wonder if this movie really needed any accompanying image. It could easily have been a radio play, although even then it would be difficult to follow the story. <br /> <br /> And the ideas stolen from Jane Campion's piano are too obvious to ignore. Not only the beach and forest shots are almost identical to those of The Piano? Perhaps something of this is due to the work of Alun Bollinger's camera in the latter? but the feeling of voiceover and levels are also surprisingly close. And who could forget when the character of Holly Hunter has her wings cut off, in the shape of her index finger cut by Sam Neill. Do you remember when Wiremu amputated his 'finger on the trigger', and surprisingly with an ax as well? I thought that if. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not recommend this movie to see it, unless you wear ear muffs and just go with the stage in mind.
