If you really loved GWTW, you will find the story quite disappointing. Those who think that this is a romantic and southern story, will probably be satisfied with this decent television production (although I consider Scarlett's choice a bad choice). But, let me say that, considering the novel, nothing good could come out of this. <br /> <br /> I have read GWTW more than 20 times and I really appreciate the adaptation that Ms Mitchell did for the film. It took me a while to understand how good the end was: Scarlett knew for sure that she was going to get Rhett back, since she always got what she wanted. But in the end there was no kiss. <br /> <br /> Then, Alexandra Ripley came to "fix" this and showed us exactly how perfect and powerful Scarlett could be, and, of course, describing in detail how exactly she gets Rhett. back, even when she had an important adventure with another person (nothing could be further from the mind of Mrs. Mitchell, I'm sure). <br /> <br /> The history between these points is, in my opinion, just a long and boring A walk made to tie ends, showing costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary ending. <br /> <br /> If Margaret Mitchell could live again, she would die once more at the same moment. I would find out what Scarlett became after GWTW. <br /> <br /> Surely it is not fair to compare this with the original, but this is not the fault of GWTW. It is not like this? Is it good if I do not compare it with the original? Perhaps. I'm sorry to say that I really do not care. <br /> <br /> I would expect a little more commitment to continue the work of another person (suberb), otherwise I will not even try.
