36/100 This should not be confused with the decent Arachnophobia, this movie is a very low budget and a cheap scam of that movie. This is so bad that it actually has some entertainment value at that level. There are numerous unwanted scenes (I think) that laugh out loud. I did not expect much from the movie, and it was actually worse than I had imagined. <br /> <br /> It's a clich√© and it's predictable directly in the video. Fortunately, he does not take himself too seriously. The performance, as expected, is not quite Oscar's caliber. The special effects are poor, worse than I would have thought they would be. Badly edited and the score is intrusive.
