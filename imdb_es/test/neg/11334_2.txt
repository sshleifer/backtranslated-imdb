!!! Spoiler alert! <br /> <br /> The point is, though, that I did not think this movie had an ending TO ruin ... I just started seeing it in the middle, after Matt had gotten into Sarah's body, but then I was fascinated by the strangeness of the plot, even for a Channel 5 movie ... and I could not see how Matt Wld would end up happy. What about his fiancee? At one point it looked like he was going to get his best friend, no doubt cranky and wrong ... and then the whole 'oggi oggi oggi' thing DOES NOT WORK as a moving phrase among friends and friends, it's just ridiculous ... Sure who can not come back to life? And yet, how can he live as a woman? and then the movie just got over that when it finished and did not explain anything at all! What is that about ??? I was so angry, wasted an entire hour of my life for no reason at all! :) but it was one of the funniest movies I've seen, so, swings and roundabouts
