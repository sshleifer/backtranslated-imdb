This is without doubt one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. However, it is also one of the funniest without intention. I like to compare it with Plan 9, since it can be so bad, so horrible, so silly and such a waste of time that I find myself laughing out loud. <br /> <br /> One of my biggest problems with that is that it's a complete Robin Hood scam, and let's be honest and let's say I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. But let's be honest, from the forbidden love between Peck (which is definitely dragging him in. Although, to be fair, this was still some years before the masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird) and the female character (which is so forgettable, apparently, I've forgotten his name.), To the final scene where the good guys dress up as monks to cheat the bad guys screaming "ROBIN HOOD" everywhere. <br /> <br /> However, I do not think the movie is not worth seeing. On the contrary, I think this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years, even if it was not intentional.
