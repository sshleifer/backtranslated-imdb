I think this movie was a poor effort on the part of the British film council. It was not as good as, well, come on, Tim Robbins is an old guy and here is this beautiful young girl who falls in love with him too. As lost in translation it is really difficult to suspend disbelief in this context. It's a good-looking movie but it lacks a punch. When Tim Robbins pretends to be psychic, he seems to have a small migraine. It looks uncomfortable and life less. The part where you are selecting suspicious employees in the Sphinx is ridiculous. If an investigator came to my factory, the last thing I would do would be to tell him about my fetishism of freckles. Obviously he is too intellectual. Clumsy. The city is as it is, a convenient backdrop. Obviously, they chose the most futuristic city they could (shanghai) as background, but the city never comes out and affects the characters as, for example, Blade Runner, where the characters of the city often intersect with the story. Slow as a wet week Not chemistry, real dramatic highs, so plot.
