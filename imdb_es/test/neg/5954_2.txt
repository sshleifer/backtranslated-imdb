This movie has a lot in it. Prehistoric society, adventure, romance, true brotherhood, violence, sex, religion; all represented abundantly ... without a single word uttered! And why is it so bad? This movie will make you rethink the origin of humanity. If this were the product of anthropology, I would prefer to challenge Darwinian theory and the Hegelian synthesis. You can not bear to see this even with your brain turned off. And now you're thinking: "I have to see this." I warned you. I do not assume any responsibility in case you regret spending more than an hour looking at this work of art. Well, I warned you. This must be forgotten and buried forever.
