The actors were not credible, the story was really weak, totally and completely predictable. Really disappointed in Depardieu. It was a shame they did not focus more on the struggle of the Canadian struggle for independence. We have seen this love story many times before, only with better actors! We had to wait the last 15 minutes for a little sense of the drama! The soundtrack was totally disturbing. The underscore hits you in the head with sentimentality. But really above. The only thing we found good was the fact that they let the Indians speak their language. And we found the cinematography, of the relatively realistic Indian people.
