Once again, director J. Lee Thompson joins actor Charles Bronson for a violent and intransigent action film. In fact, this is probably Bronson's most brutal film (a great feat for a man who appeared in Death Wish, Ten To Midnight and Chato's Land). However, brutality alone is not a good movie, and The Evil That Men Do is a disappointment. If you had to take away his brutality, the movie would have little more interest. <br /> <br /> The story is about a hitman (Bronson) who lives a comfortable life on a Caribbean island. He is persuaded to leave his retreat to locate and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who has been handling his vile trade in several South American hells. Throughout the film, especially at the beginning, we are invited to some graphic torture scenes to show us what a most unpleasant job it is. <br /> <br /> These issues are quite serious. Torture continues in suppressive Latin American dictatorships, and everyday people are forced to suffer some terribly painful experiences simply because they express an unpopular point of view. But the evil that men do, despite all their valuable positions, is not really worried about the plight of these poor people. It bothers purely with giving Charles Bronson an excuse to chase away some nasty garbage bags. He is just an exploitative action agent who hangs his coat on genuine issues. Torture sequences make you, the viewer, feel like a dirty and sickly voyeur head, rather like someone who is pleased to see "snuff" movies. The script is full of horrible dialogues, including some excessive descriptions of acts of torture. The Evil That Men Do fails to explore their disturbing ideas ... it serves as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them. I'm sorry, but that's wrong.
