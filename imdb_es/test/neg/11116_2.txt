I did not like this movie for so many reasons that I can not even say all of them. I thought it was wrong because of the whole story. I mean who will believe that they captured the chupacabra and let go on a cruise. LAME!!! It was fine for a lame direct to a video movie, but it was not worth spending money on it. I can not believe that someone has given ten to this movie. But I guess there are people who like this movie. I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 just because it was about the chupacabra and I had the boy out of the Lord of the Rings. If you want to see this movie, I would stay at home and wait until the science fiction channel arrives. DO NOT waste your money on watching this movie. Believe me
