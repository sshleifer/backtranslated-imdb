I read the reviews of this movie, and in general they were pretty good, so I thought I should see them. I am a great Francophile and lover of art cinema, but I think this is another case in which critics turn something "artistic" or "intellectual" into something that is not. I will be forceful: it contains scenes of sexual perversity that I never, never really wanted to see. Obviously, the piano teacher has some important psychological problems, but I really did not want to see them shown so graphically. The movie is, in essence, disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a Dream, I was rejected by the last type of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but that was nothing like the kind of disgust and repulsion I felt during this movie.
