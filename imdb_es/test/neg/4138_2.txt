What useless, horrible characters and boring movies. Saved by brief sex scenes, crazy witch, beautiful desert island and body of Brooks. The plot is tenuous, the characters are shallow and unpleasant. Having said that, I managed to see everything, mainly because I was totally paralyzed by the movement and hoping that his character would turn out well at the end. The film was well shot, well directed, but maybe the casting disappointed him in some way. Disappointing. He really summarized the review in the first line, but this website dictates that you must write a minimum of 10 lines. It would be better to spend time watching another movie.
