This movie changed my life! Hogan's performance was incredible, and I still have not recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 Oscar nominations. And as brilliant as Hulkster shines in this movie, he can not rule out the brilliant writing and direction that this masterpiece holds in the highest strata of achievement in the movie. If you have not seen this movie, quit what you are doing right now and get a copy. I guarantee you will blow your mind. And if you do not like it, then I only have one question for you ... Watcha is going to do when the 24-inch pitons and Hulkamania go crazy with you !!
