This adorable dog (called several names during the movie) seems to be loved all over the city ... but he is alone. He is a friend of two children (Cindy and Paul played surprisingly poorly), but his father does not allow them to have a dog. Then Benji meets Tiffany - ANOTHER adorable dog. They fall in love (instantaneously) and this leads to a hysterical montage of the two having fun on the grass, drinking from a fountain ... in slow motion, no less! Benji also lives in the cleanest abandoned house I've ever seen. Then, the two children are kidnapped by the most inept and amusing kidnappers I've seen in my life and, do not you think? They hide the brats in the exact house where Benji lives! <br /> <br /> WOW was so bad! A great success (for some reason) in 1974 that resulted in many sequels (which I will NOT see). The movie is terribly played with "humor", so little fun and badly done that you simply watch television with amazement. The movie also has a song that plays NONSTOP during the movie, so much that you want to scream. He was inexplicably nominated for Best Song at the Oscars, he did not win. Yes, dogs are adorable and much better than human actors, but I need more than adorable dogs to interest me. <br /> <br /> You may think I'm being a little hard on a children's movie but I saw it with my 5-year-old nephew. In 20 minutes he got bored with a fool and basically stopped looking. I kept looking in the hope that he would improve, he did not. Really lousy, but children VERY patient or dog lovers may like it. <br /> <br /> Note to parents: It is rated G but a dog is brutally kicked a few times. You do not see it, you just listen to it and the dog survives, but this can bother little children.
