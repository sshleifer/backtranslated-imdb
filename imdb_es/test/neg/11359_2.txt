This movie is really bad, trying to create scientific explanations for zombies always ends up taking away credibility from the film's story. There are so many things I could point out about the movie that I could almost write a book about how much the movie stinks. For example, there were about 50 people on the plane, they killed like 100 and they kept coming, apparently the "virus" gives liver complications because they all had yellow eyes, also the virus makes people roar like lions or something, and the virus does not it only regenerates the tissue since it also gives it superhuman strength, not to mention that this virus messes up people's hair. It is also important to note that if you shoot someone with a gun (probably only happens on airplanes) that person is ejected into the air. Remember that if you are escorting a prisoner on a plane and let go, always look inside the drawers and cupboards the size of a bottle, you never know where those bastards are hiding. And if by chance you can land a plane full of zombies against a mountain and survive (it happens all the time), after watching dozens of people die, simply get away from the plane, watch the sunrise and make jokes about how to get out of the flight. assistant. :)
