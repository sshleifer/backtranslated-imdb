The peculiarities of Jack Brooks are, at first, somewhat charming and lend themselves to the deliberately rural feel of the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> I found myself increasingly angry and more angry when I was tricked into seeing this one. in the end, hoping that the reward is worth it and the tedious wait. <br /> <br /> The climax can not begin to compensate all the configuration time. <br /> <br /> Normally one could expect shallow characters of this genre. But the fact that the wait time index before the action is so high, should mean that the meanwhile will be devoted to an interesting development of characters. <br /> <br /> It's not like that. <br /> <br /> While not without its initial charms, this film ultimately infuriates and disappoints. <br /> <br /> I wish I could recover all that configuration time, to reinvest it in something worthwhile.
