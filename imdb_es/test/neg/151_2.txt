This movie just did not do it for me. I like horror movies and splashes, but this has very little to do with horror. The effects are cheap and when you cut one of your feet it looks so fake. The same goes for other effects such as tongue torture and intestinal sex. They could have spent a few extra dollars on the effects. <br /> <br /> With a lot of sex (with pixelization like in all Japanese movies) this is just a sick fetish porn and it seems there is a market for sick things. I like this. Although more bloody, for me it fits with titles like Squirmfest / Purge and the Genki series. These films show how girls eat and play with every fluid that leaves their body, eat insects and fish in a crude way and have sex with all kinds of strange animals, like toads, eels and ... A look at the covers It will tell you fans of terror to look elsewhere. There is no horror here, only sick and degrading sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Horror fanatics should avoid this and it is best to check out the Guinea Pig2: Flesh and blood flowers or even the August underground Mordum. While these are not excellent, at least they offer a horror experience and Niku Daruma absolutely fails in that department.
