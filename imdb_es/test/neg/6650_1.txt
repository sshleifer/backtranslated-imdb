This is one of those movies where I was encouraging whoever could finish the movie faster. I wanted to see the cops kill Keaton And Garcia just to get it over with. Basically, this is the deal: two policemen have to die and a third has horrible burns on his face so that Garcia's son receives a bone marrow transplant from the convicted killer Keaton. Worth it? Do not!
