Telly Savalas criticizes him as the Mexican revolutionary (although Chuck Connors equates him as a military soldier) in this jokey, but rather boring pastiche about the life and times of the famous historical figure. A previous attempt, VILLA RIDES! (1968) with Yul Brynner in the role and co-star of Robert Mitchcum, addressed these events more soberly and on a larger scale. As such, PANCHO VILLA is a very typical European company and does not distinguish itself for that, despite its credentials; The end result is often more silly than fun, although some moments, especially the action sets and a scene involving a fight inside a church, offer a bit of pleasure. Oh, and Savalas even gets to sing about the final titles!
