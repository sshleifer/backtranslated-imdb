'Bland' is probably the word I would use to try to start describing this movie. I only saw it because I had a good rating here and they disappointed me. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film is about racism in a United States after September 11 and the director did it with a hammer. ! There was no subtlety in the movie and it felt like they were trying to achieve a Magnolia feel in the movie, which is never a good idea, since that movie was three hours of tedium and confusion just so it would start raining . frogs at the end ... <br /> <br /> In general, a big disappointment.
