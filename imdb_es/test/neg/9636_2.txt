This is the kind of movie that 50-year-old teachers love and people who consider themselves aware of social problems, but who really have no idea. The actors, I think they are all amateurs, do the best they can, but the script is so full of clich√©s and stupidities that they can not save it. <br /> <br /> The worst thing of all is the scabbard the children are working on - bring all your worst memories of acting classes at school. The lyrics of one of the songs says something like that in a quick translation at 2:30 in the morning: "I am the dwarf of society, an emotionally paralyzed individual". <br /> <br /> Please!
