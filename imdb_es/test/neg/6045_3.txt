I had seen this movie days before Halloween 2004. I noticed at lunchtime and it was an interesting description in my menu box, so I decided to watch it. Seriously, only a movie only suitable for nightly television ... you know, after Conan, but before the infomercials, something similar. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has very little to do with webs, it has a lot to do. Do it with spiders; Check my header if you need a review. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the story seemed absolutely fascinating to me. A hidden nuclear generator, a scientist and a credible portal ... It would have been a good start for a great fantasy, but then it descends after 15 to 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast is poor and not memorable performances, shoddy queen who has widened her breasts ... considering that spiders do not have breasts. As well as the bad sound effects. An obvious low-budget film, although the cast has tried it. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> 4 electricians stumbled upon a hidden nuclear generator while they worked. The buttons are touched and a portal opens. 2 workers fall into the portal and it closes ... struggling to discover what is happening, the party that still exists in our world seeks help while the other party looks around. <br /> <br /> The help does not come so open the portal and continue to meet in a parallel dimension. They meet a race of human spiders nicknamed soldiers. After a death and persecution, they are saved by the survivors. <br /> <br /> Now it gets boring ... they hide, talk a little, try to build another portal and then attack the hive. After losing 2 more electricians, they open the portal and escape to return to our world ... about 200 million years ago. <br /> <br /> It sounds interesting, right?
