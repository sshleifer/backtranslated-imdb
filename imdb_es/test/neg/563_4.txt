This movie should have been called "Alexander's Eyes", and should have eliminated Bogart's concept altogether. The film began with a joyful approach to Bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his face oriented to surgery, but after the first 15-30 minutes it transforms into a more serious thriller, where two sapphires the size of the palm, supposedly placed like eyes in a marble. Helmet of Alexander the Great, for him, and seen by him, just before his death. So gems are of great value not only for their quality and size, but also for the link with the best conqueror the world has ever known. Being an expert in Alexander qualifies me to say that this is totally and completely a fiction, but it is still a good movie anyway. So the film revolves around some early nonsense and stumbles across all sorts of Alexander allusions both in the foreground and in the background (which I really liked), ending with a dated shark attack (you could not go to a movie in '79 - '80 without a shark appearing to threaten the public). There is a yacht called Euridice (the young wife of Alexander's father), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus? (It's been about 5 years since I saw the movie, so I can not remember all the details), Olympias, some Street Names, and many others. It was fun to watch the movie just to try to capture all the background details that the director put in (obviously, the same Alexanderphile). When all is said and done, the eyes are recovered and the camera places them on a bed as the credits pass. A kind of clean ending. What would have been more fun would be that they were Indiana Jones-like and had an action adventure. There were many, many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting, or example, the handwritten version (by Aristotle) ​​of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life, even on his many trips across Asia (It would be invaluable if you are today). Olivia Hussey (my favorite B-movie actress) has been murdered too soon, and she should have been the leading actress at all times, not the mom's girl and dad's ... even though she was kind to the eyes. If you can find this movie, it might be worth checking out the historical stuff and seeing Olivia Hussey in a bit of funny humor, but beyond that, it would give her something more entertaining. <Br /> <br /> Yours, Nick
