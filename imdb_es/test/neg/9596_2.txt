Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little money, some knowledge of creating movies, a mix of aspiring actors and a lot of determination, but without the knowledge and skills needed to achieve something more. that a special program for after school pretty poor (in a bad way, not a good nostalgic way). I mean, this is quality stuff from home movies / student movies if you want to share them with family and friends for free. Fortunately, I found it in a discount container somewhere. Sure, there may be some kind of market out there for this kind of thing, but it's a market that seems to exist only by default because there are a lot of bad B movies out there. Even more now in this era. <br /> <br /> The only people I would recommend this movement to are the aspiring guerrilla filmmakers. First of all, I would recommend that you see the special MAKING OF feature that is included on the disk. See the film crews enthusiasm, hard work, joy and the very high opinions of their own product. THEN watch the movie. Within a few frames, hopefully you will understand what went wrong. Bored, I went through the whole thing and clearly the director and the cinematographer tried, but they just do not know what they are doing. They knew enough to have fun, but in the long run, without the necessary skills, this is interpreted as: They knew enough to be dangerous. This is like a bad Nickelodeon movie (as it relates to a more decent one, I suppose). A couple of actors did it well, and the nice stoner impersonator with the tattoo (real or fake tattoo that I do not know) was probably the best and most natural, and I hope he does. But his natural talent for acting was what was happening despite the bad movie, the bad script and the principles of regular direction. If the director had spent more time helping these aspiring actors develop their characters, successfully studying camera techniques and proven lighting principles to better manage their team, and if the script had actually been worked on instead of written in a week or so (according to the very indulgent documentary) then maybe this could have been more of a movie. Instead, it is a film that has a sense of potential and has some moments (due more to the genre than to the film itself), but it ends up showing almost all the frames, WHAT NOT TO DO. If you want to see what a decent low-budget horror movie really looks like, look at Phantasm or even Laserblast. If you want a glorified home movie (no kidding), get Bog Creatures.
