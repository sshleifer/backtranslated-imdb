I saw Roger Moore snorting about the scenes that required running or exercising. He was a James Bond who would feel more comfortable sitting in a bar telling stories with his fellow British Knights. There's nothing against old people in roles appropriate to their age, but how realistic is it for a frail-looking 58-year-old man to be fighting on airplane wings, hanging on one side of the train, swimming in a swamp with crocodiles, etc. ? Apart from the fact that OCTOPUSSY was incredibly stupid, insensitive and foolish, the fact that a frail old man involved in many death defying stunts makes it a lot easier to laugh at James Bond. By 1983, Roger Moore was clearly the same age as him, and the time had passed when it seemed he could fight younger men. I saw this movie in the theater, and the howls of laughter were many and very often. All the credibility that James Bond had accumulated was gone after OCTOPUSSY. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing from OCTOPUSSY was Benny Hill and his supporting cast. Another low point was that the incredibly lame Louis Jordan was half of the Axis of Evil. Jordan helped make the whole concept even more ridiculous. And the Russian general was a total goof. OCTOPUSSY works best as a comedy parody similar to SPIES LIKE US. <br /> <br /> Even the scene of the fight on the train was just a bad copy of the same train scenes made in many other best actor films. Take EMPEROR OF THE NORTH (1972) where Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine fought at the top and bottom of the train and made it look exciting and real. <br /> <br /> Roger Moore had a slim and frail body in 1983 and yet his double double was clearly a younger, taller, athletic and muscular man. Even the hair color does not match. This only made his fight scenes more comical. Moore's stunts looked like those old low budget Chop-Socky Kung-Fu movies, especially with bad editing. The Director seemed to try to improve the bad performance and the bad acrobatics by providing several views of it. This only accentuated the differences between Moore and his double. The fact that the scenes of the Train with Moore were filmed inside a studio could be noticed in the lighting when Moore was in the shot in front of the outside shots of the double in a real train. Although many of the Bond films have to be the worst in history when it comes to editing their tricks. In general, you can clearly see that the Bond actor is not fighting. In general, OCTOPUSSY has to be classified as one of the worst movies ever made, and easily the worst of the worst Bond films.
