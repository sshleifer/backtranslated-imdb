I saw The Greek Tycoon when it first came out in 1978. I found it extremely boring. I thought it was no better than a travel journal except for one thing: for the first time in my life, I realized why it would be good to be rich. Seeing the landscape in front of the yacht of Aristotle Onassis and getting my first real glimpse into the lifestyle of the rich and famous, I opened my eyes. Paraphrasing Martha Stewart: It was a good thing. Funny, I do not remember the sex scene. I had not seen the movie since I was on the big screen and I found that the love session with the mistress was memorable this time. Maybe because he was younger and single at the time, it was not a big deal.
