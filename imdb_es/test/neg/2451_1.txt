I think I'd prefer that my piles be cut out with a pair of rusted mowers that support another 5 minutes of this movie. In fact, I can not even bother to go into details! I'm not sure how they managed to get the needles in the wooden actors to cure them! Better for all concerned if they had attacked the island after discovering the virus, that way it would have lasted as long as the commercial recess, and we could have continued with our lives. One more thing was this garbage commissioned by God's channel? As all they seemed to do was praise the bleeding lord most of the time. Avoid like the plague! In fact I would prefer it!
