This may well be the worst version that Hollywood has produced, and that is saying something. I'll take it further than that and say that this movie is so amazingly, deliriously bad that it MUST BE SIGHTED. I do not know if I'm able to address all the wrong things, like the fact that the casting director seems to have taken names out of a hat, or the fact that the character of Richard Gere has allowed a mental fan to move away at the end free (I'm sure people say: "It's just fiction, who cares" would not have any problem if it were a former Al-Qaeda agent who just wants to return to his home country) so I'll just dedicate my review the absolute hilarity, which is mainly the scene in which Bruce Willis is testing his weapon. <br /> <br /> In the original version, you will remember, the Jackal practices his death in a pumpkin. The pumpkin explodes on impact, an effect known as "underestimation". In THIS version, Willis sets a pumpkin target, but he does not use a sniper rifle; It uses a giant remote-controlled cannon that costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge visible minivan. (This man likes challenges). Reveal the cannon by pulling a tarp, at which point Jack Black, who is there to watch, jumps up and says: "That ROCKS! This ROCKS!" about 18 times (I think Willis did not have to take it apart first, he just picked it up, with the tarp and everything, out of the back of the truck, even though it probably weighed several tons). The scene then becomes an Austin Powers movie when Willis misses the gourd and pulls out a tree, then causes Black to run through the mud with his pants falling, and finally removes Black's arm. The pumpkin falls to the ground, unharmed. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend this movie for ONE non-ironic reason, it's for the character of Diane Venora as a Russian strongie who is romantically linked to Gere despite having a facial disfigurement, a bold move for a Hollywood Feature I really liked this character in the middle of the movie, so it was a shame when he had to kill her. I would have liked to see a movie about her. Apart from that, this pile of garbage is only useful as objective evidence of intelligence. 3/10.
