This is not the true story. It is the darkest possible fiction derived from events. Supports suicide, the morose obsession with death, a side blow totally free for organized religion in general (and the Anglican Church, in particular) and, in general, offers a nihilistic, nonsensical view of the world, from which the spectators, I suppose, have the intention of moving away, richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their despair. <br /> <br /> Total garbage, although made in an attractive way by a capable cast. That anyone suggests that this is a true representation, however, is a very false advertising. Do you want the real story? Rent 'fairy tale'. That is the true story. See if you can find some correspondence between the facts presented in any case. I only found one: the girls who made the original photographs were pre-pubescent.
