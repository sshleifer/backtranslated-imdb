Maybe I'm alone here, but this is a fucking show. I'm sorry, but I was attracted when I found out about Lil 'Bill O'Reilly (which I had no idea of ​​coming out of this program until months later, and honestly since it lost its appeal), but I gave the program a fair chance. Spike strives to become something that he is not, that is, tries to be human. Fox did not even bother to hide the ropes when they took him out of the box he entered. His sketches do their best, he himself is not funny and writers strive to write material for a host without talent. There's too much good TV out there to waste time with this program, and Fox ... Fox, we've had some good times, but you need to merge your f $% ing and create something original instead. of trying to be just another "me too" network.
