The original version by George Sluizer of The Vanishing, also known as The Man Who Wanted To Know, offers one of the most disturbing sociopaths in European cinema and one of the most memorable finals of all time (blatantly stolen by Tarantino for Kill Bill, Volume Two), but it has much more. to offer that. Playing a bit with the chronology and reversing the usual cliches of the standard 'lady vanishes' plots, it also offers excellent characterization and solid, minimized but compelling performances. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can only assume that when it came to remake, Sluizer was so determined that no one else had the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how exhaustively destroys his own work. His career never recovered from this disastrous misstep. <br /> <br /> The main culprit is an amazing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overlooked in every detail at a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his first films noticed that Bridges was a great instinctive actor whenever you stopped him to think about what he was doing, and this movie is the proof of the pudding. Each movement is too mechanical in its precision, which makes it look like a rusty clock toy, while his voice is a strange mix of Tootsie, Latka Taxi Gravels and a Dalek who have been taking lessons in elocution from Dok-tah E -ville. Here there is no banality of evil, only a madman walking by with an invisible sign on his head that says: "Please, leave me, kill, you, thank you, for your consideration." But guilt must really be shared here. None of the performances is good: often, they do not even look good. Keifer Sutherland is more like a baby hamster than an anguished man in his wit that ends up in the hasty scenes in The Gas Station Nancy Travis fails badly and Sandra Bullock is not at all impressed as an object of her obsession. It's not that the director or writer Todd Graff helped them. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered. to focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. The worst is the rush in which the film is, exhausting the life and character of each scene in his career to reach the next. / Low mood swings in the relationship of the couple or the seemingly casual but careful establishment of the feeling of the place, we only have a couple of arguments that give you the impression that you are probably better off without it. As for the new and improved happy ending stan woman Dard pursued by Nutter in the forest full risky things with lame 'we end up in a joke like a TV show' moment? Better not go there? that is a tip that is worth for all this amazing movie. Even a surprisingly tasteless and boring Jerry Goldsmith score can not do anything about this.
