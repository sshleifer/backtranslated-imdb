The sleazy rock (glam) of the 80s is like the house music of the 90s or the current children's bands: it is boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes it a little "cultured" nowadays is that it is a long time ago, so we can laugh at its foolishness. Too bad, 'Rock Star' does not laugh at all, as it must be one of the most boring movies of recent years. <br /> <br /> Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is a singer of a tribute band to Steel Dragon. When he is kicked out of the band at the same time that the true Steel Dragon singer is also kicked, he becomes the next lead singer. You know how this is going to end at that moment, with Chris losing him with sex, drugs and R & D and forgetting his longtime girlfriend / manager, Emily (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> There is a way Too much music (boring) in this standard excuse full of formula for a movie and should be avoided at all costs. Look at it (overrated, but even more fun) Almost famous, instead, or even better, a film about real people who play real music with real emotions, that thing you do. <br /> <br /> What stinks. 2/10.
