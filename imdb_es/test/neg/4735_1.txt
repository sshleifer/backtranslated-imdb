If you are a fan of either of the two franchises of origin (Aliens & Predator ... duh ... and even if you liked or did not like the AVP movie in 06) you will hate this movie. The innumerable holes of the plot, incredible and incredible human characters, terrible special effects and even worse scenes of direction and fight make this one of the worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLIER *** One of HUNDRED the huge holes in the plot included the Pred / Alien hybrid that goes from the coffer stew to the bad ass in a matter of seconds (takes off in a predator killers spree aboard on board and destroy a Pred ship before the ship even breaks Earth) orbit.) AS YES. In the first AvP, we saw a hunter ship of Pred. Delantes left three juvenile hunters in a hunting game "winning their strips", and in the end they saw them picking up the "honorable body" of the juvenile that had been At the end of the film. Is it expected that we believe that the only chest-box hybrid killed all these Hunters before the ship even broke the orbit? In addition, (and this was a production value EXTREMELY cheap in the parts of the director / producer) jars and jars and jars of raiders magically appeared in some way aboard the ship Pred, even though the whole temple complex and Queen Alien They were destroyed in the movie AvP. These assailants end up playing an intregal role in the movie ... of course. And what about all these assailants who become adult Aliens in one day? What a joke Although there were many more holes in the plot, I do not think IMDb would appreciate it if they filled their servers by writing them here. <br /> <br /> About the incredible and incredible characters, well, where should I go guys and girls? Where to start ... almost all these nonsense are clich√© people from other movies or TV shows. The bad guy in the city who left to avoid going to jail but who appears right on the day when everything happens to save the day? Where did I see that? Oh yes, last season at JERICHO !!! Then there is the sheriff of the city of 20 years old (a former problem maker) who was the best friend at the same time as the bad boy. Where did we see that? Oh yes, JERICHO and Walking Tall! Then there is the generic soldier (WITHOUT RANGE) who comes home from a generic war front that is not found as a loved one and hero at the airport or at the bus station, but in his OWN gateway next to his daughter and her husband . And who is this soldier? What did she do in the Army / Air Force / Marines / Navy / Coast Guard? WE DO NOT KNOW IT BECAUSE THE FILM NEVER TELLS US. But ... dunh, dunh, dunh ... she was some kind of soldier / aviator / navy / navy / coastal who knows how to drive a Stryker infantry vehicle and ... magically ... A HELICOPTER !!! This character is just a generic copy of each service person "coming home" ... except that she brings home a set of night vision goggles for her daughter that cost MANY HUNDRED dollars. These are things that soldiers must sign and not just "take them home." UGH! <br /> <br /> Special effects and fight scenes are what most puzzled me about the worst. These are the things I enjoyed most in the first movie ... see Preds and Aliens attack! However, the way it was filmed was that the action sequences were so dark and filmed so close that you could not tell what was happening. You could not see who was doing what and what was happening while they were fighting against it. All in all, these hundreds of items will kill this franchise and fanchise. No one will care more about watching their favorite science fiction movie monsters, and you can only guess that the series will come down from here, as the producers will not like to see millions of dollars more in a sequel.
