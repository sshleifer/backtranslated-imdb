This show sucks. he put on Friday on the roller coaster, and although he undoubtedly destroyed the theme of the Friday program, I will judge him rationally ... I still think it stinks. He really is super lame. Zoey and her stupid friends are weak characters and the pot stinks and is really boring. <br /> <br /> The dirty continuity and boat stink and I recognize the dialogue and the joes are weak. The weak humor and dirty bored characters stink, and the whole show is frankly a disappointment that is not worth seeing. It stinks and is really, very scarce. It really has to be one of the most lazy programs on television, it really is not worth seeing. I mean, how weak and goat can a show become before it's canceled?
