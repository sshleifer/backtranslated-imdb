I understand the director's purpose to tell stories that are not stories, but the way he tried to show the time that passes (the pair of runners, who appear for the first time running together, who run with a stroller (sic!), That man alone ...) and to link the "adventures" of the characters (the final scene, with the maid climbing a mountain watching the big black man on another cliff, and then seeing the boat with his former employer and saying " Oh, a boat! ") They were horrible. At the same time, I liked the way he portrayed the upper-middle class, even in an excessive way. I think it's a terrible movie. If you want to see it, do it as a student of a film school, trying to see the technical aspects and problems. It will help a lot.
