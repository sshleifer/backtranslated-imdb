Deepa Mehta, Arundhati Roy and a lot of other so-called intellectuals get the title of intellectuals because of the fact that they love to portray India and Hinduism from a negative point of view ... and Deepa Mehta makes his money anyway . Anyway, the Hindus are too soft or afraid to protest the way Muslims protest so that anyone can take any liberty with Hinduism. And it is a fact that during the 1930s women in the West were also abused when they were widows ... only that no one likes to point out anything bad about the West or anything other than India and the Hindus. She paints an incorrect portrait of India and the situation of widows there. Nowhere is it mentioned that child marriage is illegal. He finished the movie saying that there are 34 million widows in India. Of course, among a billion people, there will be many widows. But how many live the life she has represented in the movie? Deepa Mehta is finally selling India and poverty to make dollars. What a pathetic ....
