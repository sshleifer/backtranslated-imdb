This movie basically uses marital rape as one of its main comedic devices. Now I turned it off the moment he literally ties her to the bed and rapes her, but I really can not imagine how that finally turned into something endearing and fun. This film not only squandered a wonderful cast and was consistently not funny, in fact it managed to be brutally disturbing and misogynistic. How many people seem to find it, a sweet family movie surpasses me. "Of course I enjoyed canning those apricots last night" is not a funny joke when you know it means to force a virgin who does not want to have sex with you in the hope that eventually learn to like it. Seeing a tom Jep peeking out is not family fun. Honestly, I feel worse for having seen half of this spooky "comedy" and I am totally baffled by these positive reviews.
