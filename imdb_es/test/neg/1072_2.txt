Honestly, Mr. Thalluri ... if you make a dramatic movie in a high school environment following a group of teenagers throughout a school day and if you screw up the time frame and jump from one side to the other ... yes he does that, he can not use exactly the same visual storytelling device from "Elephant" that uses a camera that moves from one character to another and has scenes that are shown 3 times from different angles. You just can not do that because it's such a strong scam that it's hard to believe if someone gave you more than 5 points. <br /> <br /> Where "Elephant" (which was released 3 years before this film) uses school shootings (or to be exact the Columbine shooting) as the focal point of his screenplay 2:37 uses the Teen suicide and seeing the revisions, the impact of the theme worked. It's the same slow story, a lot of dramatic piano music that leads to an ending you know from the beginning. At least the characters seem to have tried to be different in that department. So you have an atypical gay guy who seems to be a fool / skater, a loving guy who can not deal with his gay side, brother and sister of a rich family who have their own problems and here comes the nose. Diving. <br /> <br /> You also get a pampered bulimic girl and one of the most ridiculous characters in history ... a guy with medical conditions who wet his pants because of the "2 urethra syndrome" that he never really knew about. the invention of diapers, but he pisses in the classroom and then he puts on new clothes and he does it EVERYDAY! WOW, as hard as this movie tries to be realistic, this is the most absurd thing I've heard. He is beaten on the toilet and obviously embarrassed about it, but does not wipe the blood from his nose as he passes through the school with his pants wet and his nose bleeding. That is the realism of the new era that leads directly to the "turn" and the final character that turns out to be the suicidal victim ... <br /> <br /> After seeing the "very realistic" life of the teenagers (a day, including incest -Rrap, teenage pregnancy, bulimia, parental pressure for grades and appearance and the gay subject mentioned above, as your "very realistic" daily soap ... trying to be hard ... we see die a girl we met once at the beginning of this film and who has no more reason than the boy she was in love with, left the room when I was talking to him (in a thoughtful piano sequence by the way, have you seen her before? And it gets even better ... before cutting his wrist in a long and painful scene of "Yes" and "No", he asks 2-urethra-guy if he's okay, he smiles constantly and Then you cut your wrist with scissors in a school bathroom. <br /> <br /> Now you have a movie. molecule that is a total scam Elephant, fails with some really sloppy stories (the whole issue of rape-incest was also quite amazing) and people call this a shocking. <br /> <br /> What the hell is going on? Is it all it takes to take some pseudo-dramatic music, tell boring stories and add a shocking theme on top and people think there's an important deep message here? I think Elephant is already overrated, but that movie was the original, while here is an obvious rip-off that fails on many more levels. I've never seen a more brazen theft of an entire movie concept in my life ... and believe me, I've seen hundreds of horror movies, so I know how low you can get. This is a total disappointment in all departments ... it is not realistic, it is stolen, it is very slow and, of course, I wonder what is more useless ... another romantic suicide (many give this point to the movie that it makes me wonder if they only see Romeo + Juliet all day because there are dozens of movies that treat the subject in a clear, non-romantic and MORE REALISTIC way) or this ridiculous configuration ... Come on! I'm still trying to figure out if the 2-urethra boy or the suicide itself is more unreal and ridiculous.
