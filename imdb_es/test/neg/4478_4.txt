I had high hopes when I entered the theater: after having seen the trailer, I felt as excited as the next person to see how a great talent participates in the creation of a story with a beautiful premise. <br /> <br /> It is disappointing to see this talent devastated by the poor composition of the songs; the words are thick and cheesy, probably because it was composed with a more western theme. It would not be difficult for me to imagine the same melodies with lyrics in French or English. In Mandarin, they just sound strange. <br /> <br /> The musical elements were also cut very badly, too quickly to be entertaining, and the pictures of the actors who looked distressed lasted too long. <br /> <br /> Special effects are the next disappointment. Suffice it to say that it is very obvious where special effects start and stop. <br /> <br /> It's not Moulin Rouge, and neither is In The Mood, despite the occasional slow waltz theme (and very similar). In total, and time too long to tell a simple story.
