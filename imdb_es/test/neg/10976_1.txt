The daytime television of movies. Seldom have I felt so little attachment to the characters. I have rarely let myself tremble because of such serious dialogue. The thirty-odd years of Nauseous in London go through the scary and tremulous of the BBC. Avoid this movie as if it were your grandmother's hug.
