Something not so good. "Silence of the Lambs" is still Demme's only good movie, and, of course, I include all the overrated left exercises on the big screen, some of which I have not seen, and I never will. <br /> <br /> This is a light comedy that gives a twist of suspense somewhere midway. The first half is a little difficult to sit down; It is neither funny nor particularly interesting. Daniels plays a naive and foolish imbecile who is so naive and confident that he defies belief. His animated performance is often annoying, and just funny. In fact, he lies to Griffith from the beginning and tells him that he is married, with children, when in fact he is divorced! Throughout the history of mankind and movies, any man who is married and knows a woman he likes will lie, if he lies, and tell him he is NOT married. (Later, the unbelievable or credible reason behind this was revealed: he wanted to "protect himself (himself)." What a load of garbage ...) The fact that his character makes all the wrong decisions and does it all. silly things in the movie made me wait for Liotta to hit him when he caught up with him in the first apartment. <br /> <br /> What happens in Daniels' apartment is the classic end of the movie. fight-to-death that the good boy, although the very foolish good, wins predictably. Still, at least the last half hour has some action, something is happening, and Daniels no longer has the chance to cheer up. The film lacks credible characters (either main or marginal), and the feeling that it is too 80, which means that the movie looks quite smooth; visually ugly. Sayles once again makes a cameo appearance as a policeman. The movie is also perhaps a bit too heavy on the side of coincidences. Griffith once again plays a soft sound bimbo, but, as usual, it is convincing because it is a bimbo of soft sound. This was a previous movie, before her surgery to increase the size of the lips and increase the size of the breasts; he compares the natural breasts that he exposes in this film with the balloons ready to explode that briefly flashes years later in "Nobody's Fool". <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" of Griffith and Other Hollywood Intellectuals, contact me by email.
