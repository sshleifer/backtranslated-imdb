When I was younger (about 2) I looked at Barney for the first time and I liked it. BUT, at that time I did not exactly have a brain either. And now I look back and see what really is a horrible show "Barney": First of all, EVERYTHING on that show is creepy. Barney, the main character, is a horrendous 9-foot-tall purple dinosaur that teaches 13-year-olds about "imagination ..." (* shudders *) BJ (I know what you think of his name). a smaller but spookier yellow dinosaur that is positioned to be "supposedly" fresh. But, in fact, it is exactly the opposite. After watching some episodes with B.J. Entering with difficulty with his cap slightly turned, and making some jokes not so funny, I wanted to scream. Baby Bop-oh-oh-god! (* Vomita *) oh-oh-OH-anyway, Baby Bop is the worst idea of ​​a character EVER. She is a green triceratops (it's a dinosaur) that wears a yellow blanket. His comments of "hee-hee-hee" and Barney's praise of "super-deeee-doooper" make it difficult to sit down in each episode, as seventh graders learn about shapes and manners. <br /> <br /> And that, my friend, is what makes this show really horrible.
