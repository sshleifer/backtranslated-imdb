New Year 2006, and I'm seeing Glimmer Man again. Say what you want, I find the Steven Seagal movies fun. Like many comments, good fight sequences, I especially liked your phone answer in the restaurant that said how long it would be closed for the restoration. Little like Schwarzenegger's humor in previous action films, although that used to be self-critical. <br /> <br /> But the one I like the most is Brian Cox. One of the most versatile actors. Too bad of his hand and foot, but so much to resist the prolonged interrogation - he must have suspended that class on the "farm". <br /> <br /> As the movies progressed, I wonder how it affected Seagal's always thickened girth. His movement? It does not matter, it's entertainment!
