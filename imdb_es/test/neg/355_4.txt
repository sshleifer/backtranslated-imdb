As a physicist, talking about black holes and cosmology causes my heart to accelerate. However, I found this presentation too slow and without too much information for the interested layman (who is more likely to see it). If you have more than a passing curiosity in this kind of thing, go to the library and look at some books. You will discover that they explain current scientific cosmologies in much more detail and at the same time give you more astonishment than this movie. Also to make things clear: Hawking is NOT considered the "most intelligent mind" or the "most intelligent person" in the world, as is often said even among user reviews here in the IMDb. Hawking himself has commented that "it is garbage, it is just an exaggeration of the media, they needed someone to fulfill the role model of the disabled genius, at least I am disabled". To be fair, he is probably a genius, but among the most important scientists in history, people like Einstein, Newton, Gauss and many others are easily considered. This is not to disrespect Hawking, who is undoubtedly a great scientist, but rather to not disrespect others who have done even more than he has done. Anyway, look at the movie if you really like science. But if not, I think it would be boring for you.
