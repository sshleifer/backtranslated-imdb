I was very excited to see "Cold Mountain". Oh, like most of the movies that I'm really excited to see, it was a disappointment! If it was not for that miraculous invention called DVD, I think I would have put my head on the monitor, I was so bored! <br /> <br /> I watched Kidman and Law when they met because their characters are supposedly "destined" for each other. However, Law's face showed anything but a stunned love, while Kidman seemed to be counting the seconds until she could run back to her trailer. The character of Zellweger is the pure grandmother Clampett (as if we did not understand it, the banjos of cornball mark her in each entry), and therefore, all I could do not to laugh! Ironically, his performance serves to highlight how rigid the cables are. <br /> <br /> Ada almost died of hunger because she freed her slaves; we never learn why. More puzzling is why none of them stayed when Ada and her father were unusually benevolent, and (as shown in one scene) it was a very dangerous time for blacks (as they are called here politely). Why did not the neighbors teach you how to milk a cow or grow a crop? Hell, why did not he just sell the farm and go home? And for all the practicalities of Ruby, when she sends Ada's "evil" cock, that's what makes the kibosh have more chickens! <br /> <br /> When your beloved finally returns, Ada does not need Him or anyone else, which is the big joke! In fact, she may have physical intimacy with Inman, but her true intimacy is with Ruby, who has turned Ada into a Über-Babe version of herself. Did anyone else notice how they came down the hill holding hands, happy as two peas in a pod, when they left Inman behind? <br /> <br /> I doubt that Minghella would recognize him because he was too busy doing an anti-movie. Inman tells us he is "like all the fools sent to fight with a flag and a lie", and Ada's father He says "I imagine that God is tired of being called by both sides of an argument". These "observations" are historically inaccurate and insulting. While slavery was the basis of the southern economy, the reasons for the war were more complex. It was incomprehensible that a soldier thought that the cause was "a lie" (in fact, the majority in the rank was not indifferent to him). For the filmmakers, who print their points of view in a period in which such views were alien to those who lived at that time, it is more than unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the film is choppy and episodic. Law and Kidman are a mess, and they do not have chemistry! The script is a little more than a half-hearted dialogue, and a lot of clichés and banalities. "Small moments like a bag of diamonds?" Ugh!
