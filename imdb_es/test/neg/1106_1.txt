I usually love this kind of movie. However, this time I found myself wanting to kick the screen. Since I can not do that, I will only complain about it. This was absolutely idiotic. The things that happen with the dead children are very good, but the living people are absolute idiots. I am a grown man, quite large, and I can defend myself well. However, I would not do half the things that the girl does in this movie. In addition, the mother in this film is reckless with her children, to the point of negligence. I wish I was not so angry about her and her actions because otherwise I would have enjoyed the movie. What number she was, follow my advice and move quickly through everything you see her do until the end. Also, is anyone else getting tired of watching movies that are filmed so darkly? You can no longer see what is being filmed. As a public, we are impossibly involved with the actions on the screen. Then, why the hell can not we have night vision?
