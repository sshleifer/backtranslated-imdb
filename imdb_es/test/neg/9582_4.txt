I can not believe how many critics praise this as realistic. I'm a million miles away from being an expert, and I'm never going to climb a mountain; but even the very basic knowledge you get from reading Into Thin Air and seeing Everest Beyond The Limit and some other Everest documents mean that this movie became increasingly ridiculous as it progressed. There are some good climbing images at the beginning; and when the multimillionaire leader of the mission asks at the beginning of the film "How much experience does it have to more than 8000 meters?", they encouraged me to hope that this could be a man's odyssey against natural and precise nature. Instead, there is a group of climbers climbing a mountain without acclimatization; climbing with glasses in the sun, and almost never gasping for miraculous feats of endurance. Only near the top suggests a bit of fatigue, to dramatically accentuate the physical prowess of climbing such a monstrous peak, almost as a late occurrence. If you have no knowledge of mountaineering, take a look: get ready for some heroic classics (though no more cliches than a hundred other detour movies) and a clich√© result. I have been developing a small fascination for the high mountains and I expected to see K2; but apart from some incredibly beautiful landscapes, it was a disappointment because it was very far from reality. I can imagine some experts working on the making of this film, but then being conveniently ignored in the search for the heroic and sadly fantastic story. Also, it would sound like a tit if you said "welcome to the death zone" at 200,000 feet.
