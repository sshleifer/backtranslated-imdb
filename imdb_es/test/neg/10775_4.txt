As we know, movies are not meant to be a direct embodiment of the story, but it is a disgrace when a film is made that has little or no correlation. I wish that the director and / or the scriptwriter have done their research on this topic. All that this movie does is create a forum for hate between people, while causing a break that should not be there. This film portrays the Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative way, while making the third group (Hindus) look like they did not exist in the brutal murders of the people of both nations. The inaccuracies, along with the contempt of faith for one's faith as shown by "Gian Singh" was an embarrassment to the highest format. Although on a more positive note, the actors did a great job acting in their roles. Both Kristen K and Neve C played their roles exceptionally. I hope that those who watch this movie will not see it or use it as a template for the real historical event.
