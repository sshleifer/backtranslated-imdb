This is the most terrifying movie ever made in Hollywood. It is a cautionary tale about how to take a European masterpiece and suck life until it is a dry shell like an insect carcass on the windowsill. Scary because it reveals how the world of Hollywood really works: ignorant money begets scum. I wonder how many great movies could populate the corridors of my memory if the Hollywood process had not led them to a forgettable mediocrity. Cry for the murdered children! Go to Spoorloos or read The Golden Egg, if you dare, because they will come back to you forever in the idle moments of your life: when you are walking down the street and see a "lost" poster; in parking lots of ordinary appearance; when you listen to the Tour de France on the radio; and, above all, when you think "what's wrong with you?" in wearing a sock with a hole in a perfectly normal day. <br /> <br /> If only I could give you a zero.
