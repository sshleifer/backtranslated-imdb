The script seems to have been borrowed (ahem, ahem, cough) "borrowed" from another film that involves the use of a self-propelled drilling machine. Scene by scene, the two films were almost identical. Fair enough of the serial numbers included in this to prevent a claim for copyright infringement. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, I must say that I found this entertaining, since I enjoy it deeply in the basement. -A third genre of movies. It's a bit on the stupid side when it comes to science, but if you're willing to squint and pretend you did not notice that scientific mistake here and there, this movie is almost bearable. Much better than "Supernova", which was another film in which Luke Perry played a leading role, was so stupid, so stupid, so foolish that nothing could save him. A note for movie makers: hire someone who knows something about the subject the film is about. It would be a very small part of the film's budget, but it would have a great overall effect to help prevent your audience from laughing at you for doing silly science. <br /> <br /> Production values: almost passable. I have seen much worse things in my time. <br /> <br /> A new thought for disaster films: instead of always having a happy ending where the world is saved once again, what about something in which things are a bit A little more realistic, where sometimes even the best efforts end in failure. Particularly when the problem that needs to be solved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity. The films of disasters caused by stupidity with a brilliant and moving ending justify the stupidity in an improvised way saying: "No matter how terrible the problem caused by the stupidity of the brain, it can be fixed". Which is definitely not the case. A self-made disaster film with an unhappy ending would serve better as a warning of "Do not be so stupid in the first place". Should you watch this movie? If you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section of your local video rental store, sure, why not? But avoid "Supernova", since I can assure you that you are not so bored. That was definitely not one of Luke Perry's best movies. This is better. That does not say much, but it's better. <br /> <br /> A dead hoof for being an underground genre movie. A hoof dead for stealing dexterously the script of another film of the same genre.
