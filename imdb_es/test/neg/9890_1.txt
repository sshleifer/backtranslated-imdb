This movie is supposed to take place in Milford, NJ. I know the house in which it is based as well as the person. As seen at the end of the film, she was killed in the incident of the world trade center. I know, because I was one of the police officers who helped with the identification of his remains. (She was the only one in our lost area). The nudity in the movie was a bit far. I'm not rude, but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two women without showing the whole thing. This movie is in bad taste and I can not see how her family would bless her. This is an insult to the person on whom it is based.
