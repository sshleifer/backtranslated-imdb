That was a waste of 9 dollars. the movie was terrible all the "frightening" parts were useless and sadly repetitive. Apparently, all tense parts could be completely predicted and did not seem to attract public attention. In addition, the plot did not advance at all during the whole film, and was only a great configuration for the resentment 3. When it seemed that the film was on the verge of making a great advance of the plot, it turned out to be simply A scene without sense. these directors must follow Hitchcock's example: every scene has a point. It is probable that 90% of the scenes in this film could have been omitted without changing the plot. Final opinion: Do not waste your time, energy or money!
