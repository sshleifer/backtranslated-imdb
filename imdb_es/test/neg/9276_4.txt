At the final entrance to the trilogy of On The Buses, the usual rubbish deals with their business in Wales. I'm sure the franchise could have continued, but Harold Pinter complained that the scripts made it look bad in comparison, and that's why they did not do it anymore. <br /> <br /> Actually, it takes less than two minutes for us to get our first dose of sexism: a woman running to the bus discovers that her breasts fall out of her dress for no reason. Still, at least it makes Stan laugh (Reg Varney), but then, what does not? He and Jack (Bob Grant) spend the whole movie laughing out loud with little or no provocation. You have the impression that they would get wet seeing dry paint. <br /> <br /> As before, the only fun element is the genuinely funny Stephen Lewis, hilarious as Blakey. However, he is alone, with a dated and cheesy script that even wastes first class talent like Wilfrid Brambell and Henry McGee. However, it seems as if only Lewis understood how to measure the time of the unstable material, spitting laughter even from the weakest lines. When describing how his daughter fell into a river, Stan's mother laments: "I hope it's not contaminated." "Well, it will be now," jokes Blakey. <br /> <br /> The plot, if there is one, sees Stan coveting a girl, but being continually frustrated by her dominant mother. It is a recipe for the hilarity of the lateral division. I'm sure you'll agree, and if it's a storm boat or swimming bath, Stan and Mavis's exploits always produce the same result ... absolute boredom. The later conquests include Maria, an Italian stereotype and a co-worker of the staff. Even Stan's mother has an overnight affair, and Stan reminds her to "put in the tin drawers." <br /> <br /> When one of the comical "highlights" is Arthur Mullard, who listens to Olive trying to locate a light. change in the dark ("I can not find it") and thinking that you are talking about sex, then you can see why this work reaches the higher levels of literary sophistication. In fact, the reason why it was not included in the 100 best films of the BFI surpasses me. <br /> <br /> Other rib scams involve Olive (Anna Karen) breaking her glasses. I do not know what is most surprising, the low predictability of the configuration or underdeveloped compensation. Olive, short-sighted, follows a man in a kilt to the gentlemen, thinking she is a woman with a skirt. The next shot is seen by Blakey and redirected to the ladies. And that is. Next, she ends up in another man's bed, and is ordered by his wife. And ... no, that's all there is in that scene, too. <br /> <br /> When Holiday on the Buses was screened for the last time on British television, there was an interruption in the broadcast. Actually it came as blessed relief.
