Evan Almighty continues with Bruce Almighty's main franchise, this time with a journalist turned into Buffalo's first-year congressman, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), at his center. God (Morgan Freeman), a completely innocuous man (and not even that he really doubts himself) decides to impose a kind of search on Baxter, to illustrate the importance of ... reciprocal goodness, so that Baxter can "change the world". "(also known as" pay ahead "). <br /> <br /> Think of Almighty Evan as a healthy derivative of 'Distinguished Gentlemen' Baxter is not a scam, but his colleague, Congressman Long (John Goodman) he wants his unconditional support in a bill that, in essence, is harmful to the environment, and well-intentioned, Baxter, knowing the importance of networks and visibility, is willing to support it. <br /> <br /> Also, with the new work comes more responsibility, and Baxter is, in a sense, vilified, for not spending enough time with his family. <br /> <br /> So, God decides to give Evan Baxter a guide by forcing him to become in the modern Noah, his orders: to build an ark, except that, while it may be a bit funny to see Baxter's transformation to the "weird beard", there does not seem to be much point in all this, which becomes much clearer when the climax of the movie fades. (SPOILERS: yes ni Some of the population is killed by the "deluge," so what was the reason for summoning the animals ... or at least those who obviously were not from the suburbs of Virginia? Or, more importantly, if all the Baxters had to realize that Long's projects lost quality, then why did he have to build an ark?). <br /> <br /> So, although a comedy like this does not have to be a hysterical laugh, it certainly became a lot less pleasant since it was filled with too many homilies (and not all from Morgan Freeman) and action that It seemed destined to a movie of more epic events.
