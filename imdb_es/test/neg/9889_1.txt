This cheap movie is based on a true story. I do not doubt it. It does not mean that it is particularly interesting (unless you are one of the main characters who experienced this experience). A young woman named Angela buys a big, big and very cheap country house. Well, as we all know from watching horror movies, when you buy a cheap big house, it usually means that you are obsessed in some way, shape or form. In fact, the second when the house is being delivered to Angela, the wise boy who lived in the house so far takes a moment to "introduce" Angela to one of the ghosts. Good boy, huh? Angela gets in touch with a psychic and a paranormal expert and tells them that her house is delighted and invites them to come and see the ghosts for themselves. They come to a party and, of course, there are ghosts walking, sitting on the couch, hanging in the garage and trying to seduce people in the bathroom. Some friends sleep all night of the party, see the ghosts and promise never to return home. (Take a look at the girl who says "I'm so scared, I'm so scared." Totally emotionless, if she was so scared, why did not she get up, turn the knob and go?) The ghosts do not really do anything threatening other than appearing (and there is no lack of definition or aura in them.) They look like normal people). They steal the celery from the kitchen, move the chairs around a POLTERGEIST and a bisexual ghost seduces Angela, who, I understand this, does not seem to mind. This scene is played as the kind of soft porn you see on the SPICE channel. (Ummm ... not that I had known! Hahaha) Actresses are not your typical porn stars. They should go more to the beach and the gym. When Angela is not making love to the dead, she gets mad at them and stays alone in a room screaming "Why do not you go ?! This is MY house! Go away!" They do not leave. I could not help but think of all the times I heard the psychic Sylvia Brown on television say that if you have a ghost in your house, you should calmly rationalize with the ghost and say "Look, you're dead, it's time to cross over to the other In other words, get out! "According to Sylvia Brown, as long as you're not hostile and unpleasant about it, they'll leave! This movie seems to cost around $ 50 to make. It has a really cheap feeling, and bad acting. I could have made this movie with 5 friends and a camcorder.
