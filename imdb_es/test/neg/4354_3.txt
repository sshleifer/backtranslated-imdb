I have tried to see this movie 3 or 4 times, but I can not ignore the fact that everything is just horrible. I'm sure it was a courageous move on the part of someone who chose Jack Palance as the protagonist, but there is not a single fiber of my being that believes he could act at all, much less act against the guy. <br /> <br /> Yes, I understand that Clifford Odets was a brilliant author, but it is not evident here. This strange and forced mix of nonconformist dialogue of the 50's seems to obfuscate any genuine meaning, which explains why none of the actors, nor the good ones (Steiger, Ida Lupino, Shelly Winters, Everett Sloane) seems to know how to offer their lines - It is as if they did not understand the meaning of what they are saying. And, meanwhile, Wendell Corey and Palance organize an excellent contest to see who can have the most rock face. <br /> <br /> The direction is amateur and is completely altered. The physical interaction between the characters is as forced as the dialogue. <br /> <br /> And can we discuss that horrible set? It is so busy, ugly and contrived that it adds to the robotic and disconnected quality of the characters, the dialogue and the representations. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to take all the energy out of me. It seems that everyone took an overdose of Valium every morning when they arrived on the set. It takes a pretty bad movie to make Rod Steiger and Shelly Winters look bad, but this one is successful. <br /> <br /> I can see that it could have been effective as a play on or off Broadway, where the intellectuals and the rhythms could have congratulated themselves for appreciating the power of the plot and the artistic flowering of the pseudo dialogue -hip.
