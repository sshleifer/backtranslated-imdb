Bobcat Goldthwait should be praised for trying to do something different with this surprisingly sincere movie, a warning about the dangers of being honest about everything. Melinda Hamilton plays Amy, a girl who has had oral sex with a canine in the past in a lark. She struggles with telling her fianc√©, John. Of course, the truth is the ugly hairy head. The film is about the consequences of this escape. The film is well played by everyone, except perhaps Jack Plotnick as Dougie, who never felt as if he had mixed well with the image. And the movie, although it's solid enough, seems to miss her a couple of times. Every person in the film is fighting massive hypocrisy and we are all a bit difficult to relate. Bobcat should be praised for doing something different, as I said before, but different is not always as good and this pales slightly in the debut of Goldthwaits' own direction, the misinterpreted criminally "Shake the clown" <br /> <br /> My Degree: C-
