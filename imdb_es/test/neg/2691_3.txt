I must admit that although I am a Shakespeare fan, I was never very familiar with this work. And what I really can not say is if this is a bad adaptation or if the work is just a bad choice for the movie. There are some good businesses, but the execution is very clumsy and the plot is obvious. The theme of the work is about the nature of the debt, using the financial idea of ​​debt and justice as a metaphor for emotional questions. That becomes clear when the issue of rings becomes more important than the business with Shylock, which unfortunately descends to the anti-Semitisim garden variety despite Bard's best attempts to save him with a couple of good monologues. <br /> <br /> Outside of the worthy turn of Jeremy Irons, I did not think there was a decent performance in the group. Pacino's Yiddish consists of a slight buzz that is added at the end of each pronouncement, and some of Shylock's best scenes are reduced to variations in the standard scene "Pacino gets angry" that his fans know and love. But Lynn Collins is totally embarrassing, to the point where I thought she would have been examined on screen from the beginning. When she goes incognito as a man, it's hard not to laugh at all the things we're not supposed to laugh at. With Joseph Fiennes standing up trying to sound sincere and complicated, it's hard not to make devastating comparisons with Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in "Shakespeare in Love." However, the big problem that cancels everything in this movie is the lack of emotional focus. It's really hard to know if this movie is trying to be a serious comedy or a strangely silly drama. Surely a good performance of summer stocks would generate more laughs from the material than this grim production. The actors seem embarrassed to try the humor and are not sure where to put the dramatic and comedic emphasis. All this is basically the fault of the director, Michael Radford, who seems to think that the material is much heavier than I think.
