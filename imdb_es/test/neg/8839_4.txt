Lone Star Productions sure produced them in the 1930s, and "Star Packer" has the feeling of being one of the most rushed. John Wayne is US Marshal John Travers, who investigates a twisted tumult known only as "The Shadow", responsible for cattle rustling, robberies on stage and the like, and gives orders from behind the door of a box of false security. Yakima Canutt is the faithful Indian companion of Travers, appropriately named as ... well, "Yak". <br /> <br /> At first, we discovered that Matt Matlock (George Pre-Gabby Hayes, head of the Cattlemens Union) is really The Shadow; The draw is when she offers to buy half of the Matlock Ranch from her supposed niece Anita, since "this is no place for a girl". As Anita, Verna Hillie does not have much to do in the movie, although in a comical moment, she uses a six-shot shooter to hit the butt of one of the villains in a scary incursion at night. <br /> <In the film there are some curiosities: on the one hand, the Wayne character alternately mounts a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film. In what might have been a clean device, a hollow tree stump used by a henchman is located right in the middle of the street. And, finally, the film does not live up to its name, since Sheriff Travers never uses a badge throughout the film, that is, a packaging star without a star. <br /> <br /> The pursuit of horses, the fugitive The scenes of the stage, the diligence of the cliff (another curiosity, the horses that escape from the stage) are pretty standard things. But fans of John Wayne will want to see him because of the charisma he showed at the beginning of his career. For those who are more critical, the white handkerchiefs worn around the forehead by the gang of the good guy could only mean that everyone had a headache.
