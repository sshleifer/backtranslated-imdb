I rented this by accident. I raised the video, looked back and thought "Blair Witch, an unscrupulous scam". Then, in a moment of carelessness, I grabbed 'The Francisville Experiment' thinking it was something else. My horror at arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more frightening than anything else this film could offer. The boring characters, the bad acting and the feeling of "we saw the Project of the witch of Blair and we could do the same", impregnate the action to the point where looking forward will take you directly to the credits. I am not entirely guilty of the filmmakers for being lazy or desperate, but after this great party I felt the need to warn everyone: do not waste your time, you have a life.
