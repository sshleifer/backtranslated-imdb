Who is responsible for these things "behind the scenes"? Who are these actors? Did they come out from under the rocks? 'Yuks, many yuks!' do not. no yuks for me I only detest and ashamed that I am a human being. I have to take my eyes off the set, it's so embarrassing. In fact, I changed the channel. <br /> <br /> I've always had a problem with Robin 'Williams' non-stop'. I forgot my lithium litigation today, but at least it's fun once in the blue moon. to see someone who is not funny at all imitating robin williams is like having every tooth on your head stretched slowly and sadistically, without novocaine, for all eternity. <br /> <br /> Please, stop making these TV movies absolutely horrifying. Please.
