Well, I like to see B-Movies bad horror, because I think it's interesting to see the stupidity and inability of the creators to shoot a really good movie. (I always compare these films with, for example, some works by Spielberg and again and again I do not understand the great difference in what I see). I like Ed Wood's films because she's so inept that she's very funny. But people!!! "The Chilling" is not fun and is not even "interesting". It is extremely boring horror movie without NOTHING, which makes even bad movies can be seen. There is no acting, no script, no direction, no emotions, not even blood. It's a very inept amateur movie. It's definitely the WORST movie I've seen (and I've seen many of the "worst movies", believe me). I warned you !!! 1/10
