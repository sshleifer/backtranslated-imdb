Now I know why this movie can be bought for such a low price in video stores. I was curious, since I had three renowned stars, but I was among the 'B' movies that the video apparently can not even give away! The answer is that it is a movie that would attract a very limited audience: a crowd of more than 50 with very liberal sensibilities. <br /> <br /> Those who see Robert Redford the most, Willem Dafoe and Helen Mirren essentially give a basic message that "cheating on your wife is fine as long as you still love her." That's the nice "feel-good message" here, particularly at the end of this strange story of kidnapping. Who wrote this script ... Bill Clinton? <br /> <br /> I say "strange" because the kidnapper is the best kidnapper (Dafoe) you've seen, except at the end. Freed his hostage (Redford) frequently, which no kidnapper would risk, has informal conversations about family matters, etc. Everything is ridiculous! Well, the L.A. Times says it's "an intelligent thriller." LOL. Well, that confirms what most people know about L.A. Times. For those of you who believe that, and have not seen it, I will not spoil it with more of the gigantic holes in this story, particularly in the end. The fact is that it is an insult to anyone with intelligence. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you can not fool all the people all the time, since critics have yet to discover it. Here is another movie that they promoted that, justifiably, bombed at the box office and the video store.
