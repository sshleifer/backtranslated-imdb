I did not read any reviews of this movie in IMDb before seeing it because I really wanted to see it and decide. I've been a big fan of QT in the past, I think we can all agree that he has made some great movies, but lately he seems to have been overcome by his own mystique and disappeared on his own foundation. This "movie" proves that. It consists of some scenes of the Basterds at work. Instead, it consists mainly of long, tedious and boring sections of conversation between people who, after a while, realize that you simply do not realize anything. It is slow and lacks any of the great sparkling dialogues that QT has been responsible for in the past. The whole movie is anticlimactic. There is no tension: what is going to happen in each scene is telegraphed so clearly beforehand that, at the moment it happens, you simply do not care. Sincerely, friends, do not believe in the hype. This is a very boring movie and you will not miss anything if you do not see it.
