I saw tricks a few years ago with my friend. He promoted it as a great funny movie that is one of the best comedies in history. I think he was in the crack or something. I recently learned that this movie did not premiere in theaters, I can perfectly understand why. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves a group of kids who cheat on almost all their homework at school to get good grades. That is the main problem of this film, is that morality is bad. There are other comedy movies for teens in which students do bad things, but they are often things that do not take place in school. So I think the concept of having a full movie that basically makes kids cheat is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I did not like the characters in this movie either. The main character is a completely presumptuous arrogant idiot who is not a good protagonist. Actually, I'm not sure if you could say that there is a protagonist due to the fact that everyone is cheating at school, which is wrong. The other supporting characters were not fun at all and, basically, the cast of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad message and even worse acting and characters. There are other movies for teenagers that are much better than this movie. So you do not have to see this and that's good because I do not recommend this movie at all.
