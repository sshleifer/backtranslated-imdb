Jesus Franco is quite successful or not in his films and I would say that this was a fault, that is, unless you are in total sordidness. I will say that the man has a good eye for a good shot, even if it is about topless women with machine guns cut against the ocean. In general, this is pretty ridiculous and the acting is horrible, but acting is the least of what it is. And what is it about? Well, it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism, women picking and shoveling in the hot sun for no apparent reason, and almost as much sleaze as you can handle and maybe something else. The most remarkable (?) Is a scene involving a young woman who is tied to a chair and a seemingly loving German shepherd, and although what is happening is simply implied (fortunately) it is probably a scenario that could have been done without him . I would classify it there with Tender Flesh as one of Franco's films that I would rather not have in my collection, although the music is jazzy and fun. 4 out of 10, yecch.
