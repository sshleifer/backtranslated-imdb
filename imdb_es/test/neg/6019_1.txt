Why the poster and the illustrations say that "Clubbed is one of the best indie films in the UK I've seen in a long time? SCREEN INTERNATIONAL" when it was a quote from the French distributor REPORTED by Screen International (a commercial publication by influential movies). Visit www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=39811 which says: <br /> <br /> "Pretty Pictures has acquired all French-speaking rights from Neil Thompson's Clubbed ... James Velaise, President of Pretty Pictures, said: "Clubbed is one of the best indie movies in the UK I've seen in a long time." "<br /> <br /> Is not this something misleading? The distributor is obliged to say that it is good. Are the other real dates?
