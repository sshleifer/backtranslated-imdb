The movie had finished half before I could figure out what was going on. It's a dog's breakfast from a movie about four family Thanksgiving dinners. Clich√©s and stereotypes fall on each other. When everything is more than ten hours later, well, it seems like ten hours, you're baffling what it was about. I do not want to see a movie about fights at the table. There's enough of that in my own family. The turkeys looked pretty good. The rest gave me indigestion.
