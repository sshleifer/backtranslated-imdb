It is really a pity that IMDb does not allow you to give negative votes. This is the most horribly frightening spectacle ever imposed on the American public by our northern neighbors who are usually nice. The parents are a troglodyte and a neurotic witch. It is as charming as a well-used fire hydrant, with the same standards of hygiene. It's a wax museum mannequin programmed with more neurosis than the entire cast of THE VIEW. Children are not entities if they are women and repulsive beyond what is believed if they are men, especially the title character. The boy is a serious contender for the most incredibly satisfied, self-satisfied, arrogant and vain Disney male character who is saying something. This show was obviously conceived as the anti-BRADY BUNCH, but it is revealed as the anti-Christ. And why is photography so dark?
