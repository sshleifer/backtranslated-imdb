This was one of the most ingenious, tedious and clich√© movies I've seen ... and, yes, I've seen Pearl Harbor. Even the likes of Gina McKee could not get out of the atrocious dialogue. It has been described as 'house of art', this can only be a euphemism for the bored, the frightening and, frankly, the art. Why is it that when a film lacks plot, critics feel that it deserves to be called art? But much more disconcerting, why did America love him? Without you, this movie would have stayed on the shelf where, perhaps, it belonged.
