I saw this at my local supermarket and I knew Debra was in it, so I decided to buy it (in support of that sexy woman!) The plot and acting in this movie were terrible (with the exception of Debra Wilson) and not only I say because I love her, she was really the only actress or actress who had some emotion in her performance and voice.What I did not understand at the beginning is why the wife did not return her car instead of running like this ... It was so stupid And it's LA (NOBODY saw her kidnapped in a public and residential street - NO ONE ... yes, that's realistic!) Also in the park, when Charlie stole the woman's cell phone (for some stupid reason) in the that they were bent on finding him (and at one point) when they did, they had him at gunpoint, on a cell phone! Actually, I doubt that the LAPD got out of his way like that for a stupid cell phone! lady could have walked to one of many of those booths telephones and replace it! The children's acting skills also sucked (I think they were reading from a reference card or had someone off camera whisper their lines) because they were asked questions and looked around and then answered with a questionable voice (that is, "yes, I do". Miss Daddy? ") Also how could all those snipers be in the trees and in the roofs in Los Angeles without being seen? I see that this is played at 3 AM in the US <br /> <br / > Debra Wilson fans will enjoy her part, she is the only actress with real acting skills (Debra, darling, stop making these cheap D grades, directly to the video movies ... maybe that will change with the next one movie Whitepaddy.) She puts some jokes there (like when one of her superiors comes up and asks who she's talking to, she screams at her computer and says "Damn, Charlie!") I gave her a 4/10 .. a 4 just for the good acting skills of Debra.
