I'm glad I did not pay to see 'The Wog Boy'. <br /> <br /> I sat there waiting for something original and / or fun to happen. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of a lot of those predictable English comedies of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> I will not bother with a synopsis of the plot, I suggest you do something else for 90 minutes < br /> <br />
