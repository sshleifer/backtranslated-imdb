I am very diplomatic in my criticism and, as an academic writer, I try to give a creative license to television writers who try to explain a real story. This story, about Karen Carpenter, could have helped many, but because of the direction and editing, no. <br /> <br /> The story, in this case, is not fully addressed, unless one reads psychological journals. While Cynthia Gibb plays a realistic Karen, it is sad that it has been published so much ... Louise Fletcher plays her mother and does an excellent job, with limited material and dialogue. In this case, I give credit to the actors for surviving this project. <br /> <br /> Why is the audience not allowed to see the causality factors? ... The American audiences are quite intelligent, and if they have cable, they are generally educated. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think I could have written a better story, I would not have edited the truth and allowed the actors to project reality. <br /> <br /> Richard Carpenter, As a director, has seriously underestimated and insulted American audiences. Karen's story is important, and it's sad that we never hear it.
