I just can not see what everyone sees in this movie. The acting is just horrible, the choice of music is, in a few words, peculiar, there are not enough fight scenes, the plot is nonexistent and any small entertainment that one can get from this movie is ruined by the annoying way in which part of the movie It's filmed and it gives you a divided head.
