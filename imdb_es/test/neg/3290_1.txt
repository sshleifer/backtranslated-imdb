How is this in this day and age, people are still foolish enough to think that other foolish things are smart? Maybe silly people like to look at things that make them feel smart. Such as 'War at home'. 'Cuss is even more foolish than the silly people who look at him. There are no jokes, only half jokes and light jokes that hardly deserve a little internal smile. The performance is the type of typical quotes, little subtle, idiots and situation comedy. And why, oh, why did this shit replace the stopped development? Well, you have to give it to Fox. They know they need to have stupid programs to attract all the stupid spectators. You see, the reason Arrested Development was not hugely popular was because it was so smart. She was so smart that she made silly people feel bad for being so stupid. And, of course, if a foolish person meets an intelligent person, the foolish person will hate the intelligent person. Most of the time, in any way. Either that, or try to get away from the intelligent person. If you like this show and you are one of the dumb people, I really can not understand how it must be to not have your eyes open and your minds open. I can not understand what it must be like to be a senseless person, laughing at drones, influenced by every little thing. Basically, people who laugh with a laugh are parrots. Parrots trained, obedient, mindless. Maybe I should not insult the parrots by comparing them to you. You know who you are. (If I look like a bastard * in this review, it's because I'm very upset about the cancellation of AD).
