An incredibly beautiful Charlotte Lewis plays a woman who is terrified by ghosts who torment her on the phone. Directed to the limit of terror, Charlotte is forced to face this chilling mystery to save her sanity and her life. I can not believe that Ruggero Deodato, the director behind "Ultimo Mondo Cannibale", "Cannibal Holocaust" and "House on the Edge of the Park" directed this absurd piece of garbage. the story is painfully stupid. The script of Franco Ferrini is ridiculous and it does not make sense, the performance is bad and there is absolutely no suspense. The scene in which a possible Charlotte Lewis rapist is murdered by coins expelled from a subway phone is more than laughable. Do not waste your time with this piece of garbage. There are much better Italian horror movies out there!
