What a pity that a good talent is wasted. This is a tedious and overly self-conscious film, which could tell your story in half the time. Is that Derek Jacobi under that beard doing two papers? Wow, I would have guessed. <br /> <br /> The emotional reward at the end was weak and unsatisfactory. Certainly not worth the cushioned length of the film for. I felt quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> The sound was terrible. First, they used stock music. Second, it was so strong during the dialogue, that the words were difficult to understand. Only three sound equipment, and one apprentice? There were more people included in the credits, either accounting or legal. <br /> <br /> Part of the camera work was pretty good, and the actors did a good job with a mediocre script. <br /> <br /> It's not a good use of viewing time, at least for me.
