I would have liked to put 0.5 but unfortunately I can not. Who can write such bad scripts (I watched the movie for five seconds and knew that the "bad boy" would be Sutherland, who would have to pay his taxes, when he saw how good it was in the Redford movie, "ordinary people" and others! -). <br /> <br /> Although I do not like it, but I had no choice, I saw the film in French, but I know that listening to the real voices of Sheen, Sutherland and Hamilton would not have changed things, except maybe making it more unfortunate . <br /> <br /> What makes me sick is that people make a living doing these bad things (I forgot to talk about Mr. Waterson, far from the Woody Allen movies he used to play.). <br /> <br /> We had another movie on another French channel: a fool James Bond with Brosnan (I'm not talking about the real Bonds with Connery (please it's the end of the holidays, wake up!).
