"The King is Alive" is a mess of a defective and artificial film that presents itself as an excuse for an indulgent auteur to transport a group of actors to a desert abandoned by God in Namibia, where he can play a great Dogme-dome and filming his egoistically conceived. Silly, exaggerated drama with total disregard for the real forces of human nature, the attractiveness of the market, common sense and even good art. In other words, this is a stupid movie and if you do not believe that, your penance is watching it. Only for movie heads, critics, dilettantes and similar. (RE)
