This disaster film is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is located right next to the Pacific Ring of Fire (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of the plate tectonics, whose displacement will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a Japanese term in itself for the tidal wave). Naturally, this makes it a natural premise for a disaster image, such as Hollywood's with a field day with films like Armageddon, Deep Impact, and most recently, The Day After Tomorrow, which addresses how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters that go crazy. The world. <br /> <br /> But I must say this: The Sinking of Japan makes all the films mentioned above look like classics. This disaster film is a disaster, and a massive one. Having to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a sign that the movie does not get involved, and it feels like I've exceeded the execution time. <br /> <br /> Special effects are great to watch. From the satellite images of outer space to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can affect the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. However, having spectacular computer-generated graphics does not make a movie acceptable, since it's a big deal just plain boredom. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the trailer where the effects and specific scenes of chaos and chaos attract you, then yes, in fact those scenes are just that. There are no details, and everything is seen from afar, in a way similar to God. Things happen like that on the screen, without an attempt to dig deeper to see the problems up close. It's similar to Godzilla tearing down buildings, and it's as if there were no human or loss of life through that one act. As morbid as it may seem, show us the victims! A populous nation like Japan not only suffers one disaster after another with an extremely low death count, not when filmmakers unleash chaos on such an epic scale. <br /> <br /> Trying to weave a romance in the movie, It stood out as a sore thumb. There are many characters in the film, but each one of them lacks real characteristics, or humanity, and they look like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and definitely very rigid and unconvincing. Heroes get stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements, instructions and forms policies, and react to incidents as if it were a computer game, all solved with the push of a button. These are characters that do not give any importance. <br /> <br /> If I can use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, while there are terrible effects, at least there is an attempt to provide a microscope. View of the whole disaster from different individual points of view. And infused inside there are many sequences of action, great as disasters, and small focused on the triumph of the human spirit, which make it relatively convincing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan This movie should preferably be one to sink and a tank, and hopefully suffer a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better things.
