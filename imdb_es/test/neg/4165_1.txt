At the beginning I was excited about this film and I expected it to be a combination of Equilibruim and Farenheit 451. Unfortunately, I was continually disappointed by the lack of depth and interest of the plot and the subplots. Halfway through the movie, I realized I was making fun of the characters and the sets to avoid having to turn them off. I enjoyed the premise of a future with fused cultures and the separation of those who have and those who do not. What could have been an ingenious and intelligent look into the future is transformed into a semantic and compassionate semantic film from the SciFi channel with a horrible performance, cheap scenes and a final free take from Tim Robbins' vagina. Maybe he should stick to his socialist political discourse: everything has been downhill since Shawshank.
