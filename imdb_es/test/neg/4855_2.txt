Although this film has had many compliments, I personally found it boring. There are some beautiful Brazilian sunsets and the characters are believable, but the story of how they interrelate, although very unusual by our standards, is not interesting enough to hold a movie for so long. The central woman takes one man after another in a very united way and puts the interests of her children before her. As the tolerance of the various men stretches, we see that their characters develop. The story unfolds with dignity and with the help of an excellent performance. It's a rare look at the Brazilian interior, far from the city, but not exciting enough to keep your eyes open.
