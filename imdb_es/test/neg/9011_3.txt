This movie has a pretty decent premise, one that appears frighteningly again and again in science fiction movies, most spectacularly in "Alien", and some decent performances of "he-man" of the male cast. The wife of the astronaut possessed, for me, is the weak link in the set: she does not seem to know what to do with her face in many of her most outstanding scenes, which is why I blame the director Corman. <br /> <br /> Given a decent budget for accessories and special effects and a more focused and consistent screen game, "Blood Beast" could have been pretty decent. But the inherent low cost of the production design and continuity and fault errors undermine the procedures. For example, each time he saw the astronaut in a coma lying on an "examination table" the width of an ironing board, he would giggle, probably not the emotion the crew wanted to invoke. And the monster's suit needed a serious job; Parrots covered in ferns are simply not scary or convincing. <br /> <br /> Even so, the premise was strong enough for me to cling to the end just to see how the plot would be solved, and the alien's motives were ambiguous enough at first I thought it was a enigma. And the scene with the shot of the murdered scientist had a bit of strength, along with the development of the plot where the alien claimed to have assimilated something of the personality of the dead man. <br /> <br /> It's Corman. It's cheap, fast and slightly visible if you do not think too much or wait too long. What more needs to be said?
