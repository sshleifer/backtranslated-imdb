Yes, that is true. That movie is a horrible piece of ... you know what. Almost all fans of Sapkowski books in Poland think the same. The truth is that Polish cinematography can not afford to produce fantasy movies. It's a shame when you compare "Wiedzmin" and "Conan the Barbarian" for example. I hope that no one outside of Poland sees this nightmare.
