The third and last big screen is clear from the very popular ITV comedy of the early 70s, HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES is as tough and tough as the two previous efforts, and observing from a point of view three and a half decades later, is It's really amazing that even a movie has been produced in this franchise. <br /> <br /> What constitutes the plot surrounds the adventures of Stan Butler (Reg Varney), his director Jack (Bob Grant) and his clumsy and autocratic Inspector Blake (Stephen Lewis) after his dismissal from his regular jobs at the bus station. Everyone finds work in similar positions in a holiday camp with Stan's family (Doris Hare, Anna Karen, Michael Robbins) who follow him. <br /> <br /> British cinema had a deserved and considerable reputation for its high quality in the 1960s, but much of this was due to American financial support and guidance, which unfortunately came to an end when the 1970s. Since then, notable local titles (GET CARTER is one of these very few exctions) became as rare as Mick Jagger in a stable marriage, and UK cinema followed the path of cheap budgets, the sordid and witty sex comedies (the series CONFESSIONS, COME PLAY WITH ME) and the flabby and elongated celluloid versions of several television shows, mostly comedies (this is one of the many horrible examples). Only DAD'S ARMY and PORRIDGE came out quite respectable in this regard: the peculiar success of ON THE BUSES 'first film (it was the biggest blockbuster of its year in 1971, it's absurd to think now!) Led to two other sequels. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the television series itself had a cheerful, mature and PC-less vulgarity, which was reasonably tolerable in the form of a half-hour comedy. , but extended to three times that length, weighs more patience. It is ironic that HAMMER FILMS has produced this effort, since it practically resembles a horror movie in the literal sense, with old puns, threshing, badly synchronized slapstick and horrible production. values. <br /> <br /> An opportunity to send the quesina The part of the British holiday camp is totally wasted here in favor of the previous elements, and it is more strange, if not frightening, to see Varney, obviously 50 years old, and Grant, with a long nose and long teeth, who manages to charm young people instantly. The women were barely in their twenties, laughing constantly at their own boasting and boring jokes. The presence of Wilfrid Brambell (from STEPTOE AND SON) who makes an affair with the old Miss Hare does not help either, and although the film lasts about 1 year. half an hour, it lasts to an endless and depressing degree. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this was the last movie in this most terrible movie trilogy, and the television series came to an end almost at the same time, with a sequel (DO NOT DRINK THE WATER, which was wildly ruined by criticism and ignored by the public) that followed in 1975. Most of the main actors involved were not seen much later, but Bob Grant was the most affected. Other mental problems for many years, he says. He committed suicide in 2003. A sad episode of a comedy that was the most popular of his time (he has not aged too well either), and should have stayed that way, instead of the three big-screen hybrids financially successful but artistically desperate that were diluted the happy memories and the occasional merits of his television counterpart. <br /> <br /> GRADING: 2 and a half out of 10.
