What about this movie? A married couple has more than just one other. After playing for a while things get more serious. A difficult choice must be made: continue the previous situation or start again following the heart. Guess what happens at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be very low budget. But a good story does not have to be expensive. It seems a work that has become a movie only by using several cheap places (at least very few people visible) more than just the stage, in this the house. From the first minute, future developments are as clear as water. Nothing unexpected happens. Sometimes you can think about watching a soft porn movie, in which case you know in advance that there is no story. <br /> <br /> I find this movie disappointing, so that explains the vote (4).
