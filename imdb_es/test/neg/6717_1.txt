I think this movie was done backwards, first they recorded a lot of scenes and action, and explosions, and then the story writers went to work trying to find a story to unite all the scenes. This movie is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen in my life. Your average porn movie comes with a much better written script and much more coherent. The movie does NOT make sense. Seriously, even if you're a Segal fan, there's no reason why you NEVER want to see this movie, except if you're one of those people who like to look at accidents, because it's a horrible accident, and they should never have been thrown in this world. <br /> <br /> Boran.
