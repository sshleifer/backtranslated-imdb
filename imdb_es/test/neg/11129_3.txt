What a boring movie. While it had humorous parts, it was just boring and long (for a 90-minute movie). I think the cause was the lack of action. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I expected to see the white blood cells fight the malignant viruses, but not so much luck. It was more that the virus was frustrated than defeated. <br /> <br /> The film had a promise, but from my point of view, intended for young children, it did not have its potential.
