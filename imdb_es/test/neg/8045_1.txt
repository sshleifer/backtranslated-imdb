COC had its moments. I enjoyed the action sequences, but I despised the script and the plot. I hate this movie so much, I'll just write about the stupidest part. First, the plot would never happen. Second, the desolation of the Chinese president was out of place. That would never happen. Finally, the dialogue. Employing non-Chinese actors to interpret Chinese roles is understandable, but writing a dialogue for them that is TOTALLY DISABLED is silly. For those of you who understood the Chinese in the movie, you know what I mean.
