Where the hell did VH1 find the scriptwriter for this movie? Out of high school? This movie tries to be very understanding with Michael Jackson, but instead, it makes for a horrible and sticky caricature. All the lines are full of clich√©s, but surprisingly the performance was not bad. As always, this is a bad movie with very good actors. The actor who plays Michael Jackson, heavens, I'm sorry for him! I think he did the best he could with the weak script. I did not care that Flex did not look like Michael Jackson, I thought he did the best he could, but later, when he put on all that white makeup, oh, he looked awful! The other actors who played Debbie Rowe, Priscilla Presley and Elizabeth Taylor were pretty good. Except that the actress who plays Liz Taylor seemed too young and healthy to play Liz. The actress who plays Diana Ross was nothing like her and I could not find out who this woman was until much later in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie hurts everyone who is. On the side of Michael Jackson, or against Michael Jackson. It does nothing to change anyone's opinion. In fact, the only opinion that someone will have after watching this movie is: My God, this movie is really, really sucks! And where the hell is the wonderful music and songs of Michael Jackson? There is none that is found in this movie. Anyway, I love the soundtrack of this movie and I'll probably buy it if I could. <br /> <br /> On the lighter side, this is a very funny and funny movie! It is a great waste of time if you want to see something light that does not bother your brain too much. I'll probably see it again, because it's so entertaining!
