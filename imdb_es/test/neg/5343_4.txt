As a writing teacher, there are two endings that I never allow my students to use: "Then I woke up" and "Then I got hit by a truck". Now I will add: "Then I have a blow to the head". I feel it is completely unfair to use these tricks to cover the lack of imagination. The whole issue of transmigration could have been handled with some intelligence and skill, but, in this film, they could not or did not want to do that. I'm not saying it's totally useless, but it's so predictable in its progress, except for the stupid ending. There are even gang members who go to the police to get help of this type. They should have done it immediately. It's just a forgettable horror / science fiction movie, with nothing new to offer.
