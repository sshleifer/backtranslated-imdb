It opens, and for half an hour, it works, like an educational program on the Old Testament, although not without humor. The film finally begins to grow wings when the biblical song falls. In a scene of mixed success, Martin Donovan (Jesus) decides to give up starting the Apocalypse and the last quarter of an hour is a kind of humanist "what is this all about?" Play-out, gilded with optimistic conjectures against a retrospective and miserably ironic takeover of the twin towers of the WTC. <br /> <br /> In addition to Donovan's authority, the performance is divided. There is the theatrical melodrama of the rest of the cast: this, although formally created for the biblical presentation, is appropriate for the modern and paranoid comedy to which Hartley points. But I was also pleasantly surprised by the contribution of PJ Harvey (credited in this way, and in danger of existing within the film only as the pop star entity that is, not least in a set scene in a record store and a band sounds dangerously patched for what it contributes). She kept cool, a kind of inattentive lack of attention, as many pop icons that have filmed have done (I'm thinking of the Jagger of Performance here), but still maintain a convincing integration with both the cast and the project . <Br /> <br /> Lately affirmative, but this bittersweet essay is too similar to one and is based more on perseverance than on the imagination of its audience. 4/10
