As you remember, it seems that I have seen the three trilogies of garbage and the first movie is the only one that can be seen remotely. The second part was about low-grade wastewater and this fee is a little better than two, but it's still a steaming pile of something I pulled out of my yard last Monday. The premise does not make sense, why did the murderers of the moon murder that poor old woman and even in 1921 I think someone would notice a group of oily types where once lived a sweet old woman? Second, that scarecrow is pathetic compared to how good they looked in the first movie. It's just old clothes and a burlap sack. Let's face it, the series is garbage and must be forgotten. Nose
