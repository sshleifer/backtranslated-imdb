The author of "Prince" manages to take an excellent cast, a decent story, a mediocre script and carefully assemble them in a boring, monotonous and amateur mess. Despite a strong central performance by Frank Nasso, the Prince, this disconnected film wanders aimlessly from scene to scene, disintegrating painfully in hashish. The result brings a sigh of relief to the end where the tears of joy should be. A sad waste of time and talent and a good example of how NOT to direct a film. <br /> <br />
