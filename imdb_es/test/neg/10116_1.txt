It's hard and I did not expect it ... But it's really the worst movie we saw, my wife and me. Terrible dialogues that extend incomprehensibly through time for no apparent reason, except to complete the time. Does not the narrative follow a comprehensible and intelligible form? everything is a disaster Action and dialogues appear in the jumps. What disappointed me the most was seeing Dominique Pinon, one of my favorite French actors involved in this. uh ?? I do not even know how to describe it without being polite. The rest of the actors were the poorest. Susan Paterno made a terrible interpretation of her character, making a flat and inexpressive interpretation. Poor special effects. I do not think it was a complete waste of film but it's close to ?? If I have to say that I would advise everyone not to watch this movie. I think it would be a complete waste of time. Honestly, I never thought to say something like that about a movie, but? There is always a first time.
