The lives of Megan (Jackie Kresler) and Dylan (Shane Elliott) change in the Nevada desert between Reno and Las Vegas. They stop to eat in a small, greasy spoon where they reluctantly learn about the infamous Area 51 of the coffee owner (Jonathan Breck). After getting back on the road in his forty-year-old Lincoln, the radio got a little crazy transmitting Hitler's speech at the 1836 Olympic Games and then, in 1958, a newsletter from Elvis Presley in the army. The car slowly decomposes and the two are scared, as mysterious and inexplicable things happen in the lonely desert poisoned by radiation; remnants of nuclear tests. Megan meets a lost girl (Channing Nichols) and a wounded soldier from World War II. The nightmarish journey does not end there. Kresler is impressive so far and writer / director James Lay makes good use of the Patsy Cline tunes. In short, moderately interesting science fiction.
