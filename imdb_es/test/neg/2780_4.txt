Dark Harvest is a very low budget production made by a group of amateur amateurs that manages to emerge as a kind of semi-professional film. Unfortunately, the bad effects, the wood acting and the unoriginal story make this a very mediocre terror slasher at best. No way is Dark Harvest the worst horror movie I've seen in my life, it's just nothing special and has nothing to justify a second watch or the hope of a sequel. You know a director has doubts about his own horror movie when a) there's a bit of meaningless nudity and b) the movie is so short that it adds some boring shots in the final credits that nobody really cares about because the movie does not It was so good A film a little better that I can not help but feel was the inspiration for Dark Harvest, it's the movie of the eighties 'Scarecrows', which is a good movie but still quite normal. <br /> <br /> Dark Harvest is not as bad as some of the other comments say it is, but do not think it will entertain you too much. One thing I also have to comment on is the character of Angela who has a really terrible English accent! What was the point in that? Maybe give it a touch of class? Yeah sure! The English do NOT say "WAAHTAAH" when they mean "water" and I do not care what part of England they are. If you can not find a genuine English actress or a non-English actress who can put a bright English accent (not many of them), DO NOT DO IT ANYMORE! Sheesh! Final score: 4/10
