Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known, at least in his native land, for his Japanese gangster films, a series with which this film shares several characteristics. Violence and political intrigue are themes throughout Shogun's Samurai and Battles Without Honor and Humanity, and both feature a main character who finds his allegiance challenged by betrayals. Both films also feature a large number of characters that seem to have little purpose other than to die, and since there is very little to develop them, their deaths have little impact when they arrive. This movie also has other flaws. The makeup, costumes and sound design are disturbing, and the battle scenes were also deficient, inferior to other samurai movies of previous years (Seven Samurai comes to mind). <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba plays the character of Sonny Chiba in Shogun's Samurai, the masterful master swordsman who walks through the film, frowning menacingly. What a boy; He even puts a patch on his eye. If you expected to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune, you may feel disappointed; his appearance is little more than a cameo, and just when it seems that his character can do something interesting, it disappears forever. <br /> <br /> In general, the strengths of the film are its history, which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films, and the challenges posed to the traditional concepts of good and evil. Two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently deceased father, who may have had some help in his departure. At first, it seems that we will face a couple of characters that could not be more clearly good and bad; After all, the older brother stutters and has a birthmark, the sure sign of a villain. Eventually, however, it becomes clear that in a struggle for the power of the winner it takes everything, there are no heroes and villains, only winners and losers.
