I approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst movies in history. I sat down to see him with this mentality and I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> It's not great. It's not even that good; In fact, it is quite poor. However, it is not as bad as I had been led to believe, by far. It is quite inept and, evidently, as a measure of cost reduction, a large amount of archival material is put into service, many of which have no apparent relation to the narrative. <br /> <br /> What it is, however, is an intensely personal film made by a man who obviously did not have the skills or funds to do justice to his idea. Before discounting _Glen or Glenda? _ From the hands, examine your own artistic abilities. I would love to be able to draw, but anything I try to draw comes out as male men. I would love to be able to sing, but all I do is scare young children. <br /> <br /> Wood had an idea, and unfortunately he did not have what it took to make it work. However, this was an incredibly daring movie for the Puritans of the 50s, although at first sight it seems exploitative or incoherent.
