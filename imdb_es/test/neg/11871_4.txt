Let's clarify one thing: I really like the work of Snipes. Unlike his other high-level contemporaries (Seagal and Van Damme), he can act. This film, however, does little to improve its reputation; It is not exactly unappealable, but I'm not in a hurry to see it again. In fact, if I never saw it again, it would not bother me, there are just a lot of better movies to waste! It's a shame because with a little imagination and some subtle changes, this could have been a worthwhile movie. Instead, the director has chosen to almost try to repress his audience so that he submits with too much violence and very little characterization. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have is with the co-star of Snipes, Silvia. Colloca It baffles me that the producers of this film take the trouble to hire a beautiful and beautiful actress (for my money) and talented as Miss Colloca, and then they give her a pathetic one-dimensional character to play. If she was hired to simply add a bit of "glamor" to the movie, she does not even do it very well; There are no nudes in the film and there are no sex scenes worth mentioning. Strange, really. Given the amount of violence in this film, it baffles me why producers have adopted such a conservative attitude towards sex and nudity. Are we living in 2007 or in 1957? What the producers of this garbage (and probably also the actors) have forgotten is that movies must be fantasies. Like most of the inhabitants of this planet, my real life is very boring. I would love to chase the terrorists, be able to handle myself like Mr. Snipes and connect with a beautiful young woman like Miss Colloca. This movie does not satisfy any of those fantasies very well. Which is precisely why I'm giving a bad review!
