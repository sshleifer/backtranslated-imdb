The word "boring" appears all too often when it comes to how serious a low-budget horror movie might be or could not be. I've seen a lot of B-series movies. Many horrible B movies, terribly inept. Some with a production value of a few hundred dollars. The ineptitude, the bad performance, the worse continuity and shameful budgets make a film can not be seen? Some, no doubt, yes. Most of which are probably big fans of The Matrix. Well, I hate big budget movies, so I say no. Evil can sometimes be fun (Blood Freak), sometimes even mind-boggling (Troll 2), but Boring will always be incomprehensible ... Hey, a bit like Bloodchirsty Butchers, who reminds me that I'm writing a review for this pile of garbage ... uh, yes, anyway. This is one of the many alternatives of the late British director Andy Milligan to sleeping pills. This is based on Sweeney Todd ... Great. Milligan takes a boring story, and still manages to "kill" her. Hey, that's very funny, I said, I'm sorry, I'm distracted. This is not exactly easy. On second thought, I will make it easy. No gore, no fear, no entertainment, just nasty, annoying people who have incoherent conversations. That's Bloodchirsty Butchers. Oh yes, and something about a barber who kills people, and something about meat pies. I do not know, it's not important. <br /> <br /> For something a little more rewarding than Andy Milligan, there's always the only one I've seen, Rats come, werewolves are here. If you heard me But how do we forget this Milligan guy all together, and we pick up something sweet like Sick Girl or Teenape Goes To Camp. Whatever you decide, just know, butchers thirsting for blood stinks, possibly even more than any other version of this already dull tale. And that, fans of the B-movies, is really saying something. 2/10
