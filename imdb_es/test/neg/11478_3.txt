I saw this movie when it first came to theaters in 1988 and although I knew it was not of the award-winning caliber ... I liked it a little. Tells the story of 5 former puppies explorers who meet to take on the only task that children could never finish: climbing the mountain. Whitehead Of course, now the puppies explorers have grown and developed their personalities in different ways, but not as different as when they were children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still the beloved Abby of the group, and Tim Thomerson is still the group's surfer guy. Of course, the most successful star is Louie Anderson, a "true believer" in everything Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with his mother, he still checks the Cub Scout manual every day, he is brave, respectful and clean, and he is the one that gathers the others for a great adventure in Scouting. However, to complicate their task, there are the Grunski brothers, two thugs beaten by the Cub Scouts for the aforementioned. By coincidence, they run into their old lair and decide to harass them a little, even if it is harmless. Not so inoffensive three convicts who escaped, who think that package 7 is the FBI and intend to eliminate them. All in all, the movie still has a bit of charm. Watch Richard Lewis, for example, trying to feel comfortable in a folding crib, and have something really fun going for him. After an additional review, the whole movie needed more of that kind of observation humor. It does not hold up well after all these years, but it's still a guilty pleasure.
