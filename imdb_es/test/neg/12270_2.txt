Although I saw this movie on my own (thankfully), I still felt embarrassed while watching it. The reviews on the cover fooled me into renting it, and the photo cameras with blood / sand on the back, which made me believe it was a kind of documentary. These actors are ridiculous throughout the film, without being convincing. The story involves an Italian gang from Australia (?), Just fighting against other gangs, and then running, fighting, repeating. They are supposed to train extremely hard, which makes them much better than other gangs. For some reason, I do not think they can really hit some of these other guys that are twice the size. I could be wrong ... no, I'm not wrong, this movie is not nice at any level. The montage of the jail looked like a summer camp, except that instead of children, it was a festival of horrible actors sausages, just hanging out and laughing and trying to look hard. This movie is not worth your time, save money or throw it away, just do not waste it in this movie.
