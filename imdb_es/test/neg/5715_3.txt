It's nice to see Julie Andrews playing a direct dramatic role here, something she had not done in a long time, but her Judith character (wisely, they did not try to pass it off as 'Judy') has the old refinement Manners and scruffy fur of yesteryear, and Andrews plays "adults" like any other actress would interpret frigid. It's a surprisingly bland drama in Barbados involving Omar Sharif (he's not the liveliest protagonist in the world, not even in 1974!) Hoping to turn Andrews into a spy and at the same time slowly take her into the proverbial room. The unmemorable tour has something of camp value: the credits similar to James Bond at the beginning are funny. As for Julie: she is quiet and contemplative, but that does not do much for the audience or the movie. Blake Edwards walks from one place to another like a funeral. * since ****
