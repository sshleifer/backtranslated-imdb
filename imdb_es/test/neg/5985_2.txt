If this is the idea of ​​the author and the director of a part of life, they are manic depressants clinically. A sad movie, in a bad mood, at best, with ubiquitous, aimless and unhappy characters that interact negatively with disastrous results. This movie is cataloged as a comedy. What was so funny about losing his home to a premeditated arson or the forced rape of one of the protagonists by the drug. Is this art imitating life? Jack Black was a little funny like the mountain man, weed farmer. However, even this segment of the film was riddled with pathos. What was the point of living in the middle of nowhere with a retinue? If Black's character was so paranoid, why was he making acid with a group of people just outside of Woodstock? Is there no end to disconnected relationships, a script without plotting and transitions of scenes that lack cohesion or logical chronology?
