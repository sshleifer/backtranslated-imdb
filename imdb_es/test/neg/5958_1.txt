One of the latest films (about disasters) of York Entertainment, "The Chupacabra" stands out for making his viewer want to die after having spent two hours watching him. This movie seems to have been filmed with a spare camcorder that is usually used for birthday parties. The only reason I could see that it was not due to certain scenes where the cameraman's shadow is in the frame. <br /> <br /> Almost every aspect of cinema is plagued by this film, and I'm sure it has delayed the film industry for another ten years. The actors have a delay limit, they often stop while waiting for the card to change off-screen. The actor who plays Navarro not only spreads and jumps the word in his dialogue, but staggers through the line of the plot of Swiss cheese with a confused and confused look on his face. Other actors break the fourth wall and in general show the ability to act of a twelve-year-old boy who performs a science project in his backyard. <br /> <br /> My friends and I purposely searched for the worst possible movies, and this one gave us more than we expected. The funny parts are not funny and the rest is full of horrible clich√©s and plots. As a friend humbly expressed, this film is the aborted fetus of the industry. I highly recommend this movie for people like me who are deliberately looking for these films, but for all the others, beware!
