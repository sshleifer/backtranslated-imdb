Chip Foose is an absolute genius and the final result of the projects is really amazing. The co-hosts do a good job. I particularly enjoy watching the "project" come together. The final results are much better than when they left the assembly line with the mechanical and aesthetic advances of today. However, it bothers me a little the fact that the "projects" seem to be owned by the already rich and / or famous. It is a pity that the reviewers can afford the compromise. Let's see now, Vince Neill, of Motley Crew, gets the renewal of a car for his friend. Hello! If he (Neill) was a true friend, he would have paid to have his friend's car restored. What a joke! Another episode shows a middle-aged girl, apparently well off, who is doing her '56 caddy named Betsy. The husband of more than 30 years was behind everything. The couple seemed like money was not scarce. What a pity. I suppose that guys like me will have to save for the day that will never come. It turns out that I have a Chip of the Ford '53 project. Will someone choose me?
