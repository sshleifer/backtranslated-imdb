This movie was so badly performed. What was with Jeff Bridges accent, horrible and incredible. Was it supposed to be French, Scandinavian? The script was scarce. For the heroine to travel over her boyfriend's grave while fleeing the character of Jeff Bridges ... are you kidding? How convenient that Jeff brings his dirty shovel to the house after he disposes of bodies on his lawn. Do these people just do not believe in calling the police? Okay ... I'll get in the car with you, why not? DUH! Why was Bridge's daughter obsessed with making her father have an affair, is her mother so wicked or just bored? I did not see the original, it would be hard to make myself after watching this movie.
