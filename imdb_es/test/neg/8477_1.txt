The son of the mask is a terrible movie. I do not like the baby and I do not like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a nice couple, but that can not be exchanged for garbage. Even with only 88 minutes (or so he says), the movie could not finish soon enough for me. The only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by Ben Stain. That's. The rest is just a rehash of the first movie. Actually, that's just an insult to repeat. Why was this sequel made? This movie costs millions of dollars to make. Why would I sit in a movie with a baby and a dog intentionally trying to drive my father crazy? Jamie Kennedy has talent but he has nothing to do in this movie. I do not bother to be nice to this movie. 1/10
