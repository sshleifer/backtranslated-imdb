I'll be honest: the purple plane dotted with Snoop Dogg in command is a fun visual joke. It would have been a decent concept for a 30-second commercial, or maybe a 3-minute music video. But the producers have committed the old concept of comedy: the sin of stretching 30 seconds of material in an hour and a half of film, and the results are predictably scarce. The rest of the 89 minutes are full of the typical range of racist and sexist humor and jokes, offensive and, worst of all, painfully unpleasant. The threadbare plot screams under the weight of its contraptions. It is best to avoid it unless you are drunk or drugged.
