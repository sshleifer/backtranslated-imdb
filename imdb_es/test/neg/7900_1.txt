This movie was just horrible. How could someone like this movie, and for those who liked the jokes, should they look in the mirror and ask themselves if the stereotypes are not bad? Ignoring the face of racial stereotypes, this was just horrible. He never had his moments, if he paid tribute to the 1980s, "Plane!", He has to pay a little more. Horrible acting, terrible scriptwriting, even for a movie with Mo'Nique or Tom Arnold. This movie was bad from the beginning, but people could have seen all this, thinking that the plane would crash. One of the worst movies of all, stay away.
