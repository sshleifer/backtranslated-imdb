Can they be blamed for the director's choices? <br /> <br /> All I can say is ... <br /> <br /> Why was this done? <br /> <br /> Well, is not this a shame for the Korean-American film industry? <br /> <br /> Should we be selective about who we support? <br /> <br /> Am I being too hard? See for yourself.
