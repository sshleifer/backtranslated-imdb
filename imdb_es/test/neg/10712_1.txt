This has to be one of the worst movies that have been produced in the science fiction channel. This is how the movie begins. Women are the only people on this planet due to the fact that in the not too distant future the chemical warfare is A, as long as it is only addressed to the soldiers (in case you are asked, Men). Fires (great shock) and all men on earth die slowly. Then, all men are condemned to die when the president is killed by a man. Now that we are 60 to 70 years old, two scientists are working on the cloning of a baby and one of them says "Hey, why do not we bring the men back?" The other says no, the world is not ready for that, but he ignores it quickly and, therefore, a man returns to do the Eath. <br /> <br /> First, this film assumes that all men who are not genetically altered are blood. Thirsty monsters Second, the writer forgot to mention that today's soldiers are a good combination of male and female officers, so there is no real reason to have a virus like that. This is the biggest waist of time you can find. This movie managed to insult my intellect not only because of the bad story, but also because of the Lifetime style. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 in 10, but only because I can not go lower.
