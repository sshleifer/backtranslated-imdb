April enchanted was one of the last films of Harry Beaumont, after this he only directed some more. He had made the "Maisie" movies in the 1930s and 1940s. In the opening credits, he says "From Elizabeth's novel", and completely omits the author's last name ... quite strange, but since it was von Armin, it's Maybe they did not want the German association at that time ... It's sad to hear that it was a failure when it was launched, with names as funny as Frank Morgan (the Magician) and Jessie Ralph, who played WC The mother-in-law who disapproved of Fields in "Bank Dick." Two girls in London (Ann Harding and Katharine Alexander) decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends, but things do not go as planned. Reginald Owen plays the husband with multiple personalities. Apart from some funny moments, it moves pretty slow. Ralph is the only bright spot here, since it is the dominant type of charging, and the image is quite blurry and unfocused for much of the film. The opinions of Italy are all obvious funds. The only thing that is saved here is that the Turner Classic version only lasts 66 minutes. Too bad they did not give Frank Morgan a bigger role. This was remade in 1992 by the BBC as a British film.
