I have not laughed so much in a long time, or seen such an inept movie! We talked so badly that it made me laugh! <br /> <br /> First of all, I estimate that for about 40 percent of the duration of the movie, I could not say what was happening, not even what I was seeing. I can only describe the work of the camera when frenetic meets LSD. There are entire segments, minutes long, where all you can see are fuzzy flashes and fragments of the cave wall, people and other unidentifiable things. I spent half the movie asking my teenage daughters what was going on, but they could not follow her better than me. <br /> <br /> Then there are the "black" moments, when in an effort to scare us (woooooooo) the lights of all go out and the screen turns black, and I do not mean just for a few seconds. I think the longest lasted almost two minutes. I suppose the blank film is a way to keep costs down ... I suspect that the "director" had recently read a book about all the "must-haves" to make a scary movie, and decided to throw them all - about 20 times each. <br /> <br /> There are three good things about this movie: 1 / It's short in 90 minutes (although it's an hour and a half too long!) 2 / All The characters die (after all, it's impossible to worry for some of them). 3 / There was a really good scene: when the group was looking up the well, they went down, after discovering that their rope had fallen to the bottom (saw THAT coming), a large rock is pushed through the opening, sealing it . I WASN I expected it, and it was really chilling. <br /> <br /> And what happened with the first bonfire scenes with the shot, after the shot, after the shot from behind the camp lights. I swear the director used almost the same photo about 20 times in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure that after the first kill, the same EXACT amount of blood on the floor of the cave is used about twice. 90 seconds <br /> <br /> In short, a CRAP movie. I will observe almost anything, but this is close to where I would draw the line.
