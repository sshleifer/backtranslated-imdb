THE PROTECTOR. You hear the name. You think, "Oh, it's a fucking Hong Kong movie." Guess what, it's not Hong Kong. And yes, it's crap. Incredibly this stupid movie Jackie Chan, ruined by us, yes, Americans (I'm seething with anger, ooh, I think I'll skip that window!), you have to Chan as New York police chasing a gang, avenging the death of Your partner. It sounds good ... but it is not. Do not waste your money when renting it. To prove he could make a better cop movie, Chan made the incredible Police Story (1985).
