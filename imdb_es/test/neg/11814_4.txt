If you find the irremediably amateur action, the uninteresting story, the fake blood and all the senseless shots bearable, then you can have a good time watching this low-quality exploitation film. You may also want to see a good sequence of cat fights being offered, although it is not good enough to make the rest of the movie worthwhile. (**)
