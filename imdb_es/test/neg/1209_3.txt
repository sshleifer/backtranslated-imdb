It is hard to believe that such a bad movie was not produced once, but four times. Most movies require a certain 'suspension of reality' to enjoy, but this takes it too far. The basic scenario is an Air Force pilot who is shot down in a `Middle East 'country. The government of the United States is trying to recover it, which leads the Pilot's son (Doug Masters) to try a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with the movie is that it describes the US Air Force. UU Like a colossal joke. In the film you will find that Doug and his friends at the air base manage to secure two F-16s, all the ammunition, the fuel, the Intel for the mission, etc. Security on this basis seems to be a joke. Nobody seems to have the problem that a sixteen year old is completely qualified to fly an F-16! <br /> <br /> If that were not enough, one would think that the producers would at least try to get it. The ammunition is fine, since people like to see things "explode". Not so! Several times in the movie, Doug fires AIM-9 missiles at ground targets. AIM stands for 'Air interception missile', which means a weapon used to hit targets in the AIR. It also fires 15-20 missiles, where the maximum that an F-16 can contain is 6 AIM-9. The film also lacks continuity. You will see the aircraft configured with a set of ammunition, and in the next scene, you have a completely different pack of ammunition. Also, 20MM not only completely destroys what it touches! An F-16 will carry out 500 rounds of 20 mm, and is mainly used for self defense. <br /> <br /> I could continue forever with plot holes, faults and totally wrong information from the movie, but I won't get bored If you're in the mood to watch a good Air Force movie, your options are pretty slim . Most military films deal with the military, the navy or the marines. Until Hollywood can create an Air Force movie like "Saving Private Ryan" or "A Few Good Men", we will be forced to watch movies like the "Iron Eagle" series. <br /> <br />
