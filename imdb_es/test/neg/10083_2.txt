I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. Why is it that there are always more white women elected than black women? Each episode is always more white women than black women. As if he said that white women are more attractive than black women. I would like for once to see more black women and then white women. And not only your program is like that in many programs there are always more whites. but I would have thought that as the boss of the series you would see this for yourself and you would have more black women in your program. but you are like the rest trying to act as if you were so fair and nice. You are just a great false hypocrite.
