Yes, what did he expect? I thought this would be a movie about young adults at their turning point in life, something like "Sonnenallee" or "American Pie", which I really liked. I wanted to see a funny movie, maybe with an ironic look in the idyllic Wuerzburg. And what did I get? <br /> <br /> Attention, spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> This film begins with a long dialogue that gives a good indication of what will inevitably follow: longer dialogues. Sometimes I thought that Moritz Bleibtreu could have forgotten his text and try to hide that fact by improvising and simply repeating what he said before. But since I think of Bleibtreu as one of the best German actors, I think this effect was really intentional. I think the author wanted to show how boring it can be to talk to close friends, especially when they are drugged. But, in reality, I do not need the cinema to get bored with the conversations of drugged friends. The boring dialogues make up most of this movie. <br /> <br /> But it's okay, that's one thing. I can deal with that, I've seen good movies with abominable dialogues, just think about the work of Schwarzenegger's life. But the next thing is that the characters are cheap and flat and that the story is as predictable as anything else. Just one example (SPOILER!): Why, do you think, someone takes a garden hose to their hemp plants deep in the forest? To water them? Of course not, you usually do not find water pipes in the forests, right? The only reason that this water hose exists is that a hunter who passes while the two protagonists are picking up their drug can be drugged, mistreated and finally filled with three bottles of Jaegermeister. I really hated this scene, because it is really violent. Usually, I do not care about the violence in the movies, the slapstick comedies are full of that. But in that kind of comedy there's a silent agreement between the film and you so that people do not get hurt if they fall flat on their faces or get hit with chairs or things like that. But if that happens in a movie that is otherwise realistic enough, the slapstick scenes also look real. In this particular scene of "Lammbock" I really thought that this hunter must be seriously injured, if not dead. The final scene really gave me the impression that they let him die there, totally full of more alcohol than anyone could handle. And the protagonists simply move away. It would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed a style; The scene could have been quite funny. <br /> <br /> Talk about being consistent, that's what I missed most about this movie. The whole movie seems to be a list of small episodes that came to the mind of the author. Things just happen without an apparent reason. Yes, I know, that's life, but that's not cinema, because the cinema is destined to tell a story, not to show boring episodes without any meaning. I found myself asking "Where is the point?" all the time. The characters, in addition to the two main ones, are not elaborated, you never know why the protagonist's sister wants to sleep with her best friend Kai; In fact, it tells you that I can not buy it, at all. I think she was just there to give Kai the chance to make this children's AIDS test sketch, which you've probably seen a thousand times, and mostly better. The girlfriend protagonist you know once, then leaves Germany (which you do not even see and it seems that the boy does not care) and finally mentioned in a sentence that has met someone else in America and is divided with the protagonist. It seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up some loose ends. Actually he did not, you never know what's wrong with studying law, being dad's son (Daddy fixes everything at the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night, which in my opinion made him one of the nicer characters throughout the film) and living in the beautiful Wuerzburg. Even dinner with the friend in dad's cloak, who perhaps had the intention of showing how horrible it is to have to live up to his father's expectations, seemed flat, just another nice dinner with the family's friends (except for the trip that the boy will make later, but I think showing that eating pre-dinner with parents is not healthy was not the goal of this scene, if there was one.) I have lived much worse dinners in my life than this and I still finished my exams, I could not understand a single character in the whole movie, they just seemed flat and implausible. <br /> <br /> All this made it a not so good movie, but not one that would not return to I actually had some good scenes (most of them were not new, although, like the nice and understanding policemen), some were really fun, some dialogues were nice and I like the Bleibtreu game, although he repeated his well-known Stereotypes again this time. It's not good, it's not abominable, that's what I thought after the movie had finished half. <br /> <br /> But then this scene of incest came and this really seemed repulsive to me. Incest is simply not funny. I do not even know if this was meant to be fun, some people in the audience laughed, so it could have been like that. This scene ruined the whole movie for me, I could no longer feel sympathy for the protagonist, I can not feel sympathy for someone who f **** a defenseless person, for me, this is rape and rape is not funny. So it could have been a sign of drama or something, but incest is never mentioned again (although we thought that this might have been a reason for the protagonist to leave Germany at the end, but as it never comes back to mention, we do) I do not know.), it's even totally unnecessary. I almost expected the sister to become pregnant at the end, which would have added the final touch to this story of bad taste, but this final clich√© is not even fulfilled, just as nothing really resolves or thinks to the end in this film. It's not really fun, it's not really a drama, it's not at all a road movie to the Tarantino despite desperate attempts at violence, it's definitely not nice. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie. Look at "Final Fantasy", that's also bad, but at least with beautiful images and not so insipid.
