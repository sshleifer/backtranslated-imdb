I suppose this is in the public domain, since it is on DVD. First of all, this is a good-natured propaganda film to be shown to an Australian public during the war, so it should not be considered a serious recount of Tobruk. The first half to 3/4 is a very dry material that is developed in Australia, I think that like many American war movies in which the recruits gather, oh man, it's so long. From what we got to Africa and Tobruk, pretty bad, low budget things. The battle scenes on the DVD copy I saw were almost completely black. Look at it if necessary, but be prepared to use the fast forward as I doubt you can take it after a few minutes. I enjoyed much more the Italian cheesy "Battle of El Alamien", also Richard Burton made an African theater movie that was good "The Desert Rats", this movie is just a piece of the real era and should have stayed at that time, it does not hold up well today (I doubt it was very appreciated at that time). I say the same about the war films of my American counterpart, so do not take it as an Australian (I love Australia, I've been there twice!).
