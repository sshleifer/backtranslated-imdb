What should have been a dramatic life story on the Murray River turns out to be a stupid romance about an English refugee (Sigrid Thornton with an Australian accent) who falls in love with the first larrikin companion (John Waters) of a steamboat. <br /> <br /> The first half of this four-and-a-half-hour miniseries shows some promise, but it soon deflates as it becomes predictable and thin. It took some real enthusiasm and spark in the plot to bring the movie to life. Gus Mercurio's early departure did not help, since his character seemed the only interesting one. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the longest version of TV has more depth, because this video translation was missing. <br /> <br /> Sunday June 27, 1993 - Video
