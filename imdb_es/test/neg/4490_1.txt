The film begins in the spring of 2001. A soldier named John Tyree (Channing Tatum) falls in love with college student Savannah Cutis (Amanda Seyfried) while on vacation. In the space of two weeks they fall madly in love with each other (!). But he has to go to war and she has to go to university. They do it, but they keep in touch with each other in writing. Then it happens on September 11. She wants to re-enlist, she wants him to stay at home. What will they do? <br /> <br /> Historically the romantic drama. The cables are attractive. Tatum is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a sexy body (he showed up walking shirtless out of the water after surfing) ... but he can not act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she tries ... but the dialogue here is horrible. When I saw it, a friend of mine and I were struggling hard not to laugh out loud at the beginning of the "romantic" dialogue. It was just horrible. For the first hour or so I was bored by the ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the horrendous "romance". Then, after that first hour, the tragedy begins and, I must admit, it made me cry. However, the filmmakers do everything possible to make sure they are crying with death, funerals and meetings with people who break into tears. How can you not cry? This would have worked if the performance had been better. Tatum's face never changes expression, not once! He always had a blank look on his face. Seyfried was a little better, but not much. To make matters worse, Tatum and Seyfried did not have sexual chemistry on the screen! They hardly seemed to like each other much less love each other. There were some beautiful photographs of the Carolinas, but this is a boring and stupid romantic "drama". A 1 in everything ... and I usually love silly romantic dramas like this one!
