Hulk Hogan plays a champion wrestler (a real stretch of acting ...) called Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that he wanted him to sign on his network (Because the fight free is sold!) However, when Rip decreases, the network receives a championship fight called in circuit (and I am totally serious) "The battle of the tough guys" which is the champion Zeus (played by Tiny Lister Jr), such time the most lethal man in the world. Rip refuses to fight, until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital. No Holds Barred is more or less what I expected from Vince McMahon's production starring the less versatile actor in the action genre (Hogan), it's basically a lot of involuntary humor, tons of uncomfortable sequences, a couple of action sequences and tons of stupidity. In other words, it is not different from the fight itself, so I give it a fair rating, mainly because anyone who rents this knows what they are getting. The movie is cheap but it is well made for what it is and the wrestling fans will probably enjoy this. I myself found this to be ultimately hilarious. They are moments of such absurdity that you only chuckle. (For example, the way Hogan jumps 20 feet in the air after being stuck in a limousine, how he forces a man to shit himself and, of course, the way Hogan recites his card ) (IE: "I will not be around" when this check is deleted!) No Holds Barred is a lot of fun, it's true, although it's mostly because of how ridiculous it is, camp fans should really enjoy this skillful clinker. <br /> <br /> * * of 4- (Fair)
