Stay away from this movie. Far away. Phil Fondacaro stars as the insane leader of a Freakshow. Each performance is flat and insensitive, except that of Fondacaro. The plot is simple and follows almost all possible horror film clich√©s. A group of high school kids goes to a carnival, sees a secondary show and gets into their heads. <br /> <br /> Fans of Fred Olen Ray should be warned, this is not like any of the others. This film lacks all the departments (humor, sex, horror, etc.) other F.O. Ray's films stand out. <br /> <br /> The version I saw also contained a Making-Of documentation, in which the director makes comments such as "We had a limited budget" and "with our limited timeline", which says a lot about how much Charles Band cared about this movie. Go rent "Droid Runner" (Fred Olen Ray) or "The Dead Hate the Living" (Full Moon) instead. The full moon should be ashamed of itself (and that's saying long after seeing "Killer Eye") <br /> <br /> Rating: D-
