Normally I do not write comments, in fact, I never write comments. This movie was so outrageous that it really inspired me to start. The virtual sexuality tries to be a cheerful and brazen adolescent comedy with respect to the habitual traps; virginity, children, etc., except that the main character apparently becomes her perfect child that she has created using the help of a machine at a technology fair. <br /> <br /> Sound interesting? Well, it is not. The acting is the most heartless and atrocious I've seen. The unfortunate thing is that they seem to genuinely support the script and the movie, which probably explains why I've never seen them in any memorable production since then. I have not bothered to learn the names of the actors, nor their characters. The lady does not catch you or captivate you and, therefore, you do not care about her at all. The first lady's male friend shows no sympathy even when the script is screaming loudly so that you have compassion for him. The only increase you will get from you is one of extreme anger and sudden violence. The only half decent actor was the blond protagonist, who, despite his miserable and weak role, really gave everything he could, which was not much in the light of such a horrible job. I'm not even going to talk about the abomination that acts like the 'bad guys' of the plot. But, again, what plot? <br /> <br /> I watched this film unfold in disbelief, as I had no idea how someone would have the stupid audacity to write such a script, without caring about producing, acting and directing it. . I can only ask myself. The only reason why my partner and I still see such a shivering example of the movie was the incredulous laugh that managed to emerge from us as cohesion, logic, class and even an impotent story that was not taken into account in the half hour of the movie. I have no idea why someone wanted to rape the film industry by launching this to the public. This is a joke of a movie and it is better to let it accumulate dust in the stores for the rest of eternity. 1/2 of 10. Yes.
