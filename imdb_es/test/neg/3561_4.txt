This film is about an afflicted woman who lost her husband by suicide. She is tormented by her son who refused to talk after that. <br /> <br /> Childhood pain is rarely explored in a movie, so it's refreshing to watch a movie like Addison's Wall. However, due to the very nature of the film, there is no tension or drama. Apart from some key emotional moments, everything in the movie is very simple. The abrupt end that does not solve any mystery certainly does not help the film to be more visible. The Addison Wall could have been much better, such as exploring the contents of the wall, a more intensive care program to help Addison overcome his trauma. Instead, the film feels very unfinished and unattractive.
