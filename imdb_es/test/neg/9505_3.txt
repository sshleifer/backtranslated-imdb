This movie is very difficult to understand, why does the couple want to divorce? No reason is given, we do not know anything about his life in Lisbon, not even about Marie's work. We can only understand that a certain perforation appeared in this life. We do not even know who took the initiative to ask for a divorce. <br /> <br /> The way of filming is something special: I did not know the name of the director before the end of the movie, when I read On the screen, I understood why it was so slow, only 42 shots in one hundred minutes ( I counted them)! It reminded me of some Japanese films that I saw in the 90s, in fact, we must accept that this is the expression of another culture, even if the scenario is Western. I do not know if this story would have been suitable for a Japanese couple. <br /> <br /> One can see the logic of the scenes, but the result is a bore, anyway, I decided to see it to the end because I wanted to get the spirit and meaning of everything. In fact, I just understood that the story of these two beings may not be over since the train leaves the station without Marie. This is little for so long! I can not recommend this work.
