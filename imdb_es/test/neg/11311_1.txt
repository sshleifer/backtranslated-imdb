I left the theater, and I was only 10 years old. That's how bad it sucks. The plot was horrible and the performance was worse. Leslie Nielson should be ashamed of himself and also the person who made this movie. I was only 10 years old when I went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young and innocent age I did not laugh at the film once. We (my friend and I) still laugh at how bad the movie was. We ended up going to the 'R' movie where my parents were. In a nutshell, this movie was very bad. Mr. Magoo - more like Mr. Ma-who? This movie could have marked me for life if I had seen the popular caricature on television when I was a child, but fortunately I had never seen it, so I saved myself the agony but I will never recover the precious minutes of my life that I wasted.
