Masters Horror: Sounds Like is located in Seattle, where Larry Pearce works as a manager of a software call center, after having lost his 6-year-old son, Michael (Nicholas Elia), due to a rare heart disease that he discovers that has ultra sensitive hearing. Larry listens to everything ten times, from people typing on computer keyboards, people whispering across the room, people who touch their feet on the floor, touch the taps and, finally, even people who breathe become unbearable for Larry, as he is constantly bombarded with a piercing sound. Finally, Larry decides that he has had enough and if he can not avoid the noises by himself, then maybe he can avoid listening to them with the help of a great meat expert ... <br /> <br /> This Canadian co-production- American was episode 4 of season 2 of the television series Masters of Horror, generally written and directed by Brad Anderson, I thought that Sounds Like was a real lady. The script was based on a story by Mike O'Driscoll and I am really surprised by the amount of very positive comments he has here at the IMDb at this time. For starters, it would be very difficult to even describe this as a horror movie and it feels more like a strange sentimental drama until the last 5 minutes, when Howard Berger, Gregory Nicotero and the KNB boys get to work. Larry has this strange inexplicable ability to amplify sound and noise from the beginning, so this episode ends like 55 minutes of exactly the same kind of repetitive accumulation that leads to a bloody ending, although he is late to save the episode. This is quite slow and, although it is well written, is it not meant to be a horror theme and I am a bit confused as to whom it should be addressed? <br /> <br /> Principal Anderson is fine, but he just keeps repeating the same things over and over again, until in the last 5 minutes there is not a single drop of blood in the whole thing. There is no horror, no fear or tension and absolutely no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Technically, it is very well done, has good production values ​​and does not seem like a cheap program made for television. The acting is really good and it is a pity that the story is somewhat limited. <br /> <br /> It seems to be one of the worst episodes of Masters of Horror, a lot of people seem to like it and it's fine, but it's definitely fine. not for me. Another Masters of Horror, another disappointment.
