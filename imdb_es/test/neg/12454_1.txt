This movie has recently been televised by Turner Classic Movies. It may have been considered a joke at the time and may have earned money, but even Jane Russell's toughest fans will find it difficult to sit through this dreck. <br /> <br /> There are many movie musicals from the 1950s, which can stand the test of time, although it is dated according to current standards, but can still be enjoyed thanks to good music, dancing or a funny plot "The French Line", however, fails in all these aspects. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that Russell was a good singer when he was given lousy vocal material. The whole cast is dragged down by a boring and trite plot and dialogue. <br /> <br /> It is not even worth recording and jumping only to the musical numbers, they are unpleasant.
