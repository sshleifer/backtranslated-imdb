If you tried to make a bad movie, you could not do a worse one than this one. I can not imagine someone paying a good amount of money to see trash like this in a theater. What really catches you is that you stay hypnotized to see everything just because of the astonishment of seeing how bad it gets. The redeeming facet of this movie was seeing the words "The End"
