Five Fingers relies heavily on Hollywood tactics of barbaric and impact value to get an apparently positive response. This is where this film fails, mainly because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. I felt rejected and disgusted that Five Fingers was done, and essentially I had to force myself to continue observing him. The torture itself is frightening. Even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are horrible. But obviously the creators of this stinker from a movie felt it was not enough. It had to go way beyond what was needed, and it simply ruined the chances that this movie had some valid argument. For this reason, this movie turned out to be nothing more than self-gratifying. Five Fingers is also relegated to a B movie state solely because of their indulgence in time manipulation. In other words, the present is shown to us and then the past is revealed in fragments. This is a small twist of the normal Hollywood manipulation of time. While the viewer is normally shown on page 95 in a 100-page script as the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the movie is essentially explaining the ending, Five Fingers is dedicated to blinking again, which becomes quite exhausting at the end of the movie. In general, Five Fingers made me feel stupid to see the whole movie, because the torture is obviously obscene, and it certainly was not necessary to resort to graphic mutilation to point out this point. I'm surprised that Dick Cheney has not appeared as a guest as a torture superhero. This film is a perfect example of what happens when an important issue falls into the hands of greedy and mindless pains.
