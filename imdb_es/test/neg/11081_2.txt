When I reviewed the review of this film after having seen it, I was surprised that there were people who gave it good grades. <br /> <br /> This is a film of bad work with the camera. Everything "frightening" happens off the screen, usually accompanied by a close-up of someone shouting "Did you see / hear that?" Well, no, we did not see that! We can not And when there were no close-ups, the camera was doing something strange, like turning backwards or shaking from one side to the other really, very quickly, either to transmit the action or to make us physically sick. <br /> <br /> The characters were unpleasant because every two minutes, they started yelling the same thing over and over again. I do not care if that would be 'really', I did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things! I expect unreasonable things, like extraterrestrials, demons or good acting! They were stupid, too. We are going to have intimate relationships in a cave! With all our clothes on! Speaking of which, the ending somehow contradicts what Domingo said immediately before he died. This bothered me a little, though not as much as the fact that the ending resulted in ... a serious invasion of a girl's privacy. <br /> <br /> No plot, no climax, no good performance, terrible camera. -work. What's left? Right. The ending may have had a 'twist', but generally with horror films, the turnaround at the end really has an understandable relevance to what happened during the film. The sixth sense does it, explains a lot. Hide and Seek did it too. But the Cavern had a lame turn that served as an 'explanation', if I could call it that because it is not like that. Explain Anything. <br /> <br /> I do not see it. Please.
