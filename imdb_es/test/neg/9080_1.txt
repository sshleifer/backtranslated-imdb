This is one of the few movies, maybe the only one, that really haunted me for years. It was the first time I saw people being tortured, so much so that blood flowed from their mouths when they clenched their teeth and shouted, etc. It was brutal; The worst I had seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the most evil characters I've seen in the movie, and I've seen thousands. It was so sadistic that I would never see this movie again, or recommend it. It makes Hannibal Lecter look like Mr. Rogers. If seeing tortured people is not a fun idea, get away from this movie. <br /> <br /> I know there are many sick people, many of them professional film critics, who probably enjoyed this sordid, sick history. It's a "B" movie, anyway, with stupid dialogue and some acting by Charles Bronson. This is not one of your best efforts. Even if it were, there are so many horrendous scenes here that you would not want to see. Trust me this time.
