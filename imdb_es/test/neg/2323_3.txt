I saw it last night for the first time in 40 years. It is bad. Very bad. But it has sufficiently hilariously horrible moments, which are worth seeing. First of all, was it deliberate to make the child who is taking care of children completely effeminate? He even tells Costello to Mae West: "You fascinate me!" As Costello does a double take. Only God knows what would have happened if the nanny had been a gallant. THIS child would have seduced him in an instant! Then there is the main dancer. He is totally inept. He roars with laughter as he jumps and dances without any talent on the giant's grave during He never looked better in his life. The two romantic protagonists are zeros, waste. Abbott comes to sing a line and that was doubled by another singer. Geez, I guess I could not even take a tune! Costello manages to be charming in his I Fear Nothing number, and I think many children may like it, but there is not much to recommend it. But oh, that effeminate and seductive child! THAT aspect just blew me away! In addition, the fact that the family accepted anyone who was on the street without any reference to caring for a child. Today, the little boys would be taken away!
