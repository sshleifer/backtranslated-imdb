The outline of the plot of this film is similar to the original. Someone is kidnapped, the prince is incest to save it, Odet becomes a Swan, the turtle / frog / puffin first the "bad" magician the best they can, and in the end ... Anyway, there are not many new things here . With the exception of the lack of well-known voice talent. Sorry, neither Palance nor Cleese and, therefore, Jean-Bob was a disappointment.
