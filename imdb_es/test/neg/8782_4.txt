The incalculable origin of the solitary ranger. It shows who he was and how and why he became the Ranger. <br /> <br /> Legendary bomb. The idea was not bad: reinvent and introduce the Lone Ranger for the audience of the 80s. From the beginning, although there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to stop appearing anywhere as the Lone Ranger. It led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. I know of people who refused to watch the movie because of how Moore was treated. They also hired the incredibly untalented Klinton Spilsbury to play the Ranger. Spilsbury was very handsome and muscular, but he had absolutely no charisma and simply could not act. In fact, all his vocal performance was stifled by another actor! Also, their off-screen antics (public drunkenness and beating people) did not help at all. Acting aside, the script is boring and slow. Also Ranger himself does not appear until an HOUR in! There were some complaints at the time that the movie was too violent for a PG. However, I do not think it was that bad. <br /> <br /> There are some (very few) things done here: the photograph was really beautiful; Michael Horse was excellent as Silly; Christopher Lloyd is very funny as the villain and, when the Lone Ranger finally shows up (with the hint of William Tell on the soundtrack), it's really exciting. But, in general, this is a boring and terrible attempt to recover the lone Ranger. It's easy to see why it's bombed. A 4 - mostly for photography.
