I went to see the movie because my boyfriend was telling him how much he wanted to see it, and how his friends had been and loved it. So I entered with a neutral attitude, without really expecting the worst. Unfortunately, that's what I have. I could write a 15-page document on why this is easily the worst movie I've ever seen. But for your benefit, I will point out the pros and the endless amount of cons. For starters, the performance was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also some lines that deserved a laugh and a couple of suspense scenes. Unfortunately, good performance, a little humor and suspense is where the good points end. The whole story of the beginning could have been great. The family of a Jewish girl is murdered, she hides, then meets the man responsible for her pain and then creates a great plan of revenge. Sounds really good. But the film would not be so "satisfactory" for Americans and Jews who crave Nazi blood. I have no problem with World War II movies or killing the Nazis; I saw Defiance and I like it a lot. However, it is the form and attitude with which our aspiring heroes kill. I'll give you a good example of the kind of hypocrisy that this movie gives off. Our camouflaged gang ambushes a German unit and kills them all, except one sergeant and two other soldiers (no problem so far). They ask the sergeant to divulge information about another German unit. When he "respectfully refuses" to betray the lives of his fellow soldiers, he is beaten on the head with a baseball bat, cheering and swearing as if they were at a football game. They took that Nazi's head off yaaayy! Now let's see the hypocrisy in that scene. Here is a hypothetical situation: a group of American soldiers are ambushed and captured by the enemy. Follow the same scenario and the US commanding officer would rather die than betray his fellow soldier. The enemy hits his head with much celebration. This would infuriate an audience if this scene were in a movie. That American soldier was a hero for putting his men above himself, and those barbarians murdered him brutally! Well, what about the Nazi sergeant? Well, he is a Nazi and deserves to die the cruelest death possible, right? Coincidentally, the Nazis felt the same towards the Jews. Do you see hypocrisy? When celebrating the butcher of the Nazis we are located on the same sadistic level. <br /> <br /> Hypocrisy major # 2: The Nazis make a propaganda film about a German sniper that kills nearly 300 US soldiers. Near the end of the movie, the film is revealed. Hitler and his companions laugh with joy when they see an American soldier shoot through the window and fall into a fountain. The Nazis applaud as soldier after soldier falls to the sniper's ability. This is supposed to enrage American viewers in this scene. Those evil Nazis are laughing at the death of our brave men! Well, the irony is, is not that what we were doing (or are we supposed to do) all the time we are watching Inglorious Basterds? Laugh at the pain of others simply because they were "the bad guys". How would we feel if Native Americans somehow made a hit movie in which a bloody revenge stinks of American settlers? Or what if the blacks made a movie that glorified Nat Turner's rebellion? Pretty good about hypocritical faults. <br /> <br /> I will summarize other reasons for the 1 star rating. 1) There were admirable views of characters throughout the film. Brad Pitt even tortures a woman by sticking his finger in his bullet wound because he suspects that she betrayed him. He is the good guy 2) Scenes dragged in longer than necessary. 3) The southern accent of Brad Pitt, supposedly Tennessee, is HORRIBLE and completely annoying throughout the movement. I'm going to resign now since I'm in 700 words. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that the population in general no longer thinks, they just want blood. And that's why this movie received such a high ranking. I recommend this movie for the ignorant or if you are Jewish and simply want to see a good "fantasy justice". Personally, when I finally left the cinema I felt as if I had been cut back (or I wish I had done it to not have suffered more than 2 hours of mental rape).
