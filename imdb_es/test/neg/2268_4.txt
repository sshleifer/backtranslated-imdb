Shwaas may have a good story, but the director is completely lacking in talent. He does not know when to stop. When history demands that people act confused, there are ten-minute scenes of people imitating the act of confusion. When the story requires a bit of background history, there are ten minute scenes of the Konkan vegetation. When the story requires a child to throw tantrums ... you understand the idea. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the extreme close-ups so you can count the hair on people's noses. There are movies that should be seen on a big screen, this movie should be seen on a 13 "TV, and Amruta Subhash, who plays Asavari, is the worst actress I've seen in a long time, a normal human being would have to. overreacting for years to achieve what she does without effort. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 just because the subject is different and the story is not bad.The fact that a film like Shwaas comes to La India's entry to the Oscars says a lot, not about the state of Indian cinema but about the status of Indian judges' committees.A film is not good just because its theme is artistic.
