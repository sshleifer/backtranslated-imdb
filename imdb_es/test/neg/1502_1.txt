NO WAY ! I hated grandma. First, she's too tall, of course she is, it's Tom, the brother of whoever is playing her, and I hate what she does when she brushes her fake silver hair back, but: there are fun parts in this movie. For example, the fact that each actor is seen as V.G. (Very German), and also that they think that, even when left alone, they should pretend that that guy (Tom) is their real "grandmother" or something like that. I especially liked, no, that moment when Charlotte leaves and starts walking towards the nearest gas station to ask for help. Suddenly, he finds himself in the middle of a forest (where were they before? Nobody dares to explain) and he turns around, turns, turns like a dancer, looks at the stars ... and ... ignores the fact that GRANNY IT IS BEHIND HER, READY TO STRIKE! But, anyway, the music was not so bad, the haircuts were good and the ending was terribly provocative ... Mmmmm ... I wish I had the German version.
