A group of friends receives information from a friend who has found gold in an old mental well near an old abandoned western town of Suttersville. Despite warnings from the local sheriff, Murphy (John Phillip Law), Old Man Prichard (Richard Lynch), an unfortunate hick who cheated tourists with supposed Wanted posters, and the shy superstitious Aunt Nelly (Karen Black) to stay outside the mine because it is a notorious legend (... that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to the devil and murdered the daughter of a priest (Jeff Conaway) will return from the dead to kill those who take gold of its axis), these people only see the green, not the red blood that could potentially ooze from their dead bodies. When Jeremiah Stone's gold is found intact, pockets and transport cases are filled, ready for the bright future that is supposed to come. But when you do not pay attention to the warnings of those you consider crazy, the obvious result will be a dreadful death. Jeremiah Stone, as we see, is simply laid out like a skeleton near an altar containing skulls lined up side by side, while the candles on its upper part light up, the peak below its master, with dust particles that they return him to a grotesque corpse with demons Exposure, his eyes shine with anger. This unfortunate group, which expects some fun around the bonfire with gold that gives them warm perspectives for life ahead, will fall prey to the vengeful demon and its pettiness. Another victim will come across the unpleasant end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of his vehicle, directing it directly at his neck. Another failed attempt to retire has Stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree, his body engulfed in flames when he can not escape without damage. Another, a local girl who is looking for her new friends, worried about her well-being, receives the pickaxe buried in her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those who are still alive about the Forty-Niner and the curse on those who plunder their eternal hiding place ... and pays the price for linking that information. Will someone survive? Or, is the whole group destined to perish at the hands of the zombie miner? <br /> <br /> Makeup effects artist and creator of monsters, John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong storytelling, opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who is in his way. He provides enough history back, and this is weak at best, for the killer who allows the special guest star, Karen Black (... oh, how her career has sunk into the abyss) to explain to the viewer about him. The story that is told to us has the miner who holds the daughter of a priest hostage, who threatens to execute her while the authorities of Suttersville warn against such action. Amazing enough, the stone plants that pick her up directly on her back, with the opposition discharging their weapons with little effect because she sold her soul to Satan. Retreating to his domain, the well of the mine, Stone sends a warning against anyone who tries to take what is his, the loot. Typical of most slaughters in general, this group of twenty-somethings are the victims of their variety of vegetables, with little development apart from some jokes and the exchange of words provides filling until the undead maniac appears at the scene to kill them . They are the usual group, of the city, that enter unknown territory, resuscitate an evil that should remain inactive. Like many of the last series of the 1980s, much of the violence is off the screen. What is on the screen, the minimum gore, is presented in a rather mundane way and happens quite fast. The ghoul makeup for the killer is only shown from time to time; it is mostly enveloped in darkness, the horrified faces of the victims when they are trapped or pursued are given more credibility than the method of destruction. One thing is certain, the doubles were burned many times. At least three times, a character is burned alive either by a flashlight or a burning vehicle. Martin Cove has a minor cameo as Black's ex-husband, Caleb, who now lives with a much younger and denser honey. Vernon Wells (from The Road Warrior and Commando Fame) plays the role of Jeremiah Stone's story as a human being, which still captures the same type of threat in which he specializes. John Phillip Law seems to be enjoying himself as the most polite and hospitable Sheriff, welcoming strangers to his neck of the woods. Buechler has a pretty sexy cast of actresses, all in tight pants and little shirts, showing off their elegant and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as Roxann, always ready to take off her clothes for the greedy idiot, Hayden (Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell (The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a rather clumsy blade, used as part of many jokes, including his "landfill in the forest" scene and the current state of unemployment.
