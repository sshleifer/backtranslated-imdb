I certainly expected more after seeing the list of actors, but WOW! <br /> <br /> I think a director for the first time could have done a better job with this project, and the fact that a veteran like John Buechler did it baffles me endlessly. Somehow, the budget allowed them to ensure a group of actors on List D, who managed to embarrass for an hour and a half. The unknown actors were simply horrible, except Steve Wastell, who does a decent job as Axl. The story is so bad that it does not need to be mentioned. The overall production value seems standard, with some camera work above the average, if you can overcome the "slow-motion" scenes of God-Awful and the painful sequences of "person on fire". I knew it would be stupid, I just had no idea how silly it was, and unfortunately it is a time that can never be returned to me. I suppose if you like really bad "B" movies, this might work for you, but if you value any story, it's just terrible ... A complete waste of time.
