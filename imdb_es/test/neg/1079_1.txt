I must admit that I was against this film from the beginning, but I did everything possible to be impartial, I really did, but the idea of ​​remaking a sophisticated, witty, entertaining and quirky British classic full of character has to be dubious from the beginning. At first. <br /> <br /> The people in my house were watching this, so I swallowed my pride and told myself I should be professional about the movies (I studied them in Uni after all). <br /> <br /> As expected for an American movie of this kind, the movie started with a chase that was not bad. In fact, many of the action sequences are credible and this only raises the mark. <br /> <br /> However, the characterization was abysmal, the ensemble pieces could very easily have been spliced ​​from any US box office success you could have had. Unfortunately, the image of EE. UU it does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of Donald. The character of Sutherland. This allows our cousins ​​in the US UU Many opportunities for seekers of sycophantic revenge and wet eyes against "evildoers" that transforms into predictable excesses. This is never as obvious as in the scenes that show Charlize Theron (oh, beautiful! Oh, beautiful! Look at her with her beautiful and hurt Bambi eyes, everyone!) That were completely nauseating. His entry scene, in particular, was like something out of Resident Evil or Tomb Raider, which were a) more entertaining and b) had better beginnings because they could not ruin a game as they could with British cinema, which was already full of people . Of spark, people for whom you really feel something and moments of inspiration. But I digress, the complete inclusion of a pretty girl for the simple fact that it seems to be the most clumsy maneuver I've seen in a long time and exposes Hollywood's cynical lust for what it is. <br /> <br /> If you like any of these actors, by the way, and you agree with any of the comments above, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE! If I had the opportunity to watch 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' after seeing Ed Norton on this, I would have rejected it. Similarly, Jason Statham with "Block Actions" (and I guess "The Transporter" is fine if you like that kind of thing). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all the pieces are designed in the most transparent way possible. to make you think, 'Wow! It's smart! ',' Coo! It's great! ',' Hears! What a tough guy! ' Then there is the "funny guy from the PC" who has a "comic relief" sprinkled on his forehead but whose content of humor can be anticipated with two minutes of anticipation. To be honest, if you've seen one or two movies like this, you could easily mistake them as clones of Jerry Bruckheimer's stable. By the way, it's not that Jerry is hopelessly horrible, but he simply uses the clichés in excess, as everyone knows (or should). <br /> <br /> This is where I have to clarify. I did not make it to the end, so I could not even tell if the brilliant end of Michael Caine's version did it, but, I'm sorry, it's just one of those extremely rare movies that, if so, I had seen it in a cinema, I would have gone out and organized a small protest outside. It's not just another one of the identical Ocean's 14 numbers or something similar (Ocean's Eleven was fine, but do not worry about the rest!) With all the ostentation, glamor, fake effrontery and heroic pantomime of a movie Well, but nothing could be recognized from the original at all. <br /> <br /> Therefore, if you are waiting for "THE ITALIAN WORK" and not "OCEAN'S 14", even if it is misspelled with a cast and less established characters, some dishonest elements and cardboard cutout, script writing , then DO NOT LOOK! I do not care if people like a bit of fun without meaning, but this is a criminal job that does not deserve to be paraded in any way under the title of a classic. Seriously, show some pride! I felt completely justified in my indignant and ill reaction when I first heard that the film would be made. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> P.S. Some of the action sequences are not bad at all, so add an extra '1' to the brand if you like this kind of thing.
