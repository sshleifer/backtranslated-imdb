This son of a son of a sequel was terrible to say the least. You would think that the production would be better 10 years after the original was released, however, Retro Puppet Master was not directed or written by the original writers and contained a poor story, had no symbolic connection to any character and crawled slowly to the scene scene. If you can not build a strong plot, a very weak climax, you will feel increasingly restless throughout the film, if you can sit through the whole roll. I could never understand why a horror movie continues to make sequels after the release of its "final chapter". I almost do not suggest watching this movie, but if necessary, I would not recommend that someone else sit down with you.
