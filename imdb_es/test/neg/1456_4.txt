Have you ever tried a type of food that your friend made and then you said "wow, that was not a good combination"? Well, that's how I felt after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Many viewers will feel very uncomfortable with this strange mixture of crime and very, very corny comedy. It's almost like seeing Mr. Rogers playing a ruthless gangster, very weird. Some things just do not mix and this movie clearly shows it. <br /> <br /> Here are some very good performances, since Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Baldwin are excellent, but that has nothing to do with it. for the lack of balance and symmetry in the film. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme has done an excellent job in films like Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia, but he seems to be out of his element with this one.
