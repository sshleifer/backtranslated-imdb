I love most of Jet Li's films (with the exception of Romeo Must Die) and I bought this movie in a VERY cheap three-pack with "The Master" and "Twin Warriors". While Twin Warriors was very impressive and completely intrigued by her, and the master was a bit "Karate Kid" but also nice, I thought this movie was TERRIBLE. I do not say it just because I'm used to the best movies. I'm saying it was almost there with "Kazaam". The fight scenes were terrible (blurred cameras and no real fight) and the plot was your typical "stupid kung-fu plot". If you are going to have such a stupid conspiracy (look: 'man becomes a woman to become all powerful and then falls in love with Jet Li') it is better that you have a great fight to move on. If you are looking for an original HK Jet Li movie, I suggest you rent "Shaolin Temple 2" (also known as Kids from Shaolin).
