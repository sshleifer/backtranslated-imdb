I was one of the many fools who were spoiled to pay for this in the theater, even though I paid 4 dollars for the prices of the matinee (before 6 pm). <br /> <br /> The story of the remake was boring, the CGI The Morlocks were lame, the Eloi were rastafarians to imitate the fashions of today (no, I did not think the girl had any heat), the kill again the modern girlfriend of the hero was something cruel, in general just a sad and bad remake. <br /> <br /> I'll take Rod Taylor, Weena, and the fat-eyed surfer Morlocks over this garbage at any moment. My estimation is that many of the critics who like this horrible remake are small children, which does not explain either the good taste or the true value of the old classics, which the confused and increasingly beloved youth does not appreciate at all. measure. <br /> <br /> When the 1960s version came out (I saw it for the first time in the 70s to have fun in the summer) it was quite impressive and still remains. It is not necessary to have an excess of CGI in a movie to make it better. Much of this seems false. I can not say enough about how bad the Morlocks looked, ran and jumped as if they were in a children's video game. 3 stars out of 10.
