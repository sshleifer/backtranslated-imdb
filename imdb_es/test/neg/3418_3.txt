Geoffrey Wright, the director of "Romper Stomper", transplanted Shakespeare's "Macbeth" into the contemporary criminal underworld of Melbourne, Australia. The result is a piece of semi-horrible cinema. Sam Worthington is Macbeth, and he goes around looking very shy and bored. Victoria Hill, who wrote the script with Wright, is Lady Macbeth, and she is neither horrible nor good. Lachy Hulme, who plays McDuff, is the only actor in the cast who exudes any kind of authority. The rest, including Gary Sweet, is wasted and diverted. Recorded in HD by the late Will Gibson, the images in the film lack character. Everything is too clean and too deliberately lit. Wright's direction lacks extreme inspiration and the action sequences are confusing and inept. Erroneously marketed as "the most violent film in Australia", the film is sometimes violent and reasonably bloody, but it does not offer a single shocking moment. Slow-moving and terribly pretentious, this version of the classic screen play is the personification of the wrong head.
