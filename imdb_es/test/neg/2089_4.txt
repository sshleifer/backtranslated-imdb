I picked up this DVD for 3.99 in Roger's video in order to get enough points to get a better free movie. Actually, I never thought about seeing this, but I started to wake up my curiosity and finally decided to put it in the DVD player. The effects in this movie are horrible and cheap. Some of the dialogue in this movie seems to have been written by a 12-year-old boy. The acting is really corny in some parts, and the "action" scenes are completely ridiculous. You will laugh in some parts, which was positive for me because it kept me entertained. The plot is that a girl has a curse on her that makes her vomit snakes, so a shaman has to take her to Los Angeles, there are also two girls who try to smuggle drugs there and some other people who are not important to the plot, that there really is a plot. Do not expect anything from this movie and do not listen to the cover, there are not 100 passengers and 3,000 vipers, there are 10 passengers and 20 snakes at random. <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, there is a trailer that is almost as ridiculous as the movie, a defective roll that is just a take over and over again of an actor trying to say train, and deleted scenes they're really useless, if they were. They're not good enough to stay in this movie, they must be pretty bad. There's also a very bad featurette crafting that does not really show much, except that the people involved in this movie were a bit stupid. I can not recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh with your friends. I give 2 cats to 5 cats.
