I saw the version with pathetic American over-dubs, maybe this made it a lot worse, but from what I could see, the movie was pretty bad anyway. It seemed low budget. The visual images reminded me of a second-rate television movie, a random white dog that replaced Dogmatix, the embarrassing BBC costumes of the 1960s, and so on. As a result, I never felt willing to even try to forgive the bad aspect of the movie. It will always be difficult to capture the feel of comics in a movie without using animations, and I did not feel that this attempt was ultimately worthwhile.
