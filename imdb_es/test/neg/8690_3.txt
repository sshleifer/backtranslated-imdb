I rented this movie, after listening to Chris Gore say something like "five stars". in that attack of the Show show. Well, when I went around the DVD and showed the 3 stages of hell, well, I had to buy it. Just to see the spectacle of a mother screaming at her son to throw his other son into a fire pit. <br /> <br /> I did not expect ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I was waiting for the At least one short version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie. Well, unfortunately there was nothing like that. The 3 stages of the death part occur from the beginning, and it is quite downhill from there. Nothing really happens in this documentary. He was pretty raw, naked and impartial. Not bad, but there is a narrator in this. You would expect him to have opinions on the subject of this documentary, but he does not have them. What would have been nice to have, a message or a reason for this document. There was no real reason to have a narrator, there should only be one text that explained some of the less obvious scenes. <br /> <br /> It's not like that. Nor does it explain the lives of these fighters. It shows some moments of some dramatic scenes, which sound interesting, but the reality is not as good as it sounds. For example, the mother who sees her son fight with light bulbs and tacks, for the first time, in a public park. Instead of seeing their reaction to the fight, they show it by reacting to the camera, instead of saying an interview later, or simply witnessing their reactions. <br /> <br /> As for the legitimate document, this is not. The source material was flimsy to begin with. Nothing really deep or interesting really happens. There is no conclusion to some of the most interesting stories, There is no real point or final idea for wrestling in the garden, edited badly, and it is and is basically a cheap and unsuccessful scam of Beyond the Mat. <br /> <br /> Wrestling Wise, this is pretty boring. The best protuberances are at the beginning, and slowly they become less surprising and shocking. If you've seen Japanese fights, Indie fights, or even Fight Back DVDs, this will not surprise you or surprise you. If you want to fight, do not make the same mistake as me and see this one. Look for some CZW ECW or XPW Dvds. <br /> <br /> The only thing I got from this documentary was how stupid people can be. Not by supporting self-mutilation or doing dangerous tricks, but by reasoning to commit these acts. The backyards seem stupid for the fight. Most of them are unemployed, and probably have some problems in their heads, and fighting is a type of therapy for them. That the supporters seem even more idiotic. Mothers basically take all the "if you can not beat them" reasoning to face the fact that their children are killing themselves. The figures of the school authority support their students in their dangerous maneuvers because it is an alternative to joining gangs and, to a lesser extent, doing drugs, which is quite funny since that segment took place in a rural town, where people live 20 miles from each other. People are stupid. That's what I extracted from this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the reasoning and thoughts of someone who is brutalized in the fight and basically what the back of this DVD promises, download: the life of Nick Mondo. It is more amazing and interesting than the backyard, and much more entertaining. Oh, and it's really good.
