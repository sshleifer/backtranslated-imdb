The Bone Snatcher is about a group of miners who are searching for a group of miners who have disappeared in the Namib desert. When they find them, they are nothing but stripped bones and could not have died for more than six hours. The story keeps you interested in what exactly caused this. The characters are well enough, and the acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Approximately one hour and ten minutes when you discover what is causing the bones to be cleaned, you sigh "oh, that's really stupid." The film is ruined by bad writing and a non-exciting ending. Until then, the movie was pretty good, and it's a shame that it took such a bad turn. So I can not recommend this movie. I gave him a 4/10.
