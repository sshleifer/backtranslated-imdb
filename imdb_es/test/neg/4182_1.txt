After sitting through the trainwreck that was the first Dark Harvest movie, I could not leave it bad enough. Seeing that there was a sequel (or rather what I thought was a sequel) I had to increase my pain level. Seeing that this had nothing to do with Dark Harvest, that should have been a good thing. We did not get any murderous scarecrows in this case, instead, we had a donkey walking through a field of corn screaming little things like "Girls!" and "can you hear me?" Occasionally. In addition, we got two (four, if you include the two girls that the director wanted the same effect as the twins in The Shining), hateful little girls who could not act. And the icing on this mess would have to be the corn cop. I should have known that this movie was going to be terrible when the dog got an opening credit. How I managed to stay awake through this movie, I'll never know.
