Approximately one step above the film of the Olsen twins, there is no surprise here, except for how repulsive Depardieu, who is clumsy and hunchbacked, walking on the beach without a shirt. Was this guy supposed to be a kind of gallant? Quasimodo hubba hubba? Okay whatever. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is a great actress, whose career in recent years has shown much of her potential as a comedy and dramatic actress, but this film definitely did nothing to offer her a breakthrough role. His insipid character lacks any trace of personality or self-esteem, spending all his vacation crushing a cute boy who thinks he's the best man in the world (basically because he's a cute boy), but can not be honest with him for two seconds. Ladies , let me tell you something; If a boy is really interested in you, he will not get mad because you tried to pass your dad as your boyfriend. You may be a bit confused about why you would do something so foolish, devised and ... incestuous, but in the end it will only be something you will laugh at. <br /> <br /> The plot and the dialogue hit each click on the right. No originality or ingenuity ... but it is ridiculous, annoying SWEET and Ben is ridiculous, monotonously cute so that viewers who think that Titanic is the best movie ever made, will say that this movie is great because they will not notice that it is not like that. have a brain in your head A star.
