So THIS is where the head of the Columbia Short Issues Unit had its start as Director, huh? Yes, it is none other than Mr. Jules White who is credited (or is rather, "exposed") as the Director of this entry in the MGM DOGVILLE Series. Given the co-credit as co-director is one Zion Myers; His name so far is unknown to us. Mr. Meyers was, without a doubt, the guy who controlled the four-legged actors and was responsible for training and "acting." In short, he must have been the dog trainer on the set. <br /> <br /> The title of this short comedy is undoubtedly a play in the MGM feature film of the same year, THE BIG HOUSE; starring Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery and a stellar cast in support. We must plead ignorance regarding this title; Not having seen it until this point. (Sorry, Schultz!) But there are a lot of gags that relate to what we've read about the movie *; Not to mention some specific gags of the particular character. For example, we observed a canine convict who stuttered and deduced, correctly, that the Bow Wow actor imitated the character's comedian, Roscoe Ates. Then we did a cross check with the cast of THE BIG HOUSE and presto, his name is there! (Brilliant deduction, one worthy of Holmes & Watson!) <br /> <br /> THE PRACTICE OF popular characters was already a proven and true practice in the field of comedy. It was one that seemed to have no objection from the producers and owners of the copyrights of the main films; but quite contrary it received heaps of tassive approval. After all, it is said that imitation is the most sincere form of adulation; In addition, any producer would appreciate even a seemingly irreverent parody. ** AS TO THE FILM, to ourselves, we found it interesting in a perverse way. Seeing so many of "The best friends of man" being so artificially animated in one long and boring anthropomorphic gag seemed very exhausting to us, who formed the audience. I mean, how many puppies were made to bark, unnecessarily, to achieve the illusion of 'talking'? <br /> <br /> WHEN IT COMES TO PETS, OR "ANIMAL COMPANIONS" as the politically correct audience prefers, we are quite eclectic; favoring not only dogs; But also cats, hamsters and parakeets. We do not like to see any animal exploited in such a large and not so fun game format. <br /> <br /> SO INCREDIBLE As it may seem, the step Mr. Jules White made with the MGM shorts to run the Columbia 2 Reeler production seems to have been not just an increase of $ in the area of finance $; But at $ o in arti $ tic content. We never thought of being Producer-Director for such luminaries as the 3 Stooges, Andy Clyde and Hugh Herbert, as well as some who had certainly seen better days, such as Charley Chase, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon; It would be a step up cinematically. <br /> <br /> IN CASE We have not yet made our point; we are officially paneando this. Therefore, see it at your own risk. We warn you! <br /> <br /> NOTE * We read excellent stories from both THE BIG HOUSE and Laurel & Hardy send-up, PARDON US (Hal Roach / MGM, 1931) in MR. LAUREL & MR. HARDY by John McCabe (1962) and THE FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY by William K. Everson (1967). Both books have our most enthusiastic support. <br /> <br /> NOTE ** The image of the prison became a genre of its own; Everyone owes a debt to LA CASA GRANDE. In PARDON US, Laurel & Hardy, Hal Roach and their Director made a first-class parody, the first of many; for a prison comedy it became a mandatory issue for many funny men of the screen to come.
