Among the many awards here for this production, there was a person whose comments asked him if he / she was the only one (who was not so fascinated by him), that is, he gave 3 stars to this movie. However, the comment continued to indicate a general taste for history and another production of it. Well, this person is not the "only" one, who did not like this production (including me!), But there I separate myself from the company even with him / her. If you put a gun to my head and asked me to make a choice between shooting or watching this movie again, I would see it, no doubt, but I would probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it. However, I prefer to stay locked in solitary confinement, or have to look at the painting on the wall. Also, I would not like to see this story again, at any time, anywhere, or in any alternative presentation. Sometimes you feel like the pair of brown shoes of the comedian George Gobel when the rest of the world is a tuxedo, and this is one of those for me. I liked Angela Lansbury in one of my favorite movies, "Long Hot Summer", and although I was not a big fan of the show, I enjoyed "Murder, She Wrote". But HERE, not only did I not care about the story or other aspects, but I found the scream, the croaking, the singing and everything else about Angela about her extraordinary performance, maybe the PREVIOUS presence in any movie (or presentation in any another medium) that I have experienced. It was like an endless continuation of Audrey Hepburn, the same "over-the-top" Cockney who laughed at Rex Harrison, in the earlier parts of "My Fair Lady." But that was an incident in the plot, presented for light, comic effect and (fortunately) brief. No mercy, this was anything but brief, and to me it seemed as if it had lasted about 10 hours (Einstein's explanation of "relativity" at work). If I had not been with friends, with the need to remain, MY visualization would have been brief. However, I laughed at the episode of "Seinfeld" in which Elaine makes everyone angry because she tells them that she did not like "The English patient". My friends somehow looked at me the same way when I interrupted their waxing with enthusiasm for this movie. Give me some nails dragging noisily on a blackboard at any time.
