Great piece of fiction played as if in fact. Tonight I was looking at the Birdman of Alcatraz. Robert Stoud was not a tame model prisoner and he was in jail because it was pimping and a client did not pay. Once he got to jail, he was so uncontrollable that he spent most of his time in solitary confinement or in the prison hospital. He killed a few people in prison as well. This movie reminds me of the Birdman of Alcatraz, but even worse. Robert Stroud wrote books and contributed to society in some way. And the BOA had some indications of Strouds' madness. BUT this guy, Henry Young that Murder in the First is supposed to be a well-known bank robber who took hostages and hit them in more than one robbery. He was not a poor guy who ran into a grocery store, which turned out to be a post office and took some money. This man was a tough criminal. He also killed a person 3 years before going to Alcatraz. He killed another person in jail, not because of the isolation that ended more than a year before the murder. The true story of his life would have been more interesting. They did not even understand the warden's thing well. You can not be warden in 3 different prisons at the same time. And by all accounts, the director of the movie was a pretty tall guy like the guards. Also, if my calculations are correct, it is assumed that the Guardian played by Karl Malden in the BOA is the same director of the film. Oh boy Not only that, in this film we should think that poor Henry committed suicide. And he wrote the word victory. It's not true ... I could be alive right now. He was sent to Springfield, where Robert Stroud was also a prison medical center and then to Walla Walla for another murder he committed and then was released and jumped to probation in 1972, he could never be found. Maybe he's dating that type of CB Cooper who jumped from that plane in Washington state after committing a bank robbery lol. Now the performance was very good. Kevin Bacon is in that class of actors that includes Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, the hugely underestimated club of actors. Gary Oldman, well, they could have invented the part of the warden so he could interpret it because it was great. Christian Slater still sounds like Jack Nicholson, I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. Bacon's wife, Kyra Sedgwick, was in the movie, I think just because she is his wife. Although I like her, but not in this movie. For some reason I felt that this movie when it first came out was supposed to be a special project for Kevin Bacon. I feel that I could have taken a person who is truly a victim of the penal system, sure there is enough of them and spread some light on their situation. In addition to choosing a psychopath to show as a victim.
