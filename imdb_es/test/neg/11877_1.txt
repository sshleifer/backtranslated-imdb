I've seen some bad action movies in my days, but this is just horrible. I feel it is a waste of time to write this, but I will cut it short. Why does this movie suck? Here are 10 reasons: 1. Directed and cut very amateur. 2. Bad bad bad acting of the entire cast. 3. Foolish dialogues and too many clich√©s. 4. Too many holes in the plot, many scenes do not add up. 5. Bad photography (and many continuity problems). 6. Ridiculously bad performance of the main actress. 7. Unreliable action scenes (and not too good ones). 8. Even for a Snipes movie, it shows a great lack of acting materials. 9. Outrageous accents (of the entire cast). 10. Last but not least, too many unlikely events, like a football tournament in the USA. The CIA must perform a background check to obtain new information about its employees, an explosion-proof mattress, etc. In essence, it's a waste of time, it's not funny, it's not entertaining, it's not even a joke.
