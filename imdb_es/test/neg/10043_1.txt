While the premise of the movie sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the movie, I could have stopped there and continued with my life. She gets some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects, but not really enough to add more validity to the movie. <br /> <br /> I also felt that he overreacted a little with a lot of things. If a man said a dirty comment, he grabbed her or made her a gesture of disgust, he would tell her to go, to knock him down, that he is a pig. However, what bothered me was that she would walk around revealing clothes and be surprised when the boys looked at her and told them to hell. <br /> <br /> I think somehow she forgot that being attracted to other people is an important part. Of human sexuality and a large part of who we are all. Boys will look at beautiful women, especially when they dress provocatively, just as women will see men when they wear a tight tank or no shirt. <br /> <br /> Some women may hate me for this, but I hope not. I have a lot of respect for women. I was raised by one. I also come from a Spanish family and we are very matriarchal. My grandmother was the center of my family for years, but I really do not think this helped women's rights and, for what the filmmaker even said, some women were offended by their project.
