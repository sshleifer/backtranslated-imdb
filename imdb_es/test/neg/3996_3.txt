At first I was interested in this movie after reading a synopsis and seeing some amazing screenshots, and the promise was there for a gripping horror movie of Dario Argento style. It is true that I must say that Argento's films have sometimes been quite incoherent, and some feel like a handful of visually stunning pieces loose with a vague connection plot. I have to say that I'm not really surprised. Even his masterpiece Suspiria, when examined, exhibits the same tendency to follow scenes sometimes unrelated only to the aesthetic impact. However, Suspiria also had the benefit of a singular main character and clear antagonists, as well as scenes that ultimately contributed to the final resolution. <br /> <br /> The Church, on the other hand, does not have any of these things. It has no protagonist, it is not a protagonist at all; in addition, it does not have a real plot to talk about, or crescendo, or climax, or outcome, or resolution. It is a completely hollow and incoherent work that looks as if Argento would sit down and think 'hey, that would make an interesting scene visually ... let's do it!' The movie is a series of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Initially it could be interesting, and Soavi's address is excellent, I must say. Soavi can not be criticized for the material, since it is made as convincing as possible. However, such a good address draws attention to the horrible flaws in the script, and it makes absolutely no sense. The attempt at a central unification plot is nothing more than the plagiarism of Carpenter's film, Prince of Darkness. Events happen only because the script so wishes, and the reactions to those events are completely unlikely. The narrative flow is irreparably damaged after a point, simply because there is no capacity to suspend disbelief; It's too ridiculous. Added to this, there are numerous factual errors that are so obvious that they become embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If it had been more overtly artistic and edited in a different work, it could have been chilling or tense. If it had become a real cohesive narrative, it could have been exciting. But it was not any of these. The best he achieved was confusing and, at times, exasperating. Plots are presented but never followed. The characters are forgotten and arbitrarily altered. No logic applies to any situation. It could have been frightening or interesting, but to get that kind of feeling requires more effort on the part of a screenwriter ... much more. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not worth seeing the Church for anyone. But total enthusiasts of the Italian horror that is more style than substance. This is Argento's style at its worst, and it is a strong justification for the usual criticism.
