OK, I went to this website before I saw this movie, read the comments, I was excited, because they were all pretty good for a B movie, I saw it and it disappointed me completely. The main characters who want to be a lone rebel straight from the Midwestern act were sick in the stomach, and I do not even mean the two cops, I mean there's a bloody door just in sight, take a look! The plot was completely predictable, the editing was quite limited, I swear the editor was even dozing near the end when I was cutting this movie, and the direction was clouded by a bad photograph. Now, please, do not get me wrong, I love B-flicks, some are really good. <br /> <br /> Want to see a good movie with a B rating? <br /> <br /> Dave recommends <br /> <br /> "High Tension" <br /> <br /> http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/
