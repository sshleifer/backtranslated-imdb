I acquired this movie a couple of years ago and when I tried to find some information I found that even the powerful IMDb did not have it on the list. That should have been all I needed to know. <br /> <br /> With Friends Like These is an anthology that plays as a collection of episodes of Twilight Zone / Outer Limits second category, all united by a bus trip that never seems To link with the rest of the movie. Of the three stories, the only one from which I gained any entertainment value was the second episode in which a man (more or less) grows from bacteria in a boy's refrigerator. This episode earns points for some humor points and is a strange premise. Apart from that, there is an episode with a talking car (soft and without direction) and an episode in which a girl visits a very unique dating agency (my dog ​​guessed the end of this). <br /> <br /> As mentioned in other comments, qualification 18 is totally unjustified. There is nothing to offend here. If you are looking for a good horror anthology, check out Asylum or Creepshow.
