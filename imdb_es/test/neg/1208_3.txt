This movie is the proverbial movie of the 80s that shows the viewer that while he or she tries something, they can be better than the professionals. Doug, the main character, demonstrated his abilities to fly a Cessna airplane, which in some way amounted to being fully capable of piloting a jet plane and being able to kill people. We would all like to have a few million dollars to play ... maybe make a good investment, donate, buy some things, but the directors of this movie decided to do Iron Eagle ... not once ... not twice ... not even three times; yes, four times What we hope most is the crowd of "Hollywood endings" in this film. Just when you think the movie is going to end after a cheesy ending sequence, there is another cheesy final sequence. Then another. Definitely, a movie that one must see to believe ... and perhaps possess it just to remind ourselves how incredible the 80's must have been.
