This is a boring, inert, self-important hole. When the only thing that suddenly gives life to a movie is a hanging, you know that the company is ruined. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as a caricature similar to an insect, narcissistic, charged with tics, self-indulgent, with a voice of cartoons. It is never explained why he is like that and we get little background information. The script focuses on Capote's writing "In Cold Blood" and his attachment to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four. The acclaimed writer of 'To Kill A Mockingbird', Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), accompanies Capote in his initial investigations into the crime, and his presence immediately suggests a much more interesting topic for a biographical film. Unfortunately, Lee quickly shies away in favor of endless scenes of Capote who laments his painful existence. Seeing it is like seeing Dr. Smith from 'Lost in Space' complain about his "delicate back" to anyone who hears it for two hours. The difference, however, is that Smith was fun to watch while Capote is not. The film's valuable self-esteem kills him, as does the reluctance of director Bennett Miller to add any kind of shading. Like the malicious piano score, the film is a one-note wonder that does not provide contrast, emotional colors or intimate drama. If Capote really was so irritating, why make a movie about him and wait for the audience to see him? Even though the support roles are well-performed (Chris Cooper is his own habitual stalwart), they have such a small dramatic purpose because, ultimately, it's all about Capote (!). Clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of Capote's "legend". Its product is the bait of dead bears ... and it is more evidence that a great image of gender has more "truth" than a dozen piles of garbage as sincere as this one.
