Well, let's start with the good: good scenery, Channing Tatum is easy to see, Amanda Seyfried has nice hair, that's all. How much of this movie was on the floor of the editing room? Probably the plot, the action, the good dialogue, and the point. Terrible performance, horrible choppy dialogue. Let me tell you how bad it is: my friend who always cries in the movies came to the part that was meant to evoke tears, and she laughed so hard that we thought she was crying. The film seems to want to prove too many problems: war, loss, autism, cancer, but it fails so miserably to cover any subject satisfactorily. Make sure you have something to eat and your cell phone to send text messages!
