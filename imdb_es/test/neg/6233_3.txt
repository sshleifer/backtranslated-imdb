I had never heard of "The Clearing" until one day I really got bored with some friends at the local Blockbuster and it caught our attention. The description on the cover of the DVD attracted our interest, but once we put it on the DVD player, the boredom was just beginning. <br /> <br /> The story went on for too long. It seemed to follow the same pattern as other movies that include a kidnapping. However, the parts with more suspense were at the beginning of the movie. After that, the scheme was exactly followed and that made "The Clearing" not original. The flashbacks were too many and the pain of the victim's family did not provide anything interesting nor did it improve the nature of the film. And I also discovered that I did not like the ending, so it probably led me to not like the movie. <br /> <br /> The performance was not horrible ... although it was not the best. Robert Redford has given much better performances. The tragic character of Willem Dafoe was the only one I really saw developing throughout history and the viewer really only sees that change in the last ten minutes or so in the movie. The representation of Helen Mirren as the wife of Robert Redford was flat and followed the same model as other films that include a tragic and heartbreaking event. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Clearing" is nothing special. about. Use the money from renting your movie on something else ... like "Garden State", maybe?
