After placing a mummy in a local museum through the cat's exploration, a metal object in its brain reacts adversely to the procedure, thus releasing the spirit, or ghost, if desired, of the mummy, Belphegor. Due to the right circumstances, Lisa, who lives near the museum, is possessed by the evil spirit. Very soon she is stealing the Egyptian treasures from the nose museum. Detective Verlac comes out of his retirement to catch the supernatural thief. <br /> <br /> This is useful enough, if you have not seen any other incarnation of "Belph√©gor" before. If so, I recommend skipping this particular version, as it can not help but pale in comparison to the others despite the good locals and the landscape. It plays like an original (slightly) more expensive science fiction movie, and I do not. I really say it as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sophie Marceau shows ass and side tits <br /> <br /> My grade: C- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: none
