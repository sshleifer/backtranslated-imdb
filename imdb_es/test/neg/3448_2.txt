Amanda Plummer, two stars <br /> <br /> with the look of a young version of her father, Christopher Plummer in the drag, stars in this film with Robert Forster, who really should have put a black shoe on top of that bald Spot. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Amanda Plummer in a good movie. She always plays these characters a little crazy in films that do not add up, and she does it once again in this one. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have two young women, sisters, who do not look at all in the least, who are allowed to be picked up separately by questionable men along the roads. <br /> <br /> Amanda's character, Sandra, has at least one good reason to allow Dr. Jake (Robert Forster) to pick her up in the first place. He has run off the road, apparently for a maniac, and his car is practically destroyed. <br /> <br /> Warning: Spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> However, as we move forward, we realize that Dr. Jake is not playing with a full deck more than Amanda. Make all decisions based on the launch of a coin. <br /> <br /> When Dr. Jake and Amanda arrive at a motel, who do we see but the maniac car, and what does Amanda do other than go to his station? Wagon and starts sniffing. His motive for doing this is never clear, since the man is apparently dangerous and could try to kill her. One would think that the last thing he would do is put himself in such a precarious situation. <br /> <br /> He not only snoops, he finds some money and takes it. <br /> <br /> Soon after we have other things that do not add up. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake, with Amanda as his passenger, runs out of fuel, and both of them abandon their car and start walking. One would think that crossing a desert, would have checked your gas meter - this seems very unlikely for it to happen. Then, later, he is seen driving the same car. When or how did you recover the car? <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake tells Amanda that he knows that she has taken the money. Now, how would he know? He did not see her do it for what I know, and she did not tell him she did it. <br /> <br /> Then, later, we have a character named Santini (David Thewlis), the man who was driving the station wagon, take them both and we will be damned if he does not know that Amanda also took the money. How would I know that? <br /> <br /> It loses credibility at an alarming rate as we move forward. <br /> <br /> When Alice, Amanda's sister (Fairuza Balk) gets into the killer's clutches and decides her fate in flipping a coin - one would think she would be very, very careful that the coin that changes for a trick coin it would definitely be the trick coin - but apparently it is not. <br /> <br /> They are discordant things like this, that destroys any credibility that this film has had.
