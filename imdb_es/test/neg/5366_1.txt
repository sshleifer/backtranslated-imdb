I was excited to see this program when I started watching promotions at A & E. I've been fascinated with ghosts and the paranormal since I was a child, and I love catching "Ghost Hunters" when it's on (SciFi Channel). I have tried to see three episodes of "Paranormal State" and I have only used my time to comment because it is very bad and perpetuates the idea that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a gullible fool. "Paranormal state" is beyond corny. Voices in off of "Director's Log" that will make you wish Captain Kirk. Cheesy teasers that fall into commercial breaks that are taken completely out of context. Everything paranormal in this program is automatically assumed as "evil" and the work of a demonic spirit. Then come the exorcists, the demonologists, the psychics ... as in "Poltergeist" you almost expect the team to leave and say "This house is clear". I really appreciate the approach of "Ghost hunters", which they enter to refute the claims, then they take what they can ... and almost always reassure the client (if they find something) that the persecution is not evil. "Paranormal state" is not "so bad that it's good" ... it's just bad. Did not A & E usually represent "Art and Entertainment"? The artistic part has been long gone, and the entertainment factor is now also decreasing.
