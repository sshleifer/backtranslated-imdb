I saw this movie without knowing what it was beforehand. I was intrigued for the first full hour. It was shaping up to be a great thriller. A very talented cast and good dialogue. Then, everything collapsed for me when I saw the first vampire. I could not believe what I was watching. A great thriller was shot by the toilet. The rest of the movie from that moment on was totally horrible. <br /> <br /> I gave him 4 stars just for the brilliant start. I think that's a little generous, but I entertained for a while. I'm not a fan of vampire or zombie movies. If you are, then you can disagree with my opinion.
