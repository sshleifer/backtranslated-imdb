This film was released in the United Kingdom under the name of Blood Rites. It was completely banned and was never presented again for its launch. <br /> <br /> Like The Ghastly Ones, it was supposedly a hit among the horror-hungry inhabitants of the famous 42nd Street Grindhouse circuit in New York City. If you are looking for a bloody horror, then you will find it in this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately to see Colin (Hal Borske) disabled in the development of a living rabbit, you have to put up with it. An unstable 16mm camera job that makes Ed Wood look positively wonderful. <br /> <br /> Three sisters must spend three days in the family home with their husbands before disbursing the old man's money. Naturally, in such a situation, people begin to fall dead. Family secrets are exposed and a lot of blood is spilled, especially during a frightful dismemberment. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the bunnies the British opposed, I know.
