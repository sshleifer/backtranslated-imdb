I only saw this because I saw a couple of good reviews for this, so I expected at least one corny movie halfway through. Toybox does not even deliver that. There are so many problems with this movie that I do not even know where to start, so I'll list a couple of major problems (again, spoiler warning, just read them, it will save you the trouble of watching this later). <br /> <br /> One, this movie starts with, and often mentions, the mythical folklore of Celeste Noir (A Witch, who the main character claims to be the reincarnation of), and the Folker medium (or something so, an evil man with a big smile that cuts people with hooks and sells their bowels in cakes). I liked that, it was a nice concept, anything that had to do with the cakes is just nice. But then you see the movie and it's all about this idiot girl and her boyfriend (And what was the deal with him? Was he a psychic? Did he have powers? Why did he still see visions that not even the so-called 'Witch' had? Do you realize?), And they know their crazy family. They are not really crazy, they just argue a lot. That's what most of this film is, arguing, and almost never touch the supposed myth, except in a couple of confusing scenes that can not be seen face or face. <br /> <br /> In one scene, Berenice (the main character related to the witches) wanders and does some kind of ritual by candlelight. It seemed quite important, but absolutely NOTHING happened after she did it, just wasted my time more. <br /> <br /> And who the hell was that guy with his dog? Do you see him walking to the house from the beginning of the movie with that evil red-eyed dog, and then he finally arrives and they kill him? What the hell?? Was he the middle? Was your dog possessed? Did someone kill the dog? They never really showed that. In addition, any scene involving the Vicar was completely useless and only served to weakly explain the boring ending. It was as if they had all these interesting character ideas and did not go anywhere! The boyfriend, who obviously had some kind of powers but never explains them. The grandmother, who also seemed to have some kind of witch power, but never used them. The Vicar, who ... Okay, it does not matter, it really did not make any sense for his existence. And then there was Berenice and her stupid amulet. Could he really do magic, or simply use it to reflect light and blind people? This was a complete waste of time, and the only reason I give it two stars is because a) Berenice is a bit cute, and b) she mentioned cakes. Save yourself the money to rent this and, dear god, do not even think about buying it, unless spending money is a new fad.
