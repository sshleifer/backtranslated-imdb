Jerry Angell, owner of the best zombie-horror mullet, returns for more undead action in the aftermath of the atrocity at the bloody zombie house of the Todd Sheets feast. This time, Jerry plays a sleazy little thug who, along with his equally guilty partner in crime, some fugitive convicts, several teenagers and a group of screaming girls, come face to face with a horde of scandals. , corpses that eat meat. <br /> <br /> Obviously, having learned little about how to improve their craft in the two years since Zombie Bloodbath, Sheets offers another film of poor quality from a movie that somehow manages to be even worse than the original one feat that I thought was almost impossible to achieve. The acting is lousy and uniform, the effects amateur and cheap (most of the gore seems to be nothing more than a selection of cuts, spoils and blood from the local butcher shop), the incomprehensible story (as far as I could understand, the zombies resurrect from among the dead because a scarecrow commands them to do so !!!), and the address loaded in a frustrating way with cheap-looking video effects and completely meaningless black and white cuts. <br /> <br /> And as if it were not like that. Enough to convince you of the complete lack of redeeming features of this movie, the simply absurdly stupid ending should do the trick: the few remaining survivors come across an abandoned truck that conveniently has a lot of bacteria that eat meat in its seat. passenger: what is needed to dissolve the undead (but, oddly enough, it is not harmful to the living at all).
