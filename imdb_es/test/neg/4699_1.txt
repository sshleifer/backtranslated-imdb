This movie had all the ingredients of a good adventure movie, but it revealed incompetence at almost every level. <br /> <br /> The presence of Roger Moore on the cast list is usually a sign that the film is not going to be anything but mediocre, because Moore always has leading roles and can not act. But this movie also included Ian Holm and Lee Marvin, and it was based on a book by Wilbur Smith, so I thought about giving it a try when I saw the DVD for sale at the bargain ... <br /> <br /> It was a mistake. The opening scene seemed to start in the middle of a roll, with a sound that appeared suddenly as if the first second of the soundtrack had been truncated. The scene showed a dreadnought in the sea with a German crew. This bad edition was a sign of things to come, but the scene with the battleship was interesting enough to keep seeing me. The special effects were good, and the team wore the right uniforms and spoke in German, indicating that the director at least paid attention to the historical details. I was surprised <br /> <br /> So I kept looking, and then Moore showed up and my assumptions were confirmed. Bad acting, cliché lines, clichéd cinematography and cheap humor ... but the worst of all is that there is a disastrous attempt to mix the casual feeling of the film with drama and tragedy. It just does not work <br /> <br /> Does the movie end as suddenly and as badly as it started? In the middle of a reel.
