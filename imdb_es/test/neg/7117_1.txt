Not well done at all, the whole movie was just rancor and killing people randomly from nothing. Random people who have nothing to do with history are killed, like the 3 girls at school, for example. <br /> <br /> The family at the beginning also has nothing to do with the story, I think they are random. A family that never entered the house and that never had anything to do with the murders of Grudge. <br /> <br /> It did not impress me at all, I was not afraid, I did not jump anywhere, and the whole movie was just a random piece of shit to get more money. It also makes Gridge 1 look like shit, which was actually a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think The Grudge 2 is like a main movie in The Grudge 3, if they ever make one. You should not even have called Grudge 2 to this, they should have called it the prologue of Grudge 2, and you'll see if you've seen it, because I'm not going to ruin anything. Not that it would have mattered anyway. <br /> <br /> 1/10, it's not scary, it's a bad story, and it's completely random.
