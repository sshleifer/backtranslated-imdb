This is a movie that was probably made to entertain the kids from high school and early high school. Maybe for them it's fun, they can even see some fear in him. For me, the acting is bad and the plot is bad, there just is not much value for the adult viewer. I saw this movie as weak and boring. Sometimes there was a possibility that the film might become interesting, but in reality it never materialized. The creatures look pretty good, but after seeing them for a few seconds, they do not seem to have any substance other than the look. Sometimes I was not sure if the movie was trying to make another comedy attempt or if it was just another horror attempt that failed again. This movie was not good for me.
