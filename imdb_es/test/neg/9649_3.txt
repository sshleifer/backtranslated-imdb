First, let me say that I am not someone who is normally afraid of having to think while watching movies. For example, I love Tarkowsky's films. Berghman is also a favorite ... but this? The positive points can be easily summarized: the photography is splendid and the music is perfect ... is it a good movie? I used to think so, but this is a perfect example of one that (for me) does not succeed ... maybe it's because I'm too stupid. possible, but I do not think so ... Tarkwosky, for example, also used very long shots, but what he never did was shoot 5 minutes of the same exact image of two people walking (and I mean only their heads, because in this film is a lot of those shots, but sometimes it is effective, the overall result is boring, even with the intelligent nuances (which are done in a way that, although intelligent, is above all very pedantic) <br /> <br / > He also always feels that the director is doing some of the long shots, not because of the aesthetic or symbolic effect, but because of the budget ... <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed in this film, because I really liked the films first 30 minutes or so, but it went on and on, without even maintaining the same level as in the first scenes ... <br /> <br /> While reading Very praising the comments on this page, I also have the feeling that some people just try to see a lot more in the movie to what there is ... when a film is slow and artistic, it is not necessary arily means that it is very deep ... yes, it is an allegory about the musical theory located in the context of a small city, which is quite interesting in itself, but it does NOT make a deep film ... except for people who absolutely want to do a kind of intellectual masturbation, but it's not what you find in the movie, but what you find in yourself ... an exercise which, in my opinion, can be done much more effectively while watching "Stalker" or "Solyaris" than Werckmeister Harmonies, which owes much to Tarkowsky, but the taxi never equals its level ...
