I have a word: focus. <br /> <br /> good. <br /> <br /> IMDb wants you to use at least ten lines of text. good. Let's discuss the fine points of focus. I do not know about the rest of you, but in my first year at film school we were shown a lot of useless garbage, like 'someday, everyone will be famous cutting-edge filmmakers', but they also taught us how. To make this crazy call FOCUSING the lens! It was incredible! You give a little twist and wow! Everything is clear as a bell. the person who fired what Alice found needs to learn some things about the finer points of focus. lighting, too. This movie is not only completely out of focus, it also lights up like the corner of someone's basement. <br /> <br /> I do not even mean the rhythm or the argument. they could have trimmed about ten seconds at the beginning and end of each shot. <br /> <br /> but who cares about that anyway? There is not enough lurid in this film to compensate for the absolute lack of consideration towards the best friends of the film: FOCUS, and LIGHTING. <br /> <br /> words for the wise.
