This movie is certainly strange to say the least. The basic plot is that 3 former business partners invite 2 strangers to their home to return a lost wallet with 10 dollars in it. The two that appear fall in love. The 3 older businessmen die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two younger guests. Well, that may make sense, but then we have 3 old guys who apparently have some bread living together ... a little weird here ... Harry Carey plays his part off the base, you can not tell if he's a good guy or really a prick. I mean really, I decide that I can handle it. Then there's Richard Carlson playing James Houston of Texas ... hmmmm, he sounds more like a southern Kentucky gentleman than a Texas person. This is not even close. Then we took the 3 ghosts who would have more chances to help the New Orleans Saints win a game in the game instead of helping ... In fact, they really are not of any help and why they are even in the movie it is beyond any scope of knowledge. Stupid movie in which a cast of characters acts totally out of place. You can avoid this.
