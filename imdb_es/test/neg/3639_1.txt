Shopping, sunny skies, beaches, internships for rich teenagers and perfectly happy endings. Welcome to the life of Zoey Brooks and her friends. Zoey Brooks is played by Jamie Lynn Spears, the self-proclaimed actress who became famous as the younger sister of international pop star Britney Spears. With her lovely blonde wig in the first season and an attempt to hide her monotonous accent of the country, it is confirmed that Nickelodeon has gone to dogs with nepotism. When Kristin Herrera, the actress who played Dana Cruz in the first season, left the show, all hope expired since she was the only decent actress. Female casting is a total disgrace, but male casting has potential for a teenage medium. If they continue to chase Jamie Lynn Spears as the image of perfection, many people will have to lower their standards. With hope, you will soon discover that you can not make a run out of nothing. Jamie Lynn Spears is useless to act, sing and whatever else she tries for that downward spiral that calls a race. You do not have to wonder why she is a self-proclaimed actress. Critics will definitely proclaim it as something more than that.
