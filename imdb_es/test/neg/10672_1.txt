Ego. It seems that is the only reason why this movie was made. This film is so wrong in so many ways that it is below one's dignity to write much about it. All the characters were only good at autoalogarse and the main actors (I use this term generously as the director has) emote in the similarity of the stone. The little story, if any, fails in basic aspects such as logic, feeling and drama. The address leaves a lot to be desired. Flagrant flaws are everywhere (the motives of the characters are not defined, the future husbands meet overnight, the broken windows of the cars are arranged among themselves) <br /> <br /> Let's face it, Himesh can not act. Neither, it seems, can Hansika Motwani. In her defense, she is still a chubby girl who looks older than her thanks to tons of makeup. Raj Babbar overreacts and makes his small presence as false as possible. Darshan Jariwala laughs a little too much. The actor who plays Himesh's friend is the only natural. <br /> <br /> some questions come to mind: how can a movie like this cost Rs.500,000,000? Where did the money go??? He conceded that a chase sequence was moderately well shot and Mallika Sherawat was paid an Rs.15,000,000 obscene for her appearance of 15 minutes and 2 songs. but the sheer stupidity of the movie stuns the mind. (including 3 rickshaws from Mumbai that appear and jump in a police car) <br /> <br /> the good: Himesh shows courage by allowing the film to mock his nasal voice and his trademark "topi". Let's give what belongs to the devil: Himesh, as usual, gives good music. <br /> <br /> The bad: Direction, History, the singing of Himesh is still hard to ignore <br /> <br /> The ugly: dialogues and everything else! <br /> <br /> Final word: Painful in every sense of the word! Watch this movie only if you loved "Yaadein" by Subhash Ghai
