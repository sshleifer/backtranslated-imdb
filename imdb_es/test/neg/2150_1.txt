This has to be the worst case of excess action since the silent era. Not just one or two actors, but practically the entire cast. Lee Majors and Bo Svenson were fine, but the rest seem to have performed for the first time. <br /> <br /> So the budget was not tremendous. Much of the costumes and the set were credible, but there were many things that came to the attention of the viewer to let us know that they could not verify twice or that all the accessories coincided with the period. I can not think of one aspect of the movie that I liked or that I did not shake my head. Your time will be better spent burning the fuzz collected from your navel.
