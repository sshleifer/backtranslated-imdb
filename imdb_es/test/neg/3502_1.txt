What a disappointment. The story line is very simple: "good people sometimes do bad things and bad people sometimes do good things", dressed in a racial environment so that it looks intelligent, sophisticated and meaningful. It is not. It lacks subtlety. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens is telegraphed and then repeated in case the explanation has been lost. <br /> <br /> For a movie like this, convince and move the audience. it must represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivation and actions; not simply present it as a series of 180-degree changes in the actions of each character. <br /> <br /> Halfway there I really did not want to waste any more time on it, but I thought I would stay with him in case he got better; Big mistake that should have stopped then - it just got worse.
