It's okay, I'll be brief. This movie was not only bad, it was very bad, with lines like "if you deal with the devil that you expect to have in your shoes", you know that you are in a territory of frightening films. After seeing this movie, I wanted to kill myself and kill my whole family, it gave me such a vast feeling of self-hatred that I wanted to kill. Do not watch this movie. I will kill again. but when it does, it will be published terribly with a pathetic soundtrack and action sequences for rent and bad shirts. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there's an opposite side, it's the first action movie to feature a three-door Ford saw. . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it ends up shattered on its roof :( <br /> <br /> Ps: Worse than the shooter
