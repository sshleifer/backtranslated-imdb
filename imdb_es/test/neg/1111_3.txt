The concept of this film is quite convincing: zombie children who come out of an abandoned mine to seek revenge for their deaths in Pennsylvania's forests. Cool The problem I had with the movie is the lack of creativity when dealing with zombies. The creators could have really animated this movie with some terrifying images of "The Ring", like stopping the action, walking with the camera backwards or things like that. When the zombie children are walking through the woods, they look like a group of 9-year-old children walking to a playground in West Philadelphia. Instead of pickaxes and shovels, they could have easily carried baseball bats and gloves. Why would I fear these little children? Anyone could flee in a straight line towards safety. Besides, who in their right mind would have stayed overnight with their children in that spooky and dilapidated house? The moment I opened that door and looked around, I would have said, "Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm Son, go start the car, I'll go back to urinate in a bush and then we'll get out of here. "Totally incredible movie. Do not waste your time.
