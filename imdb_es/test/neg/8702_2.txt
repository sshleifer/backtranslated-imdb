I realize that it is very difficult to live up to the first movie of The 10 Commandments (which was great and personally I'm not a fan of Charleton Heston) but wow ... this movie / miniseries was disappointing. Even the lively Prince of Egypt was better. <br /> <br /> The only thing that threw me out was Ramses. Compared to Yul Brynner's version, Paul Rhys' version seemed so weak and unlike Pharoh. The acting really was not so good. For a modern adaptation, I expected something better. It just did not look as visually impressive as the first one. I guess they were running on a tight budget or something. There is a narrator of occasional locutions that I find strange and unnecessary. It also broke the flow of history. And um ... the voice / lines of God were strange.
