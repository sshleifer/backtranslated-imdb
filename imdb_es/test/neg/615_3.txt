This is a movie that really makes me tremble. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons made some of their best cartoons, with incredible animation, exceptional backgrounds and great stories. Then, at the end of the 40s, a new style of animation began to appear (like the "Crusader Rabbit" series on TV): animation with extremely simple illustrations to save money. Unfortunately, the cynical work of Columbia Picture worked! Instead of the public hating the toons (as they should have done), many accepted them and the Oscar people (AMPAS) actually gave this film the prize for the best animated short film: it grants legitimacy to an inferior product. Unfortunately, in the world of dollars and Hollywood sense, this soon began to infiltrate the products of legitimate studios, which resulted in pretty bad caricatures. Later, it got even worse, in addition to the animation and lousy backgrounds, the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to see. The cunning and style of the classic cartoons had disappeared. And for this tragedy, I blame, in part, GERALD MCBOING-BOING, one of the grandchildren of cheap cartoons. The story is not so bad, but the animation is a horror and listening to the child say "boing-boing" is incessantly a pain.
