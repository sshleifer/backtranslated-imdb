I would not recommend this movie. Although it is classified as G and is clear to children, there are enough insults (including the dreaded words 'F' and 'S'). Does not this kind of language offend me particularly, but in a children's movie? Let's go. <br /> <br /> There was also a bit of implicit sexual content, between one of the first teenage male characters and any adult volunteer woman who came, including a prostitute! <br /> <br /> The performance was as good as it looks in this movie genre, but the story line was very cheesy and even my four-year-old son commented that it was "stupid". > Despite having Elizabeth Shue, this movie is definitely not worth seeing if you have not seen her.
