This movie was horrible. He focused too much around Eddie, Clark Griswald's brother-in-law. Eddie works much better when he changes good comments, such as "Christmas Holidays" and "Holidays." <br /> <br /> I really do not understand how a movie like this would be revised. Now, do not get me wrong, I like Randy Quaid, but I felt that this movie was totally wrong for him and for the character in general. This movie leaves a lot to be desired and I really needed some names of bigger actors.
