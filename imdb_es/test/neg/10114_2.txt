It is a pity. There is an interesting idea here, but it is completely lost in a confusion of Commodore 64-style computer effects and bad stories. The plot, as it is, concerns a bounty hunter of souls. It should be a fairly simple hunter / hunter story type, but the director and / or the writer seem to have forgotten what the movie was supposed to be about three days before filming. The fact that the main bad boy seems to be wearing a cheap Darth Maul mask, which they tried to disguise with the bright colors of the CG, did not help matters. There is not much to recommend here, even the title seems to take it to the dark.
