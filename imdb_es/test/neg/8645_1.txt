I went to see this movie in the cinema because of the strength of its potentially interesting subject, a good cast, a director who had previously performed the highly rated "Once Were Warriors" and my fondness for the noiris films set in Los Angeles in the 1940s and fifty. I would say that I am reasonably easy to please in this category of movies; I appreciate the classics of the genre, but I will sit down and enjoy a half decent effort if also derived. However, I found this movie completely unbearable. <br /> <br /> Despite a good situation in which to locate the story, nobody seems to do or say anything remotely interesting or entertaining in the two full hours of this unfortunate disaster. . Good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue that go from the banal to the shameful. The narrative is lazy and dragging unbearably, and none of the events it describes are handled well enough to do anything but lead the public to death. There is no drama, no atmosphere, no tension, absolutely no entertainment value and, in the end, I simply did not care what happened because I did not believe in anything in the movie. <br /> <br /> L.A. Confidentiality was published a year later and, regardless of whether a version of the story is more true to reality, this latest film deserves all the applause for its excellence in each department. On the contrary, Mulholland Falls fails in all departments, a fact that became even more tragic because of the amount of talent involved. If you ever show this on an airplane, I'll keep going.
