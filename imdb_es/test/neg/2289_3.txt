Although some would prefer to comment on the value of Bond films in relation to the frequency of learning, and while most of the jargon that tends to limit Bond to a scarce following 007 has been exploited beyond reasonable containment, There are several redeemable possibilities for Sean Connery's credibility in this dual role he had seen his counterpart adaptation in part from an earlier Jessica Tandy performance in Driving Miss Daisy. While Connery had been less visible in the latter, his qualities as a female seeker might not have grimaced in the face of bitter viewers as he would in this latest version, which, for those most involved, addressed the issue 007 with a kind resentment, although the general flavor had been altered. Ideal for those who interest others while pretending to be who they are not!
