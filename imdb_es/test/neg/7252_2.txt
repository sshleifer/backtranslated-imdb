I do not believe that the amount of military errors and strategically contained in this turkey can be overcome. Everything in this mess became cheap and the soldiers looked really stupid. Examples: at the beginning, the lieutenant gives a strategic advice to the 2-star General and accepts it without hesitation. The map used by the lieutenant shows the enemy positions but apparently they only have a narrow valley to use to advance in the battalion (although the map showed a dozen more). The rear guard takes the position from which the enemy sees them clearly and exposes them. They hit our heroes from high places, but this superior firepower does not make much difference. A single enemy tank advances near the end (at the beginning called the armored division), comes from a solitary infantry point (!) That moves extremely slowly without covering the area, then dispenses the tank when it considers it safe to continue. - A stranger scene. The soldiers take refuge in a cave. Around it there is ice and deep snow, but in the cave, no more than a meter from the entrance, there is a deep puddle through which everyone vadeos repeatedly: their feet would last only a few minutes before they freeze. Later, the survivors wade pathetically slowly and rise through a river to return to their unit. Remember that it is deep winter and the ground is frozen. Yeah sure! <br /> <br /> And so on. They shout orders to positions on higher ground, lay mines near their own position and warn each other not to trample them (!) At first, credit is given to a soldier who received the Congressional Medal of Honor. Was he blind or was Director Fuller simply ignoring him? Truly, the most inept soldiers I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> One of them peeks into his own injured leg with a bayonet and eventually pulls out a piece of shrapnel, without a grimace or a moan. He announces that he must qualify as a surgeon. Now that was funny.
