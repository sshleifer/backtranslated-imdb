Except for the appearance of the talented impersonator of the Austin Powers, Richard Halpern, this photo was his parody of Mill's film. The dated references of films will not help the audiences that may arise in this future. Watch for "Groovy" Austin Powers in the jacuzzi. It's a flash and a half. <br /> <br /> Poor special effects are overcome with the appearance of numerous stars in tiny suits, so at least that should keep you entertained (if that's what moves you). <br /> <br /> For my money, I would rent the classic parodies DVD like "Airplane" or "Lobster Man from Mars".
