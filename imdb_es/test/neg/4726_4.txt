This is another notorious Mexican horror movie: however, although the original Spanish version is quite docile, all types of gore and nudes were inserted for the English-bent variant (prepared by Jerald Intrator, who performed similar tasks in THE CURIOUS DR .HUMPP [1967/71] - and, like the American version of that movie, had previously been available on DVD through Something Weird / Image). <br /> <br /> I first saw the original and, although there were no major jolts, it was quite attractive, especially with a plot as familiar as this one: a doctor goes beyond duty in trying to save the life of his terminally ill child he even has a great assistant with a set of legs (played by Carlos LÃ³pez Moctezuma, who had rehearsed a surprisingly similar role, albeit in a more sinister vein, in THE CRYING WOMAN'S CURIA [1961]). I know that several Mexican films mixed horror with the genre "Lucha Libre" (Lucha Libre), but I had never seen one; this element is present here, in fact, the heroine is a fighter, but the two styles, perhaps fortunately, remain separate (that being said, the fighting sequences are performed competently, with some of the movements that are highly fun) . <br /> <br /> The doctor's son transforms into a monster (he looks like The Incredible Hulk with mud spattered on his face!) after he's been transplanted the heart of a monkey - but, then, when this is replaced with that of a comatose fighter, stays like that and grows a pair of fangs to boot (I should not have become a transsexual ... although I think it would not have been very interesting)! The climatic sequence on the roof, in which the monster kidnaps a child and finds its disappearance at the hands of the police, remembers THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN (1942). However, my unintentionally funny moments in the film occur when the doctor, trying to comfort his son, tells him that he will soon be cured, only to turn his back soon after the edge of tears, and also the impatient look gives him his disabled assistant (since the latter slowly wobbles in the car) when they are about to pursue the monster that has escaped from the laboratory. <br /> <br /> The alternative nude scenes work for the film (these were made by Cardona himself for a more racist Mexican version entitled HORROR AND SEX), but his reputation is based largely on the added material that shows exaggerated violence, such as the detachment of an eyeball, a burst and even that of a person. head being torn off There are also several graphic insertions of operations that, however, give rise to an error: although it is clear that there are only two people involved in the operation, we see a third pair of hands that constantly hold an oxygen mask to the patient's face! <br /> <br /> It is also said that the film is a loose remake of Cardona's own black-and-white horror film, DOCTOR OF DOOM (1962) but, as I have not seen it, I can not say. how much of that was really stolen for THE NIGHT OF THE SIMOS DE LA BERG ...
