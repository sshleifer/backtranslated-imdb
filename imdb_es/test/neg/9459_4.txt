I own this movie. And it's terribly hard to find. It's a small low-budget gore blood film about a doctor looking for the perfect partner. It has the really funny low budget feeling, and the gore is surprisingly good for what seems to be a $ 500 budget. The director is claimed to be the gore master. He would not go that far, but maybe in his time he was. In general 6/10 on the gore chart.
