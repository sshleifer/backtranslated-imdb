I was told that Jon was for a time in spiritual experiences. I assumed the movie would be interesting. In fact, it is not at all. It is not so deep for such a theme. Eternity is endless life. Experiences after death and "dejavu". The movie is not like a comedy, but it's not funny at all, at least it does not express. He is so naive. Lovely movie but naive movie. A need to avoid. The sequences of the Middle Ages seem to come directly from fairy tales and it is not the problem at all. Eileen Davidson is so lovely and Voight is doing everything possible. Normal is a co-producer and screenwriter of this film. The movie was released directly on video, so I discovered it in a video store. It's a shame because I know that Voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the movie is not that deep.
