An old Roger Moore has returned once again as Bond, this time trying to find out why Agent 009 was killed and why he had a Faberge egg fake with him, and where he came from. It ends in New Delhi, India, then in East Germany after learning of a Russian general who is trying to detonate a nuclear bomb in a circus, hoping that NATO will push for full disarmament, so that he can take control of Western Europe , then the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Despite what it sounds like, this is really more of an affair, I think, between Bond and Octopussy than an action movie, and quite long, but still something fun. But there are too many attempts at humor in this; Sometimes it seems like it was a comedy. Also, Timothy Dalton would have been better than Roger Moore in this, so there would not have been so much age difference between Bond and Octopussy. <br /> <br /> Useless curiosities: the small plane used by Bond in the sequence of previous credits is now hanging in a Quaker Steak and Lube restaurant in Clearwater / Largo, Florida, USA. UU <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of ****
