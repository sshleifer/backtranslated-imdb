I do not see the sense of going through so many problems to make a movie like this and then throwing the history book out the window. There was not a single exact detail in that movie other than the fact that Richtofen died, so I was grateful at the end, so I did not have to see anymore. Movies like this are an insult to anyone who knows anything about the air history of World War I. <br /> <br /> I'm going to overlook the obvious, that they flew in Fokker DVII in 1916, because the Blue Max did it too, or that. The 209 squadron flew SE-5 and will attack other parts. On the one hand, they call the Pfalz D-III an "old albatross" at the beginning. On the other hand, they have Voss, Goring and Wolff in Jasta Boelcke. The only one who was in that Jasta was Voss, and he joined after Boelcke died. Richtofen was not blamed for Boelcke's death ... Erwin Boehme, who collided with Boelcke, swerved to avoid a British plane that Richtofen was chasing. When Richtofen received a head injury, it was while attacking a two-seater FE-2d, and he did not crash in the trenches and had soldiers fighting for him, and NO ... Werer Voss did not die that day. He died on September 28 in one of the most epic battles of the First World War. <br /> <br /> Manfred was brief, not like the actor who rose above everyone else. His brother Lothar was also not in Jasta Boelcke, he joined the squad when Manfred was in charge of Jasta 11. <br /> <br /> There are so many other obvious mistakes in the historical fact that I will let them go, except perhaps the worst, the scene of death. In the film, Manfred is maneuvered by Brown and then knocked down, making a perfect landing. Brown escaped a burst in Richtofen while Richtofen pursued May, and the facts accumulated over the years overwhelmingly show that Richtofen was killed by field fire, not by Brown. <br /> <br /> The only value in this movie was the opportunity to see the flight scenes themselves, which were as good as 'The Blue Max', apart from that, I will not see it again and I paid $ 30 for the tape!
