The monstrous film, largely forgettable, from the 50s has really horrible special effects: the "claw" in question is a giant puppet that would make Jim Henson want to commit suicide. I just watched the movie last Thursday and I can not even tell you who was in it. That is a bad sign. They told me that when the movie premiered, the audience laughed at the screen ... and that was in the 1950s when the standards on special effects were much lower. Basically, I should have left the theater as soon as the words "produced by Sam Katzman" appeared on the screen if I knew what was good for me, but then I sat through "Harum Scarum", so I guess I deserve it .
