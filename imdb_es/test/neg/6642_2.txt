There are many mysteries in life. For example: Why do some of the people who are not Carrot Top agree to appear in this movie? Why did someone distribute this movie? Why did someone pay money to see it? I guess none of these questions will be answered, but one thing I know for sure is that this movie is one of the worst ever made with such a large budget. It would be bad, but the addition of the "humor" of Carrot Top makes it even worse. The only entertainment one could get from this movie is to burn it, crush it or destroy it in a funny way. If you had to classify it in every movie that was made, it would be correct between "Problem Child" and "Biodome". Nuff said.
