If you thought that this is the French The Mummy and if you expect another "Vidocq" ... look elsewhere. It has the same kind of story as The Mummy about this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 lost pieces that are scattered in the Louvre. I thought the movie was a little entertaining, boring for the most part. The special effects are not bad, but it's nothing spectacular, since I expected big explosions and maybe the Eiffel Tower collapsed until I realized that those kind of scenes were in The Mummy and this is Belhpegor. Apparently based on a French cult television series, Belphegor could have been much better. I voted this movie a 4/10 only for the beautiful Sophie Marceau ... she must be almost 40 years old and she looks awesome!
