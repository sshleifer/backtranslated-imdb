I'm sorry to say but I was disappointed in the movie. It was very hasty, since I guess you can understand a version of Pride & Prejudice that could last a movie and I felt that many of the main scenes were overlooked just to pass the story. As the movie is so hasty, unfortunately you do not know much and you feel a lot for each of the characters. <br /> <br /> Not only that, this movie is boring. I say it with a capital B. 1/3 of the way I started yawning and could not wait for the movie to end. When I read the book and watched the BBC version, I knew how many scenes I had to do before I could leave the cinema. Mr. Darcy, whoever you are in this movie, you definitely can not act. He seems too young to play Mr. Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is hurried, as if he had to go through the script or something like that. Where is the accumulation? At first, he seems confused with everything. He is simply weird! Everything is seen. <br /> <br /> I tried not to compare it to the Colin Firth version, but if you love that version, chances are you're disappointed. <br /> <br /> The costumes are absolutely stunning. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress like some kind of women's fashion, and she has not grown up in a squaller. Her dresses indicate that she could be the poorest peasant in all of England. <br /> <br /> I did not agree with a couple of scenes from the film on the fact that I do not think it's appropriate in that society for men to do such things, honestly, Mr. Bingley, who has wealth, you should know better. There are some things that are said to sound too modern for the period in which this movie takes place, and they do not look at all like Jane Austen. The character of Bingley is surprisingly made, for me he behaves like a simpleton, not as a character that he likes and respects. What about that laugh of yours? Wickham has almost no presence and Mr. and Mrs. Hurst and a couple of other characters have no presence. Keira did well, but it's not the same.
