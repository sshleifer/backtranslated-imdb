Produced by International Playhouse Pictures, it seems like filmed in a doll house. Everyone is a liar, everything is like a dream, like a toy without any reason. I'm not saying that everything in every movie should be totally realistic, but those incredible fantasy things and situations in a movie are too much. How did these good actors, particularly actresses, get to this movie? It's good to see Mia again; If we were meant to understand why her husband wants to kill her, Mia does it well. It is not funny, it does not move, only false. Stephen Dorff appears briefly at the end, appropriate for a work perhaps, less for a film, but this is not a way of measuring things. Terrible.
