This is one of the most ridiculously bad movies I've seen in my life. I can not believe that whoever wrote the previous review was serious. Maybe I was connected with doing it. It has nothing in its favor. There is no suspense, the performance is terrible, the direction desperate. The musical score (?) Are three trite notes played until the nausea. The plot (?) Must have taken all five minutes to write. Dialogue is what a 10-year-old child would propose if asked to do a homework project. The only (slightly) redeeming characteristic is the actor who plays the psychopath, who grimaces, trembles and burns magnificently and, therefore, is sometimes funny. The only reason he would be at the edge of his seat would be if he had a weak bladder. Do not waste your time.
