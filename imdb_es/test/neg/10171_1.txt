Like many of the comments about me, I also thought that this was the average science fiction movie, but unfortunately it was not. I found it rather condescending, and in fact, preaching. <br /> <br /> But that is not the only comment. The scenes are very "artificial" (not like scifi, as I will explain in a few moments). (The next sentence is a small spoiler). The movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups. The physical configuration of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing side by side, the middle one typically speaking. In the worst case, the other party is represented by a person. <br /> <br /> Also the interviews that the reporters have are very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. For example, sometimes the discussion is between the reporters (I mean, from one point of the interviewees, "uncomfortable"). In addition, the people interviewed always remain calm, they say everything without normal emotions. That is to say. You can not tell if they lie or not, they are crazy or not. They show almost nothing. <br /> <br /> This is also very unprofessional, the 'Christian' reporters always believe everything the people interviewing tell them. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: <br /> <br /> All conversations contain: <br /> <br /> - facts <br /> <br /> - arguments pro / con <br /> <br /> There are no lies. No one lies (The next sentence is a spoiler, ignore it if you still plan to see the movie) The only lie that is happening is to show how "bad" the unbelievers are. <br /> <br /> This makes me conclude that the movie is a b-movie. It is very similar to 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' (from the 50s), but this film also has an annoying and erroneous discussion about aliens and Christian beliefs. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I have no intention of insulting Christians, people who believe in aliens or any other person. This is a thought that I have about the film, not about the people. <br /> <br /> Also, I would like to point out that I do not know if the actors are bad or if they were only given terrible scripts.
