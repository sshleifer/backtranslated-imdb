I work in an office on weekends, and there is a TV that only receives ONE channel. So, I do not have the option of resorting to something better. However, I keep it on because it provides a bit of background noise. Sometimes, I get a decent movie / show. Not today. Today, I have "Breaker Breaker". The city looks like a third class set (which, of course, is). All the actors and bad guys seem to have graduated from the school of specialists. I have seen better dramatic performances in a carnival. The special effects (the flames at the end of the film are more false than the masculinity of Michael Jackson). Even the horse at the end of the film was a terrible actor ... A badly written movie, badly shot, badly written.
