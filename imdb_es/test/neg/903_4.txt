This rarity contains touches similar to Bunuel, but does not maintain the interest of one. A 10-year-old boy wanders through a bizarre America in a stolen Mustang, while the usual suspects in cult movies (Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, Susie Tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy. Like his AFTERS AND HOURS OF VAMPIRE, the screenwriter delights in making him squirm. I was not affected, due to the broad performance. You know you're ready when Meat Loaf and Flea give the most attractive perfs. (And what did this child's screen test look like? It's unbearable.) Recommended for a dozen SONNY BOY fans ('87).
