The first thing that caught my attention in this movie was the terrible performance. The whole cast was so inept to deliver their lines that I laughed at the horrible dialogue in the middle of the movie. An even bigger problem with this movie is that at no time do we discover what motivates the actions of each character. The only redeeming aspect of the film is the innovative visual effects of Halfdan Hussey. However, however striking they may be, they do little to compensate for the shortcomings mentioned above. A frightening script mixed with the level of community theater does not allow a pleasant visualization. Honestly, I was surprised at how bad this movie was.
