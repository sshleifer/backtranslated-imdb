I never made any comments here on IMDb, but since I saw this movie, I can not be silent. I just set up my account here just because this horrible movie. In two words, this movie is PURE CRAP. The movie does not make any sense! Nothing makes sense in this movie. Watching this movie was pain all the time. I do not understand why Val Kilmer agreed to make this movie. He plays a minor role as leader of a gang, says few words, and is like a total of 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD just for the name of Val Kilmer in the box and the interesting photos on the cover. <br /> <br /> As stated in another review, Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back !!! The title of the film itself brought the track about the rating that everyone should give: ZERO
