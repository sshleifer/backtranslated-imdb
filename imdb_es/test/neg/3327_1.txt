My daughter liked it but I was horrified, because a character in this movie smokes. As if it were not horrible enough to see "product placement" actors like Bruce Willis who smoke in his films, at least children's movies should be more considered! I wonder: was that intentional? Big tobacco "sponsored" the movie? What is needed to ban smoking in movies? At least movies aimed at children and adolescents.
