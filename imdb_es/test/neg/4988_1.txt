When Underdog, the cartoon debuted in 1964, at the age of 7 I was hooked immediately. He was Top Dog (intentional pun) in my book (that is, until Batman debuted on ABC a year later). Even when it was clear that Disney was going to make a live version of a once popular Saturday morning caricature, it was equally clear to me that it was going to be a piece of shit. Even reading the reviews in the newspapers seemed to confirm this. However, I set out to: a) never attempt to write a review unless I have seen the film from beginning to end; and b) never spend a red penny on a movie that I'm almost sure I'll hate. <br /> <br /> Thanks to YouTube I: a) I am completely qualified to write this review; and b) it only cost me 84 minutes of my earned time. <br /> <br /> It also proves my point, namely, that this movie is not simply a piece of garbage. It's a smoking pile of dog droppings. It looks like the name-only television series, even though they almost did well with Simon and Cad. <br /> <br /> In short, Underdog is a huge waste of time and money, which fortunately does not I did. You do not have to spend. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of *****
