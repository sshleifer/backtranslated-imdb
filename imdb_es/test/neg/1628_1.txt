The sequel that nobody asked the movie that nobody wanted. Obviously, there are many flaws with this movie to name here, so I will concentrate on acting. Miles O'Keefe would have been better suited to play with the Asian's, Thong, mainly because he would not have dialogue. Lisa Foster delivers her lines showing an emotion, the dullness. Charles Borremel gives life to his part by pausing every five words. And finally, the extravagant guy, type John Saxon ... no comment is needed. <br /> <br /> See "Conan the barbarian" if you need it, but do not waste time with this low-budget loser.
