It requires a huge suspension of disbelief in regards to Will's "genius". Not only in mathematics, it is also widely read in economic history, it is capable of contracting several reductions, etc. No no no. I do not buy it. While you're at it, you could have it using a big "S" on your chest, flying faster than a plane and stopping bullets. <br /> <br /> Among other problems ... real genius (archiving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and if it deserves such a meaningless homage) simply does not appear / ex nihilo /. It is never so multifaceted. And it is very rare that contemporaries appreciate it. <br /> <br /> It's better to have made Will a basketball prodigy. Except that Damon is too low.
