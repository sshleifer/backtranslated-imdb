I rented the DVD in a video store, as an alternative to reading the report. But it is much more than a terror attack. <br /> <br /> While the film may present some information from the drama report, it is taking the word to the producers, there is no reference to the commission's report anywhere in the film. No one. <br /> <br /> The performance, in general, is quite bad: almost all the stereotypes of badly talked about and bad-tempered government agents, all think they know more than all the others. There may be some truth in it, but it really has a bad smell of Hollywood stereotype. <br /> <br /> Ratings and comments from the IMDb community of users tend to be more correct than incorrect, and I have started to take a look at the classifications before renting whenever I can. <br /> <br /> I would like to have in this case.
