Wow. So my boyfriend and I went to the movie store to rent a movie. I like silly horror movies, so I looked for the variety of terrible movies they had to offer while he went in search of Michael Moore's 'Sicko'. Then I found the worst of them all (as I would soon discover). It looked good on the cover and the description on the back seemed decent enough. The fact that there was an IMDb appointment in it as a review was proof that it would be bad in a good way. So the next night, we put it in the DVD player and, for the first five minutes, we felt incredibly confused. <br /> <br /> The movie is absolutely incoherent, with time jumps misplaced from the past to the future that left you wondering a greater 'WTF?' The plot does not have any coherent history, apart from the vague allusion to a local myth about a murder, but this only comes into play in the film in the last twenty minutes. So more or less during the first hour you have this: random and confusing time jumps; incoherent plot; parents who do not age; bad performance; bad dialogue a child that magically changes the color of the hair; and a lot of nasty characters to get bored! <br /> <br /> The film moves so slowly that it is a task to really sit there and watch. I'd rather be scrubbing the bathrooms, honestly. Do not bother with that.
