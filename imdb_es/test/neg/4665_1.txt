This movie has bad writing and bad editing. It is difficult to follow what is happening because nothing that the characters do makes much sense. Some major calamity occurs every 30 seconds. As a result, none of the "action" sequences is entirely interesting. The film has two hours of "disposable" scenes that are connected simply by the fact that they share common actors. This movie does not even have enough sense of humor to be a good "bad" movie.
