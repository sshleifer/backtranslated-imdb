Normally I do not write reviews, but this "movie" was special. I could not turn it off. I do not think I saw a worse movie, but I sat there, watching. It was like a horrible car accident with blood flowing all over the road. It was disgusting, but I could not get away. Where do I start? The movie seems to think it's a sports thriller, but it's so ridiculous, it can only be a comedy, but it's not funny, not even in a silly / silly way. It's like watching your cousins ​​try to play a sketch at family gatherings. It's painful to see it, but at least just for a minute or two. The second chain lasted more than an hour. <br /> <br /> Whoever participated in the making of this film should not work again. The writing, the direction, the acting, and everything was just terrible. The problem is that I can not describe how bad it was; you just had to see it And I'm sure this will NEVER be shown again, so unless you see it, you will not get lucky. I mean it was almost worth seeing just because of the fact that it gave me some appreciation for all the other "bad" movies I've seen in my life. And for every movie I see in the future that I can not stand, I'll think, well, at least it was not as bad as the Second String.
