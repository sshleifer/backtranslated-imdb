Norma (an) ally I do not care about remakes. There are some very good ones out there, BUT this is a stinker! Considering that it was practically scene by scene, I had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied Al's address virtually to perfection, and added color (I'm not one of those who think it has to be B & W to be classic). It should have been at least a mediocre movie ... but it was pee-pee caa-caa! I do not understand how it could have been so fucked up. If necessary, look at it as a curiosity, but I suggest you do not bother.
