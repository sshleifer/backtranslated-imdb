If you enjoy sitting in darkness, literally and figuratively, for ninety minutes, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> A loss of actors, resources and audience time. In short, a waste of space. Do not be tempted by the curriculum. There is nothing of any other substance beyond that. The film lacks all the basic elements that could be expected from the genre; plot, character, development, outcome. The cast may feel encouraged knowing that, in this case, their efforts will be completely forgettable and, over time, their careers may improve. <br /> <br /> Absolute gut.
