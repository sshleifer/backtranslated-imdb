Rocketship X-M must be seen by any movie aficionado for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) It is one of the first and the few films to have a happy ending. Undoubtedly, the effect was deeper in post-World War II America than at present, but the sad ending adds to the message of the film. <br /> <br /> 2) It is also one of the first films to deal with space travel in a serious way, using space as a valid stage for drama. Despite the lack of scientific background, the film stands out for itself as a dramatic meal. It is not so much a space drama as a drama set in space. <br /> <br /> 3) The message of the anti-nuclear war is delivered in a serious way that is not lost in the case of large grasshoppers, men, or animals. The effect of Martian society on nuclear devastation is presented clearly and frankly. The fact that the survivors of the expedition land and, as such, can not preach the lesson learned on Mars, adds another element of sadness to the tragic end. <br /> <br /> Sterno says to go up to Rocketship X-M.
