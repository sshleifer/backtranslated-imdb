(There Spoilers) Regular slasher movie with the story that takes place in and around this mine abandoned by God outside the almost deserted city of Sutterille. After receiving a map of the letter and a gold nugget from her brother Jared, Shadrach Smith, Clair and her husband Nick Breman, Carrie Bradac and Sean Hines, they lead the village along with four other friends and gold hunters Alx and Tori, Steve Wastell and Sangie, and Hayden & Rox Ann, Rick Majeske & Elina to claim their claim. <br /> <br /> Later, it turns out that the fact that Jared disturbed the forgotten gold mine causes the ghost of the famous Jeremiah Stone, Vernon Wells, to come back to life and thereby restart his reign of terror. Stone, or 49er, is one of the most ridiculous assassins / murderers in the history of cinema. Stone seems to have been buried for years under a few tons of coal that runs around with this hook cutting people in two. After making almost the entire cast, the local hermit, Aunt Nelly, (Karen Black), whose daughter Eve (Alexandra Ford) was also one of Stone's victims, tells those who are still alive that unless they return the gold to the Stone mine, the crazed miner never rest until he kills everyone who still has it. <br /> <br /> Aunt Nelly has enough time to tell her story before Stone turns her into a human torch and ends up jumping into a nearby stream. the movie continues unabated, with the mining assassin in the uproar that seems as scary as a burnt toast and so dark. Even those in the movie did not seem to show any real fear. In one scene, when he broke into Aunt Nelly's house, everyone inside, all charged, instead of fleeing, he caused the mining ghost to lose his right arm; Stone spent the rest of the movie with a choice of miner stuck to his "stump". <br /> <br /> In addition to actress Karen Black, the movie "Miners Massacre" also features veteran actors John Phillip Law and Richard Lynch as Sheriff Murphy and Old Man Prichard. Things passable, but nothing special. The film has a predictable ending with the entire burning gold mine. The audience received an indication of the creators of "Miners Massacre" that the end of this senseless madness is not in sight and that it may very well resurface in the very near future in a possible sequel, God help us all!
