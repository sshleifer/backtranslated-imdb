Ken Russell directed this strange (not very) erotic thriller and if I had not known that I would have bet my life that the director was Brian DePalma. Absolutely everything about CRIMES OF PASSION screams DePalma, from the flashy cinematography that lights up a little too bright, to the domestic story that becomes a stem and bar diagram, even the title this screams "Depalma, DePalma, Depalma" <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, since Brian DePalma looks increasingly like a poor Hitchcock man over the years, Russell should have tried to emulate his own style. Surely an erotic thriller in the style of TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN would have been strange with a capital B, but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience. Stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being harassed by a religious maniac were very common in the video market of the eighties. Oh, and Anthony Perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie he made in the eighties. Yawning <br /> <br /> The only thing of a real note to CRIMES OF PASSION is the controversy it caused. I guess the studio was the happiest people to hear this, since no publicity is bad publicity, but as for the controversial sex scenes ... What controversial sex scenes? There is none and the only controversy I can think of is that China Blue dominates a policeman on duty with a truncheon. Needless to say, it did not come in silence. HA HA HAS HA HA HA HA HA HA
