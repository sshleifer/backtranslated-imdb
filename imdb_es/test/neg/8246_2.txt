This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: do not do anything, be a loser and then suddenly ... whoah! You are a genius and unpleasant, and the world is kissing the ground you walk on. <br /> <br /> And, surprisingly, all other intelligent people are losers. They know nothing and become bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are very difficult, but still these teachers can analyze the results in less than 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all the movies have a good thing and Robin Williams is in it.
