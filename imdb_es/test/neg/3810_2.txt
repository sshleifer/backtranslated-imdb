I do not understand what the great hype of this movie was. All the horror sites said that this movie had all the essential elements of an "old American slasher" movie that would satisfy their needs. - Although it was similar to an old American movie, my needs were still not met. <br /> <br /> My big problem with this film is that we are now in the 2000s, not the 1980s. The horror of the 80s is the past and should remain in the past. Horror films have changed so much that the old movies now seem cheesy and unrealistic. Although they are fun to watch, they do not offer the same realistic, bloodthirsty blood that recent films offer. <br /> <br /> Hatchet is cheesy, unrealistic and terribly bad. If we wanted to see an old American movie, I can go back to the series on Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm street or the Halloween series. I must admit that the movie is better than some of the horror films that are released, but it is among the worst. The jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible. <br /> <br /> Personally I would stay away from this movie and never look back.
