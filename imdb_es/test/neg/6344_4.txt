Gene Hackman is a former Marine Corps colonel who brings together a handful of Vietnam's private veterans to return to Laos and rescue some Americans who have been declared missing in action. Hackman suspects that, in reality, half a dozen MIA are being secretly detained in a remote camp by Laotians to be tormented and to provide more hard work. Hackman is being paid by the wealthy Robert Stack, whose son, like Hackman's son, is believed to be among the MIAs. But the circumstances are such that Hackman can only buy old and outdated weapons, although he manages to get the help of a fervent anti-communist Loatian and his two daughters along the way. <br /> <br /> I do not think the film was deliberately invented to support the myth of the Vietnames who still hold our MIA for propaganda purposes. The myth was quite real. If anyone remembers, there were many stickers in 1982 and 1983, BRING BACK THE MIAs. I think, on the other hand, that the film was made in part to take advantage of the myth. It was absurd at first sight. Why would our old enemy refuse to return MIAs? Propaganda? Where is the value of propaganda in something that is kept secret? To add the job offer? Do they need a hundred additional workers in Vietnam and Laos? The motives behind this film, with its triumphant music and its high number of bodies, were outrageous. <br /> <br /> But what about the movie itself? Stripped of his theme of rescuing battered mythical MIAs, he is a routine paramilitary activist, no better or worse than dozens of others who appeared in the eighties. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one that manages to keep his head above water. He is almost always reliable. <br /> <br /> Of the others, being this a plot of formula, derived from "The Dirty Dozen" among others, I continued trying to guess which of the members of the gang would sacrifice for the mission. Of the three anti-Communist Asians, I thought that one or more were dead flesh. That's why Asian helpers appear in films like this one. (He was right twice in three). I also imagined Patrick Swayzie as the rookie former officer, the youngest of the group, who had never "earned the respect" of others because he had never seen a fight. You also have to go in some heroic way. Incorrect. He becomes a hero, it's true, but he survives intact. I thought there were fifty and fifty chances that Hackman would have to go too, but he does it well. The formula is not extended by originality either. The escaped Charles Bronson's claustrophobic POW from "The Great Escape" is here in the ex-rat of Fred Ward's tunnel, a claustrophobic who is forced to crawl through a drain pipe with a snake inside, so that I can make a reconnaissance in the prison camp in Laos. <br /> <br /> The title, "Uncommon Valor," comes from a tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to Iwo Jima's men: "The Uncommon value was common that day." Nimitz was certainly right in that. The fact that the men who fought in Vietnam were equally courageous or is not far from the point. Anyone who saw a combat or even approached him, putting his life on the line for men in the next line, was heroic enough. This movie, and the way it exploits our bitterness about the Vietnam War, really does not do them justice.
