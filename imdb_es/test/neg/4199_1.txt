Seriously ... <br /> <br /> You can not say I have a bad performance, because there is NO acting. You can not say that he has bad writing, because he DOES NOT have writing. You can not say that it has bad cinematography, because there is NO cinematography. You can not say it's a bad movie, BECAUSE THERE IS NO MOVIE! If you do not believe me, go see it. Just do not say I never warned you ...
