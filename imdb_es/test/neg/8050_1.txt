"Son, you must stop the experiments that I have begun!" Pity that nobody has said this too, who green has lit this project! I was almost literally dragged into this movie by a friend of mine for a midnight show when we were in high school. Now, a midnight movie in high school on a Friday night, do not expect much, but come on! And when I return to see him years later, I will continue defending my original opinion. Great special effects but so what? Possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Unless you enjoy blood and guts and see some Hollywood veterans (Steiger and Hunter) make fun of themselves for a dollar. YUCK!
