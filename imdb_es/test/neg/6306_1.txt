Great Balls of Fire is the movie that you teach someone you really hate. It is an absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by the minions of a foreign power to extract information from the captured intelligence agents. I have enjoyed some of the performances of Dennis Quaid in the past, but in this film it is totally exaggerated. It does not cross the line so much, it jumps over it, then it comes back to jump again and again. He struts and cups like an incredibly bad acid trip. It is one of those rare performances in which you wish you could enter the film and beat the man an inch of your life for doing something really horrible. Was I desperate to win a Golden Raspberry or some other prize for bad acting? That is the only conclusion I can reach. Thanks Dennis, you gave us a bad performance for all ages. Where was the director to reign in this guy? <br /> <br /> The opposite end of the end is Winona Ryder, it's plastic features and plastic acting. I came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax doll. That was, of course, an insult to mannequins throughout the earth, all of which could have taken more humanity to Jerry's cousin / wife's minor role. This brings up the confusing message of the film, which is 100% correct to marry your own cousin and have a child in the marriage. I do not see what is "right" about that, but it seems that Hollywood thinks that the incest of minors is a fantasy. Talk about "family values." <br /> <br /> Another problem is the format. Is it a legend of Lewis's life or a musical? I'm not talking about music, I'm talking about the really strange scene in which Jerry drives to school, he starts singing a melody and everyone starts to dance like it's the Broadway musical in search of a Tony. Fantasy and reality are mixed in a mixture that does not work. But who really cares? I do not. And you should not either. You can not recover the minutes of life that you would waste in this movie. So do not waste your time, it's too valuable for something so poorly guided and poor.
