For me, this movie is essentially like a pilot feature film episode for a television series. I am particularly reminded of the British remake of the television series Wallander, starring Kenneth Brannagh. The people interviewed by the police are strong and often as bitter as the weather, the principal investigator has enormous family problems, investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past, and the conspiracy is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and secondary arguments that only They make sense in the end. Both have an excellent picture. <br /> <br /> The layout of Jar City is extraordinarily reminiscent of a series of standard crimes in the United Kingdom or the United States. Effectively, you can take the graphics of any of the episodes of Touch of Frost and transplant them into the grim setting of this film and have an effective sequel. <br /> <br /> Actually the script could not be more obvious from the cookie cutter. You get even the most familiar motives, such as the fact that the police go to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath, which inevitably explodes at the end of the interview. <br /> <br /> I am absolutely convinced that this is buns and jam for many people, but I think it is necessary to point it out to people like me who do not go to the movies to watch television. What I felt a sharp lack of was the message. The film takes the subject of genetic studies in Iceland. Icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world, which represents a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics. A lot of information about the population's heritage has been saved, and many Icelandic unique genetic diseases can be effectively traced in a population that has abstained from crossing, and it is remarkably genetically homogeneous (it is like trying to put together a Map puzzle). underground of London, instead of a puzzle of a field of daisies). A company called deCODE genetics tried to create a database that contained all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of Iceland. Due to privacy issues, this project was canceled and, at the end of last year, deCODE genetics went bankrupt in Iceland. The episode is a rich topic for debate. <br /> <br /> But in this movie, genetics and medical science are not there for the sake of education, they are there because of a strange atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It's a spooky movie if you're interested in that, and there's often a morbid approach to food to accompany events, like a forensic luncher between the incisions. The most dizzy thing for me was when the lead inspector devoured the head of a sheep. Unfortunately for me this occasionally became ridiculous. The film attempts the delicate task of mixing the spooky with the sentimental, and ended up providing unintentional humor towards the end. This is the equivalent, in cinematographic terms, of trying to prepare fugu, if it is not well qualified, skilled at hand and sharp, it will poison the client. This rather novice director should have reduced the rate on his performance. <br /> <br /> I came out of this movie feeling pretty bad with myself and with life in general.
