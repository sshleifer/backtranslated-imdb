Established in 1945, Skenbart follows a failed Swedish book publisher who decides to take a direct train to Berlin. Unfortunately for all those around him, it is a walking disaster, which causes chaos everywhere he goes. The train also has a man and his lover planning to assassinate the man's wife (who is also on the train), a soldier on the way home, two older gay gentlemen, an angry train driver, two nuns, a group of refugees , and even more people. <br /> <br /> Meant as a mix of noir-ish thriller (which does quite well, at least to begin with) and comedy, the film fails with both. It does not feel good since the film changes tone with each new scene. And as the train heads toward its final destination, the movie becomes more and more bizarre, and ends with a truly surreal note. <br /> <br /> Good fragments are wasted in a lot of frames and meaningless characters. Skenbart is full of famous Swedish actors, no matter how small the part. It feels as if the filmmakers call everyone who had worked and offered them a role in the film. Pity that the interpretations are as bad as the script (act as the lines do, do not read them!). <br /> <br /> The comedy is more or less slapstick, with the same jokes repeated over and over again. The rhythm is incredibly slow at times (quite often, really), with a particular scene that lasts for about ten minutes without a good reason. The screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue. However, the film looks very good, in B & W in a bad mood, but it is wasted in making inept movies in all the other departments. [1/10]
