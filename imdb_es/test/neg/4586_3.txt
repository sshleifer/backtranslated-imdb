THE PARCEL: A truck driver (Kristofferson) fights against a corrupt sheriff (Borgnine) causing his fellow truckers to join and form an unstoppable convoy that stretches for miles and soon creates a frenzy of national media. <br /> <br /> THE NEGATIVE: The configuration of the film is weak and the end even weaker. It has all the clich√©s of good guys / truckers without adding anything new in the process. It ends up making SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT look bright and inspired. Kristofferson is too relaxed for a leading man role and can not carry the image. The character of Borgnine is portrayed awkwardly. At first, he is made to look like a real imbecile of a sheriff who behaves like a small gift that starts rolling everything. Then, in the end, he's made to be a little more understanding and even secretly with Kristofferson, which does not work at all. In any case, Jackie Gleason is a much better actor for this kind of role. However, the worst part of the film is the attempt of director Peckinpah to launch a 'serious message' in this silly action that only stops and bombs it in the process. <br /> <br /> THE POSITIVE: The only one good scene in the whole movie is the fight sequence inside the restaurant of truck stops. Director Peckinpah gives a funny twist to his characteristic "slow-motion" violence and the result is fun. Unfortunately, it begins to put all the action in slow motion for the rest of the image until it finally becomes exhausting. McGraw is always a pleasure to look at, but unfortunately he is given very little to say or do. <br /> <br /> THE DOWNWARD: if you have read the synopsis, then you have essentially "seen" the movie. The song on which this movie is based is pretty good, but the movie does not add anything to it and should never have been done. All this is very uninspiring for such a nonconformist director. <br /> <br /> THE RATING: 3 out of 10.
