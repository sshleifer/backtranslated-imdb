SILVER CITY (2+ outta 5 stars) As a fan of John Sayles' work for many years, I feel safe saying this is the worst movie he has ever done. That said, the movie is not exactly "terrible" ... simply without inspiration. Sayles introduces familiar elements from his previous films (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, the sale of youthful ideals) but does not bring them together in any new or meaningful way. Even the dialogue (usually Sayles' strong point) is disappointing this time ... it sounds cliché and forced in almost every scene. The film looks and sounds like episodes of a television series that did not exceed its third episode. There are a lot of great stars at hand ... and they do everything possible to make their bit parts come alive ... but the material is simply not there this time. While filming a campaign site, a governor with hope (a poor and obvious substitute for George W. Bush) fishes a corpse out of a lake. An investigator is hired to try to warn people that they may have deliberately established this to discredit the candidate ... but soon discovers that there are deeper and darker secrets (and more clichés) to discover. Sayles has made similar films much better in the past ("Lone Star", "Matewan", "The Return of the Secaucus Seven", "Men with weapons"). It's a shame that he went to the well once and found contaminated water. A good line, delivered by Richard Dreyfuss: "Danny, you're a loser, that has already been established beyond doubt, so try to be a good one, okay?"
