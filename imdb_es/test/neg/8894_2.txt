Any fan of Russian cinema will have great difficulty believing the sub-phone performances of Mashkov and Bodrov Jr., and may be completely perplexed by the trite and confusing script of Bodrov Sr., which is combined with an unusually weak direction. . Most of the characters roam the movie as if they had no idea who they are or what they are doing. It is also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting skills have not advanced one iota since FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, and her screen exposure is fortunately limited. This is a terrible mafia movie; so much that it makes the GODFATHER III look like a winner in the genre. To see the best of Russians, check out Bodrov Sr.'s work in PRISONER OF THE MOUNTAINS (which also has Jr.), Mashkov's turn in VOR (THE THIEF) and Bodrov Jr.'s new criminal in BRAT.
