This film captures the brief moments between a mother and her son in rural Russia, while she is dying. <br /> <br /> I am so divided between being nice to the movie or declaring it a test of patience. On the one hand, the film is beautiful, with the sparse dialogue that captures the essence of their feelings. There really is nothing to say, because everything that needs to be said is transmitted beyond words. The son shows so much care, love and patience towards his mother, that I think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards the family. It also cruelly reminds me that I could be in a situation like this, in a place without joy, having to take care of a very sick person. "Mat I Syn" is a cruel reality. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Mat I Syn" moves very slowly. Do I really need to see a train that passes over the horizon for more than 1 minute? With my previous experience of "Telets" and "Aleksandra", I am tempted to put "Mat I Syn" between them as a total boredom. <br /> <br /> I suppose one has to be in the right state of It matters to appreciate this movie. I surely see her beauty, but maybe I'm not in the right state of mind.
