I'm watching this horrible movie while we talk. It is possibly one of the worst movies that have been aired in my house. I'm sitting here with 3 friends and they agree. It's not scary. it's not funny. It is not dramatic it does not contain anything attractive at all. We are 49 minutes in the movie. We have only seen 2 creatures. Only one person has died This movie is a big disappointment. Nothing about this horrible, horrible movie has made me want to see the rest. I'm staying with a movie. I hope that everyone who had something to do with making this film died. I do not mean the actors. I mean the director, the producers, the presidents of the studio that financed this movie. It is in full, the worst movie in history. I should make IMDb the worst 100 movies of all time. in number 1
