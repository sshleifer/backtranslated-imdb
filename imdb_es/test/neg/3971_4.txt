The only reason why I even give this movie a 4 is because it was done in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The horrible direction is only overshadowed by the inability of the characters to act. The protagonist is an actor that I have never seen in anything else and it shows. There is no chemistry with love interest and so insipid that you almost do not care what happens to it. Dick Sargent was not convincing, since a villain was supposed to be a super villain ... he was more annoying than anything else. Peter Graves was the only person in the film who was not horrible, his part was small and even he could not make up for the lack of talent of his castmates. In 2004 someone tried to make this mess again, it was called The Island ... I personally did not see that movie, but from what I understand it is the same movie. If you want to laugh at this movie, get the episode MST3k, it's very funny ... full of enchanted and biographical references that makes this film finally visible.
