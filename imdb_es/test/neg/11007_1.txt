John Madden's film interpretation of Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome fails to do justice to a great literary work. While the story is maintained, the elements that give soul to the novel are skewered and, in general, are lost in the film. Madden fails to convey innocence, and the general tragedy of Ethan and Mattie's relationship, instead, transforms it into a moral story. The mark is lost and the point is lost in additional details and in a poor dialog box. Zeena (Zenobia) in the book is almost completely the antagonist, the less understanding figure of the books, where in the film she can feel almost sorry, although it is a stretch that you feel bad for this sick woman who is deceived. The book describes more accurately Zeena's tyrannical control over the house and about Ethan. The movie just pissed me off. The addition of the fox did not make sense, as did the scene with Mattie trying to commit suicide. It was simply misinterpreted and done. Movie errors: Ethan's elusiveness in the church dance scene, interactions with Denis Eady, addition of love scene, fox scene, store scene, saying that his plans allowed it, lack of exhibitions of the emotions and internal thoughts of Ethan, introduction of the priest instead of nameless engineer, let's see that Zeena knows about the growing relationship in which, in novel, the reader never knows what is what Zeena thinks or perceives. Too many defects and bad management decisions.
