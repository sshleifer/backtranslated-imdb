It seems that there is great potential for the story line of this film to be something worth seeing. The performance was flat and the story lacked depth. There was too much confidence in the camera work, which had some high points. I have to agree with the other negative comments. I wish I had read them before buying the DVD. The movie may be worth watching for free and you're bored to tears beforehand. There could have been much more development of the plot why there are homeless people in Moscow (ie, post-Soviet "capitalism", the rampant use of drugs (ie, the increase in heroin trafficking in Afghanistan); development of why the resurgence of Russian orthodoxy after the fall of the USSR, the archaeologists themselves, or even more in the fight against nihilism.
