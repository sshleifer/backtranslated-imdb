This is one of the best aspect movies of recent years. The fact that it was done in a very small budget (approximately $ 1.8 million, as they say in the DVD: they infer that they ended up with less funding) makes it even more impressive. Not only photography, but design and, in particular, locations (Eastern Montana) that are both authentically American and otherworldly. <br /> <br /> Too bad there is not a coherent movie to accompany it. An extremely promising configuration of the last 48 hours of eviction from a rural town in 1955 before it is flooded due to a dam is eliminated with a pretentious mumbo jumbo alluding to the angels and a dying child. And what is presented as the "real world" is an arch without hope. Note to the Polish brothers: the Coen brothers are funny, you are not. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, many filmmakers will find the abundant symbolism and inscrutability of "Northfork" as marks of some kind of depth, the kind that sophisticated guys fight all night in coffee shops while the masses of heads of The brain looks at "Charlie's Angels" or something like that. (Sigh) If you insist ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, it is recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for its impeccable technical credits and its photographic beauty.
