It only starts when a team of US soldiers. UU He goes into Soth America to fly a rebel airstrip, they join a robot called Solo (Mario Van Peebles) that can use any weapon that has been manufactured, it is fifteen times stronger and ten times faster than any human being. However, something goes wrong and Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians for what Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) is not happy, he returned to the base and General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders that Solo be closed and reprogrammed. One of Solo's main directives is self-preservation, so he decides to escape once again to the South American jungles to which Colonel Madden and his men are sent to recapture ... <br /> <br /> This co-production between Mexico and the United States was directed by Norberto Barba and one has to say that Solo is horrible. David Corley's script was based on the novel 'Weapon' by Robert Mason and is one cliche after another, the robots were popular at the time that Solo was made in Hollywood and at the box office, so Solo scam people like Robocop (1987), Universal Soldier (1992) and the two films of Terminator, besides having the same scenario and basic story as Predator (1987). This is the usual garbage of a emotionless robot that grows in a sense of humanity while surrounded by people, at first it does not know what a joke is or why one person cares for another but in the end develops emotions and starts befriending People, it sounds to me like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). The characters are poor and Colonel Madden in particular has no motivation to hate Solo at all and why he would kill other American soldiers and disobey orders to destroy him. You know I saw this on cable TV last night for free (thank God I did not spend money on that) and I looked it up in the TV guide, you know what it said? My TV guide described Solo as a "science fiction action starring Mario Van Peebels", which when I think about it is a perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words, my television guide has hit, is a science fiction action movie, undoubtedly starring Mario Van Peebles and is definitely terrible. I've said enough. <br /> <br /> Director Barba does not do anything especially special here and the action scenes lack real emotion and the elements of science fiction are practically non-existent, apart from the fact that Solo is a robot. Then, the military loses Solo and Colonel Madden is sent to recapture him, right? I'm not being funny, but would not the military have put a mechanism of "self-destruction" inside Solo in case something like this happened? Surely, at least, Solo would have had a tracking device inside him so the military would at least know where he was at a given moment. I'm not being funny, but these people can come up with a walking robotic soldier, but they're not smart enough to realize that a tracking or self-destruct device could be useful if something goes wrong. The violence is slight, there are some scenes of fights well, but in reality they are quite weak things. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film looks good and is done competently, it was actually filmed in Mexico. The creators of the action movie Dolph Lundgren, Agent Red (2000), edited images of Solo in that movie. The acting is bad, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play a robot without emotion ... William Sadler deserves better than this, just a few years before he was watching the fantastic Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990). <br /> <br /> It's just a very bad science fiction action movie that is basically a scam of big-budget Hollywood sci-fi action movies like Robocop, Universal Soldier & the Terminator. I do not recommend it. I will start and pay more attention to my television guide when it comes to choosing movies to watch ...
