MASTER PLAN: have the winning team in a deadly tournament. One of several martial art action images that tried to capture the flavor of the famous "Enter the Dragon" from '73, this is an effort from South Africa. The villain's strength is a bit different, appearing as a white fortress like a castle in the middle of the desert from a distance. The villain himself, a baron or general, is a slightly more perverse version of the "Dr.No" or the Han mold of the master villainy, with strange flashbacks of the glory days of Nazi Germany. He wears the full Nazi uniform of royalty at some points. His main ambition in life is to carry out an illegal martial arts competition / tournament against his Japanese rival, an extension of his complicity in World War II (my army is better than his army). It sounds silly and it is, although the suggestion of crazed madness and machismo almost works. The central hero, Steve Chase (Ryan), resembles a white character of "Bruce Lee", who has a slim and agile physique, although obviously he is not at the same level of experience in martial arts. I thought it would be a secret government agent here, but apparently not. He and his girlfriend have joined the Baron's team of fighters, but they decide to resign (what did they think they were getting into?). Of course, it's not that easy. There is a strange sequence of them escaping through the desert using a wrecked car with a moored sail - it seems that those desert winds can do wonders to travel. the hero joins the team of the villain's competitor and the girlfriend is kidnapped by the villain in a cell, under threat of rape by the hero's rival. The most interesting character turns out to be Chico, a dwarf who is the villain's assistant; He is loyal to the baron, but sympathetic to the difficult situation of the hero. Much of the fight uses the skills of the ballet hero, with many jumps and slow motion. The sound effects are also amplified and exaggerated in an attempt to add more impact to the hits. There are some good fights during the tournament towards the climax, but none really stands out. If one had to choose, I suppose the best involves the baron's brutal, muscular man, presented at the end of the story (picks up the back of a car at any given moment). You wonder how the hero will eliminate him at the end, since the brute seems to shrug at most blows. The acting is very mediocre, and descends to the camp until it reaches the bride, who tends to laugh for no reason, as if she had grass, although she is very pretty. Some of the training scenes are also countryside, especially all those guys who run or roll through the sands of the desert. And, with such a title, there are surprisingly few real murders. Ryan, like Steve Chase, returned as a traditional actor in the sequel "Kill and Kill Again."
