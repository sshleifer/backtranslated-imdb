Spiderman was one of the first comics to initiate a change in the genre: despite being a superhero comic very well done, this is the first series that adds a real psychological depth to the main character, has a complex moral issue, round Characters and social and political issues were also highlighted. in other words: Spiderman was the age of comic. This TV series lacks all those components. It is just a direct television series that offers good results and has poor budgetary results that make the action scene moderately exciting. The Spiderman nylon straps are as convincing as the cardboard stones in Star Trek. Nicholas Hammond is too old for the role at that moment. I think he was fine in his thirties when Spider, the man was really teenage at that time. For some incomprehensible reason, the writers also changed the names and eliminated the important characters in the comic, which again resulted in the tension between the characters disappearing.
