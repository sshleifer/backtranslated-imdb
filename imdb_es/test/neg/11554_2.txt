Having lived in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (30 miles from Escanaba) in the mid-1990s, I was eager to see this movie. It begins in a very promising way, with some superficial understanding of the values ​​and peculiarities of the U.P. lifetime. But apparently, Jeff Daniels was not happy with a discreet approach that would have been appropriate given the place and the people. Instead, it introduces extremely crude humor and some very inappropriate mystical / supernatural elements. Although there is a good movie about this region practically unknown in the USA. UU., It is NOT this one.
