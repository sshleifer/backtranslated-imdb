This is the perfect example of how a great book becomes a poor movie. The direction only gives the impression that the film was invented as they went along and Patrick Swaze is so wooden that you can almost see the puppet strings on his body. <br /> <br /> Spy Vs Spy films are not, or should not be, chases and car shots, the bad guys in this movie are really bad shots and miss the main characters, even when they're at a point in white. <br /> <br /> Even action shots are just a clich√© with the usual riding sidewalks and crashing into tables and chairs - yawning. <br /> <br /> I came in half and turned it off - completely boring.
