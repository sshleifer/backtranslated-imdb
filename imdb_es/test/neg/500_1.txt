I saw this last night with an open mind. I'm sorry to say it's still bad. First, the movie is too loud and you can not hear what people are saying. The accents are bad especially Richard Masur. What is the French girl doing in this movie? Miscasting at its worst. Walken's makeup is strange. The Harvard scene is useless and is not necessary. Kristoferson's character is unpleasant and he wanted to be killed and left. Meanwhile, Walken's character dies too soon and easily (despite makeup). The settlers are all stupid. Has a goal chance, ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡hicks, people come to kill you !!! ! The character of John Hurts provides some humor points, that's all. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this excess of garbage. The only good thing is that it ruined the director's career and killed United Artists. <br /> <br /> Still Crap after all these years.
