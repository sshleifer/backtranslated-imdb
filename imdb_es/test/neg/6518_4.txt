The acting is good. That's the positive! SOSN is superficial and superficial. Almost all the characters are middle class and English. Homosexual men are represented as fickle sexual predators with the goal of using children in their empty lives. to point the reference points. There's no time to interact with the characters and it has a result that really does not interest you, Catherine Tate at the height of her stars of comical fame as a woman seeking her husband's divorce and on the screen almost at the same time as her sketches of Nana could not convince, however, if she had said "what af ****** freedom" would have accepted <br /> <br /> I prefer to take a walk in the Park; Smart little garbage!
