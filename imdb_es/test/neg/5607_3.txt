The fans of Rutger Hower, DO NOT LET THEMSELVES: just play a cameo in this movie and that's it. This movie loses an extra point for that scam. I think Rutger Hower has a total of about 2 very short scenes and 2 very short off-cuts. <br /> <br /> The female protagonist of this film is far above this poor material in appearance and talent: it is great, this film is a dog and she is wasted in it. The story is about a lawyer who expects that association one day at the firm to be tricked into having to take Boss' niece across the country. They have several encounters on the road with several strange bugs and that is the vehicle for a variety of parodies and the uncle who played with Napoleon Dynamite is thrown into the mix as a secondary character to a large extent. <br /> <br /> This is a road trip in which extreme circumstances put our repressed hero to the test and little by little he finally loosens a little at the end of the movie, oh it's not great love, yadda yadda .. <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie if you want to see a hot girl be annoying for an idiot in a truck for an hour and a half.
