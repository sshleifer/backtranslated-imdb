If it had not been for the hilarious role of Christopher Guest, I would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes. The jokes were flat, the film was choppy and slow-paced, certain characters were hateful and painful to watch, but Guest's character made me laugh, so I continued with that. <br /> <br /> I feel there are much better options. there!
