Just when you think you've seen the worst that the zombie subgenre can offer, another budding Romero and his team of untalented peers appear to prove you're wrong. <br /> <br /> I've suffered the Zombie trilogy Bloodbath endured Death Valley: The Revenge of Bloody Bill, sat semi-comatose in The Zombie Diaries and laughed hysterically during Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence, and really thought that the amateur cinematography could not fall further down. However, after having seen Zombie Planet, a lot of nonsense from the writer / director George Bonilla, I think I've found the latest in horrible zombie movies. <br /> <br /> In this terrible amateur effort, which is partly Mad Max and partly Dawn of the Dead (but EVERYTHING bad), Frank Farhat plays TK Kane, a tough fighter who kicks the butt of a zombie for a pastime, armed only with knives, a machete, some concussion grenades, and what he obviously perceives to be a really mean glare. <br /> <br /> After a desperately unpleasant opening sequence in which he confronts a horde of untrustworthy zombies, Kane joins a group of survivors who not only have to defend themselves from attacks by The living dead, but must also placate a gang of evil thugs who have taken control of the area (when looking for and delivering the valuables they find). <br /> <br /> Of course, Kane is not the kind of guy to take orders from a group of post-apocalyptic z-grade thugs, and he starts teaching. The bad guys learn a lesson (mostly by looking at them). frowning, threatening them), just pausing to periodically rescue zombie friends. <br /> <br /> With a horrible performance by almost everyone involved, a terrible script, ridiculous effects and shoddy production values, there is virtually nothing in this movie that is worth seeing. To be fair, I quite like the basic premise that zombies are the unexpected result of a very popular slimming drug that blocks carbohydrate cravings (we learn this when a character conveniently explains the background story to Kane, who strangely does not he has an idea of ​​what) has happened), but it is the only vaguely interesting aspect of the whole production. <br /> <br /> I have a certain respect for anyone who manages to finance and make their own movie, but when the results are poor, that respect is lost when they decide to make it available to the public. I would have kept this a secret if I had.
