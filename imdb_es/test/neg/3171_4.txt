I think Homegrown is an inappropriate name for this movie, more like "Plantation Grown", but it does not have the same sound. My guide described it as a comedy, but the pathetic affliction of these unfortunate buffoons is not my idea of ​​a laugh. More in the genre of the thriller / farcical drama. The characters developed well enough, a star cast made it very promising, a pity that the plot was obviously absurd. Ted Danson provided a good cameo as did Jamie Lee Curtis on his part without calling. Jon Bon Jovi has this incredible ability to measure the content of THC in the front seat of his car! I suppose if you drink a little beforehand, you should be able to sit through it, though not for the shy paranoid types.
