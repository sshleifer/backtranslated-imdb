This was one of the worst movies I remember seeing. However, I'm sure I've seen worse things, if that mitigates me by hitting it. <br /> <br /> Humor is not funny, there are stupid jokes about stereotypes that, again, are not funny. I was a captive audience on a plane and I saw this movie. It was a complete waste of time. I enjoyed Martin in previous movies, but he is not. The same for Queen Latifah, it was excellent in Chicago and Set it Off was also good, but this role was horrible. <br /> <br /> In general, I attribute the error to bad script writing. I firmly believe that you can not save a fictional and deceptive script with decent actors, this movie as an example of it. Still, everyone involved should have been wise enough not to participate in this movie. It just amazes me that something so bad can be enlightened, made, launched in a theatrical and promoted way.
