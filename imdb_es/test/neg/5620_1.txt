Who wrote this movie? A 15-year-old without inspiration? <br /> <br /> It could have been written by one of the children who filmed Columbine. <br /> <br /> Totally absurd, it's not funny, boooooooriiing ... <br /> <br /> Plus this: the French do not put their flag everywhere. You do not enter a French bank and you see the tricolore flag shown like that. Even on the day of the Bastille. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the bloodbath. It's just that none of this is credible or funny. Or parodic, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Ok, whoever liked this movie will tell you that I must be some kind of fascist, so forget about my comment.
