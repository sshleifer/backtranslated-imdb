This documentary tries comedy, but it never quite reaches me. To camp? Ehn, maybe. The most accurate word that everyone will agree with, and will have difficulty avoiding in any revision, is kitsch. Dripped kitsch. It was as if the filmmakers had been worried that their viewers would take the film too seriously, and leaned back to insert kitsch and proclaim: "We're kidding around here! See?" <br /> <br /> In short, I felt that he was trying too hard. For example, the sock puppets that introduced each scene were (to me) annoying when I'm sure they were meant to be fun, or at least (ahem) kitsch-ey. <br /> <br /> No, However, avoid this movie based on my complaints. Just prepare to enjoy the kitsch instead of having to push yourself against you without being prepared. If you are interested in the happy rate, you could do much, much worse. At a minimum, the facts surrounding the rise and fall of the Baker make this interesting and worthwhile. At best, herds of like-minded kitsch lovers will shoot and shout over the bits of choice throughout the movie.
