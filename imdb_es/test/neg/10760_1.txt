The filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who once showed a light and sardonic touch with seductive material like "Whistle Down the Wind" and the original "Stepford Wives", arrives here completely. His direction is not only inept, but he also casually adapted Sidney Sheldon's early novel; The results are atrocious. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist framed by the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger, chewing the stage, is a hot cop (it's his most shameful performance). The only actor here who exhibits some life is Elliott Gould, who knows one or two things about animating a vagabond script. Soda, minced and produced at low prices. NO STARS OF ****
