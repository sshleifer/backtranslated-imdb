I love the police films of Umberto Lenzi. ARMED ROME TO THE TEETH is my favorite, and its COMMANDED DESERT almost legitimize the phenomenon of the Euro War in Italy to achieve a pretty good movie. Give him weapons, machines, some types to run with difficulty and it is difficult to lose. <br /> <br /> What a shame it is to find EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX. They could have been for anybody, really, and you look at them with the feeling that they were under contract, they were told what kind of movies they should do, they were assigned a cast and crew and they were given a budget, a deadline and a script. Lenzi then went out and executed his films in the same way that a McDonald's boy fixes a batch of potato chips. Of the two, EATEN ALIVE is the most original, which is surprising, since it has a large number of images taken from three other cannibal films, and easier to enjoy than CANNIBAL FEROX, although not much. <br /> <br /> I will allow others to describe the plot: what fascinated me about the film is the way it looks on the scene, and yet, the film's infamous reputation has something of an assault total to good taste. It is not, although the movie is a distasteful exercise, complete with a scene that earns a title in which two of the beautiful ladies they support are literally cut and alive meals by cannibals, which is the highest point of the movie . The problem is that Lenzi allows us to see the scene of the cannibal party for a long time, and has the convincing sound of a STAR TREK episode of the third season with a fake jungle set for really bloody close-ups. And I do not know anyone else, but if someone were cutting pieces of my person and eating them, I would not lie down and I would look anguished. <br /> <br /> My problem with the movie could be that I have a lot of respect for Lenzi as a filmmaker, and again this could have been directed by anyone. All of his cannibal movie conventions are played, but it never feels as if they are filmed with real conviction, other than trying to intimidate Ruggero Deodato out of the sandbox. The two directors must certainly have known each other and have a kind of youthful rivalry or real dislike for each other's work and a conscious need to eclipse them. Lenzi invented the cannibal genre with DEEP RIVER MAN, Deodato blew it with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, Lenzi returned fire with EATEN ALIVE, Deodato flew him (and everyone else) with the top CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and Lenzi fired a final farewell match with CANNIBAL FEROX, which is almost as realistic as the commercial Krazy Glu in which the guy passes his helmet to a beam and hangs in the air. <br /> <br /> This movie is less desperate and a little more indecisive to push viewers into the abyss. with all the sacredness that FEROX, which remains as a kind of wrong attempt to stage the CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. This is more of a mix, with an interesting jungle adventure crossed with a Jim Jones suicide cult: the cannibals seem to have been added as a last-minute idea rather than the reason for making the film. I think that fans of the genre will have a better impression of the film than the fans of Lenzi's films looking for something new from the formidable director. He is not as entertaining as the SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD, adventurous as his own MAN OF THE DEEP RIVER and, certainly, he lacks the upper part of the CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Combine these considerations with the recycled images, the scenes of animal violence, the misogynist scenes of sexual and stagy violence, the wood methodology of the cinema and what you get ends up being a jungle thriller with two or three outstanding scenes, and Umberto Lenzi was capable of much more. <br /> <br /> 4/10; However, Gore fans will go crazy.
