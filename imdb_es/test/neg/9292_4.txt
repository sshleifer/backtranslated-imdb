You may be interested to know that BARRICADE was seen as a failure by the studio and filed for a year before ALICE FAYE reached such a high level that the studio decided to release the film even though it was never completely completed. It was modestly good at the box office. <br /> <br /> Faye refers to a murder during his stay in a nightclub in New York City, and this scene was actually in the script and was the way the movie should start. . Instead, it is completely missing and what could have been an exciting sequence (including a full Faye song number) was never filmed. However, the rest of the story is practically intact and the release of the film was possible in a 71 minute run time. <br /> <br /> A tired-looking WARNER BAXTER is too old to be credible as Faye's romantic interest. it is merely superficial, like the decomposed reporter. Today's audiences would be offended by the description of the Chinese who use fractured English phrases like "I like youeyey doisy." Key Luke is one of those loyal to the Chinese, but he plays his role discreetly and directly. Arthur Treacher is practically invisible and, nevertheless, obtains the fourth billing on the screen due to editing changes in the story. Originally, Joseph Schildkraut had a role in the film, but his part was finally edited. <br /> <br /> A mix of a movie that will entertain only the hardest fans of Alice Faye who will get a chance to see her in a dramatic role, though weak. Charles Winninger is totally lost as a kind man who runs the American consulate. <br /> <br /> Despite all the weaknesses, there are a couple of scenes that involve narrow escapes that are reproduced effectively and the black and white photography of Karl Freund is first class.
