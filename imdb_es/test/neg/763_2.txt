For a super-dog of scientific engineering that was supposed to be the answer to a small crime, CHOMPS was a fool. <br /> <br /> All I saw the Chomps was sit, walk or run. Or run, then walk, then sit ... and then get back up and stretch, and then walk, and then run to the K-Tel dance hits. And sometimes I had all the answers to the Jumbo newspaper. But mostly he just sat a lot. <br /> <br /> All I'm saying is: In a famous death fight, Chomps could not eliminate Mr. Bigglesworth.
