Dictated by the thin experience (both of life and industry) and without cash, the early short of Sofia Coppola is almost necessarily a piece of observation on a high school campus. The cast is quite weak and does not benefit from the b & w shots (it is difficult to distinguish the characters). Sound editing does little to help a simple story of fickle teen loyalty. <br /> <br /> However, there are one or two things to keep in mind. In the midst of inconsistent editing, the high school campus was filmed with a balance of intimate and wide-ranging close-up shots of aspirants. The music edition also creates an interest and an impulse (without descending to the lower world of the music video). Coppola clearly made an attempt to vary the pace of the film. The dramatic turn is cut quickly and to the point and the second act is almost nonexistent; we recognize that it was actually played in conjunction with the first one, which is the point of the narrator-on-crutches trope (which is a curious character in that first act). <br /> <br /> Despite these notes It is an uncomfortable short. 2/10
