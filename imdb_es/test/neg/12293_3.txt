This was the first feature film for almost everyone involved, including director Teck Tan, for which they deserve credit for achieving it. But this film was awkward in its direction, preached in its style, exaggerated in its performance and too politically correct. The plot was everywhere, preventing any aspect of it from developing well. Gang members get involved in the story, although I'm not sure what their presence added to the film, apart from making the film even less realistic. They could have been completely excluded and, as a result, the movie would have been better. <br /> <br /> The plot is about an ethnic Chinese Malay young man who returns to his home country after studying in the West. His studies have returned him with the skills that he believes he needs to fulfill his dream of managing a rock band and take them to the top of the Malaysian charts (a fairly youthful premise). The beginning of the film suggests a conflict with his traditional father, but once the mobsters get involved, this part of the story is dropped without ceremony. <br /> <br /> The film tries to take advantage of the wonderfully diverse ethnic mix of Malaysia, but unfortunately, the way these aspects were set to film seemed terribly false or directly preachers. There is a beautiful scene of Malay women who do a beautiful traditional dance on a beach, but the way in which the vision is integrated into the plot seems forced and unnatural. <br /> <br /> The acting turned out to be somewhat amateurish and the male leadership was particularly unconvincing. The Malay female advantage was a notable exception that left the most positive mark. The film also has an openly gay character, and although it is a bit caricatured, it provides some of the funniest moments in the film. But the movie was just a notch above a typical local television drama. Unfortunately, this film, which is not at all offensive, has been banned in Malaysia. 3/10
