"The Tempest" by Jack Bender is an adaptation of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the American Civil War. It includes the problem of slavery and the role of revenge in times of war. <br /> <br /> Prospero, renamed Gideon Prosper, is not the Duke of Milan but a landowner in Mississippi. Learn voodoo magic from slave Mambo Azaleigh. He saves his son Ariel, who accompanies him to his exile. The island is not located in the sea but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi. There lives a caiman hunter, the so-called "Gator man", who then tries to rape Prospero's daughter, Miranda. During the time of the civil war, Ariel wants to join the Union troops to help fight against slavery. Prospero does not care about war. He is only interested in his personal revenge against his brother Antony. When Antonio and his accountant Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero raises a storm. The soldier of the Union, Frederick, gets lost in the swamp and finally arrives at the island. He and Miranda fall in love, but Prospero will not accept that. Meanwhile, Ariel was transformed into a crow by Prospero, discovers that Antony has pretended to ally with the Union, but plans to betray them. Antony and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel, but Prospero freezes them and helps the Union to defeat the army of the South. In the end, Ariel is free, Frederick and Miranda are forced to marry, Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man recovers the island. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper powerfully and convincingly while the character of Antony remains rather flat. It was not a bad idea to perform the Tempest before the background of the civil war, but perhaps the director has risked too much. In some parts the story seems constructed or comical. Gator Man, for example, simply appears without any explanation. The fact that he needs a kidnapping to remember Prospero and that he loses confidence in his power shows that Bender tried to make Prospero more human, but only turned him into a weak old man without his magic. The original authority and wisdom of Prospero are not clear. <br /> <br /> ------------- End of Part 1 --------------- --------- ----
