Fantastic, terrible, horrible times, a hundred still do not begin to describe how horrible "Biggest Loser" is. Imagine this: take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say, humiliate them and let them work to lose weight, all on prime time television. Am I the only one who thinks that this is not something that people with IQ in the 3-digit area WANT TO SEE? Everything goes on forever, with lumps of butter complaining about how losing weight will mean so much to them and their lives. Does it matter to anyone? Do you think we care? Do you care if we care? Probably not. I think I'll record on video doing a series of sit-ups and sell it to one of the main television companies. If this happens for television, then my workouts too!
