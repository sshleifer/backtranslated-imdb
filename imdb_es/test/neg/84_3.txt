Seeing the title of this movie "Stupid Teens Must Die" made me believe that this was a parody of some kind. Later I discovered that the original title was "Blood and guts". However, both titles are deceptive. This is not a parody, nor a serious movie of splashes. This is something in between, failing in both areas. A group of teenagers attend a session in a spooky house and then the killing begins. It sounds too familiar, is not it? Well, these movies do not add anything to the endless flow of similar movies. And it is badly done. Due to the lack of light, the whole film is grainy. Now this effect can be highly effective, but it is not in this case. The young cast is not acting so bad, but the director has no idea what to do with the actors. In numerous scenes, the actors are clearly waiting for instructions, but these are given too late. It could also be the error of an editor, of course. The characters are not realistic and the story line just sucks. The sound is terrible at times: the conversations are indecipherable, but when talking loudly or shouting, the actors are very strong. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but it's still a bad movie. one. For me, 3 out of 10.
