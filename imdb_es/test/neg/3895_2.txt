I admit that I did not pay all the attention to everything that happened in this movie, but, to be honest, I do not think it mattered. Basically, local councilor Sidney Fiddler (Sid James) convinces incompetent mayor Frederick Bumble (Kenneth Connor) of Firecombe to run a beauty contest and improve the image of the city. They face opposition from liberation women Augusta Prodworthy (June Whitfield) who try to sabotage the contest, but they have the advertising agent Peter Potter (Bernard Bresslaw) and the owner of the Palace Hotel, Connie Philpotts (Joan Sims). Very soon the young and beautiful aspiring models appear, among them Hope Springs (Barbara Windsor), Paula Perkins (Valerie Leon), Dawn Brakes (Margaret Nolan of Goldfinger), Debra (Sally Geeson) and Ida Downs (Wendy Richard of EastEnders). When the girls have cat fights, it attracts the usual residents, but after a while of some not-so-fun hints and William (Jack Douglas) who has too active contractions, he finally arrives at the competition, and it's right after. could not be bothered Also starring Patsy Rowlands as Mildred Bumble, Peter Butterworth as Admiral, Joan Hickson as Mrs. Dukes, David Lodge as police inspector, Angela Grant as Miss Bangor, Arnold Ridley as Counselor Pratt, Robin Askwith as Larry, Patricia Franklin as Rosemary, Jimmy Logan as Bill Pertwee of Cecil Gaybody and Dad's Army as fire chief, Charles Hawtrey had obviously given up on Carry Ons, but where is Kenneth Williams? I guess I see Babs and the beautiful young Pauline Fowler in bikini, but for comedy, this fails miserably, and the excessive use of the whistle gets on your nerves. Pretty poor
