oh, man, where to start ... <br /> <br /> letting go of your weapon to go into hand-to-hand combat with a zombie, while you hold a soldier bitten in the debate to shoot him b4 he turns, then he gives turn and bite the person holding him, turning his back on a "fallen" zombie, continually shooting the chest and seeing that it does not work, so they shoot a little more on the chest, having the idea that a child collapsed in a desk with blood coming out of his mouth is still fine, walking along a football field as if nothing was wrong, then, suddenly, we noticed the zombie football team doing anything in the middle of the field as if you could have seen them until then ... <br /> <br /> I could go one for a few more hours, but you understand the point ... children's writing and dialogue, bad direction, horrible special effects, really sad story and little developed (the campus infested with zombies, you must obtain the viral host and then lose it ... twice), the only advantage I can find is that this does not include clips from the actual game du Call to the "action scenes" .... <br /> <br /> id say do not waste your money, but I'll be more annoyed by the loss of time, I saw it on the cable and I wanted the 2 hours of my life back
