The movie begins when a girl (Rita) sees her father murdered. Apparently, he was a criminal who screamed at his fellow thieves. Later, and this part makes little sense, the girl has grown into adulthood and YET STILL her father's past pursues her. A little later, Rita meets a good for nothing and goes out with him. During one of his appointments, he is a little bit intoxicated and driving like a total fool. The police chase him and he walks away, killing a pedestrian in the meantime. Here comes the really stupid part. He convinces her to confess the crime, since he assures her that her lawyers can get rid of her. Why, oh why, would she agree with this? However, she does and spends the next two years in prison !! And, shortly after his conviction, this boyfriend disappears, which shows that it is a total heel. What a fool! Later, after his release, his friend (Jack La Rue) informs him about the truth about the boyfriend. Then, she explains, the groom's family is burdened and she should shake them for a lot of money for all the problems that caused her to take the rap. Frankly, this makes sense, since they certainly owe it to her, especially because they knew that she would go to jail and had every intention of using it and then putting it aside. <br /> <br /> Now the idea of ​​bleeding money from rich friends is a good idea of ​​the plot. However, there is no way that this has happened in the first place because it is hard to believe that someone can be so stupid as to take the blow with a blow and run. In an interesting twist, the silly woman decides a life of crime: put on a wig and pick up a rich man, take him to the desert and rob him at gunpoint! Wow ... How it has changed! Apparently, she loves the idea of ​​stealing "false", that is, rich hypocrites. However, and this did not make sense, she soon stopped doing this and started shaking the old boyfriend's father, so he bothered to make some small robberies in the meantime making little sense. And, what was also a little hard to believe was that, instead of wanting money from the old imbecile, he was interested in him putting his influence behind a man controlled by the Mafia as mayor. Strange ... very, very strange. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, another plot develops with a young Alan Ladd. He is an undercover agent who has infiltrated the mafia. He was chosen because, by chance, he is a dead singer for a real thief: what a cliché! But what does not make sense is that this real thief is not in jail and is committing crimes while the fake is infiltrating the mafia in another city. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the evidence that Ladd is able to discover is enough to issue arrest warrants to the mob bandits, including Rita. This is a very bad time case, since meanwhile, she She has made the decision to become a decent and legitimate woman, since she has met a very nice guy with whom she wants to get married! Wow, ... what are the odds? In general, this is a ridiculous and rather silly movie that suffers from the "kitchen sink syndrome"; In other words, there are too many elements of the plot and weird turns to make the film a little less believable. Also, since the film only lasts a little over an hour, everything seems very forced and artificial. It's a relatively poor B-movie PRC from crap-studio just for Alan Ladd's performance just before he got a big name the following year at Paramount. <br /> <br /> By the way, this DVD was released by Alpha Video: a company that sometimes publishes some wonderfully obscure titles (mostly public domain) but NEVER cleans prints or adds subtitles. In other words, DVD production values ​​are strictly third class ... at best.
