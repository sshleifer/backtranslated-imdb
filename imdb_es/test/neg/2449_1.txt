Before watching this masterpiece, I never would have imagined that a devastating and horribly contagious virus could be defeated by the use of Lutheran prayers ... and "erbs". The performance of Ralf Moeller is gigantic; The incandescent realism. I felt so inspired that I will fly straight to Zambibwia tomorrow to break the pesto and put my hands together for the prosperity of the third world. God bless this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'm going to have to see Troll 2 and Anus Magillicutty just to believe that it is possible to invent a more coarsely clichéd dialogue. He is so tortured that bringing a cheese to your knuckles may be preferable to sitting on it. The only subtlety that he manages to achieve is in his racism subtly disguised, while the poor islanders resort to the ineffective silly collective prayer that accomplishes nothing until the übermenschlich, a Teutonic hero wrapped in linen Moeller, with his direct line to Yahweh, can provide sample of blood in which Yankee scientists can touch and save the unfortunate natives. This movie sucks.
