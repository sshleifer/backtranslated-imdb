I'm sorry, after seeing the credits, I thought that at least it would be a decent tribute to the retired actors of SF. <br /> <br /> The boy was wrong. <br /> <br /> The direction and the storytelling in this POS are terrible. I have never been so insulted by a production. <br /> <br /> I have great respect and love for many of the actors in this "movie", but I have to say that they were deceived. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and get away. These are not just two hours that you will not return, but also ruin your respect for some actors that you may have enjoyed.
