From the title, the line of the label, the summary of the plot on the DVD, etc ..., I expected something at least slightly epic, with historical fiction and romance concurring to thrill you; That's what they did in Last of the Mohicans for example, and I think they did an excellent job. Maybe I had too high standards for this movie and I did not give it a fair chance. But the scenario was just fine (how is it possible that they can not think of something more beautiful when they have landscapes to work with?), The two lovers did not have any chemistry, and the plot was so predictable that it felt as if It would have been drawn in 5 minutes by a twelve year old boy, and not very imaginative. Nouvelle-France is a love story set in a hectic historical era. But the story of Nouvelle-France is not a side note, and the love story is banal and does not make the viewer worry about the fate of the lovers. Surprisingly, the only good parts of the film came from something completely unexpected and without publicity: the relationship between Marie-Loup, the heroine and her children (one natural and one adopted). If only they had concentrated on their family and had forgotten the love story, it would have been a much better movie. Marie-Loup's parents should have been given more screen time and character development, politics in Britain should have been a scene of more than three minutes with little connection to the rest, the evil villain should have been more developed or eliminated. of the script completely (why hire actors like Vincent Perez, Tim Roth or Jason Isaacs to misuse them?) Bad work in general.
