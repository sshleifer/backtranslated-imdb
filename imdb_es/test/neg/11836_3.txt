A heartrending T-Rex baby is running loose in a small western town, prompting Sheriff Eric Roberts and animal control agent Melissa Brasselle (who walks through her role in a very disinterested way) to get to the bottom of things. They discover that a mad scientist (Corbin Bernsen) is, without the knowledge of government sponsorship, to continue with a long-abandoned American research project called Operation Jurassic Storm (ha!) Creating an army of dinosaurs in an isolated underground laboratory. In a short time, our heroes are trapped inside, the Marines are called, the power is cut off and the dinosaurs are released to prepare a quick lunch for all those who can put their claws and jaws. <br /> <br /> Despite a script often very inept filled with gaps in the plot, inconsistencies of characters and loose ends, this direct video copy of JURASSIC PARK and CARNOSAUR is quite digestible garbage, thanks to the good production values, passable effects, occasional laughter and a lot of action without a brain. <br /> <br /> Someone pointed out that an opening scene in this movie was stolen from CARNOSAUR, but anyone who is used to watching Roger Corman's productions knows that it allows directors to reuse clips from their early films to save time and money. . <br /> <br /> Score: 3 of 10
