Jimmy Stewart, ineffective, mistreated, self-pitying and lousy, is having a bad marriage with Carole Lombard. After falling into difficult times, she suffers degrading work, a mother with an aggressive, passive, aggressive and flawed life, who has a great need for an epic attack and a baby who cries incessantly. The film's palettes on failure and misery do not have a discernible end. Do you want to see a couple argue with their mother for ninety minutes? Many scenes have a baby that screams. The film fails to clarify why we would want to endure the mother of hell, or why Jimmy Stewart can not grow a couple. Who wanted to see this? Who wanted to see Stewart and Lombard without laughter or charm? <br /> <br /> It's absolutely depressing and unbearable.
