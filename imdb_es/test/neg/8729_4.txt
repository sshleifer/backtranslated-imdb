"The Apartment Complex" is a comedy full of kookie characters created in place of a true story that tells a young psychology student (Lowe) who takes a job managing an apartment complex and gets involved in a murder mystery ... You can call it that. This low quality watch contains no suspense, emotion, drama, action, few funny moments, a touch of nudity and almost no romance. "The apartment complex" is junk food passable and forgettable for the most needy people.
