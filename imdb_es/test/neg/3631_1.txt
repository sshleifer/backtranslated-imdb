The first time I saw this program I expected some laughs, good acting and good plot. Unfortunately, I do not have any of those things. <br /> <br /> First of all, this show is completely unreal. How can someone go to a boarding school that is super modern, with an impressive location and with hardly any rules? In addition to a sushi bar. A SUSHI BAR. No school has a sushi bar. And what about the huge, ultra cool and ultra modern bedrooms? This does not happen in the boarding schools! Everyone in this show seems to be perfect. Zoey, she looks perfect, she has perfect friends, she never has to do homework and she's very popular. It sounds more like a villain to me! I hate how they use so many cliques in this show, Example: Dana, the skating girl. She is completely ignorant and wears "nervous" clothes. The jokes are old, too old! I would not see this program if it were you, it's one of the most horrible programs I've seen and I hope it will be canceled soon. Score: 1/10
