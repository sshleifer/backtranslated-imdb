"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"! If IMDb allowed revisions of a single word, that would be mine. This movie was originally designed only for children and it seems to be very difficult for adults or older children to watch the movie. The song, the story, everything is boring and erased, like this impression of public domain. Like other comedy films with roots in traditional children's stories (such as the horrible SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES and the overrated BABES IN TOYLAND), this film has limited appeal and does not age well. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many children today like this movie! So my advice is NOT to watch this movie. If you MUST watch a movie by Abbott and Costello, almost any other movie (except A & C GO TO MARS) would be an improvement.
