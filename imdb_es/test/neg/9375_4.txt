For starters, I must admit that I have never been a big fan of Dutch cinema. Unfortunately, seeing De Dominee has not made me change my mind. Share some common flaws, such as having a plot too predictable and linear for my taste. <br /> <br /> However, the worst part is that the cast has its dialogues as if they were theater actors in a play. Unfortunately, this is also common in many Dutch films and, at least for me, it makes it impossible to feel any kind of relationship with the main characters. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Adri (Sorry, I'm sorry). I forgot his name right now) is at least offering a decent performance, and it's one of the reasons why I do not rate this movie even worse. Another reason is the fact that at least it seems to have had some budget, and the production seems professional. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the fact that the performance is often too articulate might not be a big problem if you do not speak Dutch, although I warned you that the plot is not spectacular either, but at least it could make be an acceptable movie to watch.
