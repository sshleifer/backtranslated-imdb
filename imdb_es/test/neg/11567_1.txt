What a desperate movie. Dress the actors in furry rags, place them in vacant suburban land, set the cameras in motion and hope for the best.

This rival rivals the monster as the best cure for insomnia that has ever been made. Oh God, how can I fill 10 lines explaining how overwhelmingly boring everyone in this movie looks? The evil plastic robot Whiney that bothers everyone both on and off the screen, the giant spider was reduced to a single giant hairy leg pulled by a rope, the actors desperately try not to look at the camera while muttering dialogues
