If you are a pretentious person, it would be a good idea to show off your intellectuality by saying that you really like this movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not bother and better look at something good. <Br /> <br /> This is the stereotypical movie for snobs. The plot line would be very silly if I could see it from start to finish. It simply presents itself in a disorderly manner as an attempt to make it difficult to understand and make the film look intellectual. <br /> <br /> Mullholland Drive is not nice to see. You would rarely understand something the first time you see it. And if he does, he will most likely be disappointed because it's not a big problem.
