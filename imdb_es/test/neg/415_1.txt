First of all, I loved the book, more than the most popular Da Vinci Code and, although the DVC movie was not well received, I liked it and I bought the DVD. However, there is no chance he wants to see Angles and Demons again. <br /> <br /> The movie just looks like the book, in fact, only the general premise of the story is there. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the film, I was disappointed that, in the book, Robert Langdon receives a call and a fax from Maximilian Kohler, Director of CERN. Who finds the body of Father (he does not remember the name) and then asks Langdon to come, using the super fast plane ... In the book, the only people who knew this technology that the Father and Daughter team had created were them same. and the camerlingo ... In the film, however, there was a great team involved ... so the tension was never there ... how they discovered it, etc. <br /> <br /> Putting aside or rather changing this whole part of the story was a big mistake and in my opinion, what made it a poor movie ... changed everything that happened since then, When the Camerlingo confronted in the closed room of the Pope, it should have been Maximilian Kohler who filmed the video from his wheelchair, the commander hurried to take the camerlingo, but Olivetti shot him, in the film he was the commander in the room and Olivetti was shot ... (I think I hit on this, but I was bored and I can not really remember the events in the movie) ... <br /> <br /> There was no love interest between them Vittoria and Robert and in the book, she was not at CERN when he arrived and, in fact, left her research work. In the book the four preferratti were killed, but in the film, the last of the four survived the source. In the book, Vittoria was kidnapped and Robert had to rescue her and it was they who killed the Assassin in the Church of the Illuminati, not exploited as he was in the Camerlingo movie. The part where Robert was held under a stone coffin was not there, saved by the alarm clock of his Mickey Mouse. Well in the book, we are led to believe that Langdon came out of the helicopter, fair enough to say that this was a little exaggerated, but it was important in the film, because he had to come back running with the movie ... It was not mentioned how Vittoria and his adoptive father got involved, this was also important to meet the character of Vittoria. <br /> <br /> In all the worst movies I've seen, I would have left early. , but my brain became numb and I lost the use of my legs temporarily. Really, it's a really bad attempt and not one of the Best of Ron Howards, in fact, how will he get back to work? It's out of my reach !!! I want my money back!!!
