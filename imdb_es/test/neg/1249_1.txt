This is possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life. What a waste of the obvious talent of Michael Imperioli. Filthy movie from start to finish. All I can say is that this director is not an "author". You never get into the game, the character's head, the incredible talent with the numbers that the real Stuey had. The coca scene is bad enough to throw your shoe on the set, it could have been a great scene if it had been filmed for movies and not for the stage, with the camera halfway to the house floating on a mirror with drugs while the drama is happening far in the background. The scene in which the great championship wins is simply laughing out loud ridiculously. This must be shown in Film-making 101 - What not to do when taking photos.
