Stripes, a comedy from the army training camp starring Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman, is one of my favorites. Meatballs, a "romp" of summer camps starring Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman, is a complete waste of time. It takes considerable effort for four screenwriters to produce a movie (the word "comedy" refers to a job with mere illusion) as witty, anemic and boring as this one. <br /> <br /> Evidently, Murray came to the same conclusion during the filming. , but his generally reliable improvisational powers escape him and his flagrant attempts to inject life into procedures only increase the embarrassment: the singing scene "It really does not matter" is unbearable. It does not help that the support cast is devoid of talent, the funniest thing about them is their hair, but then Meatballs were created in 1979. ("And introducing Chris Makepeace as Rudy" announces the opening credits.) No, not THE Chris Makepeace?!). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Reitman rectified his mistake two years later with Stripes. Murray's trick is much more fun when he's stalking people like John Candy, Warren Oates and John Larroquette. Get rid of this and look at that.
