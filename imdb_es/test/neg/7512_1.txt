If you liked it, you'll see this in a film history class or something in your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. Believe me, anything is better than this movie. It's slow, confusing, boring, badly constructed, bloody, gringy, do I have to continue? Your message is good, but I've seen it handled better in several other movies. The acting is not even good. This film is even more uncomfortable, since it starts being funny (although it is not intensive) due to its surreal history, which in the end, becomes uncomfortable to watch. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I feel that 1 Hour and 40 minutes of my life have been stolen. Why would anyone want to see a girl describe a trio for 10 minutes, watch her go through a traffic jam for 20 minutes, listen to a hippie who can make the sheep appear, witness a kind of rape, and see the female protagonist eat? her husband. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie deserves nothing more than a 1/10. And if you're not happy with my preview, I'm really an open-minded guy and I like movies that protest through symbolism, but this movie was horrible. Make any excuse you can, to avoid this movie.
