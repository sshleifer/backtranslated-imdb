For all who have read this book, Fanny Price ends up maturing in her own wife, a beautiful woman ... with a brain. Le Touzel seems to be taking medication. Terrible acting, she just ruins it! Henry is a bit tall for his character. He is also too effeminate. Mary Crawford is brilliant. Edmond is a bit old. Mrs. Norris is hysterical. Well, this casting decision works. Rushworth is also perfect. Yates seems too effeminate too. But, Le Touzel is simply horrible. This is not a good character for her. Poor Fanny! I would recommend this movie only because it includes an almost complete textual account of the language that Austen uses in the novel. The 1999 version is much more fun but terribly incomplete. If they could remake this version with an actress more suitable for Fanny, it would be fabulous!
