This movie was very disappointing, and, except for a few moments, it did not fly away. More than anything, it was just stupid. The music was very bad and the plot was played as a bowl game by BYU? very predictable (avoid embarrassment by scoring, a late burst of touchdowns in the game, a rally that falls short and leads to a loss). In essence, Will, a naive middle / middle child, and his religiously confused brother, Danny (we'll call him a Democrat), treat Kirby (the "sweet spirit of the movie"), the third member of his "boy band" Mormon, unhappy, like shit until the man and the father figure of the film (the stage director, Jill) converse with Will and straighten him out. Believably, Will's personality changes 180 degrees and he is instantly the mature and self-conscious leader of the band. This would be a nice, maybe fun, 10 minute concert in a roadshow, but the fact that the movie lasts 93 minutes really takes your life if you see it until the end. My advice ?? Take the money you would normally spend to rent this show and burn it in your fireplace or throw it into the toilet? More entertainment with much less commitment time. If you want to see a better movie of the same genre, get Saints and Soldiers? it's not a comedy, but an infinitely better show (actually, Kirby has more fun things in Saints than in SOP).
