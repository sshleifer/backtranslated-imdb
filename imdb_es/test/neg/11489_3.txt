When I saw that the icon was on television, it surprised me. I know that the first clue as to where he was going was the fact that he was on the Hallmark channel. It must be said! Sorry! I had hope when I saw that FF was the executive producer, but very quickly I discovered that the only real way in which the television movie and the book were similar were only in the name and in the names of the characters. The plot of the television was a bore, to say the least, but I agree that, in itself, the action was worth as 3 stars. In my personal opinion, Mr. Swayze could have portrayed a valid Monk, however, I think that to do justice to the film, it would have been a much longer film, and I do not think that Hollywood itself would have opted for the plot the loss of prestige due to subterfuge. An example of this is the terrible film version of The sum of all the fears: is it necessary to say more?
