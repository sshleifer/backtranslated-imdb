All I can say is that this movie is made for Lifetime Channel on television, which means that there are no solid characters, there is no particular style, they act with weakness and all kinds of sex are suggested, but not breasts and hairs (because boy, that would only catapult the movie). in the depths of sordidness, is not it?) but very simulated sex, well, that's fine. <br /> <br /> When I see these films I wonder, when will these types of television channels and their advertisers grow? I think these companies are really far behind the times. They really have no idea what the younger generation is tuning in to and if they knew they would demand that we change. The focal point of many American television channels like these seems to regurgitate the same trash disinfected and disinfected again and again as a generic movie assembly line. I guess it works for them ... or at least it has. Although I'm not sure of the future. <br /> <br /> You do not get bored until you die like I did. Look for some real TV movies on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Any channel that makes an effort in their work and does not have to ask a priest what he can or can not show.
