The update for director / screenwriter Diane English of the classic 1939 MGM comedy by George Cukor unfortunately shows more balls than his predecessor. Based on Clare Booth's shrewd observer Luce in 1936 about the evolving relationships between a strictly female group of pampered Manhattan socialists, the story seems ripe for a contemporary remake. In contrast, due to the thematic extension of English, production is presented as an extended therapy session with a lack of ingenuity. What's more, the diverse lifestyles of today's women have been reduced to stereotypes at the comedy level in this film, and the central idea of ​​the original work of eliminating men from history seems even more artificial given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred among men, as well as women since the 1930s. To add insult to the injury, HBO's recent adaptation to the big screen of "Sex and the City" made this kind of sisterhood style of women much better and with much sharper fangs. <br /> <br /> The skeleton of the original work remains as the story focuses on the wealthy Mary Haines, who gave up her promising career in clothing design to become the devoted wife of a financial assistant Wall Street. Like "Sex and the City," she is surrounded by three best friends: Sylvie Fowler, a successful magazines editor murders Miranda Priestly in "The Devil Wears Prada" (another film that echoes); the always pregnant Edie Cohen representing the wife who stays at home; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian author who seems to represent all the repressed groups generally excluded from such an exclusive clique. Through a tasty manicurist, they discover that Mary's husband is having an affair with Crystal Allen, a Saks perfumer who is more than willing to break a marriage while struggling to become an actress. The rest of the plot does not matter much, as it becomes a series of scenes centered on brotherhood and sister-feud, none of them very enlightening and without the satirical luster that animated the 1939 film. <br /> < br /> Looking oddly young at 47, Meg Ryan seems to play Mary in a way that attempts to resurrect the goodwill she engendered in the 1990s with "When Harry Met Sally" and "Sleepless in Seattle." It's not that she's not appropriate for her age here, but her jovial family seems to disagree with the character's passive nature. Annette Bening is a bit better in the role of Sylvie who stole the scene from Rosalind Russell because she has proven to be an expert in transmitting hardness and masking vulnerability, but her character undergoes such a hackneyed transformation that it seriously undermines the actress's performance . Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a shallow and transparent saleswoman in front of the clever and hard cookie that Joan Crawford has to play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are taken aside like Edie and Alex, respectively. Much better are Candice Bergen as the intelligent and understanding mother of Mary and Cloris Leachman as the housekeeper who does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Probably reflecting the lackluster response from the box office to the premiere of the film, the 2008 DVD does not have a solid image. set of extras. There are two deleted scenes: one with Crystal and her friends having a girls' night in contrast to the elaborate party in Mary's garden, and the other an extension of Bette Midler's cameo as a Hollywood agent of several marriages that counsels Mary during One night in a yoga camp. Two characters complete the extras "" The Women: The Legacy "on the story behind the film of the original 1936 play, and" The Women Behind the Women, "which features the cast and crew who talk endlessly about empowerment feminine and self-esteem The irony is that this version of "Las mujeres" directed and written by a woman has such a condescending look on women.
