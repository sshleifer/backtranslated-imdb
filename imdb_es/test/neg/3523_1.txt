Hitting the ground, the movie begins with THREE murders in a row. No plot, no characters, no motivation; The second murder occurs off the screen, and that victim's severed head is actually used to hit the third victim quite efficiently to death! This is a high point. But the Lewises are obviously intelligent enough to lead strongly; soon they are covering the scenes of failed dialogues with the voice of a detective and shooting an endless fast and fast on a very ugly plane. At this point, the horror atmosphere of this Betacam production is rapidly giving way to an insurance infomercial environment, with the monumental (and rather attractive) monumentality of the cables that skew things even further in that direction. Shlub's policeman investigates, the type of meat knife kills, repeats, reaches the climax early with a memorable gag of fingers cut into the salad. Only, how the hell did they put their fingers in the salad? And was it not the purpose of the Blood Cult to collect the appendages that they cut? When the GORE stops making sense, you know you're in trouble. And without spoiling the great twist without meaning, just trust my word: the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep impulse cathode-tube. The basic reaction is to try to leave it behind and move on with your life.
