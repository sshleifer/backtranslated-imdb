What can you expect from a direct DVD movie? You know what you're getting into when you rent this. The quality of cinematography reminds me of TV reality shows. <br /> <br /> Why are the shots so close to the actors !? And why are they always centered? There is nothing to look at. (And the actors are so cool, so it blows). <br /> <br /> The writing and the dialogue are simply horrible. That introductory scene with the British guy is hilarious. Just try to hear these words, they almost have no meaning, just go around in circles. The lines in the rest of the film sound as if they had come out of romantic and science fiction novels, as if the writers had no idea what they were doing. The characters definitely sound like they have no idea what they're saying. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. I feel bad for the actors linked to this project. Embarrassing!
