This is a really hateful show. In fact, it is an example of how low television has fallen since "reality" became fashionable. Tanya is pretty, but she is also extremely rude and has a horrible taste. Is a house showing the place for sexual attractiveness? Apparently, some men like the show because they find Tanya attractive. The other boss is not pretty, but he's completely rude and he also has a horrible taste. It is unfortunate that you have to show so many houses while someone still lives in them. Most people who are supposedly seeing these houses before the changes are made must move to new or completely empty houses so they do not insult anyone. Most of them ... like the "crew" ... must be taught manners. I can imagine how horrible the British show is, since British reality shows tend to be even worse when it comes to manners and tastes. <br /> <br /> What happened to the Arts and Entertainment channel? When it started (and some years later) it was filled with goodies. Now it is a big garbage machine.
