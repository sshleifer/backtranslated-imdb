With several well-known actors (Lance Henrikson, David Warner, Joe Don Baker), why was Jeffery Combs given leadership? Henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead, just like Warner, Baker or even others in the film like Charles Napier. Combs was a mistake in this, and did a bad job. Everything he did seemed false or artificial. <br /> <br /> The script is poor. Which means that if Lance Henrikson (or someone else) had the lead role, he could have saved the movie (removed from my "wasted time" category), but it still would have been a bad movie. The game screen was completely deficient. The director should have recognized this and helped the film.
