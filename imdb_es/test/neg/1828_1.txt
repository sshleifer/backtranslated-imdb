Anatomie was a film made in Germany and subtitled. It was also too long and boring. If it was supposed to be a horror movie, it failed miserably for me. The film work was fine, but more attention should have been paid to the horrible banal script. I did not pay anything to watch the video and I still feel cheated. Go read a book and save your money.
