The movie Razor Blade Smile has an interesting title, as well as a leading role. Now most do not like this movie because the plot and the acting were a bit cheap, but that's the appeal of a movie like Razor Blade Smile. In a way it was supposed to be a bad movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you watch this movie until the end, you'll see that it's like I said a cheap vampire movie with a bit of humor. (Also, the way they manipulate colors in some scenes is very interesting). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is the kind you rent and laugh with your friends and enjoy it for what it is. Because no film is bad at all. <br /> <br /> As Lilith Silver says: "Humans just do not smile enough ..."
