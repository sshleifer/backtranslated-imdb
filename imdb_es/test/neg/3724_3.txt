I do not remember much about this movie, except that there was a clearly free destruction of luminaries (lamps). Almost all the fighting scenes included the wanton and wanton destruction of useful lighting fixtures, even if they were fitted with cylindrical shades of the 70s style to maintain the configuration of the story. On one occasion, there was a thunderous destruction of lamps in a scene of domestic fighting between the brothers, both in the living room and in the dining room of his mother's house, and the accessories of both rooms were removed. However, the most malicious destruction occurs moments later in the office of a bookmaker and includes, among others, the demolition of an accessory with a ceramic horse head base, which therefore disintegrates, and the dent Severe of a cylindrical tone as The boy falls back on him during another punch fight. Later, that lamp also collapses when the man is shot, which affects more damage to the plastic coated screen. <br /> <br /> Although this film fosters a particularly wasteful attitude toward lamps, it must be taken into account that lamps, regardless of their cheap construction or gauche, their high weight appearance, are still valuable for lighting that they provide However, if you ever feel the need to indirectly break a lamp, I recommend this movie.
