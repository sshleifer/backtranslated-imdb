This totally extravagant movie is so exaggerated, pathetic and unrealistic that during the 90 minutes of total torture, I probably looked at my watch about 70,000 times! Lucy Bell is much taller than this shit and for her to sink so low is quite depressing. I must admit that the whole audience I was in was laughing hysterically, but most of them were Greek or Italian, so I guess this humor will probably make them laugh, but not me. All this movie does is make you sick to see all these idlers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes. God, and I will never be able to recover those 90 minutes!
