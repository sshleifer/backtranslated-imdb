Luchino Visconti, the artist with the sword. Courage must be the first word associated with his entire work. Movie. Theater. Music. Revolutions, artistic, cultural, personal. A legacy with powerful consequences and infinite ramifications. He introduced neorealism through the work of an American novelist James Cain in "Ossesione." He gave Anna Magnani the most extraordinarily beautiful close-ups of his career. He gave us Alain Delon and Maria Callas. But the last word about his life and work is based on the talents of one Adam Low and the voice of Helmut Berger. What a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> For those interested, there is a 61-minute documentary by director Carlo Lizzani (a man who really knew Visconti) entitled LUCHINO VISCONTI A PORTRAIT. It is on DVD distributed by Image Entertainment.
