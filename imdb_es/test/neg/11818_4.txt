The plot of Black Mama White Mama revolves around two inmates, in a prison for women in the Philippines. A black and a white. These two women are thrown together in jail. Pam Grier is Lee Daniels Lee is incarcerated in the hellish prison of women, for dancing like a girl from the harem. <br /> <br /> Lee's boyfriend owes him a portion of his earnings, from his drug trafficking activities. Lee is mainly interested in getting out of prison to get her boyfriend's drug money, so he can leave the Philippines and take on a better life. Margaret Markov plays Karen Brent, a white woman with a privileged background, who is also a revolutionary. Karen joined a group of revolutionaries, determined to change the corrupt Philippine political system. She was captured by the Philippine authorities and kept as a political prisoner. <br /> <br /> The story line takes off, when Karen and Lee leave the prison where they were together. The two of them were also chained in the wrist. While they flee, they also fight among themselves, because they have different objectives to pursue. Naturally, they hate being chained together. But they also realize that they must put aside their differences, to help each other survive while evading capture. <br /> <br /> If this movie seems very similar to The Big Bird Cage, it is because much of the cast in the Two films are the same, as well as its location in the Philippines. Roger Corman, has always had a consistent set of actors, which he used in all his films of the 70s B. In addition to Pam Grier, Sid Haig, Roberta Collins, Claudia Jennings, Betty Anne Rees and William Smith, were also among the many actors who were frequently chosen in Corman's AIP films. <br /> <br /> Like The Big Bird Cage, Black Mama White Mama, relies on too much bloody violence to be acceptable. Pam Grier conveys her usual tough girl personality in this movie and shows her competition as a female heroine of action. Margaret Markov has less effects, in her interpretation of the revolutionary Karen. She seems frail and well-groomed, like a dedicated political guerrilla. With the exception of Sid Haig, like the colorful Ruben, the rest of the cast is forgettable. <br /> <br /> This movie has little entertainment value, unless it is excessive and atrocious acts of violence. Only the performances of Pam Grier and Sig Haig make it worthwhile to watch this movie.
