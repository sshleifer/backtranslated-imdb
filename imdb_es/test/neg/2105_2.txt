I would probably want to give this film a zero if it were not for the climax, which does not really involve snakes in a train, but to train IN a snake. The premise was cooked much more than likely over the course of a night of beers after hearing about Snakes on a Plane in production (this, in fact, was released to coincide with the premiere of the movie). The joke probably will not be lost on those who will seek it; I do not believe that there is a soul out there that considers this a serious effort of suspense action (unless it is at an ironic level beyond the capacity of rational thought). It is a Mayan curse on a woman condemned by her family for having left with another man, and soon she is seen sick and coughing with green slime tied with, of course, snakes. She and her boyfriend travel in a train that goes to Los Angeles, and very soon after the characters more than cliche are aware of the snakes that overcome the train, the originating woman becomes a snake. <br /> <br /> If it would be worth listing more about the film, I would, but there is not enough time during the day. All that can be said about the quality factor is that it is almost nonexistent; There are short films of students with bigger budgets. Maybe that was an accurate calculation at the end of the filmmakers, that there would be so many copies sold, just for the joke factor, that they would include their budget again the first weekend. Because when looking at the sets (the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a scene!), The actors (if you can call them that, with only another actor, the one with the very thin hair that hits the only woman) throughout the movie, who benefited from the film that was produced, the FX (also almost non-existent, making the effects on Serpents in an airplane look like Star Wars), and the real CGI snakes themselves, with the giant giant snake ending something to contemplate in terms of science fiction movie channels. <br /> <br /> All this means, basically, that it is a riot of laughter every step of the way (especially, as cruel as it sounds, when a girl becomes involved in the "attention" of a snake), with a great disregard for good taste that works well in their favor. That said, it's also 100% disposable, like a B-sour sour flavor flavor palette.
