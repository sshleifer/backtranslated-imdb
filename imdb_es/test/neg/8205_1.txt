This film shows what you can create if you have a camera, a little paint and cardboard, a toy boat, some friends who acted in the community theater and the wrong idea that you can make a movie. The end result is an indisputable loss of time that will be skipped, unless you take it out of the DVD player and throw it out the window first. <br /> <br /> The acting in the opening scene (especially by the resounding Lee Morgan as 'Captain') and the toy ship "crashing" against the rocks before the credits is a good indicator of what awaits you (with all the foam, it seems that this "special effect" was filmed in a kitchen sink, I guess Boyette thought he would save some money by washing the dishes at the same time). In terms of bad movies, the funny thing is that "Dungeon of Harrow" seems to have inspired (perhaps by coincidence) the end of "Hands: The hands of destiny". Yes, it's the same lame "I was the victim, and now I take the place of the crazy villain," the ironic ending. The biggest irony is that two inept and untalented filmmakers could make two equally lousy horror films, filmed in Texas, and get away with it. <br /> <br /> The monotonous nerd Russ Harvey is a noble in a great family line (why they were great, they were never mentioned, bored at the same time we mourn the death of their family line and their shield before they his ship crashes (we also treat a droning narrative throughout the film.) Unfortunately, we are not so lucky.Your family's toy ship crashes into some Styrofoam in a sink, and they land it with his swollen captain and a woman, conveniently placed on the island of a crazy earl. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the count is visited by an evil spirit, who, dressed in a suit of Blackstone's Magic Kit, he assaults with several puppets (spiders, snakes, bats ... all the frightful things) .The Count (William McNulty) behaves worse than Shatner and it visibly makes it difficult for him to maintain a serious face through a typical crazy madman. <br / > <br /> It also makes me mad I would have to be in this mess. The woman is quickly killed by the Count's ferocious dogs, and the two idiots are captured by her servant. The Count accuses them of being pirates (apparently his worst fear), he slaps his servant (apparently his greatest joy), Fatboy is tortured, there is a woman who is a servant and a nurse, the rotten leper. - a wedding dress Countess in the dungeon (she digs the Nerdy Noble and is the only effective and spooky thing in the movie), a lot of inane dialogue on the dining room table, the Captain's mania is killed while making a pathetic escape ( for watching a lazy battling a pack of lions). . . Everything is an ugly haze for me. I spent most of my time on the fast forward button. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the idiot noble and the nurse make a break and they think they'll be rescued by three guys in a rowboat on the lake (yes, we're supposed to believe that a lake is the ocean). They do not, since the nerd's hair turned gray and he scares the possible rescuers. Honestly, I think they just took the opportunity to get away from this horrible movie while they had the chance. They head back to the castle, the nurse begins to rot like the Countess (and her stomach, at this moment), and we end up with these two preparing to descend on it. . . DUNGEON DE HARROW !!!! Blech! <br /> <br /> I love old and miserable horror movies, but they must have some kind of entertainment value. I feel cheated, even at the low price of $ 5.99 for this cookie. Mystery Science Theater would have a hard time making this fun. I was surprised by a few crazy people who said that this movie had an atmosphere and some scary moments. Incorrect! Avoid this gut at all costs, and do not even waste a dollar if you find it in a container of dollars somewhere. This film makes Corman's "The Terror" a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.
