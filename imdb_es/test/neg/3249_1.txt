This movie made me laugh a lot. It was a bloody joke telling you the truth. So incredible and the worst plot in history. The performance was also bad. I do not know why so many popular Bollywood actors and actresses took this film. The script must have been a joke in a way. The visual effects in this movie were extremely painful to watch. I think a kindergarten kid could have done a better job of the visual effect and a monkey could have done a better job of devising a plot. <br /> <br /> The plot has numerous attempts to copy the main Hollywood movies. like The Terminator but it fails miserably. I laughed in my head to see this movie. A total disaster in the history of Indian cinema!
