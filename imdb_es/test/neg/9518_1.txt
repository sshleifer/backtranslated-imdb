I really wanted to see this at the Sydney Film Festival. I left the theater, like many others, before the final credits because I could not take it anymore. It was badly thrown, the sound sucks, and the performance was worse than an episode of The Love Boat. Now I know why this movie could not find a US distribution company to launch it in the United States. This screams of a low budget high school production.
