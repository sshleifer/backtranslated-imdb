Although not as bad as some movies (such as the horrible "Atomic Twister"), "Meltdown" is still based on misconceptions and common inaccuracies about the nuclear power industry to advance its plot. I am currently studying Nuclear Engineering in the pursuit of a master's degree, and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved in the industry. <br /> <br /> Facing the false fear of a Chernobyl style collapse It could happen in a US plant, the film indicates that any collapse (even partial, according to one of the guest commentators in the film) would mean a disaster for the area. In fact, a partial meltdown in a US plant, while destroying the core, would not pose any risk to the surrounding area. Three Mile Island experienced a partial meltdown and no radioactive material was released to the environment, thanks to the natural fuel stability and core design used in this country along with substantial containment. <br /> <br /> The security steps shown in the film were perhaps the part of the film that was the farthest from the truth. At any important strategic location, whether it's a power plant, a chemical plant, a military base, anything, you'll never see the staff responding to an alarm by speaking as if it were an unannounced drill. This is especially true in a nuclear power plant, where, when the alarm sounds, the reactors are SCRAMed immediately, shutting them down. SCRAM can be done at the push of a button in the control room (it is not necessary to put the core in "shutdown mode" as shown in the movie), and the chemistry of nuclear fission prevents a nucleus from returning to place. Power within approximately 9 hours of an SCRAM. So, if this scenario were to unfold in real life, the assailants could not cause a significant collapse. In theory, they could still cause a partial due to residual heat if they exposed the core immediately, but that would be almost impossible given the numerous backup systems present in a plant. There are many more than the individual backup pumps they talk about. in the film. <br /> <br /> As for the spent fuel pools, it may be possible to turn them into a dirty bomb by blowing them up, but this is much more difficult than simply parking a truck full of explosives near the pools. The fuel is under (approximately) 18 feet of highly purified water. Water can not become radioactive (there is no radioactive vapor as mentioned in the film). Particles dissolved in water can, but water itself can not; Therefore, the reason for a very complete purification. So the only way to turn a fuel pool into a dirty pump is to get the fuel out of the water. It is not an easy task, since the water is very heavy and the pools are underground with very thick concrete walls. The explosives would have to be in the pool below the fuel (which is well attached). And there should be a lot of explosives, since the water is * very * difficult to move through an explosion. Even if this happened, the spent fuel is not extremely radioactive, and the explosion would not cause a number of deaths as high as mentioned in the film, especially given the small amount of radioactive material that would be propagated. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of a basic movie, I got a little tired of the style used. The constant fading in and out, the use of black and white sandstone, and the rapid tracking and panning seemed unprofessional. The characters were one-dimensional, especially those of the government of the United States. I have some problems with the turn in the movie, but I will not discuss it, since it would be a great spoiler. <br /> <br /> In general, 3/10
