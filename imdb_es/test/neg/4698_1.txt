I liked Half-Life. I'm still a fan It was terrifying, intelligent and challenging. I do not tell any news, it is one of the best FPS that have been made. Maybe I'm a Half-Life fan too hard, but the so-called Half-Life 2 is not Half-Life 2. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: THIS is the next chapter of Half-Life? Maybe the creators -Valve- think so, but I do not. Where are the intelligent enemies? Where is the terrifying atmosphere? Nowhere. I think they wanted to make Half-Life a bit different (instead of another research station story), but not only did they do a very different one, they did something that has to do with Half-Life like, for example, Quake does to condemn. The whole game is so unpleasant and unreal that it is almost desolate. <br /> <br /> Although physics is really great and there was a good level to play, the idea of ​​making a revolutionary game based on physics has completely failed. When you get the Gravity-gun, which can move objects, you can wait with rights to use it as a weapon, which would turn the game's FPS scheme. The truth is that you can not use Gravity-gun as a real weapon. Why? Because the best thing you can do is throw boxes and barrels that do not cause much damage. If you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it, you can fall from about 3 shots. If you want to throw an explosive barrel at your enemy, it can explode in your own "hand". The gravity gun does not work like a weapon. The best use is to solve some physical puzzles. I ask Valve: Why? The truth is that you must use your schematic and boring FPS weapons until the end (except in the last level). Weapons are not what makes the original Half-Life a classic. If Gravity-gun was always like in the last level, a real weapon, I would admire what Valve did. But not this. This is disappointing. <br /> <br /> So if you want Half-Life then you're looking in the wrong place. Maybe they enjoy it, but I repeat it: it's everything, but not Half-Life, and it's not even a faithful continuation of that. This is the biggest disappointment of all time. The valves have shown that they can also make terrible games. They have achieved that.
