There is not much about "Reckless" that feels good, starting with the nasty title (thanks to screenwriter Craig Lucas, who adapted his own work, taking the title with him) and continues with the casting (Mia Farrow playing the wife Tony Goldwyn, who is young enough to be his son). The couple lives in an idyllic winter world that seems to be inside a snowball, but Farrow receives a surprising dose of reality after he admits that he has hired a man to kill her. She flees into the night, taking refuge with a very strange couple who wants to help her rebuild her life. The production design and art direction of "Reckless" are fine, but they are services rendered for a completely inane, often alienating script. It is supposed to be a dark Christmas comedy, although the cast is lost with this fun and occasionally offensive material. * 1/2 of ****
