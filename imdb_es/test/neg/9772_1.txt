I think the "bone thief" should go after anyone associated with this movie. Seeing this will seem like the longest 90 minutes of your entire life. The plot is boring and stupid. There were no scenes that were horrible, not even remotely. If you manage to endure this excellent work of cinematographic art until the end, you will be very disappointed or you will die of hysterical laughter. I bought this movie based on some other reviews I had read. I wish I had recovered my money. What a skunker. If you are looking for a horror movie that appeals to you, watch "U Turn". It may be based on a crazy plot, but it's full of those spooky scenes that keep you jumping from start to finish.
