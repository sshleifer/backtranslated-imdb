By far, this is the worst Halloween movie ever made. The acting is bad, except Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence. The girl who played Kara (forgot her name) was fine, but in general this movie was basically a big disappointment. Nothing advanced the story, it lacked substance and the fears that made Halloween and the H20 so good. In general, skip this movie, it's not worth the rental price.
