I have seen some terrible adaptations from book to film in my day, but it surpasses them all! The strangely unattractive cast detracts from the value of the story, which is, in itself, false to the book. Mr. Tilney is not handsome; As for Catherine Morland, a ratlike appearance makes this heroine difficult to sell to a sympathetic audience. Isabella is not at all like the Aphrodite that is read in the original text, and James Morland appears in the film too little for the viewer to understand his important role in the story. In addition, as others have pointed out earlier, this novel was intended to satirize the Gothic fashion that prevailed in Austen's time, but it seems that this "soft horror" movie was designed and intended to be taken seriously. I'm sure that Jane Austen is stirring in her grave every time one of her fans is disappointed by this horrible interpretation of what was supposed to be a joke.
