While design and locations and photography are important assets in this film; it is a turgid and melodramatic subject that demonstrates the limits of the cinema to transmit the truth. <br /> <br /> The case is the use of music from the soundtrack: a mix of Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber who plays constantly and loudly, and would have made Max Steiner grimace at his excessive use, because it instructs the audience about how difficult it is; How enraptured How tortured it is to be an artist. And then, it really tells that the story hides the details at the end. <br /> <br /> Peter Ackroyd, once this exaggerated and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once well ridiculed about a book by Yukio Mishima: this is not writing, this is Barbara Cartland. Precisely, you can make the same criticism of this film: a deceptive, mawkish vanity project.
