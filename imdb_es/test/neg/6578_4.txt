I like the helpless. Then, 12 years after having first seen Star Trek V, and thinking it was strangely bad, I gave him a second watch, hoping to find something of quality that he lost the first time. <br /> <br /> I do not. <br /> <br /> The writing is half done, and although at first the quality of the performance is stable enough to keep the film on its feet (although trembling), the more we get into the plot the more foolish places. The last quarter of the movie is just ridiculous. What was even worse, according to the POV of the original cast, is that this was the first ST movie released AFTER the franchise returned to television with Next Generation, and the Next Generation average episode would embarrass it *, including the effects special! What a shame. <br /> <br /> The Final Frontier is not entirely unhappy (I gave it 4 out of 10), but it's way below the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first one), that the only one The reason why It occurs to me to see it is because you will appreciate more the other movies. <br /> <br /> * unless it's an episode with Troi's mother.
