I've seen this movie last week during the Berlin Film Festival and had high average expectations. - The director is Bertrand Tavernier and he knew some of his previous work in French cinema. I really enjoyed some of his previous films. -The cast: Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgard, Mary Steenburgen ... I really wanted to see all this talent on the screen. -I was not familiar with the book on which it is based and I had not read anything about the film beforehand, but they told me it was an investigative film set in the deep south (we have seen many of them in the past, maybe this is going to be as good as the others ...) <br /> <br /> 2 hours later, the final titles appear: THANKS TO GOD !! - The plot is beyond comprehension. If you have read the book, you have a significant advantage. There were too many minor characters and many useless plot arcs. We did not understand anything! - The accents. OMG! The accent of Tommy Lee Jones is decent, but I still have nightmares about the singing of the French and Cajun of Mary Steenburgen ... - Poor casting in my opinion. I can not believe that old Tommy Lee Jones can beat a linebacker imbecile ... And I'm not afraid of John Goodman. - Who were these people? We barely understand who these characters are and what they do. Is there a bait shop? Tommy Lee Jones has a girl from Guatemala? Bl√∂rg! - The comic attempts were pathetic. The most fun part of the movie was probably his "action" and "suspense" scenes. They were horrible. There are no emotions. Bad acting (Can Tommy Lee Jones make different faces or is it like Derek Zoolander?) ... - And then there's the science fiction stuff. No spoilers, but it becomes ridiculously annoying. <br /> <br /> I do not usually write any comments on IMDb, but I thought the movie was so bad and disappointing that I felt compelled to share my opinion. But that's just me ...
