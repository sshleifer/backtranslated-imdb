Well, it shakes me aside. I have not seen such a bad home movie since the abysmal 13 SECONDS or HALF CASTE. Someone should take away the Sony Handycam of this type! This movie shows that just because you can make a movie on your camcorder for $ 20 does not necessarily mean you should do it. <br /> <br /> I remember that one of the things that Robert Rodriguez wrote in his book, "Rebel Without a crew" was that when he set out to do a function without a budget, he has to use the assets that he has at his disposal . Rodriguez says you should take an inventory of all the locations and accessories you can ask for, steal and borrow from your friends. Robert Rodriquez was a friend of the mayor of some city in Mexico, so the mayor allowed him to shoot for free. What you got in EL MARIACHI was a movie that seemed to cost much more than the real budget. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the director of this movie has a copy of that book, and he took that note. Advice for the heart In this case, he was apparently a friend of a man who owned a corn field where they set up a haunted house every year. It seems like a pretty good location for a scary movie, but it's hard to keep an interesting cornfield for 90 minutes. Not a single installment of the series CHILDREN OF THE MAIN spent more than a few minutes in the cornfield. Hitchcock only spent about ten minutes in one at NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Take a clue, friend ... corn fields do not make a fascinating cinema. It would have been nice if the director had had more friends with more locations, because this becomes quite tedious after the first 15 minutes. This movie seems to cost around $ 30. (Or whatever it costs in admission to the cornfield maze). <br /> <br /> Apparently, he could not even find anyone to act in his movie, so he launched himself. Big mistake. Here is a thought, if you really want to make a movie, get an actor. So, with regard to the assets, it seems that the maze of the corn field is the only thing the poor man had. Maybe he thought that was enough. In fact, I'm going to take a chance and say I KNOW that he believed that was enough because the film, before capturing the coveted honor of being the sequel to DARK HARVEST, was simply called THE CORN: THE MOVIE. Maybe he's already planning MAIZE: THE MUSICIAN or even THE MAIZE: THE MINI SERIES. <br /> <br /> Our Jack-of-All-Trades (and yes, the Master of Nothing part of that saying is definitely appropriate here) plays a psychic father who can tell when bad things will happen. Think of the character in the DEAD ZONE, but not in an actor as good as Christopher Walken or even Anthony Michael Hall. Psychic dad has the premonition that his two daughters, who are in the corn maze with mom, will be killed. He hastens to save them. From that moment, the whole movie is spent watching Pyschic Dad run in a field of corn, looking for his two daughters. Find the two girl ghosts of THE SHINING, and help solve the mystery of her murder. <br /> <br /> Engraved in a $ 200 Handycam. The director threw himself out. Edited in iMovie. Improvised story If that is not enough to keep you away from this corn catastrophe, consider this as a final warning ... ALL THE MOVIE takes place in a field of corn, ampoules and ghouls. Here is Ghoulie Guru's advice on how to save some money and feel that you have seen this movie. The next time you see a field of corn, stop the car. Take a flashlight and run around for about 90 minutes.
