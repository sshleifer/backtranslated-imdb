I thought I would like to see this movie because I am currently making a film about a mysterious box, so it would be great to see how this film took and developed the idea of ​​a mysterious and unexpected box. <br /> <br /> Before going to the cinema I had many expectations with this movie. with actresses, like Cameron Diaz, you can expect the performance, especially hers, to be excellent. The performance was a kind of disappointment for the film, the accents of the characters changed throughout the film and made it incredible. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a strange box that can make your dreams come true but destroy others is such a brilliant story, but I feel that the director disappointed him, this film had potential, it could have been a lot better than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie had nothing to do with that. It was too confusing and needed a stable plot. nobody wants to go into the cinema and go out and think what I just saw 'I did not understand at all', sometimes it can be exciting and make people want to see it again, but this movie made people never want to see it. I want to hear the movie again. As I watched, I noticed that half of the audience had left before the end. I feel that each person has been disappointed to see this movie due to the high expectations and the slowness of the parts of the film. <br /> <br /> allows to put the negative points aside ... I liked, however, Scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end. It was unexpected, it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was put together made me imagine it and how devastating and terrifying it would be to be in that position. The lighting and the effects made it look great, this scene looked a little more in the 90s than in the 70s that this movie is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> This movie was confusing because it had many different fragments. parts that you would expect to be summarized at the end, where everything is clarified, but it was not, was totally against the expectations of the audience, despite leaving the film on a rack, not giving the audience a reason why that things happen to work and do really well, but this is not, it was a creative film, different and unusual, I thought, had potential could have been better, disappointed I did not enjoy it, I would not buy it on a DVD to be honest.
