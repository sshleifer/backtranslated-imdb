Not just the money we pay to rent it or go to the movies. I'm talking about how big production companies waste so much money on things that are really boring and do not talk about ridicule. With the millions that they used to make a movie like this, because I do not think the actors here really work for free or for an insignificant sum. With that money, imagine how many good independent films you could make, or maybe a good Hollywood movie. It's just to steal, but not from anyone, just the majority of teenagers who are willing to go see an Ashton Kutcher movie, just because they're fans of him. Nor do I really know how someone with common sense could act in this type of movie. If you really look at it in perspective, the actors are of the same quality as this movie. So I guess I should not be surprised, I really could not have expected more.
