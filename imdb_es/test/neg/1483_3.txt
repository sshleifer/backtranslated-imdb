One of those movies that bet on who will die first and who will survive in the end. There was something in the movie that made me walk away. I think because I keep looking back and I think "yes, still in that tree ... still looking at the water". Poor character development I did not feel anything when they were in danger. I was voting for the crocodile. It was hard for me to believe that a crocodile would try to tilt a boat first and then, when it jumps into the boat, I think it is also very unlikely. The crocodile sometimes seems too supernatural ('all knowing that they all see'). Also, when the crocodile attacks its behavior it seems very unrealistic. It is a killing machine and would not allow victims to escape two or three times in a row, especially when they attack in the water.
