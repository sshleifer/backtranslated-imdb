Even in her glasses with the geek mode, Kathy Ireland is very good for the eyes, but her performance is not easy to see. Most of the actors in the film, either do it over (beyond the "countryside fun") or act a little embarrassed to be there. The effects and the soundtrack are nothing special and a fairly low budget. The plot line REALLY stretches the ability to suspend disbelief. Take this moment to laugh if you come in a premium movie channel or on the Saturday afternoon TV network, but do NOT lose money with this. <br /> <br /> A worthy mention for trivial purposes is that one of the clandestine mobsters is played by Deep Roy. Deep is now famous for playing (and doing well) all the Oompa Loompas in Burton's "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory".
