Oh, my God, I expected something more entertaining than this when I downloaded this movie, since 1903 was one of my favorite years for movies, but it stunk! The "plot", although I would hesitate to call it that, is a silly elephant. Little by little he makes his way on some platform and electrocutes himself to death. Lame. Even for a short film, the plot was too thin to hold my attention. Edison is, like, the worst director of all time. Also, the elephant has no screen presence at all. And the end? Wow, that was not predictable at all. * sarcasm * <br /> <br /> The quality of the image is also horrible. You can barely tell what happens most of the time. The only positive thing about this movie is that, unlike most other horror films that do not scare, this did not generate eleven sequels. Apart from that, this is a complete waste of money and 1 minute of your life that you will never recover.
