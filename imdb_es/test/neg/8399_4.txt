... now, please, move because that makes me nervous. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the man behind brilliant pieces like "My Own Private Idaho" and "To Die For" (and other not-so-brilliant movies, that is, the unnecessary remake "Psycho" started a phase experimental with "Gerry", which peaked with the "Elephant" that provokes reflection. "Last Days" had some interesting aspects, but it was very uneven, while "Paranoid Park", his new movie, also has youngsters 15 years of handsome walking ... and not much more ... Some interesting references to Fellini (the soundtrack reuses some beautiful pieces by Nino Rota) and the elegant cinematography of the legendary Christopher Doyle ("In the Mood for Love") are the aspects Most outstanding, but the film is too artistic and meaningless for its own doom.We have had many better maturation stories, and "Paranoid Park" does not bring anything new.I do not see anything artistic about watching excessive shots of Gabe Nevins in his underwear or on the d Or when Nevins and 13-year-old Taylor Momsen (the girl from "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"), who plays his cheerleader girlfriend, have sex for the first time, just because he felt they had to do it and after Una Once this is done, call your friend to tell her that it was amazing (and you can tell by Nevins' face how traumatic it was). Everyone knows that they are starting earlier and earlier today, movies like "Thirteen" and even "Elephant" (which shows how lost their minds are in general, not only when it comes to sexuality) have made a better portrait of that. Gus tries to be minimalist and artistic, but the end result is boring and uninteresting. His next project, "Milk", a biopic about Harvey Milk starring Sean Penn, will bring, with luck, the good Gus back, because, frankly, this obsession with underage children is almost ... spooky. 4.5 / 10
