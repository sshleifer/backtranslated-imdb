As you may not know, EÃ§a de Queiroz is one of the most respected writers in Portugal. He was witty, he did not spare anyone in his critics and now he must be rolling in his grave. And that is not because this film is bad, what it is, but as a result of the treatment given to one of his masterpieces "O Crime do Padre Amaro". It is treated as cheap and disposable garbage. <br /> <br /> When it became known that it was going to be a "modern and urban" version of the book that feared for the worst, normally modern in these contexts means taking the freedom to take the p **** make an adaptation, in the middle of the way to do it in the most bad way possible. And so, the moral and social dilemma of a priest who has a secret and forbidden affair is replaced by extra long passages of people who traffic drugs and sing hip-hop for no particular reason or pertinent to the plot. It is just there as if it had not been. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's a lot of sex, so at least you can count on that when you wear this. Do you remember how all the films of the 80s, regardless of gender or tone, always found a way to sneak into the nudity? If it was a thriller and they did not need it, they simply found the way that when they were capturing a criminal, "it occurred to him" that he was in bed with a woman who was walking screaming (naked, of course) when the police Ahem broke in, free is the word I think. Not that there is anything wrong with the nude scenes, but here they make the creators of this film look desperate simply because there is nothing else in the film, it is totally devoid of what you call dramatic content.
