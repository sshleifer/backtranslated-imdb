As I write this in November 2005, I have come to realize that the great boom of British cinema has come to an end and, while people will say that much of this is owed to the British government, not to the taxation of the filmmakers, I think the cause is very important. Simplest: lack of diversity on the part of producers in recent years. Let's take a look at what the British were producing 1995-2005: <br /> <br /> Funky gangster thrillers. LOCK STOCK AND TWO BARRAL SMOKERS was a really great and entertaining movie, and people went out of their way to imitate Guy Ritchie's style with generally disappointing results. <br /> <br /> Romantic comedies. Yes, yes, I realize that FOUR WEDDINGS, NOTTING HILL, etc., were produced by American studios, but they are still vaguely "British films." Unfortunately, because they are guaranteed to earn a profit for the studios, they must follow a winning formula that usually involves Hugh Grant playing Hugh Grant for the umpteenth time. <br /> <br /> black comedies. Can anyone explain what a black comedy really is? In the British context, it is usually a rambling film with often contemporary political statements and that often resembles NAKED <br /> <br /> by Mike Leigh. BEAUTIFUL YOUNG PEOPLE by Jasmin Disdar is a good example of the third type of British film. Filmed in 1999 but set in 1993, it opens with two men fighting on a bus and later it is revealed that one is a Serb and one is a Croatian, so we have a summary of what was happening in the Balkans at that time , although the odds that two old enemies in the Balkans will bump into each other on a London bus? This sums up one of the main flaws of the film: irony has priority over probable situations, you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots, but is the result likely? Perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film. It is called BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE but certainly this member of the audience found them as stereotyped people in whom I could not believe as three-dimensional characters.
