It's hard to believe that Oprah Winfrey produced this piece of scrap, the show could not even show a candle in the cooking shows of the past, including emeril lagasse, rachael ray is the most annoying talk show and cooking show in the history of the television, not since ainsley harriott has had a terrible cooking show I've seen, at least ainsley harriott has some good times and a certain style, this one has no style, it's terrible as a hostess, the kitchen looks atrocious, the writing is horrible, the teleplay is exaggerated and the initial credits are so bad that they make me sick. Now I enjoy cooking programs that have a great sense of style, but this has absolutely nothing of that. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst television shows of the year.
