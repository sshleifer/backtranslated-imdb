I like Noel Coward, ingenuity. I like Noel Coward, the work he writes. I like Noel Coward, the composer and singer, but I detest Noel Coward, the actor. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a man who should have stayed behind the scenes, writing his works, composing his music and making music. His deep and hilarious observations. He should never have been allowed to stand in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, he is one of the most outstanding talents of the 20th century, but the man simply could not act and his voice ... with R and has a too round tonal quality ... good , in my opinion, I could easily grate the cheese. <br /> <br /> This is one of my least favorite offers from Coward, as it portrays a psychiatrist unconvincingly. Embarking on an adventure with a much younger woman, made worse by the fact that the much younger woman is a friend from the old school of his much younger wife. <br /> <br /> Celia Johnson is a joy to see her as always as cowardly mistreated wife. It is his performance that saves this film from an abject boredom. I guess her own little adventure in Coward's Brief Encounter four years ago qualified her for this role, since she should have raised some eyebrows when playing such a promiscuous woman and this gave her the opportunity to recover some fans and gain some lost sympathy . <br /> <br /> She was such a wonderful actress and you can see why Noel Coward used her so much in many of her productions. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the film is monotonous, misinterpreted, predictable and, in general, boring at an almost closed level. <br /> <br /> If what you want is Noel Coward, take the time to see what we serve, Blythe Spirit or This Happy Breed. Three treasures noel cowards. With beautiful movies like these, I suppose we can forgive him for this turkey. <br /> <br /> I have given these four stars only by the addition of Miss Johnson, but in general, I would avoid this as the plague. .
