Sex is a most remarkable aspect of existence. It is perhaps the most interesting activity between birth and death. THE DECLINE OF L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN studies human sexuality in a dry and boring way. Actually, worse than being simply bored, seeing 40-year-old naked people is, well, unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I suppose there is some impact in having adults as old as our parents who talk about sex, but after twenty minutes, this is no longer interesting. Maybe if the characters were all 20 years younger, the film would be more visually captivating. <br /> <br /> THE DECLINE OF L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN is not worth it.
