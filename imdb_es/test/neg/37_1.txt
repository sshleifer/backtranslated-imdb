The first 20 minutes were a bit funny because I do not think I've seen such a bad movie before (acting, script, effects (!), Etc.). The rest of the execution time seemed to drag forever. Each clich√© in the dialog used has no effect. These people do not seem to like horror movies or how to make them or any other movie. There is no language for adults, a little short nudity, and no blood except fake blood stained on any open wound, etc. It would have been qualified as PG in the early eighties and PG-13 at present. I'm not sure how he got an R rating or if he really did. I saw the American international release entitled Hospital of Terror. I've seen 100 horror movies in the last 12 months and this is probably the worst movie I've seen in my life. Here is an example of how bad it is: there is a scene in which something green comes through the door. I'm not sure what it's supposed to be, but what's on the screen is some kids' green crayon scribbles {I'm not exaggerating} superimposed on the movie, semi-moving inside the door, then it's supposed to be Do something for Nurse Sherri to possess her, I suppose. I could not believe that they had the lack of pride to show this shame.
