I have not read "A Time to Kill" by John Grisham, and maybe that would have helped to understand the film better. But maybe not. I heard that this is Grisham's most faithful adaptation so far, and if that is true, I can see why so many editors rejected the novel when Grisham presented it as his first work. <br /> <br /> "A Time to Kill" is one of those movies that is seriously confused and that wants to do too many things at once. It wants to be a thriller of suspense that pleases the crowd and, at the same time, a film dedicated to explore certain social and moral issues. Let's face it, those two types of movies do not go together in Hollywood, so "Dead Man Walking" had to be done independently. <br /> <br /> The story involves a young lawyer named Jake (Matthew McConaughy). He defended a black man named Carl (Samuel L. Jackson) of murdering two thieves who brutally raped his little daughter. The day before the trial of the rapists, Carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when they raped them in the building, he attacked them and shot them both. To help with the defense, Jack accepts the help of a former law student (Sandra Bullock), who proves that his role in this film was totally unnecessary, and included it only for marketing purposes. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, one of the rapist's brothers (Kiefer Sutherland) became angry that a black man killed his brother and decided to act as revenge. All this leads to a shooting in the court, a kidnapping, a brutal beating and a racial revolt. I admit that all this caught my attention throughout the film, in addition to the scenes in the audience room. What I later objected to was the handling of the film's ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot. <br /> <br /> The main question that the film constantly asks, again and again, is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury. Of course they can, but that does not mean that the man must be acquitted so that the trial is fair. This movie, however, does not seem to think so. In addition to that, there are several holes in the plot used for conveniences. For example, there is an unknown character named Mickey Mouse, who is a member of the Klan and, for unknown reasons, is helping members of the defense team escape the grave dangers of the other Klan members. Once Bullock is kidnapped by Sutherland and company, and abandoned in the desert, this unknown person comes and saves her, and we NEVER find out who she is and why she is helping the people she should be terrorizing. /> <br /> And speaking of the reign of terror of the character of Sutherland, it is surprising how ingenious it is the police and the character of Bullock to stop him throughout the film. There is a scene in which Sutherland becomes a sniper in a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake when he leaves, shooting one of the guards in his place. Now you would think, since there are dozens of cops around, it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper. There is no such luck. From what we could see, no one seemed to care if a sniper was on the loose. Even after Bullock was rescued by Mickey Mouse, she never mentioned who her kidnapper was, she was not even questioned. Why was this? Simple. The character of Sutherland was necessary throughout the film to add continuous suspense, although logically, it should have come out of the picture. <br /> <br /> Besides the character of Bullock, there is another ungrateful character. He is Jake's assistant played by Oliver Platt. It seems that there is a reason for his character to be in the film: to provide a series of phrases for the audience. In my opinion, the phrases of a line show a great weakness in the "serious" movies when they are used. It shows that the filmmakers are not sure that the story and the dialogue alone are enough to keep the attention of the audience and, therefore, use them to make the audience laugh to assure everyone that they are watching an entertaining movie . But enough of many minor problems of the movie. What about the message of the movie here? It is clear that Carl is effectively guilty of murder. We saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter. The lawyers argue that it was temporary madness, etc. what caused him to kill. In desperation, Jake asks the jury to close his eyes while reporting the rape in detail as part of his final argument. After describing everything that happened, add in a final line ... "The girl is white." Then we see jurors with tears in their eyes. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, a girl comes out screaming "It's free! It's free!". Wait a minute! Do the jurors base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts? More than anything, why was there no scene that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions disappeared? I'll tell you why. They could not show the deliberation because NO JURY could absolve a man of such a crime, no matter how much the defense's arguments touched their hearts. Which is the message? That someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for an earlier crime committed against him? <br /> <br /> This movie should have had the courage to say that murder is NOT OK in this situation, because in reality, there would be no acquittal. But because the dollars were at stake, the filmmakers were more concerned with avoiding the feelings of the audience than with presenting a responsible message. If people start killing as a form of revenge, the creators of this film should be held responsible. What a socially irresponsible movie this is!
