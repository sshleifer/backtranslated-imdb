Needful Things was one of my favorite Stephen King books. But this movie is one of the worst books for film adaptations that I've seen that changed so many things that made me sick. Even the concept of the book is deception, things are not always what seem like a reminder throughout the book and did not show up in the movie. Although it was nice as many Stephen King movies are, but like many Stephen King movies, it did not follow the book and became a piece of Hollywood trash. 2/10
