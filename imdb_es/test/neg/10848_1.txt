I did not buy this film as comedy as I did, I did not find it a bit funny, but it's so amazing. I gave it to a friend for Christmas, which was very funny (for my part) I recently heard that he saw it and he told me that to ** ehole I am! <br /> <br /> There's nothing more frustrating than watching a more lighted, more dramatic, ill-marked scene in which the camera sat on a tripod and does not move ... the work of the film is truly pathetic , and I can only say NO to see this movie !!!! !!!!!!!
