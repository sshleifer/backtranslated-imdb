A young man, who never knew his biological parents, receives an old farm in an isolated section of West Virginia after the death of his natural father. Visit his property with a cross-section of potential victims, including the comedic black relief man and a fashionable lesbian couple. (Hmm, will there be a thin dip? Imagine.) Unfortunately, the party ends when the spirits of the vagabonds killed by their great-grandfather and used as scarecrows return for revenge. This movie starts well. An ingenious montage of photographs from the depression era and fake newspapers in front of an FDR speech (I think this is his first appearance in a murderous scarecrow film) sets the mood. I developed some hopes for the film, which were partially realized. The story was quite useful. The stage was bucolic enough. The photograph was mainly focused. The performance, although not a big change, was slightly higher than the average for horror films in this budget range. The film could have worked within the narrow demands of the genre if the scarecrows were scary. But they were not, they seemed cheap. They were not scared at all. The better the monster is, the better the movie is. These scarecrows would not frighten Dorothy, let alone Toto.
