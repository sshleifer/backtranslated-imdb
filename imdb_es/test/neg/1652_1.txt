Oh, how I laughed ... this has it all ... an Asian / white family, an Asian disabled child ... everything a healthy person needs to see in the eyes of the BBC. <br /> <br /> What a total tribe: this was a total insult to my eyes that saw this garbage in an episode and A UNIQUE EPISODE. <br /> <br /> When you think of something of the quality that the BBC has published over the years (Fawlty Torres, for example) and then it comes rolling ... It's a disgusting shame. <br /> <br /> Everything is oriented to political correctness and lacks any humor. <br /> <br /> This comes directly from the bowels of hell: but what would you expect from the ultra-left BPC? I mean the BBC.
