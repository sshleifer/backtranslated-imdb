This is so bad that it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party I'm going to. It is clear from the beginning that Steve Gutenburg was taking this role seriously ... the other principles were walking in their lines. I think they realized how much it stunk from the beginning and they were checking the movements of their paychecks. Sean Bean "acted" as usual, but he avoided sharing the space on the screen with any of the principles until the final scene where he was like an actor walking on a high school stage, this is how the contrast. Some actors do not look well scruffy. Some actors should not do a great job on the one hand. Those two statements apply to the "Police Academy" of Steve. His disheveled look translates into a vague and destitute and his upward bulge makes him look like a lumpy, unengaged potato. Combine that with one of the worst scripted dialogues in Hollywood history and you have a BAD movie. I can only guess that all the principles really needed the money for the remodeling or something or their agents signed them before the script was written by the monkeys who should write it. I would love to know the background story of this disaster.
