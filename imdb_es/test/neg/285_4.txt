Each James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Just like every Indiana Jones movie has its own set of rules. And the fact that the writers do not break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. With a completely unnecessary twist of the plot, the integrity of both of Ocean's films plummets somewhere between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon. <br /> <br /> Imagine what would happen, as you swing on the rope bridge outside the Temple of Doom, if Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry, because throughout the first two films, secretly, he had superpowers and can take them to safety. <br /> <br /> Entertain? Sure, for a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done it because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. More importantly, it would have angered the audience. They had already sat on the edge of their seats throughout 3 hours of Indiana Jones movies and expected that Indiana would take them from that bridge in a credible way. If he were to fly? People would have left the theaters in the same way that people did during the 12th of Ocean. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> 1. Julia Roberts' character, Tess, infiltrates a museum disguising herself as ... Julia Roberts? A smart turn? Breaking the fourth wall three hours after they introduced us to these characters? Is this the naked gun 33 and 1/3? It's a textbook example of how a cheap laugh can ruin a full movie. But wait ... in case you still have not left ... <br /> <br /> 2. The suspense accumulates throughout the last hour of the movie. How will they achieve theft? Only 10 ... 8 ... 5 ... 2 DAYS LEFT! And then, in the last 12 minutes of the movie, the ONLY entertaining part of this movie, we see that the robbery was made days before and delayed Matt Damon all 30 seconds. The last 10 days? A complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> RETURN TO INDIANA JONES ON THE BRIDGE OF THE ROPE ... "Just relax, Willie! I stole the REAL stones about a month ago! Also, I convinced them you were Kate Capshaw!" <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, reduce your losses and go see the Polar Express. I do not want to ruin the end for you, but there really is a Santa Claus. The most important thing is that you will not feel cheated when leaving the theater.
