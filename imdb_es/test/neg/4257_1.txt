Good photography, good acting, good direction ... can not justify a story that is not and can not be acceptable to any society. Amitabh has often used the media to make this garbage sell by saying that if such an incident occurs, then what? I would like to ask you if such a thing happens with your own child or your grandchild (for example, girl), what will you do? I think all parents will have to take special care before interacting with any 60-year-old neighbor if you have one -jia- with you. Such films should be banned and discouraged, otherwise they would inspire more cases of Nithari. Such acts are evil and the villains in the movies are punished ... that should be the moral of the story and not glorify them or them.
