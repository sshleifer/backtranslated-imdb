You would probably get something like this. I am translating movies to earn a living and this is the first film in my 5 years work experience that I found offensive to my intelligence. Of course, there are stupid Hollywood movies about drunken teenagers on spring break, but those movies do not even claim to be serious works of art. But when someone strives to achieve greatness and poetry, but presents a confusing (and often ridiculous) story, a lot of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogues ... Then you get the worst kind of movie that another critic defined with great precision as "pretentious". shit. "For those who find this film intelligent or even masterful, I can only say: it is your intelligence and your imagination that you obviously used to try to give a sense to this unfortunate attempt (it is in our human nature to try to make sense of things ) <br /> <br /> One more thing: I can tolerate political inaccuracy very well, I am in favor of artistic freedom and the suspension of disbelief, but the female Slavic character was too much, I wish someone would tell the director who is a bit ridiculous (even in an unrealistic art film) to portray a Slavic woman as a half-jointed disheveled creature connected to the forces of nature, probably due to the fact that he had spent his entire childhood staring at the stars and milking cows on a three-legged stool.
