I'm not one of those people who complains every time a movie based on an old television show comes out. Rather, I usually run out and see it (if I had seen the program) and try to get nostalgic. But if someone wants to exhaust films based on old programs, this is Exhibit A (so you can actually say something other than "McHale's Navy"). "Mod Squad" is sad, exhausting and lethargic. At least the original series was full of anguish long before anyone knew that teenagers could be so sad, so it is innovative. This is tedious. Claire Danes is nice to see, but she does nothing but change her mood and sneak out spying on the bad guys. The degree of performance of Giovanni Ribisi in this film is that Droopy the Dog looks for one hour and forty-five minutes. And it seems that Omar Epps wants to escape from the stage, but the chlostraphobia of the script has caught him. Sure, the production is nice, with the opening action sequence of the nightclub "rave", which now seems to be mandatory and shootouts in abundance. Oh, and the children scream and get angry with each other and their superiors too. It's something like deciding to use Scooby Doo Mystery Machine to go on a family vacation to Hollywood with your teenagers that you and your spouse know need intensive treatment and prescription medications. I really wanted to like this movie, and there were promising moments, but the next scene would take his life. You can hit another Spelling remake, "Charlie's Angels", all you want, but at least that movie knew she wanted to have fun with herself. "The Mod Squad" makes you wonder where the inspiration for the original series was.
