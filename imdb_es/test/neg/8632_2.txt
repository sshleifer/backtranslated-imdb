If I had to choose the most depressing movie, try to have suspense. I have seen that it would be this. I know how good the original is supposed to be, it's better that it be better than this one. The movie is so dark and depressing, but it's not interesting to see it either. I have seen depressing "thriller" movies that were saved due to the suspense to counteract and silence the dark quality. Disappearing did not have that, this was so disturbing to watch, and there was nothing positive about making this a classic type movie. I think another IMDb poster did well to say that this genre has just seen the thrillers done in a very superior way. I completely agree. I would recommend skipping this one. Maybe one day I will see the original, but I doubt it. I give this a 2 out of 10.
