This is a really horrible movie. Lou Diamond Phillips simply calls this in. The use of miniature train models is ridiculous. The plot seems to develop in the race (there is an alien on board, oh, and an eco-terrorist is also on board, oh, and the driver is dead and the train is out of control, oh, and the train is going. run on another train an hour ahead, oh, and that train has nuclear waste ...). Is seriously! The alien monsters are not scary (although there are many of them), and the performance is abysmal. Take a look at the guy who plays the "next president": do you really think he could be president? For the love of God, he has spent his entire acting career playing the bad guys!
