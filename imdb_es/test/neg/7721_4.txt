"House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" (2005) is the sequel, although you do not really need to see the first "House of the Dead" to get this movie. That said, the production value is definitely here, with excellent zombie effects and it's been edited quite well, with a very effective sound design. However, having said that, that is all that is good here. <br /> <br /> The story and the script are horrible. . . There are blatant plot holes everywhere. It's also funny that the soldiers do not care if they stain their faces with blood (unlike the 28 days after, where the blood in any part of the body will infect you) It is also realistic how there is little order with the soldiers here, to Unlike the usual military discipline of the United States. UU <br /> <br /> To 4 out of 10.
