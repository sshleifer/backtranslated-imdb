The other night I saw this movie on video and I found myself asleep during this uninspired snoozefest. First, one of my biggest hobbies is when movies like this are characterized as horror movies. It's a THRILLER! Do it well! It has no monsters or anything supernatural. It's just a movie about a twisted serial killer (actually, there's a very small body count, so it's more a movie of serial torturers and did a good job of torturing me). The basic premise of a man who attracts teenagers to his house. The horrors through online chat rooms could have been a great movie, but we only see him attract a couple of teenage girls over the Internet at the beginning of the movie. One of these girls turns out to be the daughter of a local detective and gets emotionally involved in the case. The film quickly shifts from a potentially intelligent sado-masochistic thriller to a boring cat-and-mouse game between the incredibly bored detective and the psychopath Captain Howdy / Carleton Hendricks, appropriately played by Twisted Sister writer / producer / leader, Dee Snider. Occasional attempts to make meaningful poetic statements about the positive effects of pain and the like of Snider are ridiculous. If you are trying to get people to subscribe to these opinions through this movie, it fails miserably and (unintentionally) drives them away. The direction of John Pieplow (whose only previous management effort was Jurassic Women, who will let the title speak for itself) was not inspired and there was an error in the editing that resulted in the film being separated with some completely unrelated scenes to the plot, unless the script is at fault (which is quite possible). This movie was a totally unsuccessful attempt of a thriller that tried to pass like a horror movie that was only an achievement that made me writhe when I saw some graphic body piercings. If you see it in your video store, do not waste your money, but if you need to laugh one night and Strangeland is on the wire, you can also look. 3 out of 10
