I caught 2:37 at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles. It is a very well filmed first film (although the DV format begins to show in external scenes), and I am sure that it has good intentions to show us the "dark side" of the secondary school; In other words, all sides of the high school. But the filmmaker does not have the talent to write or direct to the promise of the premise. There are several characters, but none of them is more than what the plot requires them to be. There is no depth in these cartoons beyond the machinations of "I am a teenager with problems X, I have the problem of Y". The perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally problematic. <br /> <br /> Let's start with men. You have the bad boy who is gay, the athlete who is also gay, the boy who rapes his sister and Mr. Peepants. As the stereotype demands, all gay men must be sexually dissatisfied and violent with women and with themselves. Naturally (or unnaturally, as is assumed in the stereotype), the two homosexual male characters hit the women, Peepants and themselves. It would be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned over their heads, or if the characters somehow transcended them. However, none took place, and that is all there is in the stories of these characters. <br /> <br /> Next, the ladies. A young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife, another is the shaved pregnant with the brother who rapes, and there is the girl who commits suicide (I'll see it later). Again, I do not believe that there is a requirement of political correctness for filmmakers (I would be left without work if that were the case), but I do believe that it is justified only if there is something else in that character or story. If that archetype were to be used to reveal something about a character other than "I am a teenager and life sucks," I would be happy like a clam. But nothing new is revealed! Nothing is subverted, neither changed nor sublimated. <br /> <br /> Finally, the girl who kills herself. This is a blunt and HIGHLY neglected story. Are we supposed to sit for 5 minutes of a girl who violently commits suicide whom we've seen for about 30 seconds in the whole movie? We have followed all these other stories for an hour and a half, and now we are invited to torture ourselves for a character that is not part of the story? It is cheap, exploitative and careless. Despite the millions of indie fucking movies that came before this, you have to WIN something like that. You can not just buy it on credit. Then, this suicide happens, we get summaries of the characters that are not reduced, and the movie ends. I've learned? I already knew that high school stunk, I've been there, done that. I already knew that people have stereotyped views of gay men and young women. I already knew that children with disabilities are mocked. <br /> <br /> What else is there, then? Smoke, mirrors, and very nice views of the leaves. Oh, and the most unpleasant deus ex machina I've seen in a long time.
