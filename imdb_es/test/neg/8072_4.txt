Cuore Sacro combines brilliant film effects with a story that leaves a lot to be desired. With a screenplay that the screen writers of "Touched by an Angel" could have gone through so powerless, Ozpetek still keeps us interested at times. In fact, I wanted to focus on the positive aspects, but the last act seemed so disconcertingly strange to me that I think the couple who jumped to death from the beginning could have been the lucky one. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the heart (pun) a story built on a grand finale spin style. This kind of tenuous base can result in tremendous success such as Una Pura Formalità de Tornatore or hideous garbage like the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Cuore Sacro falls a little closer to the latter. The cinematography in general seemed superior to the average. The follow-up shots of Irene diligently fulfilling her daily turns at the pool were very impressive, as was the atmosphere evoked by the interior of her mother's house. For me, the grotesque parody of Michelangelo's Pieta when Giancarlo comes from the rain and Irene poses with him was a bit exaggerated. A big problem that I made an exception to in this movie was Ozpetek's method of simply putting the camera directly on the face of its protagonist and recording the emotions that occur. This worked great in Windows, but when it is used here it seems that Bubolova is not Mezzogiorno. In fact, in addition to the ridiculous story, the main problem with this movie is the performance of its main character. It made the scene of the final breakdown even more disproportionately bad. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ozpetek continues his crusade against our societies driven by companies urging us to be more spiritual (not necessarily religious) and more altruistic. And although I am certainly a person who sympathizes with this point of view, I felt as if the audience were hit in the head with a blunt object. Could the characters have already been two-dimensional? I tended to find this film very unnerving and soulless. Was the "evil" aunt Eleonora more than just a caricature? It also applies to people on the "right" side, such as the "good" Aunt Maria Clara and the elderly porter Aurelio. And in case we have not been able to understand Ozpetek's point, he decided to dress his opposing forces with his own liveries. <br /> <br /> This brings me to an interesting point about the color director's use. Dress the opening couple who flees briefly in black, as well as Irene (when we meet her for the first time and after her conversion of life), the evil Aunt Eleonora and, of course, the good but confused Father Carras. Black is a color that suggests a definite course, the mind of the wearer is firm and emotionless. It is the color of choice for that indispensable element of modern armor, the business suit. It is also the color of mourning, like the funeral gala of the suicidal duo. Finally, black is the color of piety, like the simple clothes of priests and nuns that Irene emulates in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> The other main color, and a very appropriate option for a film about the sacred heart, is red. It is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component. The character that wears red is bold, emotional, receptive to new ideas and indulgent. Red is a risky color in modern times; It challenges our perceptions of the user and, at the same time, makes him vulnerable. However, red has a huge weight of history and mysticism, since the first members of Cro-Magnon man buried their dead in red ocher and, in fact, the first man named in the Torah, Adam, is named after the Hebrew word for red. Red also has an anachronistic flavor, looking back to the past where red (and by association a less selfish attitude toward life) was more accepted. So when we find the room full of red (the walls with mysterious friezes covered with a menorah with a red accent and a red painting of a rotating dervish!) From Irene's mother, the "good" characters Maria Clara and Aurelio they wear bright red suits, and finally, in the painting of Irene's mother in a formal red dress, we can see where Ozpetek's sympathies are. <br /> <br /> One or two words about the soundtrack, I found that the original musical themes were perfectly adapted to the story. The almost baroque theme that meant that Irene was great for her monotony and general malaise (the best absolute use of a constantly repeated Baroque theme like this should be in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, with the masterful repetitions of an 8-bar sarabande attributed to handel). An absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera aria that we heard while the power flickers while Irene is chasing Benny around the house. It is from the famous aria "Ebben? ... Ne andrò lontano" from the opera of Catalani "La Wally". The aria is sung by the main soprano who leaves home forever. As Irene's mother was a dramatic soprano, we can assume that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a moving farewell to her daughter, since in the film Irene is destined not to see Benny alive again. I only have one minor question from the soundtrack, why include the famous tango Yo Soy Maria? I love the song and I could personally listen to it all the time, but it really did not fit here.
