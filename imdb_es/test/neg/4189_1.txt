This is by far the worst "horror" movie, no, make it a movie, I've seen it. Shame on Block Buster for carrying even this type of garbage. I never ask for a refund for any movie, but I think this will be the first time. <br /> <br /> The movie is so bad that I had to stop after only 15 minutes of watching it. <br /> <br /> I had more fun watching any of the blurry YouTube movies than watching this piece fall. <br /> <br /> The marketing friend of this movie must have some kind of silver tongue to move this thing to an establishment like Box Office Success.
