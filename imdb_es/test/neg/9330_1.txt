How does a movie become a biblical epic? Simply by quoting a couple of Scriptures and using some names of the Bible for their characters? The only biblical thing about this epic were the names of the characters. Oh, I almost forgot the 3 kingdoms, Israel, Egypt and Sheba were also used. Where did King Vidor get the rest of his story? Surely it was not from the Bible. It was complete and complete nonsense. If you want to read about Solomon's reign as King in Israel, then read 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chronicles 1-9. He will even meet Adonijah in 1 Kings 1 and 2. The Queen of Sheba, (who does not show up until King Solomon has been king for about 20 years, which, by the way, is long after Adonijah and Joab had has died) can be found in 1 Kings 10 and 2 Chronicles 9. One of the first things that Solomon does is affinity with Pharaoh by taking his daughter. <br /> <br /> Yes, King Solomon became involved with the worship of false gods and this is the reason why the Kingdom was divided after his death, and not the Temple was destroyed by lightning. Furthermore, I believe that Solomon was too busy marrying and giving temples to the false gods of his 700 wives and attending to his 300 concubines to fight against Egypt, let alone a dead brother. <br /> <br /> As I said this movie was a complete nonsense. If you are not going to use the history of the Bible, call it something else. This could have been called Romeo & Juliet or Sid & Nancy. <br /> <br />
