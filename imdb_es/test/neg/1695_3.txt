Maybe this captivated them in the 50s, but this is one of those movies that do not age well. It has the vibe of the favorite, serious and oppressed working man of a live TV broadcast of Rod Serling's second-rate TV "Playhouse". The "plot" is in the book, the problematic background of the character of Cassevetes seems stuck, and the love interest is unconvincing and unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Sidney Portier gives a good performance, but the man is safe. An annoying and arrogant mucus. If I had to work with this guy in a warehouse, I'd probably want to hit him with a hook too. Jack Warden is good, because as usual, he plays Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> Like 90% of the films rated in IMDb (whether classic, mediocre or crapola) in some way, it is rated with 7 points. -some-stars In no way is he worthy of that.
