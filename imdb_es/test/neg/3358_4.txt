Blaxpoitation action / melodrama below average, in which the lovely Ms. Grier plays a private eye that helps her father (Rudy Challenger) and his partner (Austin Stoker, from the original "Assault on Precinct 13"), whose business of loans is being threatened. <br /> <br /> I'll be frank: I agree with the few comments from other users for this movie. "Sheba, Baby" has an unsatisfactory script, a direction that is not particularly distinguishable, action scenes that are moderately entertaining at best, and one of Mrs. Grier's most indescribable characters (although there is a role of important support for D'Urville Martin, also a household name in blaxpoitation). I get the feeling that this routine movie may have been armed quickly simply to capitalize on its enormous popularity. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it was great to see Stoker again, although Mrs. Grier does not have as much experience. a role, or a dialogue, as he has done in other films, although he is doing what he does best, and is playing a brazen and sexy sister on a mission of revenge. <br /> <br /> Soul without stopping / The funk soundtrack is nice, at least. <br /> <br /> It is recommended above all to those who want to see everything in Pam Grier's movie repertoire. <br /> <br /> 4/10
