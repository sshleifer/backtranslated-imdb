This 'documentary' does not shed any light on what it would be like to be behind the scenes during the Hard Knock Life tour. Okay, I was not there, but watching this movie did not make me feel like it was. And for a movie like this, that's not exactly a compliment. All the time I saw it, all I could think was: "What are you leaving out?" When it's over, the only rapper you feel you have any idea about is DMX, and that's mainly because he only talks about his dogs. A waste of time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
