I just watched this movie on TNT and let me tell you that this movie was downright cheesy and cheery. But after a certain moment, I started to laugh and tell you the truth, you should classify this movie as comedy instead of action / adventure. The absolutely most hilarious scene occurs when Delon and Kennedy make a 360 loop to avoid the French missiles that Wagner ordered to destroy the Concorde. Our intrepid leader, Kennedy, decides to shoot flares out the window to stop the heat in search of missiles ????? Mute but fun, although the kicker comes here, after a shot, the flare gun works badly and Kennedy tries to repair it in the cabin and well ... if you want to know what happens, get acquainted with this movie. The silly parts of this film include the total lack of the plot: yes, we have some action for 25 minutes that land in Paris and go ONE HOUR with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. Now, let's change the saboteur for ten minutes, then a lost remainder of the film and a plane that is visually breaking and the DON PASSENGERS "DO NOT SEE IT TRUTH? --- final qualification for this movement --- (1/10 ) of 4 stars if it was action 2 of 4 stars if it were a comedy
