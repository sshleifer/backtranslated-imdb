and nothing more. <br /> <br /> One of my friends bought the Problem Child Tantrum Pack (it contains the first two "Problem Child" on a disc), and we decided to watch the sequel because it was "more fun". <br /> <br /> There were many funny moments in the movie (the vomit scene, that's all I need to say.), Nippy the dog after eating CHOW DOWN and many others. The movie is nothing more than toilet humor, but it's hilarious. However, aside from the fun moments, this movie has little to offer. <br /> <br /> John Ritter bothers me a lot because I think he's reading a book. Man can not act in this case, I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> Although I can not say if I would find the funny movie now ... (we were impressed when we saw it), it's a perfect film for a rainy day ... but nothing more. Do not expect Oscar material in this case, guys.
