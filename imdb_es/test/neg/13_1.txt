An obvious vanity for Julie in her first film with Blake. Let's see. Where do we start? She is a traitor during a world war; she redeems that by falling in love; his friends (who are probably patriotic because they are German citizens) are expendable and must die; and she ends up as a heroine. IN AGREEMENT. The scenes with the drunken pilot and the jesters who work for French intelligence can not even be described, and we will not even mention the romantic scenes of Rock with a woman. (By the way, when you visit a museum, look at it, I see it again on video and it's priceless). Is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie? I do not know and neither do you.
