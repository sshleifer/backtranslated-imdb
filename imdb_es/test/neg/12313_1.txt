Well, I guess I know the answer to that question. For the money! We've been so bombarded with advertising and Cat In The Hat merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good in this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a try. Well, I should have gone with my instincts. It was a complete piece of hollywood trash. Once again, prove that the average person can be programmed to believe that everything they say is good should be good. Apart from the insulting fact that the movie only lasts about 80 minutes, it obviously started with a script eaten by the moth. It is full of failed attempts at meaningless humor, and terrible landscapes in pastel colors. Jump across the universe without destination or direction. This is complicated with ............................ yes, I'll say it, BAD ACTION! I could not help feeling that I was watching "Coffee Talk" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the cat destined to be a middle-aged Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were not awarded either, but Myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he is ready to make another Austin Powers movie. F-, without stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save your money!
