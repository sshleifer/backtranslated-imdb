Although normally my preference is not for romantic dramas, watching this movie left me a bit short. <br /> <br /> I had a promise, the characters and relationships could have been explored much more deeply than they, however, the story did not seem to understand the direction I wanted to take. <br /> <br /> The comparisons and parallels within the story, especially the three generations of women in the family, had great potential, but somehow they did not fully extend. It could have made the movie much easier to relate and attach, which is the goal of any film about lost love and life recovered. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, I think the film suffered a lack of direction in the writing, although Harry Connick Jnr and Sandra Bullock tried desperately to give a little life to the schemes of characters that would otherwise be blueprints. <br /> <br /> It's not that this is a bad movie, some parts let you understand the reasons for several developments of the plot, it's just that this movie is poorly made, and a little flat in general.
