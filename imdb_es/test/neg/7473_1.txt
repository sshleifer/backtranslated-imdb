I saw this on a drive-in when I was 9 years old. The only thing I remember are some scenes (the scenes in which the main character, Elle, is being chased by a guy with a mask) and scared of spitting. Seeing it now, my opinions have changed. It's a pathetic "horror" movie about an ophanage directed by Gloria Grahame (sad) and about a young and untalented Elle who is sent there after her mother, the tramp, was beaten to death with a hammer ( it is shown graphically). The film features teenagers (actually 20-year-old actors) who are beaten, tortured, killed, starved, attacked with meat knives, raped, etc. The brutal murder with a hammer is the initial scene and then it gets worse. There's nothing to recommend about this shit. The plot is stupid, all the dialogue is bad and the acting ... the less said, the better. How did this patient manage with a GP rating (now PG)? I would get an R now. Worthless. One last thing ... a truly repulsive end of turn suggests incest!
