This is just a long announcement of the movie "The tunnel of death". Although it is an interesting history of the sanatorium of Waverly Hills, the whole theory of the ghost depends on its interpretation. More "Ghostly Orbs", which can be duplicated with dust in front of a camera with flash, and the "Ectoplasmic Fog" is simply the smoke of a cigarette that was turned on with the flash of the camera. I could not see any "shadow people" until they drew an outline around the blurry distortion of the image. No scientific explanations were suggested for the phenomena, only paranormal. Maybe these are just events that one would have to see to believe, so be sure to make plans to visit Sanatorium on your next vacation in Louisville, Kentucky.
