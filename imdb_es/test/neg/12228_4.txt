It was only a matter of time before a parody of sports films was made! And there are many movies to be seen that are fun. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that it is still movie recognition. The director and the writers of "The Comebacks" somehow forget to be creative. Although I must admit that I laughed at certain scenes, "The Comebacks" could have been much more fun. The actors forget to give their lines seriously and have a serious face throughout the film. A parody demands this and that is the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this. Due to the failure of the cast to do so, the jokes never reached their mark. Some scenes take an eternity and usually in simulations that do not have to be a problem. Take "Naked Gun" for example. There is always something that happens on the screen. In "The Comebacks" they did not even bother to let things happen in the background. Only a couple of factors make it worthwhile to watch this movie! It is still fun to see the movies that are fun. And Jermaine Williams as Ipod. His parody on Cuba Gooding Jr. as Radio was very funny! He seemed to be the only one in the cast to get an idea of ​​what a parody is. Not bad at all!
