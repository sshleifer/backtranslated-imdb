There must be a lot of background information that was left out of the movie. In fact, in the movie, the girl, Lizzy, did not even seem depressed. She looked like a girl who got out of control when she finally got to college, mainly because of drugs and alcohol. That seemed to be his problem, not a mental illness. Of course, she had emotional problems because her father left and she barely saw him as a child, and her mother seemed a bit out there. But, the way he treated Noah and Ruby was bad and I do not think depression caused it. She was very necessary, which took Rafe, but it was like that because of her father. <br /> <br /> But, I think the main reason why this film never made a premiere in the theater is that it does not happen enough with the plot and the story is not well written. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: To be honest, I would only recommend this if you are interested in seeing Ricci's first nude scene. Otherwise, it's not very interesting.
