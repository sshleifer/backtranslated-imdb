heavens, this was immensely boring. The protagonist (Christian Schoyen) has to be the worst actor I've seen. And another thing, if the character of the movie moved to the United States when he was ten or something and had been living here for more than 20 years, he would speak much better English than here. or to say it in my own language "Skikkelig gebrokkent". But it's great to see the Norwegian dudes in a movie made in Hollywood. It was simply a shame that they were hacks without talent. The plot itself is below mediocre. I suspect that Christian Schoyen made this movie just to live the dream, as he clearly does in the movie by fucking one beautiful babe after another.
