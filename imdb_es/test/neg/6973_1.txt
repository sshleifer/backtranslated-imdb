Phew! What can be said about this strange and stupid mockery-mentoring about Ed Wood's fantasies? Well, a word that comes to mind is incoherent! The wood uses rough slabs of innocuous and incidental filing material, and then builds a "story" around it, and what a story! Wood himself plays Glen, a regular Joe who enjoys enjoying his girlfriend's underwear and sweaters. I think that what Wood wanted was a request of tolerance for all the Glens of this world to show that Glen is like all of us, only in Angora. Ummm ... ok But then, we have this very strange montage of some horny demon, a girl in captivity, some malicious and pointing people, some bigger footage and finally a gaunt Bela Lugusi, playing some kind of Puppetmaster invalid and twisted. Lugosi is a howl, spitting out such garbage as "Beeevaaare ... the beeeg greeeen dragon that sees your door: Eeeets leeetle boys, puppydog tails, and beeeeeg snails!" Um, okay, Bela ...: = 8 / There's a strange and twisted kind of Wood's logic here. After all, it reminds us that "7 out of 10 men wear hats and 7 out of 10 men are bald." Hmmm, it must be that weird / transvestite / habidashery cowspiracy-thang !! Glen or Glenda star in a plethora (whatever it is ...) of Wood Schlock's trusted actors, including Lyle Talbot, Delores Fuller and Timothy Farrell, and Wood manages to convince each of the unfortunate and untalented non-talented of each one. . Everyone already knows the sad story of Bela: by the time Wood used it for this flic, he was probably looking for another solution and needed the moolah, but even for him this is a depth hitherto unreached. One of MooCow's favorite wood mooments comes with the buffalo scene of footage loading, it's incredibly insane! The MooCow says "Puuuull de schtriiiiings", and they give you helmets in a copy of Glen or Glenda. You will not believe it! : ??
