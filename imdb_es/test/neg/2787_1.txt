Some teenagers go to an old abandoned farm that a dead grandfather had left to one of them, not knowing that there had been several murders there decades before because his grandfather had made a pact with the devil for a good harvest. Have you thought of something better to sell your soul? The grandson of man and his friends are set to be the next sacrifice, for reasons that are never explained. The stereotyped teenage son and his girlfriend, the black man with a white girlfriend and the two lesbians have to fight against three murderous scarecrows, but do not be fooled like me, this is not as funny as it seems. It's mostly just a bunch of chats about kicking balls, smoking drugs and the main actor complaining about not having met his parents. The work of the camera is atrocious and unstable, perhaps done in a hand-held camcorder in some scenes, which may be a good thing, since the scarecrows seem to have left the birthday party of some children, and apparently could only hire two people to play the three scarecrows Some of the best movies I've seen have been these low budget, independent horror movies, but this is just pathetic. The cast and crew seem to have been made up of a group of people who knew each other, had never acted before and had no intention of acting again, and had a few thousand dollars (I can not believe that this movie costs $ 130,000 to make) and a weekend of free time on their hands, even the scene of lesbian thin immersion is scarce. <br /> <br /> I think it's also fun, that as of this writing, there is a sequel to this movie that not one has even bothered to add to IMDb. <br /> <br /> * of ****, and I only rate it so high only because of the scarce immersion scene, no matter how scarce it is.
