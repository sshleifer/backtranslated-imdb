I do not know about you, but I go to horror movies to scare me and this was all but scary, the movie had several chances to be really scary and failed miserably EVERY TIME! Several of these supposed moments of suspense were persecuted by some of the worst cg you'll see this year, maybe a decade! I mean, when I say that CG looks like daytime television, I'm giving a bad name to daytime television, I've seen better things on the science fiction channel. For what I really feel sorry for the actors, (they have their names attached to this movie) they did a good job, I was interested in most of the characters and I felt that their performances were pretty good, but that was not enough to get this movie from the ditch. What is really fun is the reuse of some of the games, if you have seen "exorcist: the beginning" it will be easy to detect the reuse of some of the buildings. However, what I thought was the worst part of this film, even over CG's problems was the main demon, it just was not scary in any way, its form, the way it spoke, was extremely bland. In general, this movie was a horrible experience and I would have left the theater if it were not for my wife who wanted to see the end.
