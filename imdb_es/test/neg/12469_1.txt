Basic structure of a story: Beginning, Middle, End. <br /> <br /> Sometimes we play with this structure and we get Memento or Irreversible and the story is played backwards. Sometimes it is simply not linear, to the pulp Fiction. In any case, they all have a beginning, middle and end. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I've seen that does not have an ending. <br /> <br /> Principle: the best friend of the girls is expelled. <br /> <br /> Intermediate: The girl needs to face her best friend. <br /> <br /> End: It does not exist. <br /> <br /> It's not that having an ending would have been saved this movie, but at least it would have been complete. <br /> <br /> It is an exercise in apathy; We got a mix of party characters, and they all turn out to be fake. Imitation boring, vain, vapid and pale people. <br /> <br /> And here is the action within this movie: NOTHING HAPPENS. Nothing happens at all. Mischa Barton tries to speak with a soft English accent, Dominique Swain complains a lot and Brad Renfro receives a blowjob from an old man. End of the movie. <br /> <br /> When the credits ended, I had the horrible feeling that many prisoners must feel: the periods of time, those precious minutes of our lives, have been lost. <br /> <br /> The only passable point (and that ONLY is very emphatic) is Brad Renfro. He acts well. Lacey Chabert usually likes me, but there's no luck here. Due to good work in other films, I will forgive Mischa Barton for this farce, but I hope that all the cast members have been slapped for their participation. <br /> <br /> Please, I beg you. Avoid. Do not fool yourself by thinking "I'm going to make up my mind". My sister told me never to see this, and I ignored her, wanting to make a decision. That was a bad decision. <br /> <br /> I've never hated a movie. There are many that I do not like, but I have never hated a movie. Until I saw this.
