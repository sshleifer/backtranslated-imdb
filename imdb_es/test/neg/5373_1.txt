For a while I got hooked on programs like Ghost Hunters and Destination Truth and those things, although I thought they were full of garbage, I found them interesting and entertaining, and that's why we watch entertainment television. It's fun to turn off your brain and believe that every shadow captured by the camera is not just a shadow, but the tormented spirit of a crazed inmate or something, as long as you can return to the real world later. <br /> <br /> That said, enjoying the paranormal state requires more than just turning off your brain, requires you to consume lead in large doses on a regular basis during your childhood, then suffer a repetitive head trauma and then apply paint with a peel on your teenagers Then you have to drug / get drunk and look. <br /> <br /> The paranormal state is beyond pseudoscience (which I can enjoy with some degree of critical thinking) that you will find in Ghost Hunters (which I still find to be a reasonably interesting and entertaining program), it is pseudo. .. all. <br /> <br /> The program follows the adventures of a group of students from Penn State University (not to be confused with the University of Pennsylvania) led by Ryan Buell when they risk exorcising demons and spirits using ceremonies of any religion that seems most dramatic at that time (from Catholic exorcisms performed by university scholars to Wicca spells cast by socially awkward goths, to Native American cleansing rituals). credit, these are made by Native Americans). If you believe in Wicca or are a Catholic or a follower of the traditional religions of Native Americans, I think you would want your cleaning rituals performed by someone who ... is not a badly adjusted college student with some free time. I do not remember the scene in the exorcist where the priests raised their hands and said: "It's no use! Call a club after the state university school, this is too much for us." They probably have read Wikipedia. Exorcisms The show is downright insulting to the viewer's intelligence The initial sequence of the show shows Ryan talking about PRS (the Paranormal Research Society), saying that when he arrived at Penn State (note that he does not see any program where the host Say the same thing, but instead of Penn State says "When I came to MIT" or "After getting my degree in theoretical physics ...", he found other people with similar interests in the paranormal He says sometimes they are " warriors. "I remember when I used to pretend I was a warrior and fought against ghosts, I was six, then Ryan, without emotion, brings out the cunning and unpleasant Chip Coffey, who pretends to ntrar in the trances and be possessed by cursing the cast. Amazing. I thought that people had learned something about how ridiculous the idea of ​​psychics and mediums is after "Crossing Over" faded away. The show takes itself too seriously, since this small group of social misfits pretends that they are fighting against an ancient and cosmic evil. The production values ​​are low, the stories are boring and, unlike the ghost hunters, who occasionally detect something anomalous (although probably explainable, but nevertheless interesting) in their equipment, PS requires that you believe that the noises and creaks they hear are evidence of Demons, ghouls, and possibly goblins. The only thing that scares this program is that there are people who take it seriously. The only paranormal about it is that the people who appear in it can do each episode while maintaining a serious face. <br /> <br /> Call me jaded, but I feel that the great mysteries of the universe and the future life are too good to be solved in a half-hour television program by a journalism student in a state school. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, I strongly recommend that everyone see this program at least once, if it is not for another. Reason that the mere entertainment derived from watching a movie or a really terrible television show. Or you can make a drinking game of it. I think the second would be preferable.
