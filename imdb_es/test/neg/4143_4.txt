I wanted to pursue this movie, but somehow I can not find it doing that myself. <br /> <br /> Exhibiting a duality of fighting styles, is Li vs. Li in a somewhat decent battle for supremacy. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies in which history presents performances. Li's performance is extremely amateur, hesitant and rigid for most of this movie ... until the end. At first, I tricked myself into believing that I was just doing that for one of his two characters. You know, to show a difference in personalities. But it seemed to be inexperience or lack of talent. He got a little better, more relaxed, toward the end. But that was not enough to save his performance. Jet Li's performance improves as his career progresses. I do not hate his performance. I just hated it in this. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that the effects were very "B" class effects. What effects are there? <br /> <br /> The story itself had great potential. He was exceptionally creative, daring and fresh. Unfortunately, the budget was not large enough to accommodate better lighting, effects, film quality and some acting lessons, or the director simply did not care enough to worry about these little details. He also did not bother with SCIENCE in science fiction. A fact that was a great detractor for this movie. <br /> <br /> The fight sequences were a bit unilateral, since it seemed to give more to one character and little to the other. But in general, the storyline was made for a very nice attempt. <br /> <br /> As pleasant as it was, I could not help thinking that it was one of those movies. You can not help but see it as it should have been, instead of being what it is. <br /> <br /> Rate a 6.0 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> That's a 4.2 / 10 (on the "A" scale) to have a good plot, of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
