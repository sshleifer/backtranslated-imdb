From 1936 to 1939, Peter Lorre made a series of successful Mr. Moto movies. Although technically the B films, they were much better made than the typical films of the genre. However, Lorre got tired of making these highly repetitive films and told his friends that he wanted to get out of the series. When it was canceled in 1939, Lorre was excited but his plans to obtain more complicated and satisfying roles did not materialize when he moved to Columbia Pictures. ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN is one of these films and it is quite obvious that the studio is not putting much effort into the movie, as I believe that the plot was written by penguins. Gifted penguins, maybe ... but still the movie does not make much sense. <br /> <br /> Start with a man who accepts being an undercover agent for the government. He must infiltrate an island in the United States where something strange is wrong. Now they could easily have gotten a search warrant to do this. But, since the penguins were writing the movie, the agent takes the rap for a murder he did not commit and spends a year in prison for this. He apparently expects to be released on probation on this island, since many people on probation are sent there when the period ends. <br /> <br /> There are some more serious problems with this idea. First, they only have to serve him a year before being convicted, but he was found guilty of MURDER and refused to reveal who he really was. In no case in this way, they could put anyone on probation. Second, what if he was not on parole to the island? I would have spent a whole year in prison for nothing! Third, why not only divers, paratroopers or boat police come to the island? Talk about an artificial plot! <br /> <br /> Once on the island, the agent discovers that the evil Peter Lorre established his own private prison and treated her with men on probation as slave labor. What about the men who have to inform their parole officers? This was never explained, but Lorre was using them to extract diamonds and they were abominably treated. Now, another question I had was that if Lorre was discovering huge diamonds there, he was a very rich man. So, why do not you PAY people for diamonds? Why set up your own version of Devil's Island and savagely hit and kill men? <br /> <br /> Eventually, Lorre obtains what he and the slaves of the island are released. Unfortunately, by then, I really did not care. In general, observable but quite silly. Lorre's career only improved when he moved the following year to Warner Brothers. With films like ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN, I could see why his stay in Columbia was short.
