How to take the fantastic intellectual journey of Charles Darwin and turn it into a movie for girls. His fundamental and seminal ideas and his radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are intact except for two brief scenes, one of which is said to be "killing God"; Pure demagoguery to make the emotional film. And the rest of the movie is dubbed for that purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long and familiar scenes with music in the cloud to which one should mourn. Anyone who reads the "Origin of Species" would really realize that there was no violation with God in any of Darwin's works; On the contrary, there was greater admiration and respect, and a new revolutionary way of seeing things. A good film about Darwin could be educational, reflective and deeply inspiring, even in a religious sense, but that would contradict the telenovela intentions of this film. This is a film designed to make people moan in artificial sympathy and then feel transformed even though they can not understand why; He makes quick use of Darwin's big name only as a marketing influence, since one would release a famous name at a party to create an impression. It is sad that the ensembles and the costumes are so good: the values ​​of production, with the exception of writing, were obviously high. See if you want to cry, for the loss of intelligence in American literature.
