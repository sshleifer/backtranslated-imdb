After reading the reviews, I am very relieved to know that I am not the only person who was very disappointed with this movie. I'm a big fan of Nicholas Sparks, I've read ALL of his books, most of them more than once. Of course, I LOVED the Notebook and a Walk to Remember ... I still have not seen Message in a Bottle or Nights in Rodanthe, so I can not comment on those ... <br /> <br /> But I did Go see dear John this past weekend and he was terribly upset! The movie was not good at all! When I watched the movie alone, and did not think about the book, it was a terrible movie. I did not get the rush and range of emotions from this movie that I got from other movies I enjoyed, especially The Notebook. I was not smiling and laughing and crying and worried and scared ... never! From the beginning all I could notice was how they changed everything! The only thing in this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a guy named John who is in the army and a girl named Savannah who is not ... the part that his father is obsessed with coins is the only other part that accompanied the book. Everything else was totally out !!!! First, in the book, Allen was Tim's little brother, NOT his son. WHY they had to change that, I do not understand. It made a lot more sense how it was in the book when Tim was a little older than Savannah and they grew up together and Allen was the inspiration for Savannah to want to work with horses and autistic children ... that did not happen in the movie ... ugh .. And in the book they spent much more time together than just those initial two weeks and then the 1 night ... why did they leave those times out? I could go on and on and on, but then I would run out of space! Basically, if you're a big fan of Nicholas Sparks, do not waste your time or money on this movie ... just read the book again ... because it's terrible and it does not look like the book at all!
