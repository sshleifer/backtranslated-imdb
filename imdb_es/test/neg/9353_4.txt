I saw this movie in 1956 and again on Cable a few days ago. The film has not improved with age. Quite the opposite. It is a true epic of spaghetti. <br /> <br /> The Trojans are heroic and nice; The Greeks are unpleasant, mean and furtive. <br /> <br /> So, what if Paris escaped with the king's wife? Hey ... love is love.
