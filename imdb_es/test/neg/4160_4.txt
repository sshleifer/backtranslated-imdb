*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> I watched this movie last night at a screening. I started to like Tim Robbins and love science fiction. The first third of the movie was very cool. The score was good, the cinematography was interesting, the vision of the future of the filmmaker was realistic but, nevertheless, very interesting. I remember thinking, "This is the most cleverly made science fiction movie I've seen in a long time." Then, they just could not keep it together. <br /> <br /> Although from the beginning, there was a series of problems more "approximate" with this film (namely, the edition and later some of the writings). / Development of the plot), these problems were forgivable. They became unforgivable once the movie lost some momentum around half the mark, and then the movie became tedious when it realized that it was not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Robbins could not bring his character to life, but he did the best he could. His female counterpart (her name escapes me now) was good in her role. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the snaking of the film seemed to be that the filmmakers could not decide whether to do a science. -Fi movie or a futuristic love story. They ended with neither. <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> Part of the cinematography: grainy, it felt like "21 days later" a few times. <br /> <br /> Very appropriate for a futuristic movie like this one. <br /> <br /> I unearthed some of the location shots. <br /> <br /> The music was great. <br /> <br /> The vision of the filmmakers The future was realistic but still it was great and interesting. <br /> <br /> I liked the interactions with the other secondary characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the writings were interesting (at first). <br /> <br /> The girl who played Maria Gonzales (name I do not remember), was good. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS DOWN *** <br /> <br /> Some questions / comments: <br /> <br /> I felt that many of the futuristic things in this movie were convenient for Fix a mosaic story. Namely VIRUS. Obviously, the virus that was given at the end of the movie that made her physically "fearful" of him was there so they could stick in another sex scene and then she could report it uncontrollably to Code 46. Then they took him away and Clears your memory and the movie ends. Classic 'sleep sequence' end of exit if you ask me. tie all the loose ends very well if you just make everything a dream, right? <br /> <br /> Was Robbin's character naturally as intuitive or was the virus? <br /> <br /> Why not? Do they explore the large number of problems that surround the girl as a clone of her mother? That could have made an interesting story. <br /> <br /> At first, I like the greetings from everyone in everyone's speech. But it became intrusive, especially because its accents were not convincing. I understand, the future will be, without a doubt, racially and culturally more androgynous, but in the end he began to feel like an AT & T Global Networking commercial. <br /> <br /> If they were "outside", how could they have arrived? Busted by Code 46? <br /> <br /> 'Cover' was never well defined. Sometimes it seemed as trivial as a visa, and other times it was as vital as life or death. Again, loose definitions allow them to use it to paste disparate parts of the plot. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm starting to get negative about it, so I'll stop. There were some interesting scenes and interesting things about this movie, but that only gives it a 4/10.
