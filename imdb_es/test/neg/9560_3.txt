A tedious gangster movie that leaves you wishing that someone has edited it farce more ruthlessly. I thought the story of the creation of Las Vegas would be interesting, but it fails in almost every way. The performance of Warren Beatty as the stupid and nasty Bugsy Seigel leaves you wanting to be seeing someone else. Once or twice it flashes through the fog of its performance to offer an interesting scene, but most of the time you can not worry about it. Annette Benning takes an expert turn as her untrustworthy lover, but even she is a little more flavorful than him. <br /> <br /> I would not really bother with this turgid drama unless you are a devotee of Benning.
