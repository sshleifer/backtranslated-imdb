Eight Legged Freaks is a movie of modern monsters, like a new version of any of the old 'Giant Attack [INSERT ANIMALS HERE] - movies of the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should have been more like a new version of, instead of what it was. So, how is a monster movie made in 2002? Well, from the typical opening with some chemicals that make spiders grow to enormous proportions, they mix movies like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and spice them up with a parody like Scary Movie. Gremlins is probably the best comparison, but Eight Legged Freaks was so full of stupid jokes and parodies that it sometimes looked more like Scary Movie. It was too much, at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another parody movie full of jokes. <br /> <br /> For a movie like this you do not expect much from acting, and that's how it was. However, the story was extremely thin, with only a lot of events connected to show some action mixed with all the jokes, which led to a cheesy and easily located ending. <br /> <br /> I rate Eight Legged Freaks a 4/10, and that includes the fact that the special effects were pretty good and that the noises made by the spiders were hilarious.
