This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen; I gave him a star simply because it is the lowest score possible. Who thought Flood would be a good movie? The director and the cast should be ashamed and then I realized that all this could be part of a scare tactic. Only the propaganda could be so bad. <br /> <br /> The redeeming feature of Flood is that it is horrible, and the plot of a sassy formula makes it fun. If only the characters had the same depth as those created by the flood itself, however, they went from one bite to another without any emotional response. <br /> <br /> The sad thing about this movie is that it could have been Much better, informative, imaginative and tense. Flood has the amateur streak found in many recent British films in which a more focused use of the funds would have contributed to better entertainment. <br /> <br /> Where was Smithee?
