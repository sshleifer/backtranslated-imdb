...first? Killjoy 1. But here's the Killjoy 2 review: <br /> <br /> (contains spoilers, so be careful with the readers) <br /> <br /> Oh my. Oh, my, my, my. I will start by saying that I had no hope that this movie was good. Considering that Killjoy (the first film) is undoubtedly the worst film ever made, the sequel was not very promising. <br /> <br /> As expected, it was not delivered. <br /> <br /> The deaths were even slower than in the first movie. There was absolutely no candy for the eyes, and all the accessories looked so fake that I would not be surprised if they had a kindergarten class. <br /> <br /> Look, I do not even know where to start. . Hm, to begin with, the film was not even a feature film. It only lasted one hour and eight minutes (68 minutes), but, again, ending soon was actually a reprieve. In fact, that's the only reason why this movie was not as bad as the first, because the first one was longer. <br /> <br /> Usually, I do not give spoilers in the reviews, but since I do not do it I want some of you to go through the torture of watching this movie waste, I'm going to spoil it. It is not that there is much to spoil. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the end. KILLJOY is the PUSSIEST killer of the story. Explosions, incendiary bombs, weapons, etc. are needed to kill all the normal serial killers in horror movies. Guess what it took to kill Killjoy? A F *** ING WATER GLASS. It's not a lie. In the end, a girl took a cup of water and threw the water on Killjoy's face. Then Killjoy started screaming, and they tried to make it look like his face was melting by putting dry gum cement on his forehead. Then he lay down there, and the people went to sleep. <br /> <br /> Now let's act. VERY TERRIBLE. Not even a person was credible in the least. I do not even know what to say, other than that it seems that they only hired some vagabonds who live in the streets to act in this film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I sincerely doubt that you have spent more than 100 dollars in total to make this movie. They did not have anything. Most of it took place in the forest, which would have cost them nothing to film. The actors did not give any effort at all, so it is evident that they were probably "working" for free. They did not have any special effects or good accessories, and probably used ketchup for blood. Hell, who am I cheating? Probably did not even spend $ 100. They probably spent $ 3.29 on a bottle of ketchup and that was it. A film f ** kin 'made with a budget of $ 3.29. <br /> <br /> For Bob's sake, they could not even afford to rent a police uniform. In the end, after Killjoy dies, the girl wakes up and says "Where is she?" and the main woman replies: "He's gone." Then, suddenly, a fat and silly guy with scars on his face appears out of nowhere with a cell phone that says "You have a call". The girl responds and says "Oh, mom!" and smiles. Then the fat fool walks to reveal that he is a police officer. However, he wears khaki pants and a green shirt with buttons, with a badge on the front pocket. Hell, it was probably the badge the director got when he was on security patrol in the 3rd grade. Then everyone put on a tan blazer and left when the credits accumulated. They could not even get a police cruiser, so they just got a cinnamon blazer. F ** kin 'lame. Killjoy did not even have the ice cream van he had in the first movie. <br /> <br /> Killjoy is without a doubt the most outrageously gay killer in history. If there were a slasher who wore pink spandex and a rainbow flag, STILL would not be as cheerful as Killjoy. Killjoy is not funny either (and believe me, he tried to be). <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is an extremely scarce threat given by one of the criminals. Someone comments to a child about not passing the third grade, to which the child responds: "I will show you the third grade!" in a threatening way. That has to be the absolute worst threat I've heard. "I'll show you the third grade!" <br /> <br /> This movie does not even work on a "so bad, it's good" level. It's dirt. Unless you did something bad and you feel so guilty for wanting to punish yourself severely, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Just remember; If a gay clown on fire with a huge black afro tries to bore you to death with gay jokes (and try to kill you at the same time), just throw him some water. Case closed. <br /> <br /> FINAL RATING: .1 of 10
