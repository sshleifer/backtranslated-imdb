Strangers with sweets exaggerate in all the wrong context, situations are simply not fun with the cheesy voices and the bad timing of the comedy, the clear attempt at dry / black / dark humor is obvious and does not meet all the elements of a good joke. <br /> <br /> With a high contraction factor and a low proportion of laughter, I was surprised that this program passed the first season, I personally like Scrubs, The Office, 30 Rock, Trailer Park Boys, Pulling, Peep Show , Simpsons, Family Guy and I know what you think, these shows are not uncommon, so some other good shows I've seen are Jam, Garde Marenghi's Darkplace, The Book Group, Asylum and Snuff Box that are originals with dry / Black / dark humor / satire are at least 5/10. <br /> <br /> The Dark Place of Garth Marenghi is especially cheap, exaggerated and strange, nevertheless, the context is thought and works so that it really goes well. entertaining too
