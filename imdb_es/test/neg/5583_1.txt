This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. The highlight of the film is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina. <br /> <br /> The acting is pathetic. I know that acting is hard work and that, but that is why it should be left to real actors. Seeing these people act is like watching Michael J. Fox perform brain surgery. It is unstable at best. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments would make you believe that the film was saved by Dan Gordon's talents as Chris. Only Dan himself or maybe his mother could believe that it was a good performance. <br /> <br /> The special effects in this movie were terrible. The worst special effects were due to the gas explosion in the lighthouse. It seemed that someone was lighting an orange light from the bottom of a model built from a refrigerator box. Of course there was a bit of computer animation superimposed, but it did not help. I suspect that the special effects in this movie were created and rendered using a single Amiga computer from the late 1980s.
