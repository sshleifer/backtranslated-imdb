Why did not they follow the book? I am very sad and disappointed. I really wanted to see this movie, however, if you have read the book (maybe recently) it can be very difficult to stay objective. My wife had not read the book and she loved the movie. <br /> <br /> The reasons for the disappointment are: 1) Cern's participation ... disappeared with the wind, it was a shame, there is a very small part. at the beginning, where antimatter is created, but even that does not adhere to the facts (why not, the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand, which is how Langdon got involved, would have been a start perfect for the Movie_ 2) The story line between the Pope (deceased) and Camerlegno disappeared completely ... this completely complicates the motive for the theft of antimatter 3) The line of history between Langdon and Vittoria Vetra completely non-existent <br /> <Br /> All-in-all, a story too scaly, and I can not understand that Dan Brown allowed them to put his name against. Maybe I should revisit this movie in 10 years, when I can no longer remember the excellent book (I'm afraid I forgot the book) <br /> <br /> I really regret the negative criticism, which was spoiled by The expectations
