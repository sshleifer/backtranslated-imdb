I tried. Lord, help me, as I tried. But there are some people who are almost incapable of creating quality. Brett Ratner, Uwe Boll, Britney Spears and Asylum. To his credit, "The 9/11 Commission Report" seems to be an honest attempt by the company to move towards a more sophisticated state of storytelling and film making. But for all intents and purposes, it comes out as another real movie in your gallery. At the opening, the legal notice notifies the hearings that all names have been changed, but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same. A man named Mussaui tries to learn to fly an airplane. With a cold grimace that would make someone uncomfortable instantly, this "undercover" agent can learn to fly on a small computer. And you have to ask yourself, not how you could get into this program so easily, but how these people did not even ask questions; because this scene is so implausible in its presentation, and the actor who plays this man is extremely exaggerated. And you can see that director Scott tries to imitate Paul Greengrass with a bright grainy picture followed by a terribly dizzying and irritating hand direction that, throughout the entire film, attempts to take off the Greengrass guerrilla shooting techniques. . <br /> <br /> You can feel Scott emulating the Greengrass technique for realism, but he becomes somewhat clumsy halfway. Meanwhile, the film is less a takeoff of "Traffic", and more a takeoff in "Law & Order" in which we will have the legal notice that notifies us that the names have been changed, the logo almost reminds the logo of "Law and order, "and then ninety minutes of the actors pumping their breasts and discussing politics. <br /> <br /> None of which is as convincing as it tries to be. And then, when it seems that the movie is about being an adult drama, Scott relies on his old proof of failure, the sex scene. Scott's new film seems to really want to be considered a low-budget "Munich", but it is not, and it manages to be disappointing on every possible occasion. The "September 11 Commission Report" has nothing to do, and that is due to his limited attempts to imitate other films. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the inherent ambition of the camera, this new perspective of the events that are approaching 9/11 is flat, and without brightness. As much as it may be a low-budget "Munich", it's really as entertaining as a normal Dolph Lundgren movie you'd find in Cinemax.
