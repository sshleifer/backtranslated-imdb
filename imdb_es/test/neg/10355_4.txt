There is something in this program that keeps me looking and waiting for the future. In writing, jokes are few and far between, and the lines of the story are boring, so it seems to me that they should be physical comedy and images. , and wardrobe. It is highly contrasting against the monotony that reigns. And I'm pretty sure that every time I laughed it was about the physical comedy of John or Molly. The two make a disgustingly cute couple that makes me laugh and want to throw up at the same time. <br /> <br /> So here I am ready to sit down with Kath and Kim once again tonight to see which way this production will go down (or rise as the case may be, looking forward positively).
