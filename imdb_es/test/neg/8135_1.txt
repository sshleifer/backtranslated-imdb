I joined Heart of Gold thinking I was going to see a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I witnessed a selfish homage to the arrogance of older baby boomers who have lost their advantage and forgotten their roots. Highlighted by critics of the aging baby boom, directed and performed by more aging baby boomers, Heart of Gold is a festival of boredom from beginning to end, that is, if you can sit for the whole movie of almost 2 hours . Neil Young and his team have long lost their advantage and want the rest of us to join them in a padded rocking chair of intermediate mediocrity. What happened to the raunchy guitar from his previous solo efforts? I suppose all of your lint boxes rusted and your overloaded vacuum tubes exploded in the hot air of your generation. As far as Demme is concerned, this is the daring director of Something Wild & Melvin And Howard? A student filmmaker could have made a bolder movie than this superficial performance movie with little visualization. Do not waste your $$ on Heart of Gold and go directly to The Last Waltz and Gimmie Shelter. And if you really want to deepen the personality of a rock and roll icon, look for a copy of Chuck Berry: Hail Hail Rock And Roll that is very exhausted. And the baby boomers, do not bother screaming about how this review is jaded by someone younger. I'm also one of those baby boomers who listened to Cinnamon Girl in acid and danced in the streets at Stones' Street Fighting Man. Go back and look at "Do not Look Back" or "Gimmie Shelter" and then come back and tell me "Heart of Gold" has value as a document.
