This movie made my face hurt. I do not understand ... things just happened, inexplicably, and usually resulted in someone breaking into a song and a dance number. I do not understand how people can praise this movie with praise. There are B movies, and then there are B musicals, and then Rockula. <br /> <br /> The songs made me want to run headlong into a wall. The only salvation is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a music video, which relieves the pain, but still does not justify why it had to exist. The most terrifying section of the film is Toni Basil's creep-dance that accompanies his strange song. But on the positive side, she can find the notes she is looking for, unlike the sensations of pop music Rockula (also known as Rapula) and Mona ... wow, we can say dull tone. So, if you want to question life for about 90 minutes, watch this movie. If you hate your life, then buy it.
