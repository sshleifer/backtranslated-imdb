After the Japanese attack of World War II on US forces in Pearl Harbor, "The Eastside Kids": Leo Gorcey (as Muggs), Bobby Jordan (as Danny Connors), Huntz Hall (as Glimpy), David Gorcey (as Peewee) ), Ernest Morrison (as Scruno) and Bobby Stone (as Skinny) want to serve their country. But, both the US Army. UU Like the Navy they reject them for being too young. Still wanting to "knock down about a million Japanese," the "children" attack an Asian employee, who turns out to be Chinese. However, the unfortunate incident leads the gang to help discover some really unpleasant Japanese and Germans. <br /> <br /> If "too young" is defined as "under twenty-one", only Mr. Jordan and Mr. Stone would be rejected for military service. But, it is possible that the recruiters were rejected by the office manners shown by Mr. Gorcey and Mr. Hall. "We're going to be difficult!" was made during what the script accurately describes as "open season in the Japanese", for this and other reasons, has not aged well. It's a useless endeavor, but regular customers perform skillfully, with Tom Brown moving the story along, like Jordan's spy brother. <br /> <br /> *** Let's be difficult! (5/29/42) Wallace Fox ~ Leo Gorcey, Bobby Jordan, Tom Brown
