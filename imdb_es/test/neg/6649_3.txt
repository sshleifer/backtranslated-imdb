Having entered a secret database file for the corresponding DNA sera, federal agent Frank Poo (Andy Garcia) discovers that the only person who can save his son's life is a psychopath, played by Michael Keaton. However, when a transfer of serum to the local hospital goes horribly wrong, a certain Mr.Poo has to do everything in his power to make sure the madman is still alive to make the inevitable transfer possible. By the way, his name is not really Poo, I want to call him. Despite the original concept at hand, this is an unlikely and insurgently turgid action thriller. I've never been a big fan of Andy Garcia, and I conceded to his character that he can not be attached, this movie ends up being even worse. The action sequences are handled quite disappointingly, and the end stinks pretty badly. Having made a great villain in Pacific Heights, the evil psychopath of Keaton here is disappointing, which provides an overly fun and charismatic fool to be deplored. Brian Cox is also wasted as Garcia's firm and outspoken superior.
