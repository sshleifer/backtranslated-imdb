It is extremely rare for me to see a 1955 film that I do not love. Noir, JDs, science fiction, Drive-Ins; I dig everything to the fullest. Robert Aldrich is a director who has done an excellent job, and most of this cast has excellent performances under his belt. So, what went wrong? <br /> <br /> When I used to work in the independent film world, we used to talk about something called "actor movies". Actors' films are films that can not be seen by anyone other than other actors. The actors like "actor films" because they can see ACTing, that is, a completely exaggerated melodrama. The actors love being given the opportunity to leave completely "give everything they have" and get great satisfaction to see other actors do it. In many interviews with actors, they say that "he was a great director, he never interfered with me in any way". Actually, that is the opposite of a good direction, because the whole point of having a director on the set is to prevent the actors from deceiving themselves (which, given the opportunity, they will always have). <br /> <br /> Apparently, Robert Aldrich forgot about this project. Or maybe he was sick. Or maybe he thought there was no hope of saving the script in the first place, so what the hell? In any case, this is an example of a lesser known film that is better to forget. The characters gesticulate, pontificate and generally cut it all the way. One thing I can say is realistic: it is set in Hollywood and everyone acts as if their little problems were the most important thing in the world. It does not make it fun to watch, but it's realistic. What is unrealistic is that a producer so desperate to keep his star under contract will do everything possible to contradict him in almost every way possible, including demanding that he participate in illegal activities. But this and other contradictions of the plot simply carry along the melodrama, which increases the opportunity to squeeze the hands and shout accusations. <br /> <br /> I managed to get to the end of this movie, which does not make it worse than a "3" out of 10 in my book. But why test your own resistance when there is much more available to rent?
