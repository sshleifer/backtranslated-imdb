Definitely the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. I can not find anything positive to say about this movie (if this production is even worthy of that word). <br /> <br /> This production is not even the standard of a low budget porn movie! <br /> <br /> My question is simply: why did someone look at the script and think "Hey, am I going to make a movie with this?". <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I did not even expect "Nicole" to make it. It really was so annoying! <br /> <br /> So, for your own good, do not watch this movie ... unless you want to waste 85 minutes of your life ...
