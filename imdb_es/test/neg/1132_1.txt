Who gave these people money to make a movie? There was nothing funny about it. The fact that the dog with farts was the funniest thing about this disease says it all. First, it has nothing to do with Christmas, just took the name and had all those people who liked the original Chevy Chase. They took Randy "I have no talent, I'm just a fat and sweaty pig" Quaid (the only wrong thing in part 1) and I made a "movie" about him ... There are only idiots in his family, but not the 'no' They are cute 'a little silly, but' do not touch me 'a little silly. Seeing this pile of earth helps you to hope that everyone who participates in it will die. They did not even bother to put the effects in order ... when they are in the boat, the only thing that moves is the false background ... when the pigface Quaid is in the water, it can be noticed by the illumination that is in a study. This movie was sexist (Uncle Nick), racist (Uncle Nick) and should never have been made ... never ... throwing money at a volcano would have had much more use. <br /> <br /> Well, I hope I have reached some of you ... Nobody warned me and now I have a scar for life Merry F * cking Christmas
