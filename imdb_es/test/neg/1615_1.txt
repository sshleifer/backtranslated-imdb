Regards; <br /> <br /> I never thought I would see the day I would be so upset by a movie that it would be a burden to finish it ... I was always a fan of horror movies, B 'C and C's included. But in this case, it is difficult to describe how a film can stop qualifying for lyrics of that scale ... <br /> <br /> The film focuses on an undeveloped background story, a mixture of folklore and after. taste. And to recharge it, the performance of the actors is questionable. The horror films B are generally divided into two categories ... 1) A jewel that was not seen or financed 2) How bad it is fun, laugh or give you back the money. Well, this movie falls in the middle. I was not scared, I did not laugh ... So, if you really need to see it, you can do it but I recommend you not ...
