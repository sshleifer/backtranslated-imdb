A highly publicized, ingenious and avant-garde reinterpretation. <br /> <br /> They have fallen into the "because it is modern, it has to be promoted, skillful, etc." trap. <br /> <br /> "Romeo and Juliet" carried out this idea with much more success, but I really think it is time for us to move beyond the two extremes here (period piece vs. movie tense). <br /> <br /> Just because it is a "modern" account does not mean that the film has to look like a magazine ad, or that it has something to do with drugs or weapons. <br /> <br /> If the traps were the following Subtle as the sweet words, Macbeth would be a much more powerful movie. Anyway, read your Shakespeare. Read it out loud. Ask your Oxford dictionary some questions. Skip the movie. Or not, but he has been warned. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the super long review. IMDb forced me to do it.
