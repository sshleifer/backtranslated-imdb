It seems I disagree with a lot of people here. but I really did not find this film as brilliant as the reviews I read said. Without a doubt, it was a moving story and the background of the partition provided the scope for an epic. But, the movie was a disappointment. Especially for those who have seen 'gadar'. Even though the sun is being played by Sunny Deol and the incessant songs, I must say that Gadar is the best of the two. The story is practically the same. The partition could not create any depth in its characters, as well as in the scenes that were supposed to have an impact. looking at Kristin Kruek's accent and the little image, which in itself was not an easy task. The characters did not seem too real. It is not that I am criticizing the performance of any of the protagonists. It just did not work. the environment was well structured, but the film really lacked substance. It's not that I'm a rambo fan, but some action players have seen the movie, or some character development. Everything seemed like a race towards the end. and the end only added to the dissatisfaction of the spectators. <br /> <br /> However, I must say that it was at least a good effort in a territory apparently unknown to the director. And if you have not seen Gadar, then you may like it.
