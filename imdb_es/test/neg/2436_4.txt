This film is presented as an English version of an ABC special after school, with nudity. It makes you wonder who was supposed to be the target audience. Nor is it that the writers were too preoccupied with selling a plausible plot. Although it has a certain capacity for observation, Virtual Sexuality is softer than dandelion meringue. It's a good movie to see if you fall inside, the cable is out and it's the only tape you have.
