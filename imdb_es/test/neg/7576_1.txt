One of my co-workers recommended it to me, implying that it was one of the most terrifying movies I have ever seen. I checked it with my girlfriend and we gave up after about 50 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, I had a long conversation with my co-worker (we are still friends!). <Br /> <br /> This film is as original as the last film starring Steven Seagal. It brings absolutely nothing original to the table. The creepy parts have been done thousands of times before. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw, however, is the painfully slow pace of this movie. The periods between fear are completely wasted with a meaningless dialogue and a lot ... nothing ... <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 Molotov cocktails
