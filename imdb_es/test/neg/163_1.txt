I can not believe how silly this movie is. The story (written by the mother of Keira Knightley) is what ruins the film to the extreme. It's boring, absurd, and it does not make any sense at all ... <br /> <br /> This movie was delayed so much for most, especially at the beginning. the story went on and on about their daily flirtations, often looking like a trio. In this movie, you have an annoying couple (the poet and his wife) who are completely drunk from the start. the wife sleeps with other men to make ends meet, while the poet is a pervert who thrives on boos and cheap women. The wife, who waaayyyyyy too soon becomes friends with her former childhood lover (played by Keira) suddenly becomes jealous, knowing very well that the two were lovers since they were children. Something does not seem right here ... I mean, come on ... go with the program, ma'am! What you expected <br /> <br /> The end result is: former lovers meet again with a new wife who hugs him, then becomes jealous, then the former lover marries and her husband becomes jealous, bombs the house of the crazy couple drunk, crazy husband calls the police, and end up going to court on charges of attempted murder of the man. that's all summed up in summary ... <br /> <br /> this movie had moments like Cillian Murphy's quality and good acting, but other than that, I can not believe I've seen it ... I complained about this during the movie and some family members who saw her with me fell asleep. I decided to give it a try and should have limited myself to my first instincts.
