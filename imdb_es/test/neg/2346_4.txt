If you can overcome the slow start and the bad performance, it's worth seeing. The story line was pretty decent. The father had a bad temper because he was unemployed and could hardly see his son, except in summer because his ex-wife had him in his custody. The father was very angry and frustrated most of the time. The monster in the story was not too scary. The movie breaks the consistency that the monster is incredibly strong. The scene in which the filmmakers do this is one of the times when the child is in the basement and the monster is going to attack him. When the monster is going to attack the child, his arm is trapped in a steel trap attached to a chain. The monster is one foot away from the child's face. Every other time throughout the movie, the monster is strong enough to break or knock down anything. However, the trap and the steel chain prevent him from obtaining the child! Most likely, the filmmakers did this because of the shock factor because nobody wants to see one of the main characters die. The filmmakers just wanted to scare us into thinking that it might be a possibility that the child would die. Instead of breaking coherence, filmmakers should have replaced the child with someone they could get rid of!
