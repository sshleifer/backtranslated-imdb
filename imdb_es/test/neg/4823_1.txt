If this is classified as the "real life" of London, then the producers must be on a different planet. <br /> <br /> It is the most depressing, suicidal, dark, dreary scum on television. <br /> <br /> Everyone is fighting, everything has low bad tones, nothing is done for genuine reasons. <br /> <br /> If you want a real-life picture of people in London or the UK, this program is so far removed from reality. <br /> <br /> There is not a single good word I can say about this program. The only certainty is that it will be a big fight at Christmas dinner. <br /> <br /> Even the characters are totally incredible!
