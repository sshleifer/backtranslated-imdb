Damn horrible! There is simply no other way to say it. In fact, it's ** SO ** bad that the only reason I'm wasting the words is to warn other reasonable viewers that they want to entertain themselves intelligently. You will lose I.Q. points watching this. Now that I think about it, it is not even suitable for a meaningless visualization due to the irritation factor. There is no guilty pleasure in seeing something so incompetent. <br /> <br /> Reasons to avoid it: <br /> <br /> 1) Harshly scientifically inaccurate, to the point that this is no longer science fiction, it is simply a lazy and careless fantasy. <br /> <br /> 2) Have fun FX that are incredible. Not even a cheesy cheese is a wink and a nod, like the old Doctor Who, but it's cheap and shoddy to the point of being insulting. The FX are so bad that they are not even ridiculous. They spent about a dollar-fifty on this, no more. <br /> <br /> 3) The direction is so weak and meaningless that the only way the actors could reach the end of filming without becoming a terminal depression Walk asleep through their roles, although Catherine McCormack He made an effort anyway, probably on principle and despite the director. Also, this is not the only bad movie of Peter Hyams: his failures far outweigh the almost impossible to rescue, of which Timecop was the last, and that was 15 years before he wrote this. he has not had anything half decent since (End of the days was just as crazy, Arnold was the only draw, and he needed a much firmer direction than Hyams provided). Hyams continues to make it increasingly useless for anyone to consider giving him more work. <br /> <br /> And finally, <br /> <br /> 4) Ray Bradbury's stories deserve a much better treatment than this one. Refusing to watch this movie sends that message, it's not that Hollywood is listening in particular. <br /> <br /> Watch it at your own risk. If you do it and take away the movies, you just have to blame yourself (and Hyams) because you've been warned more than adequately.
