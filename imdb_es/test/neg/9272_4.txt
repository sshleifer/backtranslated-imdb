History of a former Navy Seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a Russian avant-garde submarine with a nurse. This is to answer a call for help arranged by a dying member of the original crew. The submarine has been overtaken by terrorists who are bent on destruction. So we see the duo trying to regain control. And this happens with the fear that the Naval Forces of the United States are about to unleash everything they have on the terrorist submarine to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Be careful with the explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie. A couple of inexplicable scenes towards the end. Watch it when you have time. Nothing can be lost, even if you let the show run while you have a cup of coffee: move slowly.
