This lazy Harold Lloyd sound movie does not have any laughter, and it makes you wonder if this Lloyd is the same one that made all those lovely, hilarious silent ones. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's childhood sympathy turns into nonsense. when we can hear him speak, and a slow and moderate rhythm replaces the stupid pranks of his silences. Lloyd plays a young son of a missionary who grows up in China and then sees himself transplanted to the contemporary city of New York without an idea of ​​how life works outside his Chinese village. He finds himself an unlikely winner in a mayoral election and quickly sweeps the wrath of all government organizations because he refuses to look the other way in the face of rampant corruption. When framed in an attempt to tear it down, he decides to play as dirty as everyone else, and organizes a fake execution of all the criminals in New York City as a scare tactic. This dark satirical ending feels out of place next to everything else in the film, but it is the only part of the film that comes alive remotely. Everything else is boring. <br /> <br /> I do not like to admit that a Harold Lloyd movie fails, because I like it a lot, but I have no choice with it. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
