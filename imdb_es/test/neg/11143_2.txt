I liked Flesh a lot and waited for the Heat, but could not help but feel that Morrissey grossly exploited most of the "artists" who perform here. To stumble naked in a narcotic stupor seems to be all that Dallesandro was capable of in this feature, a huge and heartbreaking contrast of Flesh. His semi-erection in a few scenes is the only indication that he could be acting; Mostly it seems like something he did to buy drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation, it is the embodiment of the Lower East Side. But his is a one-woman show. However, he rarely gets involved with other performers, it must be said, his sex scene with a beer bottle definitely leaves Halle Berry in the shade when it comes to film exhibitions of raw passion. When he pounces on a young lover, it is with the ferocity of a vampire. Two of the female artists, Andrea and Jane, have voices so annoying that you'll have to mute the sound to get through their scenes. The fact that several of these artists committed suicide or were killed a few years later only adds to the air of exploitation. But they were probably desperate to be in front of Morrissey's camera anyway. There is probably no worse way to spend a Saturday night, but at least it brings a specific time and place with real life.
