A unit of the Delta Force Army, assigned to find a batch of missing imbeciles who are not known to disappear completely, will be in a fight to survive against a hooded skeleton man, the supposed spirit of an ancient Indian warrior who revived when Archaeologists disturbed his grave. The skeleton man rides a horse and has the ability to move from one side to another using a type of dimensional portal, and does not seem affected by bullet shots and explosives. The horse of the Skeleton Man does not leave hoof prints and can walk from behind and around his prey in silence. The point of view of the film through the eyes of the Skeleton Man looks at his prey with a different color. In other words, he does not appear to be human, so how can Captain Leary (Michael Rooker, as grizzled and intense as ever) and his gang of possible commandos stop the threat? For some reason, the Skeleton Man kills employees of a nearby chemical plant. What are the reasons for the Skeleton Man to kill countless human beings? And why would a blind Indian living in the forest, where our commandos live, be saved if the Skeleton Man, as a human, murdered his entire tribe to prove its worth? <br /> <br /> As stupid as it sounds. Simply amazing horrible. This is the kind of film that can deaden brain cells. Casper Van Dien gets the second billing in the credits just below Rooker, but he has a ridiculously subscribing character that leaves the movie quite early. Rooker deserves better than this. If I were an actor, I would not want this movie in my curriculum. The Skeleton Man is a rejection of Templer Knight from an Ossorio movie. It has a spear that can simply topple certain people while exploding a woman's head on impact. An arrow shot from the bow of the Skeleton Man actually destroys the propeller of a helicopter plane. For almost 99% of the film, the bullets are fired at the Skeleton Man and he can enter and exit that portal object, but in the end, suddenly, he becomes vulnerable to attack. Oh, and the horses also change as the Skeleton Man moves freely through the forest from that portal. The film is written and edited by clowns. The attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters, who are supposed to be experienced professionals, make really bad decisions throughout this movie. The mind is stunned with this movie. It's good for some laughter, and some bloody scenes make this piece of pure shit look like a garbage movie.
