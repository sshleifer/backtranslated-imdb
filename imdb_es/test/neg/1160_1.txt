PLEASE people! Do not bother with this badly directed joke. The address was totally wrong from the beginning. Where is the story of the emotional interference of their mothers and the general madness in the original family? Why is ED presented as this imposing, large and dominant figure, full of anger and hatred? What is this shit? The writer and the director obviously did not investigate the story and just wanted to take advantage of the infamous name of Gein. The fools who made this movie took so many liberties with the truth, it's ridiculous. If you want to see a brilliant movie by Gein. He returns to the minor classic "Deranged" to see what Ed really was like. There is humor in that film, and Ed is represented as the saddest and loneliest man he was, according to HISTORY. Where is the background story here? There are simply misconceived shocks (which are not shocking) that we have seen before, and also more successful ones. Take the worst scam of the Texas massacre and add it to that list. I had to give ONE of every ten because the grade would not accept ZERO. I want my money back. If someone considers this movie "impressive", you may receive a financial commission to do so.
