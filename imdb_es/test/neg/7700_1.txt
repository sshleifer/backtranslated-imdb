There's nothing good to say about this movie. Read Revolution for her hell or any of his other writings. Abbie was often dismissed as the clown prince of the 60s, but he was a man of ideas who used his intelligence, his sense of humor and his pop culture, and his extravagant personality to draw attention to his ideas. The media often focuses on man, not ideas, and that is the problem with this movie as well. Later in his life he suffered from depression. But this movie is like a version of Abbie from National Enquirer. It deserves something better. If you do not know Abbie or his era, this movie will not help you. <br /> <br /> This movie is mere. I give it a zero <br /> <br />
