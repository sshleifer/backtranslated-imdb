For a film that won so much recognition and appreciation of this split to "Rosemarys Baby" is a big mistake. It begins that Andrew / Adrian, whatever his name is, because he is so confused that he no longer knows who he is, he flees from a cult with his mother and is soon kidnapped by a strange lady who ends up taking care of him as if she was his mother. The acting is terrible, since Andrew grows in his twenties and looks terrible with his face sunken, the endless smile and Dukes of Hazard's clothes looks more like a drunk than a son of Satan. In fact, that is all he does is drink and fall carelessly on himself as he tries to confront his past and the last memory of his mother who goes on a bus screaming at him. Find a friend who seems to be an angel, but is quickly killed and electricized in a hilarious scene where it looks more like a Christmas tree. Andrew gets his hand and the cult with the members of the first part put him to the test to see if he really is the Son of Satan. His fool does not pass the test and rises from the alter shine with myme's make-up and the jumps of a nightclub's stage and dances like a clown in crack. This scene is memorable and worth seeing. The ending is terrible and somewhat predictable considering how stupid it is throughout the film. Do not look at this piece of garbage or you will lose respect for the first part.
