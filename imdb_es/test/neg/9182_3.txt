this caricature is not good, haha. I totally disagree with many of the things he portrayed, but he ended on a positive note, but as for me and mine, we will not see this in our home mainly because we fight stereotypes every day and this caricature just confirms what that most whites feel that black people act like <br /> <br /> the comment that one of the black girls made in the cartoon was that their boyfriend was so conscious (that he was white) that he really offended me, that's not something we, as black people, take lightly, it's a state of being that black people achieve when they realize their true ability
