I rented this movie hoping it would stink, and it did not disappoint me. I rented it with some friends as a joke. But, what we got was worse than anyone could imagine. <br /> <br /> Start sucking before you take it out of the box. It looks like a Blade scam and the guy on the cover is nowhere in the movie. His name is vampire killer, but is not a murderer someone who kills by contract? Well, this guy kills by his own will, so that does not make him a murderer. <br /> <br /> Then, when you put the disc, it gets worse. First of all the animation menu is lame. But, when you really start the movie, everything from stage design to lighting (or lack of it) is terrible. You know that a movie is bad when the credits even stink. The performance is laughable. The action is childish. Writing is elementary. And the address is the worst.
