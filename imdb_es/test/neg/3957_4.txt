A group of teenagers discover a pirate videogame, but once they start playing it, each one begins to die just like they do in the videogame. As they become addicted to the game, they have to find a way to defeat the game's central villain, The Blood Countess, before he kills them all. The movie could have been a little entertaining. However, this "horror" movie is not scary at all. Actually it is more a comedy than anything else. The movie is taken too seriously and the movie is not very fun to watch. Sure, there are occasional laughs, but for the most part, the movie is very boring. The horror films PG-13 can still be good as The Ring or Cry Wolf. However, The Ring and Stay Alive are not really the same kind of horror movie. Stay Alive is more of a slasher movie and since its PG-13 rating, scenes of death are very docile. It should have been the main sale of the movie and, since it had an interesting concept, the deaths could have been really good. Unfortunately, the studio wanted a larger audience and the movie had to be modified. <br /> <br /> The acting is a complete joke and the majority of the cast gives horrible performances. Jon Foster is not a very good leader. He lacks charisma to really attract the audience or for the audience to care about him. Your character is not unpleasant just very bland. Samaire Armstrong actually gives a good performance, although a bit too tasteless to really excel. Frankie Muniz probably gives the best performance in Stay Alive. It is an honor to be the best player of the Houston Texans. Sophia Bush is absolutely terrible as October. His acting feels so hasty and so false. The most annoying character in the film is Phineas played by Jimmi Simpson. Your character is so unpleasant that you will encourage him to die. <br /> <br /> In fact, most of the characters are quite unpleasant, which makes it even more difficult to be interested in the movie. It's hard to feel sorry for some of these annoying children and it's much more fun to watch them if you want the characters to survive. The only really good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. It's a bit old but it still works. The movie is also very short, so it's not too painful to sit down. However, I really would not blame the cast because they were working with an inexperienced director and writer. The address is not very good and the script is not much better. Stay Alive is not really the worst horror movie of 2006. That honor would be for When a Stranger Calls. However, Stay Alive is still a missed opportunity. In the end, this corny and lame horror movie is better left on the shelf. Rating 4/10.
