Usually, I give the sequels the benefit of the doubt and I take them slowly. But this is very poor. Exactly the same thing that happened in the first movie. The exact same. They just wanted the younger children to see it (this explains the repeated presence of Bugs Bunny, but the reason why they released an 'f * ck' is beyond me). <br /> <br /> They did not even bother to change the character of Jackie Mason from Dangerfield. Let me explain, on CADDYSHACK Rodney Dangerfield played a real estate owner that infuriated members of the Bushwood Country Club. In this film, Jackie Mason plays a real estate owner who infuriates members of the Bushwood Country Club. A great effort they made to change the content of the script, huh? No I dont think so. A very funny little Dan Aykroyd shamefully copied the character of Bill Murray. He even goes after the Gopher (now more like a Gremlin) in the same way that Murray did. <br /> <br /> Do not laugh. A sample of the 'comedy' in this film: Jackie Mason is preparing for an appointment with Dyan Cannon. He is in the bathroom is his robe. He moves to the door to get dressed in his room when the door handle breaks. Wow!?! That is the best they can do. Eight years to think of a completely new sequel and that's all we have. I could have taken a better script out of my ass. <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you're a fan of the original. It's the only way you'll find some kind of laughter in it. Everyone else moves away.
