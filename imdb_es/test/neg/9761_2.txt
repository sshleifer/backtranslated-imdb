Do not get carried away because the premise of this movie is good. It is, but that, it does not make a good movie, do. <br /> <br /> Comedies require a well-honed script and a masterful direction. Unfortunately, this badly executed movie has neither one nor the other. Leconte, a good director in other genres, does not appear in his comic farces (another example is the Les Bronzes series). <br /> <br /> The comic moment is terrible. Some jokes are telegraphed. Some are re-hash of other movies. Others just feel like they give you time to laugh. The plot has disordered secondary plots (the allergic daughter, the lesbian co-owner) and simply does not develop or envelop the viewer. It's not funny or credible for a second. <br /> <br /> Compare this with any Billy Wilder comedy (Some Like it Hot, A Foreign Afair, etc.) or Leconte's compatriot, Francis Veber, a true GENIUS in French comedy (Le Diner de Cons , Le Placard, Les Comperes, La Chevre, La Grande Blonde, etc.) and you will see the difference in their adjusted scripts, their great comedy and their synchronization with each one. A joke that leads to the next. <br /> <br /> Seeing Mon Meilleur Ami twice would be a cruel and unusual punishment, not a good sign for a comedy.
