So let's say you're a producer, you have some money and somehow you have Richard Gear and Bruce Willis, so now all you need is a script ... but why bother? Look, this movie is really terrible, the acting is pretty good, but the casting is a horrible team and Willis did everything possible to play these characters that just can not play. Now, this movie has no plot, or rather, there is something that tries to pass itself off as an argument: there is an evil murderer (Willis) who is great, dangerous and sophisticated (actually it's nothing like that, but some dialogue among the other characters, you're supposed to get this impression), so this hitman is on a mission to kill someone, now there's a former IRA prisoner who is kind, nice and very nice (team) that the FBI releases of the prison so it will help them. So now the FBI is "investigating" to find this hit man, the investigation involves a series of unlikely information, as if a person randomly lost his wallet and someone used his name to buy a car, which is always right. since there is no real plot and the script is so bad, you can not expect any real character development, or tension, so instead of creating them through the story, simply add a little disconnected dramatic music, which will It indicates that something very dramatic is happening. , instead of actually creating something dramatic ... <br /> <br /> the bottom line is that this is a very bad movie and a complete waste of time that somehow got an incredibly high score for its level, probably because to the Cast - and this is exactly what the producers were counting on.
