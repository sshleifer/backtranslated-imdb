The film begins great in 1872 with a violent and bloody fight between Dracula (Christopher Lee) and Van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Dracula is impaled and dissolves into powder. Van Helsing also dies. Someone picks up the ashes of Dracula and buries them in the grounds of a church. Cut to 1972: this is where the movie collapses. <br /> <br /> Instantly they hit us in the head with loud and bad music from the 70s, HORRIBLE fashions and silly dialogues. When this was done, Hammer was losing money and decided to try anything to get a hit. Putting Dracula in the 1970s was NOT a good idea. Fashions, music and dialogue horribly date the film. They introduce us to a group of annoying children in their twenties who decide to have a black mass, "for a giggle". Naturally, they have it in the church (now abandoned) and naturally revive Dracula. It is good that there is a descendant of Van Helsing ... but Dracula pursues his niece (Stephanie Beacham) in revenge. <br /> <br /> Lee and Cushing are great as always in their roles and whenever they are On the screen, the film gets a much needed power draw. The opening and end of the battles are the highlights of the film (although the end is ruined by playing the music of the 70s). Also the main ringleader of the children is called Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame), a truly stupid name that dates back to the 1940s. The movie also has the screaming queen Caroline Munro looking absolutely great. The film is well directed and quite well acted, but the plot is stupid, the constant barrage of 70's fashion, the dialogue and the music get annoying very fast and it was basically boring. <br /> <br /> Most Hammer fans agree This was one of Dracula's worst movies. His follow-up (Satantic Rites of Dracula) was the worst, and the last film by Hammer Dracula. This gets a 2 - just for Cushing and Lee.
