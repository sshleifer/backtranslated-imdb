This movie was really terrible. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth seeing, as it presents the most unnecessarily extended sex scene in the world. I mean, this went on for about 7 to 8 minutes (repeating the same 'movements' over and over again), that's almost 10% of the whole movie! I have not laughed as much as I laughed at that for a long time. <br /> <br /> There were some really weird and useless events in this movie, but the one that I found most fun was when Reason of whatever) a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run to the nearby resort end. 2 minutes later they sell out again. What the hell was that for? In addition, the small white elevator that magically changed into a huge yellow excavator was quite classic. I have been led to believe that this is because they used images from the 'carnosaur' trilogy to fix this absolute donkey. I'm going to have to see them now! <br /> <br /> It's worth watching the movie to laugh one or two, but if you do not like bad movies, get away!
