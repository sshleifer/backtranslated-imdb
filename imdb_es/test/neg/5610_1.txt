If only the writer / producer / "star" had the slightest indication of the limits of his range of action, and the way he is perceived on the screen (wearing glasses and a lateral separation is not enough to make you look ungainly and peculiar if your face and your teeth have been sculpted by various medical professionals to fit the American ideals of generic symmetry, without character, mistakenly perceived as beauty in this obsessively superficial society) he would have chosen John Heder as the main character instead of trying throw a good Will-Hunting and create a vehicle to show your ... your ... well, yourself. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast (God knows, they must be having trouble agreeing to this) is wasted in an agonizing perpetual struggle to react convincingly to a main character unable to offer even the simplest line with the right intonation, and believe me, there is no shortage of simple lines to choose from, since the dialogue seems to have been composed of a period of five years. -old. Oh, wait ... it's the same person who pretends to be a writer as an actor. It is not often that he does not see a movie until the end, but this ejaculation was irrepressible from the beginning and showed no signs of improvement after the first hour. Excrement.
