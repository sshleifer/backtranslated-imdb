One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Three immature young people have sex and talk very little, except for their "love". They do not seem interested in much but in others, and only passively. I was left with the feeling of being outside. Most of the exterior scenes take place at night, so one can not even enjoy the well-lit views of Paris! I gave up after one hour and ten minutes.
