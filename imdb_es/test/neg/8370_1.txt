It's a real big boom that people can easily make movies too because of cheap digital video cameras today. Usually, I would appreciate this possibility, but if you watch movies like this, it's a shame. and it's also a great shame if people like h.p. Lovecraft is abused by people like this. I rented this "movie" because of the drop "h.p. lovecraft" in it. and I am a big fan of many of his adaptations, mainly those made by brian yuzna and stuart gordon. This movie has nothing to deliver! A cheap landscape on a beach and in an old cellar. Digi-cam effect "red light" over the entire film. there are no actors, only some stupid models of low quality who have no idea what they are doing, rigid as wood. And that's what the director should be like. It is obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere. but as everything is so ridiculous that it just does not work. and there are no blood effects, only a little blood in a river (babies = you become a demon) and fall here and there. oh yes, the story: thousands of years ago, some "great" colonized the world and took humans as slaves. then humanity became independent, then the "old" tried to destroy them. and now there are some survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. The only possibility of saving humanity is to find the NECRONOMICON, which is where LOVECRAFT arrives. So those soldiers are fighting some undead and demons on their beach and in their hold. Amazing - the whole thing! but as it is called (German title: "Armee des Jenseits) and you can find it in most commercial video stores, it seems you can make money with things like that.
