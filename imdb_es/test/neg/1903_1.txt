Plunkett and MaCleane are two men on the road who rob the rich to give ... well, to the rich; comparatively, they are the rich. But we know they are the good guys because the guy behind the forces of law and order, Mr. Chance, is just so evil. He rapes women, or tries to do so. He hits his subordinates. He commits murder. He has bad breath. He does not shave properly. It has no fashion sense. He tortures puppy dogs. The last one is just an inference of mine: we do not actually see it torturing puppy dogs. But I'm sure he does. The villainy of Little of Chance has a lot to do with his search for Plunkett and MaCleane. It's just something he does in his free time, a kind of hobby that he dedicates to being absolutely sure that we do not like him. He should not have tried so hard. Nobody in this movie is nice. <br /> <br /> Let's take stock. Attractive characters? There is none: I think we have covered that. Swashbuckling? It is not a swash. Instead, we have a kind of heavy, dirty breathing. Script? Shine? Vigor? Everything has gone out of the way of bluffing, I'm afraid. Realism? None of that, either. I think they were TRYING for realism, since they were all so dirty, but the characters and the action had all the verisimilitude of Errol Flynn, with no sense of enthusiasm to back them up. Beauty? No Good camera work? For a television crew, maybe. Humor? You can laugh once or twice if you are in a benevolent mood. On the other hand, maybe not. Dialogue? See `humor ', above. Music? Do not even make me BEGIN with music. The music in 'Ladyhawk' was, by comparison, incredibly adequate; and at least the wrong aesthetic of that score was consistent. <br /> <br /> Ugh. I apologize to 'Ladyhawk' even for THINKING about this in this context. <br /> <br /> In short: there is a lot of positive badness here and NOTHING is good, unless I count Liv Tyler, who seems to me to be fine. doing. <br /> <br /> I feel like I just wrote a smallpox review. "Not very well," says the critic. It would be much more interesting if somehow I could DEFEND smallpox, claim that critics of smallpox have misunderstood it, but I do not know how to do it.
