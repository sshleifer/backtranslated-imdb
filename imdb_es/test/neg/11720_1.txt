This movie was not only disappointing for the suspense / horror movie lover, it was disappointing for anyone who saw it. Wow. I thought that this movie could be funny because the guy with the huge head. However, it was filled with a long and prolonged conversation that was not necessary. There was so much sex that I hate women and men now. This movie was not only boring, it had no substance. Wow. Wow. Of all this, each scene seems to have been the light of a single light bulb, and I think they used the same set for two different lawyers, a restaurant and an airport. This movie is not for the movie lover who loves bad movies because in the end, it feels like a lost time. See the movie! <br /> <br /> -party
