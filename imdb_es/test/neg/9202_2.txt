First, this movie was made in 1978. So that tells you that the movie is going to be bad anyway. But I'm not saying that all old movies are bad. Second, special effects are terrible even during that time. Finally, the performance was so bad that Bozo The Clown could have done better. It makes you wonder how people get the money to make such pathetic movies. This movie sucks!
