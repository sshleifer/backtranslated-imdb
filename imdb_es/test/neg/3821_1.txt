I read the recent comments and could not wait to see the movie. However, after sitting through 80 minutes of predictable "surprises" that did not even make me jump and be an unrealistic villain, I was very disappointed. I thought that the cartoons were the only films that were only 80 minutes long. I thought that this could be due to the editions so that it is classified as 'R', but the original only contained ten more minutes of blood type "Kill Bill". When the blood comes out like hoses, reality loses its appeal. Add to the killer that he is supposed to be a "ghost" but that he can rip someone out of the jaw (wing King Kong with the T-Rex), lives through everything and has an ending similar to the end of sopranos and Possibly Having the most overrated movie in the last year. After watching the movie I felt I had seen countless movies with the same plot and the same method and I also felt dissatisfied to a large extent. I do not know what everyone else saw, but if you want a good horror movie this weekend, look at Halloween, it's definitely worth $ 10. When it comes to Hatchet, let's hope the next one is based on the Book.
