Can you believe that a university professor made this movie? The same man who did DHOOP. <br /> <br /> The movie is horrible and has some of the strangest scenes of all time. /> <br /> The main message is nice but it is badly presented <br /> <br /> The film looks like a collage of amateur scenes, miscasts.etc and bad performances <br /> <br /> The direction and everything is poor <br /> <br /> The music is good <br /> <br /> Emraan's bad spell works and he does it well Tusshar is bad Tanushree and Isha are bad Paresh gets upset when he looks in the mirror
