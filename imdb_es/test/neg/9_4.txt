David Bryce's comments are exceptionally well written and informative, as they almost say everything I feel about DARLING LILI. This massive musical is so peculiar and exaggerated, produced in excess and must have caused ruptures in Paramount in 1970. It cost 22 million dollars! That is simply irresponsible. DARLING LILI should have been enlightened at a board meeting that said "hey we have that Pink Panther guy and the Sound Of Music girl ... let's get this too" and I handed him a blank check. The result is a hybrid of GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF A SIXPENCE, some numbers of songs and dances of MGM 40s of a style (daisies and navigators!) As old-fashioned as that of the musical papyrus and the dramas of MATA HARI. The production is colossal, exuberant, impressive to look at, but the rest: the ridiculous romance, Julie looks stunned, Hudson is already dead, the wrong comedy and the incredibly boring songs make this spectacular movie become irritating. LILI is like a mega musical from the 1940s with some vulgar fragments to give it flavor. STAR! released the previous year, unfortunately I crashed and now it is finally appreciating because the excellent film is genuinely ... and Andrews looks sublime, mature, especially in the last half hour ... but LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and I think that it really killed the mega musical binge of the 60s ... and it made Andrews look like Poppins again ... which I think was not Edwards' intention. Paramount must have fainted collectively when they saw this: and with another $ 20 million in CATCH 22, and $ 12 million in a clean day and $ 25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON ... they had a financial chasm of CLEOPATRA proportions with $ 77 millions Tied in 4 movies with very uncertain futures. Maybe they should have asked the clairvoyant Daisy Gamble of ON A CLEAR DAY ... LILI was very popular in its first immediate release in Australia and ran in 70mm theaters for months, but failed once in the submarines and the sticks and only once did it emerge after that, in one night, with ON A CLEAR DAY as a double Sunday night. Thank God, Paramount had his simple $ 1 million movie (yes, ONE MILLION DOLLARS) LOVE STORY and that $ 4 million gangster photo THE GODFATHER is also ready to recover the $ 77 million over the next two years ... for only $ 5 million. ... amazing!
