"Electra Glide in Blue" is a slow-action movie in which Blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and gets involved in a murder investigation. At best, a mediocre movie, "EG in B" presents some members of the Chicago band, a whiff of action, some philosophy, and lots of dull dramatic stuff. It's not worth the time.
