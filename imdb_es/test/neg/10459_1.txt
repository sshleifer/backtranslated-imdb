As other posters have commented, this was a very bad movie (keep it friendly for the kids) The FX class was low, they should have spent $ 1 on a coke. As is typical of these D films, most victims die and leave a mystery, except for a lucky soul and, of course, the protagonist. I hope the money was worth it for Boxleitner, really a big step from Babylon 5. It's good to see what happened to Buck Rogers, but damn it, even to him. "It was so bad and in the older actors you could even say that they thought it was bad too". Do not look. <br /> <br /> ***** Warning Spoiler below **** <br /> <br /> This thing persecuted everyone it chased and yet, Boxlietner ran away ... that was pure BS. And the end? How the hell did the kids end up there with him? That was too stupid.
