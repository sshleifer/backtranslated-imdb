Jesus Christ, what the hell happened here? This is one of the most boring movies I've seen in my life, how is it possible that they have ruined such a good idea for a movie? To tell you the truth, I was so excited about this, I thought it was like Blair Witch but with real alien creatures chasing the camera guy. Damn it, I've reduced myself to overtaking this pile of shit, and I never do that while watching movies. The high rating here on IMDb makes me believe that real aliens are giving 10 for this shit. <br /> <br /> The invasion is an invasion. The movie starts by saying that everything you're about to see is real, blahblahblah. Then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars, as if I had to believe in their nonsense to enjoy this movie. The next thing you know, I'm watching the most boring car ever filmed, in a forest at night. Is this a movie, or a ride in the Disney theme park? The first 20 minutes are a boring dialogue between police officers as they see a lawn and a straight road with a flashlight. Where the hell were the aliens? They were sleeping of course! Then we learned that the bad performance is not only reduced to the plays of high school, since the policeman behind the camera gets out of his car in search of a missing man who was "fishing" and had run into a mysterious meteorite. I wonder what's wrong with him? Out of nowhere, we see the man of the 'night fishing' walking like a zombie. The policeman is apparently too stupid to notice that something is wrong with this man. Apparently, it was really silly, since the zombie / alien injects into the policeman's ear a kind of alien parasite, turning him into an extraterrestrial. Then the police / alien returns to his car, looks for a young couple who was having sex for a while in the forest, approaches them, turns them into an extraterrestrial, and then the girl runs to the police car and escape If this quick introduction to the plot did not make him think that this movie was bad, then the next 40 minutes will do it. Watching this movie is as painful as repeatedly stabbing you with a plastic fork. The script, although it may sound interesting in the back of the DVD case, is misdirected and, unfortunately, we are left with another boring direct to the atrocity of the DVD. <br /> <br /> The only things that kept me awake were constant flashing and loud sound effects (unfortunately). If it is not enough to see the same forest path for 63 minutes, we must endure the flash techniques to "scare" the viewer and the constant weeping of a bad actress who ages and becomes annoying rather quickly. <br /> <br /> If I feel like you should rent this, I tell you, why? There are better SciFi / Horror movies out there. Even the dreaded remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is more entertaining than this. For the love of all good things, do not bother with their shit. My eyes were bleeding, and for the first time, I wanted to commit suicide. At 1/10, avoid this as a disease.
