Everyone has their choice for the "worst movie they've seen". Some like to choose Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some choose the classics as Plan 9 From outer space. Since I was 14 years old I have been very vocal when telling me that for me, it is Problem Child 2, and 9 years later, I feel exactly the same. It is not "one of the worst", it is not just an expression. It's the worst movie I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> How many farts, pooping, urinating and vomiting can you put into a single movie? I do not need to see a dog take out a trash can that goes up to my waist! Why am I so hard with this dirt? I have nothing against bathing or rough humor. Heck, I like American Pie movies. Having such an excess within 90 minutes is a bad idea, but the real turning point is doing it with the children! Making young children are called sexual names (IMDb will not even let me post that word here, but here it comes out of the mouths of 8 year olds - think about the irony of that!) And urinate and vomit on each one. another simply makes everything feel dirtier. The worst of the movie: "I guess I should throw farts in the offices of more people." <br /> <br /> What other movie do you have: peeing in lemonade, sticks of dynamite exploding toilets, a little boy filming his babysitter having sex and projecting it on one side of the house, and a little girl joking about scratching testicles ? <br /> <br /> However, my absolute favorite moment has to be when the same girl is on a carnival ride, she says: "I'm going to throw up", opens her mouth, and a fake-looking vomit goes off directly from his mouth open at a perfect 90 degree angle! The scene of vomiting in Scary Movie 2 seemed more real than that. <br /> <br /> I guess the only redeeming element in the movie is Gilbert Gottfried. You have the impression that he did not even have a script, but that he was just being his usual self. Too bad he has to act stupidly while they throw pizza at him. <br /> <br /> You know what? Thinking about the movie all this has forced me to go to the bathroom. Goodbye!
