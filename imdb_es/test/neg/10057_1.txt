Nightkill plays Robert Mitchum as a private and tired eye of the world investigating the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, the anxious wife of the missing man. What Jaclyn does not inform Mitchum is that she knows very well the whereabouts of her husband. After all, she was the one who helped her lover James Franciscus get rid of her rich husband. <br /> <br /> What else can you expect from a rotten slasher movie with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes to the west, the monkeys are mistreated, the models are based on classic cars, and Smith is constantly overshadowed by Sybil Danning until a recap of giallo style makes the whole thing rebuff. This is the bad cinema. And this movie is very poor. Makes it look like Halloween mixed with Trick Or Treats. Avoid this <br /> <br /> Rating R for Graphic Violence, Nudity and Sexual Situations.
