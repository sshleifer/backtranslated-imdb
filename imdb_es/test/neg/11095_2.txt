"An evil spirit seizes a girl and spreads panic in the Louvre museum" that's all I think, the summary of the film and the film itself! I think it's one of the worst French or non-French films ever made in the history of cinema! <br /> <br /> Here there is nothing good, except music (credits only!), some tender moments of (Sophie Marceau) and, of course, the last shot of the movie. Not because it ends in years of what it seemed. How many years have we had to see THAT GIRL but also for being as perfect as a magical CGI work that was too good to be true here! <br /> <br /> By the way, I want to change the summary of the plot to make it so: "An evil spirit seizes some film artists to make bad quality films". Just like this, sure.
