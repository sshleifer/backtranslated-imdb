It's not fair. I really hoped this was an entertaining and fun movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell by Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson has nothing to sneeze from her early classics, Airplane and the naked gun. However, after watching the Superhero movie, I'm glad I did not have to pay for it. It just would not have been close to $ 9 per ticket. More like a dollar and a few cents. Because that would sum up by the hour and a few minutes. And as disappointing as this movie was, I am glad that the execution time was so short, if not shorter. I just can not believe how incredibly vulgar, unnecessary and, above all, STUPID, some of the scenes! And on top of that, I've seen better acting from a wooden doll (without the ventriloquist). It's as if Craig Mazin would deliberately want to make a film that deserves his 3.7, if not lower, and even try to be worse than "Meet the Spartans." Very disappointing by the way.
