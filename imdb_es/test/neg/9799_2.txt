Flesh Feast begins at the Miami airport, the great reporter Dan Carter (to Harry Kerwin, also credited as a production designer) calls his partner Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) to tell him that he has just returned from South America, where he has been investigating Carl. Schuman (Doug Foster) and he had a great story, but while talking on the phone, they stab him in the back and kill him. Schuman meets with Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, also executive producer) who was recently released from a mental institution, together they discuss their grisly plans. The news of Cater's death has reached Casey and he decides to take the story himself and do a little research, well, actually, he receives his secretary Viginia Day (Marth Mischon) to do most of the research and just inform him, lazy. Virginia informs Casey that they have someone inside called Kristine (Heather Hughes), since Dr. Frederick rents her rooms to the nurses, Kristine informs Casey about the grotesque youth restoration experiments of Schuman and Dr. Frederick which involve human flesh and specially cultivated worms. ... <br /> <br /> Co, co-produced and directed by Brad F. Grinter Flesh Feast is a pretty bad movie in all aspects. First, let's start with the script by Grinter and Thomas Casey, who was also responsible for the cinematography (he feels that most of the cast and crew have more than one job), basically it's terrible. The characters are one-dimensional idiots and they have no personality, I did not like anyone in this movie. For what it's worth, I quite like some of the ideas here, the meat-eating worms, the basement lab, the corpse robbery in a hospital and the unforgettable end of 'twist' that is almost worth sitting for. rest of the movie alone. Unfortunately, the dialogue is so badly written, the rigid and unnatural sound is not true, I mean there is a scene in which a nurse says "they will not let us out of the house", which is fine, except for the fact that she is talking about. OUT in the garden to someone. No thought has been put into the story, since there is never an explanation given as to why meat-eating worms are capable of restoring youth, in fact, at a time near the end, when asked about this, Dr. Frederick states that there is no time to explain At that point, what sounds to me as if the people who wrote this did not have a clue either. Even in an extremely short time of 68 minutes, Flesh Feast is very slow and boring, bad editing does not help with scenes and shots that last too long, for example, there is a scene in which an ambulance stops outside a hospital. Up to the doors, the man goes out, walks to the back doors and opens them, etc. Do we really need to see every detail? There is also another sequence in which Dr. Frederick enters the room and puts on gloves, then removes them, enters the opposite room and puts on another pair. Personally I think that Grinter probably did not shoot enough material, so he stretches each scene as much as he can to increase the execution time. I like that strange ending, although I really do. Technically, the meat party is a complete shit, I'm not sure what the budget was, but it must have been small, very small. Almost the entire film is made in a house, Dr. Frederick's lab consists of a table, plastic cups and test tubes, an old-looking electronic medical equipment and a strange screen with funny colors (do not ask). The cinematography is bad, the music sucks and the whole movie seems bent, badly bent too. The elements of exploitation are also disappointing, there are some shots of worms, but in reality they do nothing more than wriggle a bit, there is a brief scene in which a corpse has a severed leg and a corpse dismembered with corpses and limbs that are well . on hooks. The performance is horrible on the part of all concerned, and I mean it is really bad which makes the garbage dialogue even worse. Do yourself a favor and avoid the Meat Festival, yes, there are one or two funny moments without intention and that ending is, well, the only thing that can be said, but for the most part it is a real accomplishment of amateur films that It quickly becomes painful to see. I doubt that most people will achieve it through this session, I can tolerate anything, but I even considered turning it off. Definitely one to avoid, you'll be glad you did and if you really have to see it, do not say you were not warned!
