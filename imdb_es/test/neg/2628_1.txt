Milo is a complete robbery of Mikey's 1992 film, if you really check it out, both films have the same motto. But if you want to watch an incredibly funny movie with absolutely no plot ... well, then this is the movie for you. The acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing. The story behind this atrocity is simple. Milo Jeeder is a child with serious family problems, his father is an abortionist doctor who keeps the feds not born in a jar (NICE!) And was desperate to have a child of his own, he discovered a way to bring one of these children aborted to life and called him ............. MILO !!!!! <br /> <br /> Apart from all the bad deeds, the terrible direction, the annoyance The sound of Milo's voice and the piercing sound of the bell on his bicycle, if you take away all that evil, it's still an attempt Bad but fun to make a movie. <br /> <br /> I'll give you an attack in the bank 1 of 10
