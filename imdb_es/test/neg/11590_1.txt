Where do I start? First, the story sucks. The performance sucks, the effects really stink, I guess I'll start with the story. The history of Komodo vs. Cobra: number one, does not explain how or when they got there or Komodo does not charge it. Or for that matter, how it was created. The performance: TERRIBLE! It seems that the director has just removed a few people from the street (which is probably what he did). And last and definitely the least, the effects: they are so horrible that the komodo does not even look like a komodo, just a dinosaur, which seems incredibly unrealistic. The water does not even move when the cobra appears. With all: terrible piece of shit, do not even think about renting it.
