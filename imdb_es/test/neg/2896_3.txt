I am also fond of science fiction, among other genres, and I especially like those films of the 60s and 70s with their premise of "ideas about effects" that produced so many smart and pleasant stories put on the screen. In short, I completely agree with the scott-886 review of this movie. I heard about this film, and being what I mentioned earlier, an SF fan of the 60s and 70s, with a predilection for SF stories with the Twilight Zone touch, I expected a lot, and my expectations increased with criticism that They classified the effects of this film "second best" to "2001 Space Odyssey" by Kubrick. What fraud. "Journey to the other side of the sun," was an ordinary film, convoluted, half-baked, ridiculous looking, with special effects of ridiculous fondness (and remember that I love the films of that time and contempt of CGI), and you can compare completely with Disasters in the decade of the 60, like "Marooned", that "Journey" reminded me a lot. The idea behind all this is not so bad, but in constructing the storyline of a twin planet to Earth, in which the same world is reversed, a teacher like Kubrick was asked to direct it. The needles to say that Robert Parish is nothing like that, so he presented a boring and silly movie, which looked and felt like a matinee TV series from those days. It's not worth wasting your time, even if you're an absolute fan of the genre.
