I can imagine the writers of this story thinking about this script: <br /> <br /> 1. Let's make a serial killer movie like Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat and Silence of the Lambs. People like the things of serial killers. It will be sold ... 2. The killer needs to adopt some kind of pattern. I know; he will copy it from a serial killer mystery novel. That has not been done yet, at least not exactly like that. 3. Now, we need some kind of way to make this movie unique; Of course, the good guy can be in bed like in the back window. 4. Finally, we need a turnaround that will give this movie the success of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects. <br /> <br /> Ok, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie, so do not waste your money. One thing I really hate about filmmakers is that they take a perfectly good concept for movies and take them completely to the ground. I wrote better stories than when I was in high school. I kept checking my watch every five minutes. When the end of the turn finally came, I was not surprised, I just said, "Oh, who cares?" The characters are two-dimensional. They have your typical movie personalities. This movie is just proof that stealing items from other successful movies is not an excuse for a bad script. I give this movie 1 out of 10. Normally, I would win at least 2 or 3, but I'm so sick of originality. When will they learn? 1/10
