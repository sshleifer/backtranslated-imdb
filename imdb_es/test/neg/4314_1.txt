Opie, Tom Gilson, was my brother, so I went to see the movie and I never saw her again in all these years. Sorry! that was wrong. They told me that I have to write 10 lines, so I'll put a little curiosity. Tom and Tuesday Weld were to be "presented" in this image and Tom was told to take the premiere on Tuesday, but Tom said no. with Joan Collins, and he did it and because he did it only on Tuesday Weld showed up. I found this very funny then and I still do it. The film, although the concept was fun, and the actors in it were impressive, but somehow they just did not come out funny. The continuity was abstract, at best, it was as if I was watching 2 different movies at the same time. the time, each one colliding with the other. I'm sorry, bob gilson
