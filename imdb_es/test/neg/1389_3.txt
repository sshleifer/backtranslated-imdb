I am surprised that the comparison between Mind of Mencia and the TV show The Awful Truth, which was published a few years ago, has not yet been made. With the controversial director Michael Moore, the show would begin, in exactly the same way as this show, with Moore interacting with the audience and introducing segments, namely short documentaries and dramas, which had been drawn up in an attempt to provoke current thoughts. . The difference? Mencia rarely deepens beyond the superficial and the reactionary. What he says and does is often complacent and rude, and insults the ability of his audience to make decisions for themselves. There is a difference between being "nervous", with which I have no problem, but Mencia tries too hard to achieve it, and ends up being arrogant and with little support. However, it does make points occasionally, but often, to get to them, one has to sit through some attempt to stun humor.
