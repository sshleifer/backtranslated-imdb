Eghads, what a bad movie. Tart is perhaps the worst movie I've seen all year, and I've come across some of those things. There is nothing that redeems about this garbage, from the characterization to the address to the plot. Even the generally brilliant Dominique Swain could not save this movie. None of the characters is sympathetic in the least, with the possible exception of Eloise (beautifully portrayed by Lacey Chabert, the only bright spot in this terrible failure). <br /> <br /> ******* Possible Spoilers ******** <br /> <br /> The main problem with Tart is that he rambles without saying anything. It staggers over drunks instead of guiding us down the path of history. It also introduces numerous potentially tempting details (the hypochondriac brother, the mother's possessions that are constantly recovered, the anti-Semitic classmate, the other classmate's murderous father) without successfully exploring just one of them. And just when I finally thought there might be some kind of resolution for the characters, the movie has an unexpectedly violent ending. <br /> <br /> I left the movie with the feeling that it was trying to tell me something, but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated. This is an obvious first film by a writer / director who really needs to spend a lot more time working with more established filmmakers before continuing to work in an unsuspecting audience. <br /> <br /> I gave her this movie 1 out of 10, and I'm usually very generous, even with bad movies.
