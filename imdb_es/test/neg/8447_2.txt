The film is ideal for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and more birds. Only 1 piranha. Beautiful scenery The only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end when the Caribbean drowns is a definitive Hollywood proposal. There is no definite plot. It passes from the Venezuelan scene to an easy rider robbery to the extraction of diamonds and to a ruthless hunter who goes crazy for some reason, who finally gets it. A very low budget movie that could have been filmed anywhere with footage from Venezuela. William Smith is a very talented actor who has made some very good films. Like all actors, everyone needs to have at least one bad movie. Do not waste the $ 5.00 on the DVD.
