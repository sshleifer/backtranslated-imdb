This movie is so daring that it does not try to hide its similarities with The Shining. It lacks the originality to do it. And when he does, near the end, he tries to cover up his story that "the father goes crazy under the influence of a haunted house in a strange place," by bowing to many other established conventions and ideas. In other words, it is reduced to a mere clich√©. But hell, even I enjoy a good horror or a predictable thriller whenever there is an interesting story, full of violence and gore, somewhere before the film takes a terrible turn towards the predictable and trite. Well, this movie does not have a good story and it disappointed me a lot. What 'Darkness' has in its favor is an extraordinary direction and cinematography. It is a well-shot and carefully constructed film, full of fun, angles and spooky shots. What 'Darkness' does not have in its favor is almost everything else. To start with a small objection: the editing in this movie is unpleasant. Jumps from one scene to the next, sometimes without meaning. For example, the old man in the movie (who practically carries the background story, then filled in by another character) is underlined by a hamster who runs circles. I mean, it looks good the first time, but why keep using the same image? I suppose you should see it for yourself, to understand what I mean. Another problem with this film is the character of Anna Paquin, who essentially complains throughout the film, crying and worrying too much about everything: it is the unsuccessful attempt of the film for a horror film directed by a character. The film has scenes of exaggerated sentimentality and the family drama it represents is simply not credible. In the end, 'Darkness' is a confusing melodrama, with a mystery without implications provided with a too simple ending. And it's just scary.
