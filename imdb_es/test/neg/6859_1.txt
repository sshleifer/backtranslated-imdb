I've been watching "LOST" with my family since the first episode, it used to be great. The last season was very disappointing, it seems that they (the writers) do not know what to do with the program, therefore, they are still trying to compensate by stretching a story line in an entire episode. The current season, which by the way I decided to continue watching only to see Rodrigo Santoro, and also with a small hope that things would improve; It has been one disappointment after another; my husband and my son even stopped looking. First, he (Santoro) only appears for 30 seconds in each episode. But the real problem is with the story line, there is NOTHING REALLY HAPPENING, each episode could be shown in 15 minutes. We see each episode waiting for something that never happens; I'm not asking you to reveal all the secrets at once, but what about some variation in the story lines? In the first and second season, we had different story lines, we saw the story of the characters, a bit of action, a bit of romance, now it's like a big event that takes the whole episode to reveal. It is almost tired to see it, when it ends, you have the feeling of having wasted time. Now, it's important to keep in mind that the actors are still great. I can not believe they killed Mr. Eko (Adelawale ...) he was great, Jack (Mathew Fox) is still amazing, the perfect hero, so kind, magnanimous, brave. Sawyer (Josh Holloway), the "bad guy" is softening because of Kate (Evangeline Lylli), but that's great. I miss Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Sun and Jin (Yoon-jin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim), they are all an important part of the plot (or should be), but we hardly see them. I hope that Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) has a large part in the program; If not, why was it so important to join the program (Access Hollywood, etc.)? I'm sorry if I've been rumbling for too long, but I feel cheated by this show. When I started watching it, it was great, I got used to it, and now it's very disappointing to see how it goes. I will be here, waiting for the improvements !!! Katia
