Unusually cool and silly drama by director Sydney Pollack. The soapy plot revolves around an adulterous couple who perishes in a plane crash, leaving their spouses to meet each other and connect at their own intimate level. The writing of romantic novels has a slow treatment, although I thought that the performances of Harrison Ford and Kristen Scott-Thomas were fine. The production of Slick is interesting, although the plot continues to cover the same terrain and never generates any emotional impulse. As a result, the climax at the airport is a big 'So what?'
