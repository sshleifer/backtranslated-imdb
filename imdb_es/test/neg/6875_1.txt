In this film, everything possible was wrong and I do not know why I bothered to see it until the end. It would have been more fun to see the paint dry. To shout loudly I even liked the D-Tox and it was much better than this. Here is the basic plot for you: A hick is bitten by snakes that hold the evil of 13 murderers and turns into a machine of undead that kills adolescents who have no personality. During the film I lost hope when it did not scare me at all, when the murders were bad and there were BAD CGI blood and CGI snakes. It got worse with the thin cardboard characters that killed her friend by holding her legs and not letting go, so she was traversed by a tree and when the bad man moved underwater like the shark in Jaws. I'm still upset so I even bothered with this. I guess because I'm a fan of horror movies.
