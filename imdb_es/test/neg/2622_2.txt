I watched the first episodes recently and I felt I could not take it anymore. The horrible scenes of struggle are the worst I've seen in my life. Approximately one third of each episode is dedicated to Flash Gordon and his "powerful" fighting movements. I know that the fight choreography of that time is not exactly the same as the current standards, but this is ridiculous. They do not even try to make it look realistic. Flash Gordon, who almost does not look like a fighter, uses his slow and drunken movements and his bare fist to knock out four or five guys with knives, guns and other weapons. Give me a break! There is also a scene in which he does a similar act while he is in the water. Basically, each episode has scenes similar to that. As for the rest of the episode, I do not remember much more. I basically saw it out of curiosity about how science fiction looked 70 years ago.
