I did it and I lost two and a half hours of my life that I will never be able to recover. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have no idea what critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can not appreciate "art". I love a good movie with deep messages, brilliant cinematography and a great direction. <br /> <br /> This movie is not one of them. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about this movie is that it is so horribly slow, to the point of boring the audience to death. On the other hand, dialogue sequences pass too quickly and there is not enough exposure for people who have not read the book to know what is happening (my mother took pity on me and explained everything to me before seeing it). Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and for the end? <br /> <br /> Let me break it down for you: (Spoilers everywhere) <br /> <br /> For the first two minutes, you are presented with a black screen without music, waiting for the real movie . start. <br /> <br /> During the next minute and a half, you will see several images of sunrises and savanna landscapes. How the audience could not figure out how to set up the scene unless they saw the establishment plan three or four times. <br /> <br /> The next eleven minutes are busy with the grumpy monkeys. They fight, they see the monolith, they fight a little more, they wield things with a bone. They are supposedly prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the singing of the monolith. Not that you could say if you had not read the book. <br /> <br /> * Finally * we get into space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of boats that turn slowly towards the Blue Danube Waltz (a waltz quite fast, as I understand it, but here I find it absolutely agonizing). At last we have a harmless dialogue and a rather cryptic exposition about the government that does not allow people to fall on the moon. We stayed to ask about this for another fourteen minutes of Blue Danube and spinning boats and camera tricks with anti-gravity. <br /> <br /> Next, four minutes of watching a ship travel on the surface of the moon and dock in a space station. We have a little more exposure in the next boardroom scene. Then we went back outside, traveling at a snail's pace on the moon. A second monolith is revealed, which re-fills our ears with that horrible sound (I had no idea it was a real piece of music!). The monolith makes its little light show and then the plot jumps forward. <br /> <br /> * Seven * minutes of observation of Jupiter's trip to the ship. By now, my brain had turned to mush. Could it be moving slower? It may be "realistic" to represent it as such, but we do not yet need to see five or six different takes of the same to understand the concept of its "realism." Let me tell you about this "realism"; I was glad when the secondary character of astronaut died. Not because I'm a sadist and I like to see people die, but because, after five minutes, I was so upset by the sound of his damn breathing! I'm supposed to worry about this character, feel him when he dies! Instead, I found myself waiting for a happy silence in any way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, now we come to the most interesting part of the movie: the part with HAL. Forget Dave, the protagonist of the wooden stick. The real star of the show is that kind of computer, coldly impersonal, creepy, evil and mercilessly ruthless. He's fine. And the sequence of "Open the doors of the bay" is wonderful. But it is too short. And it's not long before the director once again becomes too long events. <br /> <br /> Four minutes for HAL to die. And he dies he does it. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence with each minute, each time he lowers his voice, singing "Daisy, Daisy", all with a low and constant whistle that becomes as annoying as heavy breathing. <br /> <br /> Seven minutes Flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could feel my brain melting and dripping from my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing more than the psychedelic version of a space trip of a guy, again with that damned chorus three times! We have the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why lengthen it so long? Unless he wants to make LSD users go psychotic and have flashbacks. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to explain the ending, especially since I do not understand it. He is supposedly in an extraterrestrial research lab and is being taught deep and deep things as he sees himself aging more and more and then sending him back to Earth as a cosmic baby from the celestial space. None of this appears in the movie. As far as you know, it's just a sequence of images without any purpose or plot. Much of the movie felt that way. <br /> <br /> The first time I tried to watch this movie I gave up in half. The second time I suffered this painful excuse for a movie, it was to help my sister to program the sequences to see how long they lasted. It's that boring. <br /> <br /> Call this movie "art" if you wish. I would not. I've seen more interesting "art" in the local museum. And I will never submit to this kind of suffering anymore.
