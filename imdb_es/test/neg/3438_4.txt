!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> With the exception of THE TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL, I do not think Arnie's action / adventure films are too much. They are better than their comedies, but that does not say much. The problem I have with their great successes of action is that they are exaggerated and lack some kind of morality. <br /> <br /> Morality? I mentioned in my review of TERMINATOR 2 the scene where the good guy Terminator blows the swat of the SWAT team. Should we think that because the hero makes people do their job instead of killing them, we will admire it in some way? This is the problem with ERASER, when the character of James Cann is revealed as a traitor within the US Marshal department. The character of Arnie, John Kruger, flees with a witness who is protecting, but in several later sequences, Kruger kills a rather large person. Number of marshals working with the villain. We assume that they were all traitors too? Surely many of them were honest men trying to stop Kruger because the bad boy told them that Kruger was the traitor. It is a little uncomfortable to think that Kruger killed several people who tried to defend the law. <br /> <br /> Although it cost a hundred million dollars, the special effects are not so impressive. Look at the scene where Kruger releases the jet wing and hurries to put on a parachute. It is obvious that as the action gets in the way, it is a specialist who performs the free fall sequence while Arnie is in a studio in front of a blue screen. ERASER is also a film that has an unnecessary CGI with murderous alligators, not just an unnecessary CGI but also an unconvincing CGI. There are also some holes in the plot, like in the opening scene that involves a couple of witness protection people that the Mafia has reached. Kruger opens the trunk of a car, takes out a couple of bodies and starts a fire, thus releasing the smell peat. Kruger is then seen rearranging the dental records through the computer of the couple he has saved. It would be logical to do this, but would ALL couples' dental records be kept on the computer? The most important thing of all is that we must believe that the US Marshal department. UU It has a freezer full of bodies for such events. <br /> <br /> So there you are, a typical Arnie thriller with many unlikely pieces and little intelligence. and it is interesting to note that ERASER did not make big profits at the box office, since production costs almost surpass a potential audience figure. After ERASER, Arnie did not do much more business at the box office, except TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, which was a film of events and it will be interesting to see if he will be remembered as a politician instead of a movie star.
