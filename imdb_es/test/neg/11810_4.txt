The "Baseball" by Ken Burns is a decent documentary ... it presents a clear origin of the game, a great representation of the early years and the heroes of baseball. There is a lot in this movie for any baseball fan ... having said that, the film has several obvious flaws. <br /> <br /> 18 hours is simply too much for human attention. It is clear that Burns extended his film to fit his "nine entries" concept. It's not even a tight 18 hours ... the rhythm in each segment is slow, almost dreary ... the music is always nostalgic and melancholy. Is baseball never exciting and fun? Why each player and his achievements are presented in the form of tragedy? Talking to the head after talking to the head, turning each throw into emotional pain, talking about baseball as a metaphor, baseball as an American, baseball psychology and theology ... enough! This is syrupy, silly fool. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Hokum Yankee that he sold us before. Ken Burns uses the National Anthem as the main theme of the series, and he manages to play "Take Me Out To The Ballgame" so many times that you could throw up. We understand, friend. <br /> <br /> Clearly Burns is a false-liberal neo-Hollywood, so he probably spends a third of the film in the black leagues ... these segments are spent in punishing yesterday's targets by not being as open as Kenny today. To shame! He rebukes baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties, but he does not realize that America was segregated in those times. Burns falls madly in love with Buck O'Neil, a former black leagues player, and drools every piece of video in which the elderly O'Neil is poetic about his playing days. Nonsense ... <br /> <br /> Burns would have been better with an adult to help him reduce his creation. The "baseball" ends as a soft propaganda, full of bugs and civil rights disguised as American. It's clear that Burns is not a baseball fan ... otherwise, he would know we see games laughing and screaming, not crying and reciting soliloquies ... are you listening, Mr. Burns? There is no crying in baseball.
