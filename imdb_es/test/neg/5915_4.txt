Produced at a point in his career, where he had the juice of doing what he wanted, Eddie Murphy took on the task of producing, directing, co-writing and starring in HARLEM NIGHTS, a costly but ultimately empty gangster saga on a group of nightclub owners / black gangsters who run a fancy club during the 1930s, led by a big shootout (Eddie Murphy) and his adoptive father (Richard Pryor) and their attempts to avoid being dominated by white gangsters who think they are taking the control of the territory. who, apparently, think they are legitimately yours, simply by virtue of their color. This was an idea that probably looked good on paper, but definitely lost something in the translation. This was a piece of vanity for Eddie and I think he stretches a little too thin here trying to be the whole show here. It's true that it was a pleasure to see Murphy and Pryor together on the screen, but the rest of the great supporting cast, including Arsenio Hall, Redd Foxx, Della Reese, Michael Lerner, Danny Aiello, Jasmine Guy, Thomas Mikal Ford, Stan Shaw and Eddie's brother, he's really given very little to do (although I admit that the scene of Murphy's fight with Della Reese is hysterically funny and probably the best scene in the movie). Murphy clearly poured a lot of money into this movie and a good part of it is shown on the screen. The art and overall direction are impressive and the impressive costumes should have won an Oscar, but this was a big mistake for Eddie, as he definitely tried to wear too many hats.
