This film begins in A and never reaches B. Its title promises much more than what the film offers. It is superficial and full of the usual clich√©s of a story in which a boy questions his sexuality. The people are nice, even the extravagant compulsory type. The leader (Kevin McKidd) overreacts to the extent that there is a reason for him to act. Simon Callow, playing a horny straight, is always worth seeing, and he is, by far, the only reason to stay with the movie. However, the rubbish about the "meditations" of your group of men or whatever it is becomes extremely boring in a short time. It seems that they have been thrown into the smooth mix of the film in a wrong effort to vary the scenery and inaction without stopping. The same comment applies to a really strange and unconvincing camping trip. Do not worry about pausing the tape so you can eat something. Let the thing run; You will not lose anything. The character of Hugo Weaving is superfluous. It appears in a sequence with one of the minor tracks and does not even meet the rest. The result of that sequence is not explained, and Hugo's real estate transactions have nothing to do with history. The film is a total disappointment in the end, because there is no resolution. The thing simply fades away and they send us to closing credits. This is an interlude without structure.
