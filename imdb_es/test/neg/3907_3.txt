How are stories made so bad? That is not a question. It is a statement. <br /> <br /> Here are my problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Much of the development of the story was predictable and boring. My emotions ran more or less in a flat line in everything. There really was not much to attract the viewer to the movie. <br /> <br /> 2) The characters were decidedly uncharismatic. One was crazy, another was confusing, and the third was very boring. There was absolutely no reason to be attracted to these people. Even though I knew it was not going to happen, I was still waiting for them to meet someone else, someone more interesting. <br /> <br /> 3) The physical environment was uncomfortable for me. Â¿A trailer ??? In the desert??? The desert is a place that most people prefer not to visit. How is it that these three people end up in the desert ??? <br /> <br /> 4) And in the same desert. Did the writer really expect that he believed that the last three people on Earth would meet each other in the course of a few weeks in that desert? <br /> <br /> 5) Was it really necessary for Mrs. Ryan to be in two scenes that required a swimsuit? Hey, it looks great, but it was pretty free. <br /> <br /> Well, then, if I thought it was so bad, why did I give it a 3? I'm trying to be as objective as possible. Although I found Alan annoying, I must say that David Arnott did a very credible job of portraying a neurotic nerd (the character reminded me of some of Albert Brooks' most annoying papers). Jeri Ryan tried to do something with Sarah, but it just was not written very well. Well, she was supposed to be a confused and dysfunctional woman. But why? What did you add to the story? Their mood swings made me feel as if they were shaking me (strongly!) One way and then another and then another. <br /> <br /> I do not usually leave the movies, but this time I contemplated myself several times. Rigid, predictable, boring. Proceed at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My 2 cents.
