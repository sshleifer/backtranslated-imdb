Two years after leaving the small town of Grover's Bend for meeting the Krites, Brad Brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for Easter. Meanwhile, Krite's eggs begin to hatch. While causing problems in the city, Brown and the townspeople, as well as extraterrestrial bounty hunters who have returned to do away with the creatures, must fight the bloodthirsty before destroying the city. <br /> <br /> The original Critters It was a minor attempt to defraud the family horror movie "Gremlins". He became one of the cult favorites on video shelves and was successful enough to guarantee a sequel. This sequel minimizes horror and makes its full-focus comedy in its place. Unfortunately the comedy part is extremely clumsy, as well as childish. The performance is on par with the rest of the movie. It's just that the movie suffers from a weak script. The visual effects are pretty well done. <br /> <br /> Grade: D + Revision by M. K. Geist.
