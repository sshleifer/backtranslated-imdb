I have noticed that many of the films that have been presented in "Mystery Science Theater" have received a lot of low ratings in IMDb. However, some of the films that appeared in the films were not so bad and it is not fair to qualify a film that has been given the "MST" treatment, with the presenters making funny comments during the film. Now I'm not saying "The Girl in Lover's Lane" is a great movie, but it's not bad enough to deserve your current IMDb score of 2.1. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the meeting of Bix and Danny. Bix is ​​a veteran drifter and Danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to be wandering around the country. Once they arrive in a small town, Bix needs to rescue Danny again and again because Danny is quite naive, a good way to say that he has the intellect of a tomato. <br /> <br /> On the way, something happens Bix, sure of himself, finds a good girl and finds the attractiveness of staying pulling him. And, in a strange secondary argument, Jack Elam plays a super creepy sick who wanders around the city scaring everyone, but curiously, the police do not seem to pay much attention and nobody on their own does anything for him. . Ultimately, however, when Elam puts the moves on a girl for whom Bix is ​​falling in love, things start to boil. <br /> <br /> In general, although it was not a great movie, there were many interesting elements of the plot in this film - enough to deserve a score higher than 2.1. The most important negative aspects are a simplistic conclusion of the mystery that occurs near the end, as well as Danny's total stupidity once too often. However, considering the minuscule budget, it is a small visible movie.
