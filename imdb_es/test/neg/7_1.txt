The legendary fiasco of Blake Edwards, begins to seem useless after only 10 minutes. A combination of The Eagle Has Landed, Star!, Oh! What a Lovely War!, And Edwards' Pink Panther movies, Darling Lili never attracts the viewer; The aerial sequences, the musical numbers, the romance, the comedy and the espionage are all buzzing. At what point is the viewer supposed to care? This disaster fluctuates in tone, never decides what it wants to be, and apparently thinks it is a parody, but it is square and pathetic. Out of fashion in the worst sense, the public understandably stayed away in droves. It is awful. James Garner would have been a great improvement over Hudson, which is only cardboard, and does not connect with Andrews and vice versa. And Andrews and Hudson do not seem to have been told the joke and act with a badly calculated seriousness. Blake Edwards' SOB is not much more than correct, but it is the only good that has come out of Darling Lili. The expensive and professional aspect of much of Darling Lili, only makes what is lavished all the more difficult to bear. To quote Paramount boss Robert Evans, "24 million dollars in film and no image."
