I bought this movie on DVD for Â£ 4, but it was a waste, the movie is very bad. The plot is your average monster movie, where it kills a few people, the mayor / boss does not believe it and they fight at the end. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the quality of the film is very good, and the New York stage is impressive for a budget movie, rather than a small coastal city. The acting is also reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, the special effects, main stage in a monster movie, are ridiculous and the addition of a random busload of children to the plot midway simply becomes rare. The end is bad. <br /> <br /> In short, every time you have the opportunity to see this, there will be no better. <br /> <br /> RTC "Real horror movies I do not have a PG rating"
