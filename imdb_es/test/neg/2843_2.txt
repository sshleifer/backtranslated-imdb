At first I thought this was supposed to be a comedy / horror when I saw the body in the bathtub with the lady standing there screaming over and over again, but as the film progressed, it became flatter and flatter. . The plot was ridiculous with an annoying man because the real estate prices have gone up, so now he decides to call a radio psychiatrist and babble his rage because he has nothing better to do. Then, the law gets involved and tries desperately to make us feel that they really care who the caller is and they try hard to track this guy. One suspect after another are accused. This movie is terrible and the slow moving love scenes of Adrian B. and her husband are boring and they have made the movie move forward. Avoid it!
