From English accents to violence so unnecessary after violence. Showing Moses as a murderer. People who really believe in the Old Testament will sit there and shake their heads. I am not a religious person at all. But I even felt as if the writers of this film were trying to turn us all against God and the Jews. When Moses took that rock and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for committing adultery. He wanted to stone the writers. I can not believe in this time that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) try to show as much crap as this one. Do not we already have enough problems in this world?
