I finished seeing Mandy Lane about an hour ago, and I felt the need to go straight home and come here to warn anyone who is about to spend money on the DVD. DO NOT. <br /> <br /> The secondary characters are superficial, the failure of the performance is greater than that of Matthew McConaughey's films, and until the final turn, the plot is anything but obvious. In nine out of ten, you can see the next scene 5 minutes before it starts. The whole movie is more or less without motive or message, and the half-revelation of the "murderer" simply clarifies the little interest that could have left at that time. What could have saved this superficial and tedious film is a decent splash, or at least a sangria worthy of the genre "Slasher". It also fails there. <br /> <br /> If you need a background movie for a party that you can enter and leave without missing anything, I recommend you buy Mandy Lane from All The Boys Love. <br /> <br /> If you are looking to sit and really concentrate on the screen for more than 15 seconds, I do not.
