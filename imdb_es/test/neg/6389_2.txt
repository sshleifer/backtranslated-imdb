This puddle of derivative nonsense was stolen from every Soviet memoir and failed miserably. I was left with an experience of everything that is wrong with organized religion in general and the particular deficiencies of the Russian Orthodox Church (keep in mind that this comment comes from a person of faith). Even exceptional cinematography left me without inspiration. I spent his most beautiful moments very aware of the masterpieces that he imitated badly. I would not recommend watching this movie unless you have a deep passion for the Russian Orthodox Church, its monastic traditions, the miracles before communism and the saints of the seventies. It's a meaningless film from (and on) a narrow perspective that did absolutely nothing for me.
