This movie does not even have the salvation of being so bad that it's good. It is really scary. It is closer to an ironic parody than a film about disasters, but unfortunately, they were serious. Made for television, but not even worthy of that. It contains every clich√© and corny plot moment you can imagine. Oh, will it save the people from the flood? Will his wife admit that he still loves him? Will they escape before the flood drowns them? I can not explain how bad this is. A horrible and predictable plot that makes you shudder is so corny. Bad effects (although to be fair I have seen worse superimposed bubbling waters). Bad script Sorry attitude. Horrible. So bad, in fact, that you should probably get drunk and see it.
