There was no 0 in the voting option, so I was forced to use the next available figure. <br /> <br /> It's a sad day for Bollywood when this kind of movies that have star actors is nothing more. they are more than a bunch of juvenile performances and a horrible script. <br /> <br /> This movie can not be called Hitch's clone. Salman Khan with his usual theme of taking off your shirt and Govinda with his funny laughs. If someone had told me two decades ago that I would be writing a commentary on Salman (after his success with Maine Pyar Kiya), I would have discarded it.
