I saw this DVD for sale and I bought it without thinking twice, despite not having known, because this is one of my favorite books of all time. As soon as I got home, I ran to see him and I was completely disappointed. While it is true that this movie is based on the book, the similarities end there. The characters are changed (that is, Finny looks more like a pompous imbecile than anything else, while Gene seems to be something like a mound), the scenes are misplaced or completely changed (ie, Lepper), many characters are missing and famous lines / thoughts are missing. The film tries to portray some feeling that was missing from the previous one, but it is done in a dismal way that makes for a boring flat movie. It is the depth of character and feeling that makes the book so classic and this film takes those things and completely destroys them in their rewriting.
