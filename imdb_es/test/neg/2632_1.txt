This movie is so bad that I could not even see the ending. Milo's voice was too low and I could not understand what he said as well as some of Kendra's lines. Also, where did you get all these wedding dresses? It was very impractical. The film did not give details about Milo's drowning and how he made people ridicule Dr. Jeter and his practice. In general, I was disappointed that I could not give this film a rating of zero because by rating this movie as one, I felt I was giving undeserved praise.
