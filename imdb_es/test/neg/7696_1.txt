This is a fact that this is the first Saudi feature film shown in movie theaters but not in Saudi Arabia for a simple reason that we do not have movie theaters in our great kingdom ... not just a movie theater! The government banned movie theaters after the Islamic extremists or the religious police (or both) called for it to be closed in the late 70s and early 80s, accusing the seventh art of promoting wrong sex and things like that. .. I do not do it. I do not see a powerful reason why we do not open cinemas! ... we have many video stores throughout the kingdom, we watch movies on television from some satellite channels, we can install the "Showtime" channels and, after all, movies in general seem harmless in many ways. to neighboring countries just to watch a couple of movies ... I personally went to Bahrain several times just to watch movies in theaters because watching it is a lot of fun as opposed to watching a movie at home. The Saudis pay the most expensive movie ticket in the world, we travel to see movies, while the rest of the world has movie theaters in each city. This is one of the problems we are having! .. <br /> <br /> The film is produced and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment, which is an important company that belongs to the Saudi magnate prince Alwaleed Bin Talal (the eighth richest man in the world). <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is a word that literally means "how are you?" but it is also a jargon that means "what happens!", sometimes it is used as a jargon to say "bad" about something and sometimes it is used as a jargon to tell someone to take care of their affairs and not interfere in the affairs of another person. Anyway, I think they wanted to say (how are you?) And (what's wrong!) At the same time, I could be wrong. <br /> <br /> The male actors are from Saudi Arabia as Hisham Abdulrahman, who is very famous and has some popularity after winning the 1st prize in the Arabian realty show more like "American Idol", works in some programs TV as the Arabic version of "Cash Taxi" ... the other famous actor is Khaled Sami, who is funny and has a very good sense of humor ... other actors like Mishal Al-Mutairi, Turki Al-Yusuf and Ali Al Sabea are less famous and work in some television series. The female actresses are not Saudi and did a very good job with the Saudi accent ... Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan in the lead role and actress emerita Fatima Al-Hawsani ... it's not that we do not have Saudi actresses, but we are few and not that good. <br /> <br /> A Saudi critic "Rja Al-Mutairi" who writes for the Alriyadh newspaper (the kingdom's most popular newspaper) wrote about this saying: "We did not expect much of the first Saudi feature film. Therefore, we can not judge him according to the usual standards like any other film.It is a fact that the film was a great financial success in its first days of opening only in the Kingdom of Bahrain .The film is recent and it is about Saudi family that deals (interacts) with new and controversial issues within Saudi society such as: women driving cars, shallow thoughts about the arts, the tutelage of society by a certain group and the differences between being conservative and being a The ideas are good but you feel that you are lost in the middle of the movie.One of the advantages of the film is the beautiful music of Rajeh Dawood that was good, but sometimes it does not coincide or express what is in the image. Turki Al-Yusuf did a great job ... his performance was the best along with Mais Hamdan ... the biggest loser is the main actor Hisham Abdulrahman who was behind the secondary actors Mishal Al-Mutairi, Ali Al Sabea and Khaled Sami who did Good work within the limits of their roles. <br /> <br /> after all, "Keif al-hal?" even with all its disadvantages, it's still a good movie and it's a very good first step of Rotana ... and the film became the speech of people and streets, which is a golden goal to make a strong debate within the Saudi society about movies in general. until they become aware of the importance of the seventh art and other arts "<br /> <br /> PS: There is another Saudi filmmaker" Abdullah Almohaisen "who says he directed the first Saudi film entitled" Shadows of Silence ". <br / > <br /> I have not seen the movie yet ... I hope I have been useful.
