To avoid getting bored during "Love and Sex", I first tried to think about all the films in question: "Breaking Up" with Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek (although it had a more original ending), "About Last Night" With Rob Lowe, and many television shows. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I was admiring how beautiful Framke Janssen is, so I could not believe, for a nanosecond, that she might have trouble getting an appointment. It is certainly in line to give Julia Roberts a race for her money, literally, and was not Julia in a movie with this same argument or another? <br /> <br /> Third was trying to find out why the writer / director bothered to give the character of Jon Favreau the Jewish name of Adam Levy; he even refers with admiration to eating a ham sandwich. <br /> <br /> Fourth, I was trying to find out why some critics had given him a good review, that's why I was in the theater. <br /> <br /> (originally written 2/2/2000)
