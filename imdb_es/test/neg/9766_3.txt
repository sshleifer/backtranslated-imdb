I do not care what they say, this movie is hilarious! It combines the somber seriousness of Threads with an anarchic mix of alternative comedy, and the results are a harshly dark but outrageously amusing satire on the control policies of both the western and eastern blocks at that time. You must give the filmmakers credit even for trying to overcome the real-life craze of "Duck and cover" or "Protect and survive"! <br /> <br /> Imagine someone made a movie based on Dead Kennedys' 'Kinky Sex Gakes The World Go Round' song, and you're very close to Whoops! Apocalypse. Add Rik Mayall in the best way as an insane commander of OTT SAS and he will have it exactly. A worthy piece of company for Dr. Strangelove, and that's saying something.
