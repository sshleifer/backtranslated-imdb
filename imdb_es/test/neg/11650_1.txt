I'm sorry, but this really feels like an imitation of the modern Apollo 13. Totally unlikely (at least Armageddon felt like a comic book!) This felt like a bad High School film project, acting as the cliché one can get, and ... landing a space shuttle on a Los Angeles freeway ? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking? And all the clichés: the wife of the pregnant astronaut, the meddling reporter who gets in the way of everyone, the unconditional manager of "Go Fever". And one thing is to twist the laws of physics or politics or whatever to make an entertaining story, but at least to do it GOOD! Fact and science were totally destroyed by this. The space shuttle does not have fuel tanks in its wings, and even if it did, it could not turn around moving the fuel between them (and neither did a DC-10). <br /> <br /> If you want bad acting, bad narrative, low realism and corny cliches, this can not be surpassed!
