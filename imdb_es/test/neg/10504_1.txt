This movie was pathetically horrible. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating. If you have a life, do not watch this movie, because you will want to commit suicide. This film totally blast Blade (which is undoubtedly a really good movie ... or trilogy, I must say). <br /> <br /> I do not care who the actors are, this movie is just horrible. I watched 10 minutes of that and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely bad this movie is. Actually I do not know why my family is still watching him ... oh, wait, yes, I know. They laugh almost nonstop at the stupid action, the dialogue and the acting.
