A group of teenagers of showers go up to an old mining town with the hope of finding nuggets of gold. The only problem in this scheme is that the former supernatural miner to whom the gold belongs does not want to get rid of his treasure so easily and, therefore, begins to dispatch the intruders. <br /> <br /> The dialogue that literally springs from a clich√©, a horrible performance, a terribly terrible 'southern dialect' and an unmemorable assassin that resembles Jeepers Creepers (without the predilection of the above-mentioned small children) They combine to make this stinky almost perfect can not be seen. Even the legendary cult actress Karen Black in a small role can not save this aberration. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elina Madison shows (poorly lit) T & A <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: TMCX
