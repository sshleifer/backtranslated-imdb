Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with a single point in common: the small Basque town of Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange movie, since it has a main character (the film dedicates approximately 20 minutes to each story) other than the city of Obaba. Any story is very well explained and the fact is that they are very boring. It was by far the best movie of the year in Spain, but, well, that does not say much. The only good thing about the movie are the beautiful settings. It is filmed in a very beautiful valley and it is more pleasant to spend time observing the stage instead of being aware of the story.
