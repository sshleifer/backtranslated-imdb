The brands in this film, like Suit Supply, eliminate the story, since it is supposed to be set in the eighties. It is not a very exciting movie. In addition, Intwine's single on the soundtrack is very bad, it has a chorus that is repeated several times, "like" I am a cruel man, I take everything, I am a cruel man. Stay ... "Jeeez, could not those imbeciles think up something better than that? I guess they wrote it in a couple of minutes ... <br /> <br /> It's really annoying, like the placement of the product in this film product, which is important in the controversy and publicity around a criminal who should not be a celebrity, as he is now made to be, but must be forgotten as rats should be.
