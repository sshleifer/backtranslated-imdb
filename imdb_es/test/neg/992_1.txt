In a Saturday morning session in my hometown. I went with an older friend (I was around 12 years old) and my mom let me go because she thought the movie would be fine (it is classified as G). I was assaulted by loud music, strange images, no argument and a stubborn refusal to have ANY sense. We went halfway because we were bored, frustrated and our ears hurt. <br /> <br /> I saw it 22 years later in a renaissance theater. My opinion had changed, it is even WORSE! Basically, all I hated was that I was still there and the movie was VERY 60 years old ... and it's dated badly. I have all the little jokes ... very bad that they were not funny. The constant changes in the tone quickly became annoying and there is absolutely nothing to control. Some people will love this. I found it frustrating ... at the end of the movie I felt like I was throwing something heavy on the screen. <br /> <br /> Also, all the Monkees songs in this movie SUCK (and I like them). <br /> <br /> Only for former hippies ... or if you're drugged. I give this a 1.
