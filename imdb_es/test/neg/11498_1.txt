I had just finished reading the book and I really wanted to see this TV adaptation that aired on the Hallmark channel on Monday night (30/30/05). The key to the whole book was the manifesto that was stolen by the man with steel teeth, but I watched it for an hour (3 1/2) and saw the man with steel teeth, but I never saw him steal a manifest . . I saw someone steal a virus, but what did that have to do with the book? It is very bad because this film had excellent production values ​​and a good cast, but it is not the idea of ​​turning a book into a movie (TV or movie) so that the people who read the book are part of the audience. They only held me for one hour. I thought that the premise of the book was great and what they did, but they threw the whole premise. This book had a great McGuffin (paraphrasing Hitchcock) but they ignored it. And he said in the titles that Forsyth was involved in the production. Surely you must have paid a lot of money.
