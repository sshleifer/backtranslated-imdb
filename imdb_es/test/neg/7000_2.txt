1st seen 06/21/2001 - 2 of 10 (Dir-Emmanuel Itier): Supposedly useless thriller who spends more time getting into sexual encounters with and without the star 'Amber Smith'. Try to wrap a story around the sex scenes, but as usual in this type of movies, it is not very well made. I was so bored with this movie that I actually went ahead through the ending to get it over with. The video version I saw was called 'Tell me there are no lies'.
