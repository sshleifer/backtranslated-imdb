Well now this strange movie. It was categorized as a comedy, but I certainly did not find anything to laugh at. Actually I am struggling to find something positive to say about this movie. Oh, here I go. Alex Ferns is not bad in the main role and I did not choose the end for a change, but, apart from that, he does not have a strong direction of solid two-dimensional character and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious enough or dark to be anyone. Decent drama form. I would really avoid having to watch this movie again and think that it does nothing to benefit any of the working-class characters it is trying to represent. It was difficult for me to empathize with any of the characters and I was not given enough information about the main character, Jimmy, to believe his motives. Better to avoid it.
