After a disgusting and crude opening that gives you that creepy feeling of "massacre with chainsaw", everything collapses. Real murderers Anyone who has seen enough of these "cheated" movies can solve this. <br /> <br /> This movie is crazy with one thing in mind: representing brutal killings. Why, then, is the girl not tortured and killed too? Will this be the next thing for us who go to the movies? The torture and abuse of children? What's wrong with you? Lynch is truly has a disgusting and ugly mind.
