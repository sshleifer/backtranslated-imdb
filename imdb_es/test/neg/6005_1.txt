IN AGREEMENT. First I said, I just wanted to check if this movie has an average rating below or exactly -1. But the 5.9. This is more sick than any of the murderers' procedures. That made me curious about what people wrote here ... what ultimately made me create an account to give my two hundred truth to this "well of deception" that I found here. <br /> <br /> How dare they even? Do you mention this movie in the same sentences as, for example, Â¿Siete? The only thing they have in common is that they show several scenes of the crime. That's. And "Best thriller of 1999!" ? Have you ever seen another form of film that year? Or any other movie in your life? 1999 is not a year that people remember in RESURRECTION ... what about the real MOVIES like 8mm, eyes wide open, Arlington Road, Double Jeopardy? (Theyre actually more of a "thriller" than this could be ...). The resurrection does not even deserve to be dedicated to A SECOND of 1999. <br /> <br /> Really, you can not be serious. Yesterday I saw that movie with my girlfriend, highly recommended by a friend of hers. A "great movie with Christopher Lambert"! ... that I had not seen yet? Hmm ... <br /> <br /> Well, first look at the Covers: OK, nothing special. At the second glance, he does not need to have supernatural powers to realize that they simply reflected Lambert's head, cut off his nose with this and that, and then made an elegant negative pattern to get the image of the assassins on the COVER. You might even think that an apprentice ate a gallon of marshmallows just to subtitle that spooky mouth (booooh! -.-) ... whatever. He turned around and the plot begins with ... "It's raining in Chicago ... blabber blabber." Come on, a six year old could have made that fragment of voice sound more exciting. Now, with this enormous emotion that comes from the excellent presentation of the cinema, you absolutely want to start seeing it. Because it can not be so bad, it's still Christopher Lambert. That assumption of mine proved wrong. With "proven wrong" I mean that he was brutally executed by a deadly mixture of the worst imaginable performance ever known to mankind (all the actors, but the best ones are the "I can do 1-Liners!" Chief of Police, Prudhommes Wife __ actually a better detective than Prudhomme when he combines several incidents in an ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN SENTENCE in the case !!!! -.- __ and ... yes ... Prudhomme himself) with a squad of false inhuman feelings, logical errors in a minute - cycling, light years - implausible conclusions that in my point of view represent an insult to any thinking human being and last, but not least, to a cameraman who was obviously a hyperventilated kangaroo. Oh, well, and if you do not completely close your brain (they are not premises to see it), then you should know who is who and what is what after max. 30 minutes, simply because you know ANY scene after the first one. That's exciting. Exciting because this movie almost makes you think you can tell the future. <br /> <br /> The conclusion: this is the worst movie I can remember. Believe me, I've seen many horrible movies that were somehow at least just bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. However, the resurrection is the best example of how to fail in all possible aspects. It was so bad that after surprising me for its unimaginably low quality on e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g, I laughed more often than at any recent comedy, simply because I was fascinated by the crew's nerve to publish such an extraordinary film strip. Luckily for Lambert was Highlander: Endgame a year later, so he can be pardoned. ; ^ O <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend watching this movie to ALL. In the end, we had a lot of fun watching him: ^ D. I guarantee that, after you fully observe Resurrection (be brave, you can do it!), You will love the performance level in any given daily soap. <br /> <br /> Or just go and look at the mountaineer one more time ... that's what I'm going to do.
