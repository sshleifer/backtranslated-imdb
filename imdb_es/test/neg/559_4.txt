I thought that this movie was going to be a misfortune for the series. After all, part 3 was not up to part 2, and it does not have Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humor was not as witty as in part 3, but it was funny enough to make it worth watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The part of the girl was pretty good. She is a lost teenager who needs direction. I find the plot a bit hard to believe. That the aunt would simply accept to leave her home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi, a man she has just met. Of course, he was friends with his brother. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the monastery. One might think that some of my other comments I would not have liked the dancing monks, but I found it fun. It was shown that they know how to have a little fun. Now, if these were monks in ancient China dancing pop music, that would have been another matter. <br /> <br /> Probably the smartest part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid for the monks not to do it. You kill a bug Miyagi told him that street gangs that kill each other are stupid, that nations that try to destroy each other are stupid, but having respect for all life is not stupid. Miyagi has also expressed so much wisdom in the other films. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 4 out of 10. Of course, there were some things that I liked. It was not as fun as the third part, and no character could be up to Sato in the second part. This movie has no re-watch value. I can not imagine seeing it again, but it's worth seeing once.
