How sad that this came from the same mind as Donnie Darko, possibly one of the best films of this genre. Where do I begin? I think one of the most infuriating aspects of the movie is that we're supposed to be criticizing humanity, and yet we do not see humanity in the film. No more than 5 minutes of the film are spent agonizing over the possible death of another human. These are horrible one-dimensional cardboard cutouts of human beings. Unfortunately, this is how you play with what can only be described as a terrible performance. Is it really like Kelly sees humanity? Judging by the reaction of the spectators, this is a horrible encapsulation of humanity. Why do not the characters in the film ask the questions that all the spectators have? This is not an accusation of humanity. It is an indictment of the straw men that Kelly establishes, which almost does not look anything like the real human beings in this situation. <br /> <br /> For those who say that this was a wonderful thought-provoking movie, what are you comparing it to? Armageddon? I even saw someone compare this with Kurosawa's works. How private should it be to think that this would promote a good existential discussion? For the love of everything that is good in the cinema! Even the Indecent Proposal is ten times the accusation of humanity that this is. There we see really dying people about greed and the human condition. Yes, even Indecent Proposal puts this film to shame for philosophical discussion and, nevertheless, gets 5.3 to 6.0 for this foolish gut. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen a more pretentious, pontificating and self-glorifying film, that the film falls so flat on his face. This has the depth of a high school film project, and a poor one in that. In truth, that is the level of discussion promoted by this film. If you want to see GOOD psychological movies, do yourself a favor and check out Das Experiment. If The Box had been up to even this single objective, I would have been willing to forgive some of the atrocious performances, the open plot holes and the plot of the meaningless story. Unfortunately, he can not even do that. <br /> <br /> The true accusation of humanity is that there are people who think that this film is a profoundly introspective look at the human condition. This is not Sartre! This is not even Sartre's Cliff Notes version! This is an end-of-grade paper for Sartre, written at high speed and written by hackers, based on some divisions on the Internet message boards. If Sartre were alive, he would sue Kelly for defamation.
