I just saw it ... the story, the plot, the script does not make any sense. Samvise is the brave part 2 (without the RING), his characters appear out of nowhere (without reason), his Hercules are hated by everyone (nobody knows why), Leelee Sobiesky shows his true talents (two of them), its effects Fucking specials, are some good actors who waste their talents (did I mention Leelee's two talents?) ... Do I have to say more? It's just amazing, even by NBC-TV standards! It's the lowest ... what a waste! By the way, how can you give this mini-series so many stars ????? It is beyond me! ... What a shame! I have to do 10 lines, so this is my last word: AVOID, AVOID, if you are considering buying it!
