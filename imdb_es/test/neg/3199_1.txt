Possibly one of the biggest celluloid waste of the last 100 years. Not only does he suffer from a painfully (and highly predictable) unrelated sequence of commands, but he is clearly a copy of Alien II. In five minutes I correctly predicted who would die and who would not (and in what order). The special effects are laughable; there is a scene in which a member of the crew is mutilated (unconvincingly) by two Krites that look like a pair of teddy bears, and the scarce humor is out of place. There are better things to do with a VCR remote than to use it to watch this movie.
