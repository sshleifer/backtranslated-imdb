Steven Seagal's films in recent times have not been exactly good, but this is by far the worst since The Patriot. The plot does not make any sense; It is never clear what the relationships between the characters are, who works for whom or who is crossing with whom. The film is completely disconnected, each scene seems to confuse the story more instead of taking it forward. Even the action sequences have no inspiration and are difficult to follow. Most of the blame should be on the director's feet for not even understanding the basics of making movies, but Seagal is not taken lightly, as one of the producers of this film, he must also share the blame. Oh, and I have not even mentioned how horrible the acting is, even by Seagal standards. Even as a direct to the video, this is not worth even for Seagal fans. Give him a big bunk!
