Before I start, let me get something out of my chest: I'm a big fan of John Eyres' first film, PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film, a B-grade crossover from THE TERMINATOR and DIE HARD, may not be the work of a film genius, but it is a very entertaining action movie that became a cult hit (and resulted in two sequels and a spin off). <br /> <br /> The judge and jury begin with Joseph Meeker, a convicted murderer who was sent to Death Row after his capture after the so-called "Bloody Shootout" (which seems to be a bad name for a wave of murders Meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store), being driven to the electric chair. There is a funny scene in which Meeker talks to the priest about living for sex, but he knows his only true love (he was killed during the shooting), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her. Michael Silvano, a football star who strolls through the days watching his son Alex play football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). But once executed, Meeker returns as an avenger (or as Kelly Perine calls "a hamburger without French fries"), whose only objective is to obtain his revenge, which basically means making Silvano's life miserable. <br /> <br /> Let me point out the fact that Judge and Jury is not a true horror movie. It's a supernatural action movie, with Meeker chasing Silvano, using his ability to change shape (which amounts to David Keith dressing up like everything from an Elvis impersonator, a French chef (with an accent as bad as his mustache) , a drag queen, a clown and a comedian, a shotgun that fires explosive bullets and an invulnerability to death (although that does not stop Martin Kove from shooting Keith with a Desert Eagle) to pay Silvano for killing his wife from Meeker. <br /> Director John Eyres does not seem interested in the characterizations, but focuses only on the action scenes, of which the film has a lot, but that is the main flaw of the film, since there is nothing to connect the action scenes, the performance is surprisingly good, with Keith delivering the best performance, ably supported by Kove, as well as by Paul Koslo, who plays the fallen cop pretty well. And Perine is annoying as the taxi driver who tries to help but worsens the situation.
