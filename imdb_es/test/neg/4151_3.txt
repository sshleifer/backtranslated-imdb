My wife and I never got into the movie. We thought it was a way to dispel and many subtitles. I understood that they needed them for Vietnam, but it took me a long time to leave Asia. She wanted me to say that I was going to succeed. best. He never did. They had a hard time getting to the United States, but I wanted to see him looking for and finding his father. Not in the end, but forming a relationship. I mentioned that it was incredible. I love watching a movie to feel good, not sad at the end. I know they do not make many good movies nowadays. I think that action movies are the only ones that have to be seen. I've been renting a lot on Netflix and now I've surpassed box office volume, maybe 20% is. Worth seeing. I do not know realism or facts, just a movie that is fun and makes you feel good.
