By Hollywood standards, this film was shot and edited as are Hollywood movies and, therefore, it looked like a movie that would be taken out of a large production studio in Hollywood. That's where anything remotely close to having Hollywood standards ends. This was the worst movie I've seen in my life. I'm not kidding. The story was so incredibly stupid and unrealistic that I could not contain my laughter in the movies while watching this movie. I know what you're saying: "It's a horror movie that is not supposed to have a good story that is supposed to scare you". Well, let me tell you something, the movie is not even scary in the least. It is too full of stupid bits that cancel the little suspense that could have been. The performance was also frightening, along with the tremor of the murderer, who is constantly seen through flashbacks locked in a cage that is removed. Throughout the film, I had the feeling that I was seeing something that had been thought, written, produced and directed by a high school student who sees too much pornography. Please, do not watch this movie, spend your $ 8.50 on other things, like a snow cone, which would be much more worthwhile.
