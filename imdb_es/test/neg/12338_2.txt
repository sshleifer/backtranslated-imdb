Downhill Racer is essentially a movie to watch only because of the incredible ski sequences. Although there is a story here, the character of Robert Redford, a skier trying to be part of the US Olympic team. UU., It is so insipid and unfriendly that one wonders why worry about him. Gene Hackman, in an early performance, adds very well, but this is a movie that could be seen with the sound off, and it would not make much difference.
