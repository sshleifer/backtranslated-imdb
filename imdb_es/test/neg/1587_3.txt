(Spoilers) "Cash Crop" is something like this. Farmers with bad luck cultivate a pot to make ends meet. The DEA agent arrives in the city. The farmers hide the pot. The DEA agent leaves the city. End of story. <br /> <br /> This film presents solid performances by some second-level actors, mediocre direction and a regular script ... but it has no history. And since history is the basis of all drama, "Cash Crop" is a complete failure. Too boring to recommend.
