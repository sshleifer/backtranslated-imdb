This movie easily falls into the category of laughable, if not beyond that, to really insult. I mean, in what alternative universe did the filmmakers think and the studies that this film would play? From start to finish, we bombard Quaids by overreacting and ridiculous facial expressions, lying in the "im a loose canyon" act a little thick. Another important point I had with the film was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect with a character. I mean, in a scene where Lewis is playing in a bar before he gets to the big time, this is exaggerated, a completely absurd bar fight that apparently all the citizens of the city are part of. Then Lewis begins to interpret his version of "Much tremor" and all immediately forget their differences and begin to dance as if it were the most normal thing in the world. This type of scenes, of which there are numerous, along with the lack of depth in any of the characters, led me to real laughter. So, in general, it's not worth watching this movie for anyone who is not interested in making fun of a filmmaker and his actors for an hour and a half.
