"Yesterday" as a movie, it is difficult to qualify. The cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. The story is gritty and real and does not compromise. But the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not coincide with the work of the camera. <br /> <br /> As a person born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film's appearance and honesty. Representation of the daily life of the Zulus. But this and the work of the camera are not enough to recommend to the average viewer that he should watch this movie. It is necessary to appreciate the true cinema and not only the love for films to see the purpose and strength of "Yesterday". <br /> <br /> Unlike the 1980 movie "The gods must be crazy", it was a comical look at an African culture that meets modern technology, "Yesterday" it does not intend to attract any public crossover. The movie is simply not suitable for the common western mind, and I doubt it was meant for the Western mind. The scenes are long and slow, the edition is not ready for a world of instant gratification of 60 mph +. The dialogue is not cleaver or ingenious, it is real. Movies about health crises are not the best entertainment and this movie is not entertainment, it's education. <br /> <br /> This film is best seen by those who know, appreciate and love the lifestyle and culture in sub-Sarah Africa. If you lack a worldview broad enough to understand other cultures, especially African cultures, you should skip this movie. Do not waste time with him. Go see "Talladega Nights" or "Larry the Cable Guy" instead of seeing your cross culture. <br /> <br /> I give a 4 to most of those who want to see the film but do not understand African cultures well. . For viewers who appreciate movies about human experience anywhere in the world, I would give them a 7.
