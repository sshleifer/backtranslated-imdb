This is one of the strangest things about television. It is located in a magnificent populated area of ​​Midlands called Leatherbridge, which seems to be the most boring place in the country. It has a bar with no staff or visible clients, a university without students, a police station without criminals and a medical consultation with more doctors than patients. The story lines are terrible: each episode revolves around a strange medical problem represented by a variety of extra brummies that can never act, and for some reason, the doctor always ends up at home solving the problem. Quite entertaining for its pure comedy value, but I can not believe that this thing really poses as a serious drama. Crazy.
