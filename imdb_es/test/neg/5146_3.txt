During production, this LWT series was titled "Rocket To The Moon", a title that everyone on the set thought was cheesy enough. Then it was learned that it had been renamed 'Reach of the Moon', as if this addition of this new word evoked heavy metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters. This same lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the entire plot of the series, and the same story of a tired and boring love triangle extends over 7 episodes! Any television program that decides to use the "love triangle" argument even for a single episode is pushing it, but it is unforgivable to defame it in more than seven episodes. However, there are reasons to see it, because the landscape of the Isle of Wight provides a beautiful setting and the apparent interpretation of Lynda Bellingham that seems effortless, reaching all the right comedy marks. This, however, is not enough. Several actions are noticed, especially when placed against the static and emotionless moor that Jonathan Kerrigan refers to as his face. I already mentioned Lynda Bellingham in the role of 'picky mother' (yes, that's in regards to character development and background story), but I was impressed by actor Maurice Roeves (who is by far the most experienced in Cast, having appeared in classic films such as 'Oh What a Lovely War' by Richard Attenborough and 'The Eagle Has Landed', and on TV including Baywatch, Holby City, The Bill, Eastenders, Cheers, Doctor Who in the 80s , Star Trek, and even going to Hollywood with Sylvestor Stallone in 1995, Judge Dredd, whose performance reminded me a lot of the real masters I've met, often powerless men, whose lives are tinged with a very sad streak. that Roeves is still working, since he also appeared in the British movie "The Acid House" in 1998 and even more recently with the wonderful Maria Bello and Sean Bean in "The Dark." The outstanding reason for watching this series, despite that s His appearances are very few. Another actor who tries his best to elevate the program, is Ben Miles, in the role of the brother of the "typical man of sex" (once again, what an original character!). As with Roeves, the CV says it all. After raising this, Miles has appeared in the Hollywood movie 'V for Vendetta', and in the 2001 film entitled 'The Affair of the Necklace', along with Brian Cox, Adrien Brody, Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce. Unfortunately, the fairly capable actors I've mentioned are resigned to relatively small roles compared to the dramatic driftwood that are Kerrigan and Saira Todd, who seem to have been in Casualty for too long and have not yet learned to act. Even the tolerable Frances Gray is made to suffer in the presence of such theatrically fetal mannequins, and unfortunately for her, the lasting memory I have of her of the set is the AD that requests another shot of a relatively complex shot because during the shot, she subconsciously 'He pulled his panties out of his crack'. In each episode, familiar faces appear: children's actors from the CBBC programs and dramas such as '2 Point 4 Children' and other commercials such as Ben's ("they will remember me for this"), Lynda, the lady of Oxo Bellingham and others that I do not even want to remember. Each episode is about trying to deal with issues such as teenage pregnancy, problematic students and building rockets (...) ... things that Grange Hill was doing better when my parents were young! In general, this series was a disappointment and a wasted opportunity to create a really interesting and well-developed dramatic series. Unfortunately, for them they took the easy way, both in writing and (mostly) in the casting. I would recommend both 'Waterloo Road' and 'The Street', to the fans of good drama, the latter in particular who achieved this. If you like the Isle of Wight, do not "touch the moon", look for the holiday brochure, it probably contains more character development!
