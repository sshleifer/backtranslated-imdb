The concept of this film is unique, however, its execution is less than special. When I arrived at the cinema and realized that there were only about 15 people in the crowd, I thought I had made a mistake. However, the real mistake was made with a shocking detail when the movie ended and I knew I had lost two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Without the cruel recordings of the old man and the stupidly funny friend, this movie would have rated 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This film is special, special because it is probably the worst movie that has been released to the general public. <br /> <br /> There is also the issue of whether you could call it a movie or just an advertisement for the "Northwestern" probably fake. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking about watching this movie for the plot, the humor, the filming, the locations, then no. On the other hand, if you like to experience both ends of the film production spectrum, go and take a book, a small game or a novel article.
