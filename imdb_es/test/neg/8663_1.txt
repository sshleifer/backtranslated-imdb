I agree with several of you that this movie was quite boring and boring. I discovered that I did not like the main character and the following actors / actresses who appeared in the scenes. The camera work was not pleasant in itself. The random shots and shaky movie scenes bothered me a lot and I turned off the movie. I will take my time observing the 1999 adaptation and I hope it fits what is in agreement with Sense and Sensibility; Emma Becoming a jane; and pride and prejudice. I only have a few others to watch, in addition to these films, but I think they were done with great pleasure. The music was also out of place with the movie, and it reminded me of another show I had seen this year. It was called Hex and a BBC show. I found it one night on the web. I really liked the first season, but the second season was dry and it took things from the air that should keep the clouds. I found the main male character that was Henry in this misplaced movie. Maybe I just do not like the way he talks or his stature. Well, I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they kept it quiet and wanted to look at the fashion of the time, or the way the houses were kept at that time. Once again, I'll see the 1999 version and I hope it's better and it does justice to Jane Austen in her writing.
