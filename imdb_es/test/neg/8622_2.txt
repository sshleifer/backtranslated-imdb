Most American remakes of European films are quite poor, but this is in a league of their own. In fact, this could be the worst movie ever made (Sandra Bullock). I would dare say that I could have done it like another Hollywood thriller innocently bad if I had not seen the Dutch original, SPOORLOOS. The end altered here is quite stupid (and runs with particular ineptitude), but a crime far worse than that is to eliminate all the intelligence and depth of character that marked the original as a classic. The real horror that is found here is the fact that the same man who led SPOORLOOS is responsible for this atrocity. Will the real George Sluizer rise?
