What the hell is this movie about? Well, if I did not know that the "son of the mask" is classified as a comedy, I would never have a clue! A comedy? A tragedy, that is the correct genre for this yet another so-called "sequel". <br /> <br /> Yes, I have seen "Dumb and Dumber" but I never thought that someone would make his real title in Hollywood. Yes, you see "The son of the mask" and you think ... 5 minutes - Dumb ... 10 minutes - Dumber ... 15 - minutes Dumbest ... And then, after 16 minutes there is only one thing to say : / I'm out of here ... <br /> <br /> Sorry, my nominee for Comedy Crap of the Year 2005.
