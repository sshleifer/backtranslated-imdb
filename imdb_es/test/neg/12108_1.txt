If you want to have a truly traumatic experience, this horrible movie (if you can consider calling it that) is for you. A movie worse than the postman, Sizzle Beach EE. UU., Batman and Robin, Kazaam, fair game ... well you understand what I mean. This film directed by the sensation of the French television Patrick Sebastien (Jerry Springer with an IC of 25) can really be considered the worst movie ever made. I hope Troma or someone in the United States distributes it, so that Americans can experience the French stench when it's worth it.
