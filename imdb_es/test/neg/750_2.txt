My first hugely disappointing movie of the BBC / Jane Austen. The tone is off, the locker is off, the hair is loose, the music is from outer space, and Robert Hardy, bless him, seems to be really upset about being so stinky. Even part of the casting is off. No, I take it back, a good director can make a silk bag with a bristle ear, so to speak. The performances on this subject are so exaggerated and melodramatic that it's almost a farce from a Jane Austen story, which is ironic, since the Northanger Abbey is a kind of homage to the primitive Gothic novel. I wanted to slap the female lead after a while; Who made the decision that she should be a ninny? I had to watch Pride & Prejudice ('95) immediately to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Phew!
