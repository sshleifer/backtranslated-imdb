Remarkable just as the feature debut of future Hollywood star Sandra Bullock, this ridiculous action movie is so full of holes that one could easily suspect termite infestation. The plot is incomprehensible and very badly thought out. The production values ​​stink of cheese. In fact, a total LACK of production values ​​would have been better ... at least the movie could have seemed more aggressive that way. The ADR is ridiculously bad and omnipresent in the movie. It is debatable if ANY of the dialogue tracks of the actual shooting were used. <br /> <br /> The performances are, for the most part, horrible, although there are some exceptions. However, in those exceptions, the performances are undermined by the fact that the director was obviously giving the actors misdirection and, on occasion, making them act completely out of place. (ie, the characters go from passive to panic in the blink of an eye.) Bad direction.) In addition, the constant "sound effects of weapons" (magazines that are loaded, slides are loaded, etc.) are completely overused. and, most of the time, totally desynchronized with the actions on the screen. Add to this cheesy "Bad Guy" vocal distortion for the main villain (mainly so he knows he's the villain in this incomprehensible movie mess), and he has a recipe for disaster. <br /> <br /> The situations in the film, go far beyond the standard "suspension of disbelief" and become downright ridiculous. A main character spends a good part of the film tied to a chair before DECIDING to use the butterfly knife tucked into his sock to free himself. So, my questions are ... why did not he do this before, and why does he even have the butterfly knife? Was not searched? RIGHT. This is one of hundreds of examples of completely absurd situations that have somehow been piled up in this 90-minute package. <br /> <br /> In general, "The Hangmen" plays like an unbearably bad R-rated TV movie from the '80s. If it were not for the subsequent success of Sandra Bullock, she would NEVER have found her way to the DVD . But he has done it, so my only advice is to stay clear. Watching this movie can affect your IQ.
