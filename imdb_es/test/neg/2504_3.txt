One of the few films filmed in Coronado High School in Scottsdale, AZ in the late 80s, as well as Just One of the Guys, Excellent Adventure and Just Perfect by Bill and Ted (which was a segmented movie of the Mickey Mouse Club). Movie It is definitely for children, since the previous comments are quite correct. <br /> <br /> Coronado has gone through a revision in recent years and many of the buildings seen in this film are gone. The field where the catches play is adjacent to the soccer field, one of the few areas that still exist. I think the internal scenes near the lockers were in the old building 200. <br /> <br /> Unless it's playing late at night on the Disney channel, it can be a very hard movie to find. How they ever made sequels to this is beyond me.
