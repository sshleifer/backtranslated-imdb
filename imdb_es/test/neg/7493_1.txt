After spending half an hour examining Rumors, a gay bar located on the outskirts of Tupelo, Mississippi, SMALL TOWN GAY BAR focuses on the murder of Scotty Weaver in Bay Minette to demonstrate the risks run by the subjects interviewed. But there is a problem here. Bay Minette is not near Tupelo, as the film implies. It is not even in the same state. Actually, it's about three hundred miles away, off the coast of Alabama. <br /> <br /> Director Malcom Ingram does not rush to point out this fact, nor does he bother to mention that while Minette Bay itself is little more In a large place on the road, it is actually two deep breaths from the metropolitan area of ​​Mobile, Alabama, which has a remarkable gay community, lots of gay bars and even a congregation of the Metropolitan Community Church. If Ingram is not sincere in these points, one must ask if it is also in others. <br /> <br /> Speaking as someone who was born, grew up and continues to live in Mississippi, I must say that I found most of SMALL TOWN GAY BAR a lot of hooey. Neither Meridian nor Tupelo, the communities Ingram focuses on, are as rural, small or isolated as he could imagine, and gay bars are more common in the state than the film implies. That said, Ingram blithely ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean an absence of a gay community, and in doing so demonstrates a profound ignorance of southern culture, which tends to contain those who frequent bars: Be gay or straight, in low esteem. <br /> <br /> SMALL TOWN GAY BAR is, in my opinion, an instance in which a filmmaker came to his subject with a personal agenda in hand and then went on to film the agenda. Do gays and lesbians living in rural Mississippi face great, sometimes frightening challenges? You can bet that yes, but that is not an excuse to play with reality to such an extent. The DVD includes a comment track and a series of deleted scenes, but I thought the film itself was so ridiculous that I did not waste time on them. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
