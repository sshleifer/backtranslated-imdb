Apart from that Frankie Muniz chatting too quickly to understand (Malcolm in the middle flashbacks?), This movie still can not evoke a scare. The idea with the "Countess" and the history that surrounded her in the story was fun, but the plot and many secondary plots simply do not come together. Synopsis of the plot: killing ghosts attracts victims through a video game. Throw some splashes of blood and special effects and you'll have another bombing that would be a horror movie. Ghost cronies look too much like the ghost in "The Ring Two." The performance and the constant and dramatic change in everyone's emotions is incredible. Save your money
