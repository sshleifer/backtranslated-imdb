There is an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this film: it's just a brainless comedy, do not take it seriously. Chillax dude !!! Well, that's a point of view. The other would be: why are we accepting exactly the same script, the same formula and the same people without grace in all these "comedies"? <br /> <br /> What you get is a bum who, through some totally unrealistic circumstances. , has to change his life (always a he), overcome a series of circumstances that would only be a problem for a raccoon or a teenager, beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the girl he met two days before and triumph over be lazy but with more money / self-esteem. On the way someone does something rude but very illogical. This means that you, the viewer, can call someone after the movie and say something like "you will not believe it, maaann." This guy finds the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhea that the other man left after having He ate laxative brownies, then polished his shoes with that. " Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Most of the usual names appear. David Spade and Rob Schneider do not funny tricks, but they are crrrazzeee characters: a Russian and, I'm holding my sides, a waiter in a vegan restaurant. Adam Sandler, the king of brainless extravagance, the illogical comedy co-produces and once again, someone without talent named Dante appears. I know. UU They will have to explain to the rest of the world why this guy is famous for whom Dante is famous. Allen Covert plays a 36-year-old boy who gave me the biggest laugh of the night. He was 42 years old and looked years older. <br /> <br /> Did I laugh? Yes, but no more than I would in a television program and I do not have to pay a penny to see them. Please, stop making these movies.
