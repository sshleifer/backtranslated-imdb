Although this is the first movie of the group of broken lizards, it's the last one I saw. Having enjoyed a bit of Super Troopers, and I managed to sit in the trash that is the club dred and beerfest, I was surprised to hear that they made a previous movie. Now I did not sit with high hopes, but I was expecting a fun romp on campus. My friend asked me to keep in mind that they are younger (obviously) and it is their first foray into cinema. I did it and I was still disappointed. By not removing the acting and comedy skills of the BL guys, they were fine. The whole movie was boring, clich√© and downright boring. Some of the other actors in the film were very poor in acting. And the game of rugby was not even like rugby. Poor sample They improved drastically with the Super Troopers and have decreased since then. Hopefully they'll be back in shape with Super Troopers 2
