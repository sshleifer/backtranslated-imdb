Basically, this film tries to represent the heroism of firefighters by having the whole movie revolve around an American father with a good heart that puts others before himself. Now I know that they try to show Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American father who is a fireman, but just as there is nothing interesting in him, so when the movie reaches the climax, there is little or nothing. emotion. Basically, this movie is about making a firefighter's life exciting, but it's just as boring as any other job, except that you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire. John Travolta plays the captain of the fire station, but anyone could have played his role and is a boring character like the rest of the movie. What could have been a good movie is that firefighters are considered heroes because they are firemen and turn the whole scenario into an uninteresting melodrama. <br /> <br /> 4.9 / 10
