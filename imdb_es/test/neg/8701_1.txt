I really want Hollywood to come up with some new and quick ideas. Instead, they go through, recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a new version. This movie is horrible from the DeMille version. Throughout this whole movie I was telling myself, huh? - What???? - I do not remember that part. The only exciting thing in this movie so far was the separation of the Red Sea. And in Heston's version, it was much better than this version. Did anyone else see an atom or nuclear bomb cloud vanish when the Red Sea was separating? I think I did it. Anyway, I could - I could - see the last part tonight. <br /> <br /> I would like Hollywood to address different ideas and themes when they are making new movies. Instead of rewriting old movies. <br /> <br /> They should have left pretty well alone. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: <br /> <br /> Well, I've seen the last part. Did Moses make the second copy of the ten commandments with his own hand? Or was I seeing things? Please, someone. Send me an email and let me know. HORRIBLE
