I'm going to say this first ... the movie would have been a 1970s science fiction classic if it had run much better. <br /> <br /> That said, let's examine the plot ... start with Peter Graves (or is it Clarence Oveur?) running for president, then cut out a ridiculous university environment, full of authoritarians with hats and headphones trucker and retarded athletes who act as if they were the same age as ever. It shows a man who apparently goes to the United States, throws a party, then they take him to a medical laboratory where they drug him, wrap him in a plastic bag and then prepare it as if the doctors were packing vegetables for steam packages. Well, they're actually putting it on the ice so doctors can extract the organs they need. <br /> <br /> Then he cuts out another silly man thinking that the place where he lives is a bit strange after a can of beer (of all possible plot devices) found in a river makes him look suspicious ( Damn those beer cans!). He and some of his equally stupid love interests feel that they need to get to the bottom of everything, so he makes her stay behind while he escapes by what is basically a large university administration building with some evidence that he discovers in the way of the cloning ..and how is part of that. <br /> <br /> He escapes his controllers after some were shot and an old journalist helps him find his 'father', the man from whom he was cloned. As it happens, he is a clone of Peter Graves' brother. After debating what to do with him and his evidence, he returns to the facility to find his girlfriend (who in the meantime has been lobotomized to be even more stupid, harmless and ready to present a talk show according to the SOL team). ). It is captured and stored cold, like his retarded friend of Nazi construction from the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a confrontation in the house of the Graves brothers causes several deaths, including Graves'. The reporter and his wife are killed in the middle of an exciting conversation with a bomb. It seems that the conspirators have won to some extent ... <br /> <br /> Then, Peter Graves is able to survive if he runs with a metal poker for the miracle of the cloned parts, and gives another vote. For me, the speech is fair when the reporters confront it on the issue of cloning. <br /> <br /> Definitely MST3K forage, but at the lower end of the spectrum in regards to general evil.
