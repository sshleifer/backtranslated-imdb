Just to save you the $ 3, or whatever it takes to rent movies at your local video store, and the anguished hour and yet for a long time this is a simple plan. Go to a friend's house, invite them to rent The Pest for you, observe the first 30 seconds or so and then make up an excuse to leave. The opening sequence is very funny, definitely worth seeing. Unfortunately, the other 99% of the movie is horrible. Without the shower scene at the beginning, this is one of the worst movies of all time.
