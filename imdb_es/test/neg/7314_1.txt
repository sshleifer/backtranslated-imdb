"Misconduct" was one of a series of texts published in Australia in the early 1990s that explored the alleged victimization of the privileged heterosexual man in the age of feminism. This creature only needs to look at a fairly young thing, and is accused of sexual harassment, and his life is ruined. Damn the liberators of women! Grrr ... <br /> <br /> As my tone might suggest, I did not buy any of these anti-feminist BS and, therefore, I did not enjoy this movie. 'GM' trivializes the problems of sexual harassment and the relationships between teachers and students. Sexual harassment is the product of a confused young woman's imagination, and the professional boundaries that teachers must maintain ... well, when the teacher is a lovely and handsome family man (and played by Jimmy Smits!) worry about that. <br /> <br /> Sexist garbage, and even revising it, I give it more time than it deserves.
