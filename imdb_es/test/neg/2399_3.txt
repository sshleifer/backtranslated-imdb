I am sure that the people who made this movie believe that they are doing something wonderfully politically correct, because they manage to criticize the wars of the United States in Afghanistan and particularly Iraq by suggesting that the United States is doing well in war, but not cleaned up afterwards. . So sowing the seeds for future problems. Also, they do it without turning the Islamists into enemies And without making the Republicans become enemies, since it is the Republicans who are in power and are doing this supposedly great, overthrowing the USSR by providing a war in Afghanistan. br /> But seriously now. . . Do we really want a movie that says repeatedly "let's kill some Russians"? Is that the best thing a red-blooded American can do? And are we supposed to find this adorable congressman because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes? Even his supposedly intelligent assistant, who is always dressed professionally, still looks at Charlie as if he were the most wonderful, the best, the best boy in the world. As if she were Nancy Reagan to her Ronnie. Julia Roberts does a great job in her role, but basically the women are really degraded in this movie, and it was really annoying.
