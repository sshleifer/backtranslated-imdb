I will never forget to see this program around the age of 13 years. Even at an early age I remember thinking, "This is a Baywatch scam show without the one thing that makes Baywatch bearable, the girls in swimsuits." However, in those days it was too small to be the owner of the remote control in my house. The high point of Pacific Blue was an episode in which a couple of gang members approached to hit someone with machine guns ... on bicycles! At thirteen, I never laughed so much at something that was supposed to be taken seriously. I even knew that the task of going out and getting Uzis (for murder) is a task that should never be done before borrowing someone's car for the day. That had been the defining moment of this show. Simple crimes and situations made to measure by piracy so that they can be taken care of by the unrecognized hero of the world of crime fighting The Bike Cop. It does not get much more foolish.
