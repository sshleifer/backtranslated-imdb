When I saw "Mosquito", something funny happened to me: on the one hand, the hero is a deaf-mute and the director is totally incapable of making us understand why he does what he does (mutilate mannequins ... er, excuse me, corpses) through Their images. On the other hand, the English version at least is very badly bent. So I found myself wishing there had been more and less dialogue at the same time! This movie is stupid (it's funny how this guy has access to all the cemeteries and mortuaries in his city) and creepy (where would we be in an operator of the 70s without our free lesbian scene?). Not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how sweet!) ... I miss him. (*)
