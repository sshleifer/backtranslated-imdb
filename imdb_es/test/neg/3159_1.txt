Well, you hippies are probably wondering what I have against an "educational" and "informative" program like "Barney." Well, I have a lot of hatred against this for these reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. It teaches that having personality and individualism is immoral. No one in the program has a personality. They all dress the same, talk the same, act the same and dance the same. Even in the episode called "Being an individual", children try to tell Barney what they like and EVERYONE on the planet should do what I want. Do you want to teach your child to be a wrong individual? <br /> <br /> 2. "A stranger is a friend, you have not met" Episode. Although seemingly harmless, the program's producers soon discovered that it could also be extremely dangerous for young children. In fact, several young Barney lovers from all over the USA. UU They were victims of pedophiles, who used the friendly message of the show to lure children away from their parents. The episode has already been removed, but the damage was already done. So-called "innocent" errors in programming, like this one, clearly show why parents need to watch TV WITH their children. <br /> <br /> 3. IF you are not happy all the time, you are a bad person. Nobody seems to show any emotion other than happiness, regardless of the situation in which they find themselves. If the child's parents become angry or sad for some reason, the child may think of mom or dad differently. It is not a good message at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Magic solves everything! It seems that every problem is solved by magic. At least in programs like "Fraggle Rock", it teaches us that magic can be counterproductive and it is better to solve problems on your own. Does Barney teach this? Of course not. There must be magic there. And the problem is that many of the two-year-old children can not distinguish fantasy from reality, and might think that their parents, siblings or relatives can use magic to solve everything, but get confused when they can not use magic and think which are rare. Another erection shot again. <br /> <br /> 5. Barney makes no distinction between stealing and sharing. He has even specifically said that "stealing is fine if the person you steal from does not care." Children can learn that if you really want something, stealing is a perfectly acceptable way to get it. This is not something that preschoolers need authority figures to tell them. <br /> <br /> 6. "If I have the right thing, I can solve all my problems". When children have a problem, Barney gives them everything they need to solve it. The message sent here is "Do not try to think to solve this! It's too much work, and the solution probably will not work anyway. Just use this." Because of this, children could stop thinking about things (Barney said it was too much work) and become dependent on the "right" object. (The right shoes, the right food, the right computer, the right exercise machine ...) Obviously, this is a good message for Barney's salespeople, but it's not good for preschoolers. <br /> <br /> 7. The message that cheating is fine. In another episode, the children participate in a contest to take a peanut in a spoon without dropping it. A child puts peanut butter in his spoon and earns easily. The child is rewarded for his creative thinking, when in fact, the child followed the rules and changed the game so that he could win. This teaches that cheating is good, that you win and that people think you are creative, when in real life they will often disqualify you or, worse yet, other competitors who do not follow the rules. <br /> <br /> 8. Do children in this show eat anything other than cakes, cookies and sweets? That teaches that it's okay to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy food, despite the song called "Healthy Food" by Barney. Apart from that, EVERYONE in the show eats junk food. No wonder there are so many obese children in America and Europe. <br /> <br /> And, finally, ... <br /> <br /> Most television shows for other children teach creative problem solving, without having to. resort to "magic". Barney could also have done that, but instead he decided to use the method that was A) the best for the marketers and B) took the least time and money for the scripts. It is a complete impudence that shows how little the Lyons Group really cares about children. <br /> <br /> That's my rant for all of you.
