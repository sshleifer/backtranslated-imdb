I can appreciate a satire that goes against my own views, but it must be witty and well placed. This movie is ... How can I explain it? He makes no attempt at subtlety, much less intelligence. In fact, it's hardly horror. The dead soldiers come alive but they are not interested in the brains, only the voting booths. Why? It indicates an endless flow of the most idiotic, banal and inflated attacks of "bad president, bad conservatives, bad republicans". What a piece of pig dung for self-indulgent, evil and annoying. <br /> <br /> Even if they agree with the "points" of the episode, only the most stupid of the liberals would say that they enjoyed watching it. On the other hand, assigning a degree of stupidity to the crazed, angry, hostile, antisocial and anti-nada-media-normal liberal spectrum is a difficult task in itself. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as a liberal convention.
