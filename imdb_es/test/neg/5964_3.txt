According to this masterpiece of the screenplay (intentional pun), Charles Darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his theory of evolution, because he made no mention of any alien intervention. To see, the aliens sent chupacabras to the earth and form the missing link in the theory of evolution. However, the rest of the film seems to clearly emphasize that Chupacabras are a typically Puerto Rican phenomenon, so I really do not know where that fits. Are they saying that all Puerto Ricans are foreigners? Anyway, everything is pretty irrelevant anyway. The only thing you need to memorize is that "El Chupacabre" is an absolutely cheap and imbecile amateur amateur B movie that lacks tension, character development and any form of style. Several duos of people chase this goat-chewing monster (which remotely resembles the dwarf version of the Pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. We have a dog hunter without talent and an annoying female novelist, a pair of obnoxious cops and a supposedly evil scientist with his little intelligence accomplice. Since they are all extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can continue to devour all the Latino immigrants in the neighborhood. The monster looks good and the make-up effects on the leftovers of its victims are acceptably rude and bloody. Acting performances are irremediably horrible and cause headaches. In particular, Eric Alegria is pitiful in his first and only leading role as the overly ambitious employee of Animal Control. Yes, it's an incredibly stupid movie, but surely you've fought the worst, least fun, low-budget crap.
