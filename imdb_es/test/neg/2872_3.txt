This movie was very bad. It has the quality that many indie movies have: moments of humor filled with long spaces that are completely boring. Any fan of BAM magera will like this movie very much, but it is likely that this is the only person who sees it. Someone gave me this movie to see that I'm a fan of Jackass and that I was a fan of viva la bam, before the nature of the script for that show ran out. To explain why this movie does not work, I must say that the premise itself develops <br /> <br /> a guy who is with a girl that is horrible to him. And almost the whole movie has this Ryan Ryan whining and Bam Magera jumping like a happy creator of mischief. Dicamillo's performance is strange at best. It's a bit of the Canadian French accent, non-specific and humorous, which is practically the extension of his performance (basically fun for 5 minutes and then it's like 'ok, you're already pretending to be foreign enough' ') <br /> <br /> Maybe it would work if they were for parody, but all they do is make a movie with an IQ of zero. I love the toilet humor as much as the next guy, but this is not much less stupid. It's like the only humor that is obtained from this movie is completely inside and the audience, even those experts in Magera and company, are out of the joke. <br /> <br /> The next time Magera receives a sack full of money, let's hope he does not blow on a lousy pet project
