I was just watching a marathon of forensic files on Court TV. The episode was identical to the plot of this film, to the secret of incest and the secondary argument of the adventure with the sister. I do not remember any based on a True Story disclaimer, but the case has MOW written everywhere. Apparently, it narrates the real homicide of Ruby Morris on the part of her husband Earl, condemned to 25 years of life by its murder. Just to show you, the truth may be stranger than fiction, because I thought the plot of Lifetime had been devised and was more than "a stretch" as far as I thought. I'm with the other posters that said the performance was bad. Although I did not notice it with all the players. It really was the main character, the daughter, whose performance was bad.
