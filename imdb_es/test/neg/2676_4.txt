"Curse of Michael Myers" is a very frustrating piece for a fan of the Halloween series. After a disappointing disappointment on Halloween 5, the series reached a boiling point in the plot lines, with a foolish return to witchcraft and a cult of teenagers dedicated to the cult of Michael Myers. "Curse of Michael Myers" raises the stakes in blood and blood, but it really represents a decline in the integrity of the series. It's a shame, since this is the latest Donald Pleasance movie as the character of Dr. Loomis. Pleasance has some good moments on the screen (beautiful if you're a fan of the series) as the now very old and says "very retired doctor." Unfortunately, he died before the film was completed, and it is very evident at the end of the film that the stories of the original climate scene were never made. Since the initial credits, Halloween 6 has more of the feel of a movie made for television than that of the horror movie that began in 1978. Any loyal alumnus of Halloween should have demanded more from this movie. ... Dr. Loomis and Donald Pleasance deserved more.
