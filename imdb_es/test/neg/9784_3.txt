My jaw dropped so many times watching this movie, I have bruises. Granted, granted, I really did not expect the quality of, say, The Others or even Thirteen Ghosts (the new one, which was just dreadful and is still way above this madness). Someone else noticed the thin characters ... I would not call them "thin". "Delgado" implies that there could be something for them. What about almost non-existent? In no particular order we have: The girl who will scream; The American who will solve everything; The Male Macho that will be limited to surpass everything until they kill it: The Sage Black Man that will die early; The extra type that is there to die first; The extra woman who is there to play hard. That's. That is your list of characters and that is what they are and what they remain from beginning to end. If they were "thin", they could at least change a bit from start to finish. But they do not. Well, well, the American decides that he will stay with the fieldwork at the end and the Screaming Girl returns to wherever he comes. That is the change. Apart from that, they all act according to their assigned roles and rarely betray a real emotion when they finally encounter the threat. <br /> <br /> Now, the producers will get accessories for an original threat, I'll say it. He had understood that the story was going to be "Tremors" but with ants instead of giant worms. I give credit to the writer: these are very cool ants, very frightening and what they do with the bones is excellent. (The first time the "bone thief" appears, I recognize that I jumped a few feet). Unfortunately, the great concept becomes Alien in the Desert very quickly. We get a lot of comments about ants that may or may not be true, but we do not get much of the mythology on which the threat is based. And we got every cliché of monster movie ever made. People go to places they know they should not and when they do not have a convincing reason to do so. The moronic characters try to hinder our heroes and die for it. A character fulfills a dual function as "a scientist who does not want to kill the monster but to study it". Only a Very Cool gadget is presented so that the American can tell everyone something about ants that, well, I hope everyone knows anyway. Then the gadget breaks. Our heroes are left without the only thing that can keep the threat at bay. And then there is that final moment, annoying, when we know that the threat is still with us, and we wonder exactly what and in what way the hero or the heroine came with that. It makes everything that was before useless and false. <br /> <br /> Three stars for the fresh use of ants and bones. Nothing at all for the clichés, the clumsy dialogue and the dim bulb characters.
