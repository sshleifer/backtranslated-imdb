As a child of the '80s, like so many other critics here, I hated the original V and V: the final battle. I own both on VHS and I never connect the VCR to see them. I remember that I did not like this short series very much, but I could not remember why, so I rented the first album. In the third episode I had my memory updated. It's terrible. The writing is beyond the horrible. It is not even FUN. They had a lot of material to work with here, but it seemed like they just did not know what to do, so they turned it into "Days of our lives with alien lizard." How great and full of potential is the concept of Elizabeth the Starchild? All they could do is turn her into a bored, tearful teenager to compete romantically with her mother? Marc Singer was less ashamed to be in Beastmaster II than when he was stuck in this nonsense ... what matters is that you are one of the youngest people that V has just discovered or one of us, the science fiction fans that we search to rediscover a bit of old fun, save yourself and PASS THIS!
