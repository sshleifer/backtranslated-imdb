This is a movie about people who receive a love letter. No one knows who sent and nobody knows who it is for. A good cast, led by Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres. This, however, is a completely boring plot. As an example, the character of Capshaw, one of the main citizens of a small town in New England, talks to an immature college student who works at his bookstore during the summer. She chooses him instead of Tom Selleck, the village fireman who is crazy about her. If that is not the epitome of stupidity, I do not know what it is. Just an example of how silly this movie is. Seeing Kate Capshaw running is a pleasure, but you immediately realize that she has never run a day in her life. Another obviously silly part of a silly movie.
