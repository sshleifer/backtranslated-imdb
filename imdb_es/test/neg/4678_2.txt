The name of Bad Company's greatest hits album is called "10 From 6". You could have uploaded this album and cut the sound of this movie. Most of the songs reproduced in the film were from this album. I guess the old people in the 70s were probably tired of all the period pieces made in the 1930s and 1940s. That's how I feel about the movies made about the 1970s. The characters in the movie They looked like they were auditioning for Danny Terrio. Why is it that movies have to exaggerate the 1970s? The only piece of good period that I liked was "Freaks and Geeks". They cut that television show. It was exactly how things were in high school when I returned around 1980. I was old enough to remember the 70s and no small city was like that. He was totally dominated by youth. There were no reactionaries talking about the hippies and the downtown area of ​​Philadelphia. That was more than 70 I remember when I was a kid. This movie was very boring and corny. Sometimes, I was falling asleep. I do not know why an actor who played during the 70s appeared on this actor. He was probably trying to give him some credibility. Walken did not even show up until the second half. I guess the only real thing about the movie was that the "baby boomers" were / are a spoiled batch. All the children in the movie were spoiled brats. I do not know what they had against their father.
