On the one hand, he produced this movie. It has the feeling of later films with international cast that bend. The opening credits tell us that it was filmed in Vienna. <br /> <br /> Bey was a delight in Universal's adventure films of the 1940s. It was also excellent in a movie I saw about ten years ago, but I've never heard of that: "The Amazing Mr. X." Maybe it was Dr. X. I remember it as an exciting and terrifying movie. <br /> <br /> This is quite wooden, unfortunately. The plot is not easy to follow. When I understood the subject, I was disappointed anyway. <br /> <br /> Francis Lederer looks great as a concert pianist. He was a very handsome man leader ten or fifteen years before. He never realized he was an important star, although he should have. <br /> <br /> This is not terrible, but it is quite heavy.
