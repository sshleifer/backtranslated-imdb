Wow ... as a big fan of the western tales of Larry McMurtry and the Lonesome Dove series in particular, I was looking forward to Comanche Moon. What a tremendous disappointment. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the excellence of Lonesome Dove ... the story, the characters, the cinematography, the music ... everything worked. <br /> <br /> Comanche Moon comes in comparison Through a bad work of Saturday Night Live. The characters are completely colorless, the dialogue is babbling and the plot meanders without thinking everywhere. It seems that all the actors read TelePrompTers. I could not relate to any of the characters, good, bad, or even incidental characters. The performance of David Midthunder stands out in particular. It looks like it was ripped from an eighth grade high school performance. I'm sorry, I'd like to find something positive to say about Comanche Moon, but I can not do it. There is nothing there.
