Okay, I felt that a Mormon movie, about Mormons, for Mormons would be a disaster waiting to happen, but I did not know how painful it would be. A little known fact is that Mormons have always made exceptionally good propaganda films. The official film campaign of the Church has produced rare and lasting gems that transcend the Mormon community, including the wonderful short film "Cipher in the Snow", which ended up being an educational film in the late 70's. Then there is the disturbing masterpiece by Neil LaBute ... <br /> <br /> However, the success of these films depended to a large extent on the fact that they did not focus on Mormons or on any specific Mormon theology. Instead, they choose to focus on a universal theme and treat it at a basic human level. The "Army of God" abandons any pretext of universality and rushes to the world of orthodoxy and behind. While this might be enough to alienate anyone except the most devout Mormon, director Richard Ductcher's ineptitude as a filmmaker and his youthful approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge that the "Army of God" is not compatible with almost any standard. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's horrifying performance in wood sets the tone for his army of the less interesting Mormons you're likely to encounter. Of course, the pitiful performances of the cast have not been helped by Dutcher's pathetic script. He must be given credit for not avoiding some of the most controversial aspects of the Church, but, as can be expected, conveniently frames these controversies in a sympathetic light. It should also not be surprising that most of the answers to the darkest side of the Church are addressed with little more than faith. At one point, a couple of African-Americans chided an African-American missionary for joining a segregated church until 1978 (about ten or twenty years after nearly all the congregations in the most degenerate parts of the south had already done so). Instead of addressing the actively racist history of the Church, perhaps the most sensitive place in Mormon theology that even church leaders no longer advocate, the disturbing character of Dutcher instead reflects on the assassination of Joseph Smith, a obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching. Complete this syrup of milk with syrup with third degree lepers jokes that become a comic relief and has a solid case for the resurgence of silent films. <br /> <br /> If you knew little about Mormons before watching this movie, you could become prone. To avoid them at all costs. If you are Mormon, this movie offers absolutely nothing to be proud of.
