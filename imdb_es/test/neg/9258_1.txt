Staten Island filmmaker Andy Milligan is well known in the horror community for being an even worse director than Ed Wood. And with this as a tenuous example of their production, I agree with them. In "The Ghastly Ones" we basically have three couples who fight and travel to their childhood home (located on a conveniently isolated island) to collect an inheritance. There they are killed one by one and the events unfold in the form of murder / mystery with a hunchback and retarded butler with added scars to launch you in a loop. The movie is in such a bad state that it seems that someone just passed it through a dishwasher, the sound is terrible, the dialogue is bad, there is some primitive mannequin (plus some dismemberment and guts) and is technically inept in every way. may be inept But is it nice in a bad movie? A kind of It is unbearable to see but strangely entertaining in the form of train clashes. Approach with caution. If you're not a fan of horrible movies, better dig into this one.
