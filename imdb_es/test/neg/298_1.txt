How can you make a joke about the mafia? It's not the kind of subject to laugh! A close movie can not make me laugh, because I'm comparing it to Jane Austen's mafia. Mafia! It was not a good movie, but Hoods is really worse! In Mafia!, There were some good jokes, but in this there are maybe two or three ... that make you smile. Not very bad actors but very bad scenario !! Surely we prefer something serious like The Godfather. I give * of *****
