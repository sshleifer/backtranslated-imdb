In part, it is bad luck for "Illuminata" to appear after "Shakespeare in Love", since it deals virtually with the same themes of life as art, art as life and the Magic of Theater and the same Archetypal Files of Popular Theater , but much more heavily. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that come to life, as a play is developed and reinterpreted in the life of a writer, but there is a lot of ego of Orson Welles in this produced by / directed by / driven by John Torturro as a vehicle for his wife Katharine Borowitz (with an adorable cameo of his son). <br /> <br /> Each actor has their moment literally in the spotlight, but there are many "masks" or sets that look like nineteenth-century parlor games. Bill Irwin speaks. Susan Sarandon becomes a diva. Christopher Walken becomes a different villain: a gay critic. Women have to undress unnecessarily because it is an art film. <br /> <br /> The art and the overall direction are wonderful, although quite dark. This should get a prize like Best Use of a Jersey City theater like A Set Ever In a Movie. (originally written on 8/21/99)
