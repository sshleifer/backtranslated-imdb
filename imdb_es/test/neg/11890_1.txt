I was forced to watch this movie for my World Reigonal Geography class. This movie is what is wrong in the United States today, instead of discovering the best way to get out of difficult times or situations that we would prefer to complain about how it is someone else's fault. This movie goes through the fall of Flint, Michigan, and the 100% fault of General Motors. In the process of doing so, Moore goes to great lengths to get General Motors executives to become villains simply because they are doing their job in a capitalist society. Moore films several evictions throughout the film and does not even ask once if the person is being evicted due to a layoff from GM. Also, never interview the owners of the filmed tenants. Moore does everything possible to twist historical events to fit his political agenda in this film of pure propaganda.
