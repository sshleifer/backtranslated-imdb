It is disappointing to see such a talented actor as Amitabh Bachchan in such a weak role, especially when he was beyond sensational in BLACK (which I highly recommend). One line of the film says: "Sakar is not a simple man, it is a thought and a philosophy". Director Ram Gopal Varma attributes THE GODFATHER as an inspiration for this film, and that may be the problem. It looks like a poorly adapted American film in India. The Left Elbow Index considers seven elements of film creation: acting, continuity, plot, character development, dialogue, art and production series, on a scale from a maximum of 10 to a minimum of 1, with 5 dice as a average score. The continuity of the film seems high, an 8, maintaining a violent tone impregnated with drama in places, and using justice outside the legal system as motivation. However, there seems to be a lack of emotion related to the evil of organized crime. The performance qualifies 4, it seems too weak, even when someone is being beaten or killed, it seems hoohum. For example, when a character is shot in the forehead, I found myself wondering if, or when, I was going to fall. He does not, and the Ronald Reagan wing is placed in a car, with his bleeding face cradled to the John F. Kennedy wing. The plot qualifies 5 as an example of American-style gangsterism, with a family-oriented Robinhood at the helm. The development of the character seems static, and the characters look like chess pieces on an abandoned chessboard, so they get a rank of 3. The dialogue seems forced, and seems to be forced to conform to a Bowery language pattern: a 4 for the dialogue. The sets of production seem to be below average: a 4. And, the art is disconcerting, with too many close-ups, too fast a panorama and too many group scenes in which the actors seem too rehearsed, a 3. For me too Much camera movement is disruptive. The average of the Left Elbow Index is 4.4, and with a slight deduction based on a poor derivatism, it is reduced to a 4. Two questions arise continuously in the film: one, why are so many people eating so often? Does not India have its own brand of organized crime? Should films like this have to be so dependent on Western cultural examples? As much as I like Amitabh Bachchan, I can not recommend this movie.
