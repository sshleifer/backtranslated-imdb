One day I was watching TV with a friend and watched the last twenty minutes of "Going Bananas". Believe me when I say it was enough to get a good judgment of the movie. The first scene I saw was the monkey, the boy, the fat and the black that looked like Dave Chappelle, flying in a feather duster thousands of feet in the air. While everyone else was solemn about the trip, the monkey seemed to be in a kind of drug binge where he shouted something that looked like the fastest English word. Then they landed on a twenty-meter long dock in Africa. After a heart said goodbye where the monkey cried (Hahaha), the "villains" of the film appeared. They were tearing themselves completely in their vintage Cadillac when the evil monkey took an Air Jordan jump from the dock to the ship that sailed 40 yards away and had them sink their beautiful car into the Pacific Ocean. After seeing this movie, I have a new purpose in life; to find the dwarf who played the monkey and stab him in the eye with a fountain pen.
