I have read many reviews in the IMDb (well, the five that were written at the time I write this) and I am surprised by the amount of praise received by The Brideless Groom, which is undoubtedly one of the minor comedies made by the Stooges. I prefer the older ones where Larry, Curly and Moe were, although Shemp credits most of the funny scenes in Sing to Song of Six Pants, another Stooges short that is only moderately funny but far superior to the Brideless Groom. In fact, there is a single slightly amusing scene in the movie, the "do not hit a lady" scene, which is just funny and takes 15 minutes of filming. It's not very promising in a 17-minute comedy. <br /> <br /> Shemp is a voice coach whose uncle has passed away and left him a $ 500,000 inheritance, as long as he gets married within 48 hours, which is as brief a notice as it is, but for When Shemp finds out, he only has 7 hours left. This is a premise that had been made and remade before, but it was not, I do not think, a massive clich√© at the time this movie was made, as it is now. There are a number of gags throughout the film, none of which is even close to the level of comedy for which the Three Stooges are so well known. It seems that the Stooges have encountered the same problems that affected so many Shirley Temple films. There is very little confidence in the content and too much confidence only in the fact that they are there. <br /> <br /> The standard features of the Stooges are here, Moe is the mean, whose pettiness is certainly not used. Moderately in this film, and the slapstick sound effects (although with more exceptions than usual) are quite funny, but are connected to their standard slots in this movie. The line "Hold Hands, lovebirds" is immortal. The rest of the movie is not. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of talk among the other people who have reviewed this film for this site, since this is one of the best Stooges shorts, you will not find a weak moment, about how this is your best moment from the shorts of the early 30s. It just is not true. I can certainly understand a level of automatic respect for the classics of landmarks and the giants of early comedy, which are certainly the Three Stooges, but that respect is affected when the poorer films are praised more than they should be. The Brideless Groom deserves some respect because it's a Stooges movie, but for the same reason, it should have been better. The Three Stooges were better than this.
