I'm not surprised that so many people have fallen in love with this one. When I was watching this movie, a couple of spectators next to me sobbed each time I was "supposed" to sob, or at least felt "touched". Like when Hunting said he did not love the girl. As when the character of Robin Williams (sorry, I forgot the name of his role) told Hunting repeatedly "It's not your fault" (oh, Lord, just thinking about that scene gives me goose bumps). I could not have worried less about what would happen to the characters. Many people cry for characters made in Hollywood that can not even relate (think Titanic, yuck!) ... but really only made me tremble and want to leave the theater. I guess I just refuse to be manipulated psychically and emotionally by all this. <br /> <br /> People, it's not me who is being condescending ... those characters are, and not for a good reason, because they are unreal. Worse still, nothing is new or surprising. Even the character of Robin Williams is all clich√©. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 out of 10. Probably not so bad; it's just pretty mediocre ... but a lot of people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10, so I thought that a single balance vote would not hurt.
