Coen Brothers-wannabe, by writer and director Paul Chart, relies too much on ideas drawn from other (best) films, but manages to create a spooky atmosphere that keeps you watching. Robert Forster unravels like never before to play a psychopath psychiatrist (ha ha) who goes on a spree in the desert. The film is unusual, but in its attempt to stay a step ahead of the audience, it becomes alienating and unpleasant (with a role for Amanda Plummer that is downright humiliating). An end certainly brave, many extravagant details of business, and Forster looking great in the nude, make this an element of curiosity, nothing more. Veteran film director Irvin Kershner produced, and perhaps should direct as well (could Paul Chart be a pseudonym?). * 1/2 of ****
