This is really the worst movie I've seen. For a while, I got used to watching terrible movies, like "Battlefield Earth", "Delta Force Commando" and "Starship". All these movies are movie gems compared to Ironheart. <br /> <br /> It does not make much sense to summarize this scrap piece; I think it's more beneficial to summarize my reaction to the movie, which is this: I get furious and I want to start the tape from the VCR and record it after (approximately) 80 minutes of playback. <br /> I qualify this movie with a 0, but IMDb does not allow you to rate a movie with less than 1. I give it a 0 knowing that I am saying that any movie that has a score higher than 0 is infinite (indefinitely ) Many times better than this - That's really how bad it is.
