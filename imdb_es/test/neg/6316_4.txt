Being a big street fighter fan and thoroughly enjoying the previous movie, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, I was really looking forward to it! <br /> <br /> However, it seemed that the film did not have a real sense of direction or purpose. Most of the characters I could not associate with and just lacked the intense action that made the other movie fighters street mentioned so superior. <br /> <br /> However, there are some positive points, the Animation is excellent!
