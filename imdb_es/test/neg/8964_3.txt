As someone has already mentioned in this forum, it is very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires tremendous skill, rhythm, patience, "distance" from the director, a plausible premise, a narrative "flow" and a truly credible performance (also known as a GREAT performance). <br /> <br /> This is not the case with 'Love Machine'. He begins to show his fake hand around the 20 minute mark (there are 60 minutes to see), and the viewer begins to realize that he is being admitted. It's downhill from there. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon. But to be fair to Eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he started wanting to make a REAL document, he could not get financing and he settled for a cheaper way to make his film. <br /> <The premise - people who have secret lives when posted on a pornography website - maybe it was more interesting in 1997-98, when the movie was made. Eriksen does a lot of difficult things, an aggressive host, handheld cameras, zooms, grainy blacks and whites, everything, I suppose, to elicit a sense of authenticity, but it just does not work. The film is confused and forced, but what finally brings it down is the credibility of the actors and the rather horrible dialogue.
