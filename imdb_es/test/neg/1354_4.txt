I think you can write a complete book about the odyssey to remake the classic film on which this film is based. When Hollywood started talking about this type of company, the reaction was always negative because there were too many aspects that could have gone wrong, starting with the solid set that made the original unforgettable, and that's where things start to sour here, with the selection. of actresses who can otherwise do a remarkable job, but who are not suitable for the parties, and unfortunately, have been directed with the hard hand of a director who does not understand or appreciate the original material. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is no focus or direction, or that the direction that has been taken is to erase everything good from the original movie. This is called updating, since we eliminate the humor story, the agile dialogue and any interesting premise. More than anything, let's prove that women have come a long way, except that the problem is that we really do not (at least to see this movie) where women really go. <br /> <br /> To begin with, choosing Meg Ryan in the central role is almost fatal to the film because, somehow, it seems to have been locked in a kind of limbo where women do not really change their appearance, even after 20 years of working in the cinema. Her Mary, who proved to be a difficult role in the 1930s, somehow emerged from her interaction with the other stereotypes, such as Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz" by learning, observing and realizing that she had a choice in the matter . It may not have been a choice that women would celebrate today, but it was a fun ride, and part of the fun was the malicious, silly, and sometimes slapstick routines that elevated that movie to the realm of the sublime. Here, we are down to earth with a thud. By changing the nature of Sylvia, the film has lost much of its spark, and anyway it is not the fault of Annette Bening. I could not help but admire how she tried to save this sinking ship and experienced a sinking feeling as she struggled with the horrible lines they handled. Fortunately, I amused myself by looking at some of her magnificent outfits and I kept reminding myself how talented this lady really was. Your Sylvia is wise but flawed, and it could have been a great creation. Unfortunately, Ms. English did not pay attention to her own work and loses control of the only character that could have turned the film into a new direction. <br /> <br /> However, that was not the biggest blasphemy of all. . In the original, we have Joan Crawford probably doing one of the best performances of a woman. Its crystal is legendary, with intricate lines, incendiary movements, duplicate maneuvers and some very attractive poses. She was the link between the masculine and the feminine, and through it we knew what the whole catastrophe was about. She provided the tension between men and women. She was dangerous, sexy, the best fatal woman. A woman of intelligence that we feared and admired, and most importantly, that we wanted to destroy to save our heroine. Eva Mendes, as beautiful as she is, is two-dimensional in this output due to a weak writing and, once again, to a bad casting. <br /> <br /> There are more atrocities in the film, such as the addition of a terrible role for Mensing as the dedicated mother who lives by having babies and Pinkett's rather annoying lesbian turn. Then comes the biggest loss of talent in the film, since Bette Middler, who is a bit unrecognizable in her makeup, shows the spark of what could have been. His acid delivery reminds us of the contemporary angle that the film could have taken. His words revive and put a lot of things so necessary in the film, and it is exciting to see that it can really fly, then it goes. She is in the movie every six minutes, and vanishes in the middle of the confusion. <br /> <br /> Here is a movie that raised our level of anticipation and really disappointed us, a film that could have joined the successful "Sex in the City" that made an incredible transition to the big screen because it respected his source of information and he did not commit. It gave us more, bigger and better adaptation. He really updated what had made him successful before. "The Women" in his present reincarnation needs to go back and work again, like "The Hulk" did this year, find more suitable artists, a good writer and, above all, someone who really values ​​what good people are films. about.
