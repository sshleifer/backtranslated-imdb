Okay, here's the short of everything ... this movie is full of cheesy dialogues, about top performance and a threadbare script. <br /> <br /> There are moments that tried to be very dramatic but that are simply comical. Due to the superior and badly written lines of action. I could not help but laugh at the moments that must have been very serious. The bright spot in this movie is the circus. Seeing the circus at its height was undoubtedly a pleasure. <br /> <br /> There are moments that are so good. But then he fell back into the territory of the movie B I was tempted to stop seeing him several times. However, I do not know how he won the best image. It must have been a slow year!
