I mean the undead, but my mind is still not sure of the walking dead, frozen. Unfortunately, COOLING did not help me decide. This is really slow and nothing happens during the first 45 minutes, which makes me press the "film enhancement" button several times. When well-designed zombies appear, it's already too late and the director (it is rumored that two filmed this) has no idea how to shoot them. Haggerty, Blair and Donahue look tired / embarrassed / recovering in some way. I will give credit to the movie since it is prior to the T2 termination with villains frozen by liquid nitrogen. The Shriek Show DVD offers an extended promotional roll from the day that lasts 8 minutes and I would actually recommend it for the film to be seen completely.
