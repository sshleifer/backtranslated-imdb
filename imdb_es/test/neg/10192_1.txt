Christian propaganda ... Many fears ... <br /> <br /> This is not SciFi, this is ChriFi (Christian fiction). The movie started well, but it took an abrupt turn to the Christian right. From then on, everything was about god, jc, the holy bible and the devil. UFOs are just a demonic deception to trick people into believing that there is another intelligent life in the universe. Satan's idea is to trick you into thinking that there might be more to life than what is in the Bible. <br /> <br /> The kidnappings could be used to explain the abduction. The people who stayed behind would believe that it was a massive alien abduction, instead of God taking all Christians to heaven. There is no reason to repent if they are extraterrestrials. The deeper message in the movie is that if you do not believe in God and have Jc in your life, then you do not believe in anything and your life has no purpose.
