James Cagney plays Richard Gargan (nicknamed "Patsy"!), A former gangster who now oversees sullen boys as the new superintendent of a state-run reform school. Warm gender entry in which Cagney is the complete show; dominates the image, but only because there is not much more interest. Jimmy gives exactly what is expected of his hard character, which can be satisfying if you find yourself in a quick fix. The direction (by Archie Mayo, although it was said that Michael Curtiz had helped) is direct without being particularly captivating, although the narrative slips in the second half, sweeping the film to a disorderly conclusion (even with Cagney's Patsy getting lost in the shuffle) . It was remade in 1938 as "Crime School" and again in 1939 as "Hell's Kitchen". ** since ****
