This is certainly not a comedy, I do not know what was marketed that way. Like a serious movie, it lacks any kind of substance. Unless you have not left Sunday school or need your arrangement of Noah, you will find yourself bored to tears. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast removed what little remained of the film. Lauren Graham plays an empty housewife without real depth. Your children do not really add anything to the movie. They seem to be around only to meditate on their absent father at the beginning. Jonah Hill plays a spooky Internet addict who is not so much fun. <br /> <br /> I found the original as a decent movie. Disappointed that this really did not go anywhere.
