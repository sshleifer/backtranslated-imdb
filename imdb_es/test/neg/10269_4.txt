HBO production typically elaborated with a first class cast, a rich small-town ambiance and some nice narrative vignettes, adorned with above-average production values. <br /> <br /> But, and that's a big "but", the various secondary frames, populated with some nice caricatures, mostly annoying, are paper thin and come and go in boring stretches for more than three long hours. <br /> <br /> The story, often silly, runs uncomfortably between the melodrama, without being entertaining. enough, and personal drama, without being profound at all. <br /> <br /> A pity, because some scenes really shine. Two or three, that is. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 dirty Paul Newmans
