This was a horrible short film that tries to be funny in a dark way but it was not at all. Say at a film festival in Chicago. It really is what the title says and I just did not like it at all. The bad story was what he did. If you rewrote it and re-record it, it "could" work. This attempt fell into "the hole". The horrible cinema.
