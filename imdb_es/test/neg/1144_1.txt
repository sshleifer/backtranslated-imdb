I sat down for 2 hours. I do not know what was worse, the horrible plot, the lame characters or the Hawaiian hottie with whom Eddie, the 11-year-old boy and the 80-year-old grandfather, made sexual advances towards. The money spent on this was simply thrown on the throne. Matty Simmons should be ashamed. The original idea for this movie was "A Family Family Griswold" and somehow it became this mess. The only bright spot is that the ratings were so bad that we will never see this on TV again. AVOID ALL THE COSTS ... RENT ERNEST SAVES XMAS or something else.
