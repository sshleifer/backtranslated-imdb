There I sit at home in the morning, suddenly my brother checks what seems to be the most stupid looking movie I've ever seen. Considering that it was the 70s and special effects were not for sharpe, this movie almost equals the definition of garbage. The stupid monsters, the stupid plot and the stupid scenario made this the worst movie I've seen in my life. So bad, in fact, I did not even finish it, I did it to a certain extent and then proceeded to see how much time I could spend without putting a rope around my neck and hanging myself up. (I'm kidding haha) IMAGE OF THE MOVIE
