This strange Texas movie is about Fallon, a rich and dilettante guy in the late 1800s (although he looks like a 1960s C & W singer with greasy hair and sideburns) whose ship is shipwrecked on an island owned by Count DeSade (pronounced de-sayd) with its captain. The count fears the pirates and tortures a young woman who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. Meanwhile, the dreadful nurse Cassandra tells Fallon the secrets of the castle. The Countess has leprosy and went crazy! Fallon is stuck but brings supplies. The captain is killed by a racist-caricatured slave. Fallon is thrown into the dungeon with the leper, who always thinks it's her wedding day. The leprous bride is horny, but Cassandra kills her. Fallon and Cassandra escape from the castle, but the count and his slave chase them with dogs. DeSade kills the slave and Fallon kills DeSade. Fallon and Cassandra fall in love over the next year, but when the supply ship arrives, the crew refuses to take our lovers because now both are lepers. They live for years in the castle ... Fallon's hair turns gray and Cassandra goes crazy. Fallon puts her in the dungeon. Our tale of love and leprosy ends. <br /> <br /> So strange that you can see, and you can smell the popcorn.
