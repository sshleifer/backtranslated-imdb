I rented this movie because Elijah Wood has done a good job and I thought that this could be an overlooked treasure. It was not a treasure. I do not know if it was straight to the video, but it should have been straight to the dumpster. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood fans will like the fact that he appears shirtless in a too short shower scene. But, no sensible person would like this script. Imagine Memento played by teenage actors, but ten times more confusing and a hundred times less plausible. Case in point: Janeane Garofalo plays a loving psychologist (apparently, "keeps the chain of mediocrity alive"). <br /> <br /> As if the syndromes of false memories and medicine about the mind over matter were not hokey enough, the film also depends on one of those unexplained psychic twins that keep the plot moving and the audience puzzled This same twin bond creates too many artificial love scenes between the character of Wood and the girl from She's All That, who plays the holy sister of Wood's angry friend, a cancer victim. <br /> <br /> Adding to the harshness of this In the script, Wood's other friends are a victim of cancer with mental problems and Kidney, a young black man with a mysterious kidney disease. The desire to die from the kidney becomes a reality when Dr. Garofalo gives him his own Walkman. The trilled function of this character in the story is compared to his relationship of walking, of walking again. Usually, Kidney has a wheelchair, has several unexplained scenes that show him pushing others around. <br /> <br /> The characterization of Kindey may be a small detail, but it is indicative of the many other flaws in this film. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is definitely clumsy, but never flies.
