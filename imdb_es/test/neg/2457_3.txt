The only thing more full of holes than the premise of this movie is its script. Flatliners is the ideal showcase for Joel Schumacher's lack of glorious, extravagant, cheeky talent. The plot is totally illogical but super false and heavy, and everything is directed by art to an inch of his life in the most cliché and overheated way. I love that the autopsy room at the medical school is a cavernous marble mausoleum with little red light and huge paintings by Rembrandt hanging on the walls. I love how Keifer Sutherland drives an army jeep backed by canvas. No one in Joel Schumacher's films lives in a non-eccentric way. It is always an alternative universe where we are all young and painfully hip, but the hip is strict and obsessive according to the idea of ​​the middle-aged billionaire middle-aged man-child hip and out of touch. And holy shit! The part where Baldwin brother # 16 dies and comes back to life and then is persecuted by all the women he has slept with who says: "I'll call you" and "I just need some space" is the funniest thing of the world. universe!!!! In what kind of world do we live where Joel Schumacher gets people to give him money? The "flatliners" made me want to review all the work of man only for the type of high quality yuks that it contains.
