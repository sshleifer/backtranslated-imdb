Seeing this movie in advance, I thought it would be witty and in a good mood. Unfortunately, it was a standard case of "the funny bits were in the preview", not to say that everything was bad. But "the good parts were in the preview". <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a teen movie that puts you to sleep, watch this movie.
