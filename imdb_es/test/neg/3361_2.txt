Hi, I'm Derrick Cannon and welcome to the first Cannonite review program. My movie for this week was debatable, what route, what movie, what an excellent four-star epic I would choose, guess what I decided to take an eighty and the other route, I decided to revise a film so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept. The movie that I will review today is Jack Frost Two, the revenge of the mutant killer snowman. The stars in this film include Christopher Allport as Sam Tiller, Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller, Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Agent Manners, Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun, Ray Cooney as Colonel and Scott MacDonald as Snow Killer. Jack. Frost <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny Jack Frost (I loved the carrot scene), but it's even harder to believe that this is exactly the same cast . The movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and was introduced to Captain Fun. What was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie? The only possible reason I could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was the total forage of the snowman. Sam Tiler seemed more paranoid than he did in the original, his babbling on antifreeze was one of the most pathetic exhibitions he had seen in a movie. His wife however was one of the few bright spots. She played her role as the main woman up to the hilt. It was a voice of reason in the cinema of pure idiocy. The scene in which he discovers how to kill snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the film. Ray MacDonald once again did a great job as Jack Frost despite what they gave him. If it were not for such weak characters, he could have been immortalized as Chucky, Freddy and Jason. Laugh if necessary, but when it comes down to it, Jack Frost hurt himself, had humor and, most importantly, had an undeniable vicious streak. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been much more, I could have done it. It has been a continuation of a great franchise, however, all plans to make a Jack Frost three have been canceled. <br /> <br /> This movie has a two out of ten for me, and it's lucky that even one.
