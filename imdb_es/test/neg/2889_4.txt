*** SPOILER ALERT *** An incoherent and confusing incendiary drama that has to do with a sinister plan to burn an important resort before New Year's Day. Being insured for ten million dollars, the man behind Valley View Estates in the Blue Mountains in Australia Julian Fane, Guy Doleman, is determined to bring his own project to the flames to collect. This must happen before January 1, two weeks later, before the project's insurance policy runs out. <br /> <br /> With his mind totally focused on his work, architect Howard Anderson, Tom Skerritt, has no idea that his boss, Julian Fane, is planning to burn the complex he is building and possibly establish him as the boy of the fall. Anderson suspects a little when insurance researcher Sophie McCann, Wendy Hughes, informs her about some suspicious events between Fane and the insurance company Proud Alliance. It turns out that Proud Allience is actually owned, or 60% of it, by the same Fane. This explains why the Fane serum has all these arsons to collect the ten million dollars in insurance, which is at least double the value of Valley View Estates! <br /> <br /> Later we have Sophie McCann murdered, in a fake swimming accident, to prevent her from discovering what is happening with the suspicious potato chips around and in Valley View Estates. It is when Lloyd's of London, which is subscribing to Proud Alliance, insurance researcher George Engles, James Mason, appears that Fane takes a gunpowder leaving his arsonist on his own and out of control to destroy Fane's entire plan. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Anderson has noticed both Fane and Engles, who, unlike Fane, want Valley View Estates to sink for reasons that are never explained clearly, just look at the latest seconds of the film to realize that, for its writer and director. The arsonist is exposed as he is doing in his girlfriend with Anderson who comes to rescue her. Then we have this wild chase scene with the arsonist getting lost at the construction site of Valley View just to set it on fire, with the help of Howard Anderson, where it ends up burning until the time the fire department came to the hose. he knocked down <br /> <br /> The sudden and inexplicable ending never made clear what happened to the Big Cheese in all this scheme of things that the sinister and evil Julian Fane. It is as if Fane had escaped from Scot free and only his henchman, unstable and upset, the arsonist, who was only the instrument of Fane's crimes, ended up being the only person who paid for them.
