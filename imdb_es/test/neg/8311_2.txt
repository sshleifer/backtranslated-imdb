As bad as this movie is, I like it a lot. The bad acting, the dialogue and the action made it so fun. I loved John Travis from Omega Cop and I stayed up all night working on how the Death Machines registered at the airport if they can not talk, I probably had to shake / nod at the security questions. Actually, why can not they talk? It does not adhere to any kind of movie-making convention that makes it strangely interesting to watch, just a lot of people who die in a very loose plot surrounding killers, there are no "machines" like that and those weird things on the face / mountain in front. Cover and trailer do not appear! I love the fact that there is not a good boy in this film until almost half and I love the many useless scenes of the landing of an airplane: many people die that have nothing to do with the "plot" and do not give any Explanation. On anything - DO NOT expect to understand this movie. Instead, admire how the main good man can not even handle a randomly older man in the bar, who introduces himself as the bad man, but speaks against the bartender's decision to hire a woman with little clothes to dance badly in the corner for "entertainment" - all good guys seem to enjoy this! Why the old man could hit our hero, and why did the guy randomly decide to help the old man in the fight ?! Why the hero collapsed under a punch from an old guy in the bar where a stream of water came out in the background so that it seemed to come out of his mouth? Defined Top 20 B-Movie, you must check for a part 2.
