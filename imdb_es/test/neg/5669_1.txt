If you think Hannah Montana or Suite Life are at the bottom of comedies, then obviously you've never seen iCarly. iCarly is, without a doubt, the worst show I've seen. From the lifeless performance to the low budget, the show smells cheap, like Chinese food last week to simmer in your overheated car. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around a beautiful, cheerful and "is supposed to be." The funny girl named Carly, while she and her friends make a live web show called iCarly. Carly lives alone with her older brother, who seriously needs some kind of counseling or something like that, because some cells are missing for the brain. <br /> <br /> The plots of the shows are very ridiculous and unbearably annoying. But having to watch Carly and her friend, Sam, do their little iCarly show in a show is even worse. Basically, they show strange images and stuff things in their noses while the laugh track plays over and over again. I mean seriously, every two seconds the hint of laughter seems to come without any reason. <br /> <br /> So, what is the point of this review? You can ask. Just to ridicule iCarly? Well, yes, but I also warn you to be careful with this show. Really, if I had to choose between seeing iCarly and Barney? Without a doubt, I would choose Barney.
