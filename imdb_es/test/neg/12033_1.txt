First, let me start by saying this very interesting SOUNDED movie: a serial killer that imitates the works of Edgar Allan Poe (who is one of my writers of all time). It sounds good, right? Yes, definitely not. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Forever. And that is not an exaggeration. I have seen many very, very bad movies. This takes the cake. And I even prepared for a bad movie before I started. <br /> <br /> Maybe the writer should have studied some law enforcement procedure: if you have the name of the murderer, his whole story, a criminal record, and his address, where is the first place where he should search for? Hmm. . possibly. . . his house? What?! DO NOT! That's an absurd idea, Anthony! How could you suggest something so obvious and sensible instead of going to a bowling alley? * end of spoilers * Honestly, sometimes I can forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad, or vice versa. . . but this had everything bad that I could find. <br /> <br /> I think my biggest annoyance was how the police / FBI acted. <br /> <br /> For example: Black FBI Agent: "Okay, woman in danger of extinction, just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while I go in and observe the possible crime scene in which it is supposed that a serial killer must be in. Is that okay? " FBI Agent Moronic Female: "Yes, that's fine with me, go ahead, I'll make sure I do not focus on what's around me or at least verify the perimeter." Black FBI agent: "Excellent, that's what I would do!" Honestly, if you want to participate in compliance with the law, rent this movie so you can learn how not to act. . . or if you are human and want to learn the same thing. <br /> <br /> 0.5 / 10: Half a point just to get a film produced and in stores. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
