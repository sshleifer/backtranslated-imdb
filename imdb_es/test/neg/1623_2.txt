The only redeemable quality of this movie (besides Ator's loincloth) is the hilarious performance on the part of the bad guy, Zor. This wonderfully exaggerated villain has a certain ... oh, Shakespearean presence that made this film bearable (hence the 2). He only giggled each time he did pirouettes, raising an incredulous eyebrow at the man of confidence or the hero. A true example of someone who does not get paid enough. (And that BARBA!) <br /> <br /> Now really, what happened to the 12-minute delta wing scene? Really, really, really bad. I can not emphasize that point enough. <br /> <br /> So, really, if you even worth watching this movie, look at the version of Mystery Science Theater 3000. With these beloved silhouettes, many horrendous movies have been tolerated.
