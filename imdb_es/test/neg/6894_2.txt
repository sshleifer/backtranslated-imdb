"This movie is great, I saw it with some friends and we thought it was proof that a movie does not have to be commercially successful to be successful." ... is what I wish I could say about this movie. In the words of the film itself "you are very very bad!" I went to see an acupuncturist without a license once, so I generally agree with the moral of the film. <br /> <br /> It would include a spoiler, but the lack of argument makes this very difficult. In general, a cinematic disaster. <br /> <br /> appointments; 'You are not a leper at all!' 'You're beautiful, and I bet you're good too' 'Have you ever seen the body of a naked man?' 'A piece of straw could not be broken'. <br /> <br /> Cameos when folding; Micheal cane x3, bishop harold, steve erwine, benjamin netinyahoo, iodine.
