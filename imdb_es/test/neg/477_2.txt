My brain screamed "why are you still looking? Turn it off and go to bed!" But the sofa chair won and I watched until the predictable end. I think when it's Bruce Campbell I have to give him a chance. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to complain about a low budget movie just for the low budget ... again and again we see a low budget Movies that prove that a good story, good writing and a good performance are enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce had their start only in a movie like this, but they did not seem to learn from Sam that it takes a bit more than hitting her to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It's also sad, because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70's and 80's, I can not believe that such bad movies are still being made. Bruce, I'm really disappointed.
