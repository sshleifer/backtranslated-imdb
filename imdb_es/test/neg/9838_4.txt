Here is a movie that was so pedestrian for 90% of it that it had no right to be so challenging and frustrating in the end. The director decided to suddenly become an author, 80% through the making of this film? Yeesh SPOILER ALERT The thing usually starts enough for 50 crazed young people; there are vagabonds, good girls, bad girls, gangs, the friendly old manager of the restaurant and the city. Things follow the expected path until about 15 minutes before the end, when the only sympathetic character is killed and the antihero is blamed (this would not be so unexpected if this were the main plot of the movie ... but all this. Things they begin to happen and unravel during the final reel! (Main curve ball) Then things get weird, the old and kind coder forms a mob and hits the hero until it becomes a bloody pulp. Hero somehow drags a confession of the real murderer: the crazy and creepy madwoman of the city (who, in any real universe, would have been the first suspect, even if he had met the antihero with his body). <br /> < We are left with a somewhat "weak" ending, which is almost as out of the ordinary with the rest of the film as the 10-minute events that precede it. <br /> <br /> Even more strange is the insistenc This movie is about playing the homosexual innuendo to the fullest, but constantly presenting the two male protagonists as heterosexuals. Maybe this was on purpose, maybe Bix's resistance to establishing himself with the girl was more due to his sexuality (which in the 50s would have to be kept quite repressed, and therefore not discussed or admitted by him) that his need to be a "vagabond" If the director's intention was to spin this as a sexual thread, drift drifts because he feels he is sexually marginalized; that his fatherly consideration towards Danny is not, in fact, paternal but spousal; that his inability to remain with Carrie is rooted in a sexual repulsion that even he does not fully understand, could have been clearer. Instead, we get this very strange alchemy of homoeroticism and behavior that is completely heterosexual. <br /> <br /> These young people sleep side by side even when they can have room to expand. When Danny is proposed (and once even in bed with a woman), Bix turns and takes him away. Danny pays Bix the way he does (of course, there's another explanation for that, but he still plays a chord every time you see Danny buying Bix's lunch). They end up living together at the end. Not since the "Rope" of Hitchcock homosexuality has been so blatant but denied. <br /> <br /> MST3K did the right thing by taking this. Apart from Jack Elam, there is little to congratulate the film.
