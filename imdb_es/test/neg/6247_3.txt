Hmmmmmmm - massacre of cheerleaders. Let me think: girls in high school are cut into pieces, except the one that survives. I have it. Next movie <br /> <br /> Actually, I was surprised that this was done in 2003. I really thought that they stopped making these films in the 80's. This was really your career of the mill slasher with sweet teenage eyes, stupid male horn dogs, even a dumbest adult male and a passionate teacher. Continues on the list of dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the forest. We've seen everything before. <br /> <br /> However, this had a few interesting twists in the plot that put it above normal, too, if you have some brain cells to fry and 2 hours Mata - you could do worse.
