The video case for this film says "a story of beauty, passion and forbidden fruit". Are you talking about the same movie that I just saw? They can not be, since the film that I just saw was beautiful, but there was no passion and, as for the fruit, all this is nonsense to attract the potential viewer to see this movie. If only I had some passion or some life, I would have enjoyed this movie a lot. Instead, it was an agonizing and not particularly interesting movie that I definitely would not want to see again. It's not that it's a bad movie (after all, it's very well filmed), but it's boring. I kept waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen, but then the movie just finished. There was not a great feeling of emotion, mystery or anything, just a rather uninteresting story about a girl who becomes a servant and spends the next 10 years of her life working as a maid.
