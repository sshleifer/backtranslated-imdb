Wow, I was told that this would be a B movie that is worth seeing. I feel like I was cheated after seeing this preview event. The plot is a twisted brand of several films at best. Even the title is a version of another movie if you can give the movie a lot of credit. I'm sorry to say that they took me to the cleaners. I would not waste your time on this. This movie seems to be a group of aspirants who came together and made a bad idea of ​​a movie a weekend with a borrowed camera. Being in the entertainment business, I can judge a decent movie and it deserves to be shelved or discarded. My advice, stick to a classic like the Sunrise of the Dead of 1979. On a scale of 1 to 10, even a 1 is being good for the producers because BLOWS this movie. (Below the limit of what stinks) Producers must stay in their day jobs. If you see the movie, be honest in its publication, it seems to have been promoted and inflated by a few. There are some who have seen this for what it is and have published correctly. I'm sorry, but, I have to say that this is one that should be omitted.
