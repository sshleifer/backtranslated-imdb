This is absolute nonsense, designed to impact and stimulate the mentality of the 60s. The performance is completely made of wood, composed mainly of ad-libbing, which results in actors who do not meet the standards dribbling first in what They can think, repetitively. <br /> <br /> The final result is a poorly written work that is being read by people who have no idea and who do not care. The only exception to this is the main character "Joe" (played by Joe Dallesandro) who spends much of the movie in a naked stupor (either stoned, or the only one in the piece who can act!) Please, do not think I do not "understand" Warhol, this is simply and simply a stinker that should never have come out of a film class.
