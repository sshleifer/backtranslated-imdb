Just when I thought nothing could be as offensive and / or irritating as a Billy Mays infomercial, I had the intellectually devastating experience of renting this garbage. Peter Barnes and John Irvin must be charged with criminal charges for smuggling this script to the public place. The actors must be accused of being accomplices, at a distance not less than the life of the public. <br /> <br /> This production offers the disclaimer, "For a dramatic effect, we have taken poetic license with certain facts", or some statement so inadequate to prepare you completely for the disgusting absolute disgust of a biblical story that he did not need to add drama. What they added was enough to make your I.Q. release three full points for every five minutes of viewing time. <br /> <br /> The "poetic license" taken, invents so strange characters, that it will only recognize the names of a few and, of course, the ark. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Noah and Lot live in Sodom, so maybe Abram was on holiday in Switzerland on a ski trip. Lot's wife, played by Carol Kane, is a harpy, and when he goes to a pillar of salt, Lot removes his finger and takes it in what appears to be an empty baby food jar. If that is "poetic", I am a kumquat. <br /> <br /> When Noah, who has now started drinking wine in quantities that could help to float the ark, complains about the hard work of the construction project, he wakes up one morning to discover that God has delivered enough wood. precut to lighten your load. At least I think it was God. It looked like a delivery of 84 Lumber, carefully stacked and packed. Maybe 84 Lumber is really an agent for God ????? Instead of getting bored with the load you're carrying, I'll remind you of the account of the pirate attack on the ark. Incongruous, do you think? This movie is full of such insulting nonsense. After an incalculable time in the waters, Noah spies on a pirate ship that goes directly to them. And who could be the salty sea captain? Well, duh, it's Lot, of course! My only surprise was that his uncle Abram was not on board. If you're going to kill a plot, kill all that. The attempted piracy was unsuccessful, and the braggart was pathetic, not poetic. I think it was around this mark that my nausea prevented me from punishing myself more. <br /> <br /> An ugly, absurd, meaningless distortion of anything that resembles a Bible account. On a scale of 1 to 10, this movie is premeditated mental abuse. Stupid and insulting, you will entertain yourself more by reading the Yellow Pages.
