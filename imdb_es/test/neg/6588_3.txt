The main problem with 9th Company (9 Rota) is that he is not sure if he wants to be a private Private Ryan or a Full Metal Jacket. Spielberg's attempts at sentimentality are embarrassing, like the burley sergeant crying in a field of red flowers. The training sequences do not have the intensity or realism that Kubrick gave them in his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Another reason for discord is that the Afghan fighters are called Ghosts because they attack and almost never see them. Here they attack a Russian fortress almost in formation without any attempt to use cover. I'm sure the tactics have advanced from Waterloo. <br /> <br /> Every scene of this movie has been seen before in other war movies and it has been made much better. <br /> <br /> I have to ask: Why do all the talented shooters have to chew a match? <br /> <br /> Finally, I always distrust a film that starts without a narrative, but still the end must be qualified. <br /> <br /> "We won!" ... errrr ....... no, you did not.
