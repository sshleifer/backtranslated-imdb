This was really the most painful experience I've had in a movie theater for quite some time. I will leave criticisms as easy as 'maudlin' or 'historically inaccurate' or 'horse shit' because our sympathies are immediately directed to these words. If a director wants to make a great epic of grandiose love, well, for God's sake, MAKE A BAD DAMN THAT CHANGES IN THE LOVE OF THE GREAT! Why bother with second-class harlequin romances so ridiculously unconvincing and so boring exchanges between characters that we can not be interested when the most decisive battle takes place on Canadian soil? And for pompous people who think 'oh, well, this story should focus on the characters!' Well, you're wrong, very wrong.
