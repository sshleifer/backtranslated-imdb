I came across this movie late at night on television. My brother and I could not stop laughing at how terrible this movie is. The sound effects of shit every time White Ninja or Black Ninja hit, kick or use a weapon are hilarious. This movie is almost on the same level as the Evil Dead series, but you can only watch this movie once because of fears. I'm not sure if the director intended it to be so bad on purpose because he knew that idiots like me would buy it.
