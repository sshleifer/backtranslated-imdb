WEBS is a rather strange movie, although a little visible. Richard Grieco plays an electrician who is absorbed by a mutant spider parallel to Earth, or something like that. The film itself was made with a modest budget, which explains the limited scenarios and the somewhat tedious script that manages to do very little with a very interesting premise. Basically, a 90-minute episode of the television show "Sliders", and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review and reviews of other films in the genre)
