It is not the best of the WIP, but not the worst either. Honestly, I feel guilty about laughing at this movie, since it had to be a minimum of career for everyone involved. However, the acting, the dialogue, the absurd scenarios and the booming microphone always present me more and more and they certainly increase their film charm. As a big fan of Linda Blair, the top (or topless) honors are for Sybil Danning. Also, special congratulations to Henry Silva, who is the only one in the cast who does not play his role too seriously. Watching, the movie now, however, makes me see the character of Stella Stevens more closely. She plays the chief officer, and I wonder if Hilary Clinton decided to adopt her current appearance and behavior. After all, I'm sure she did not have to look beyond her husband's video collection to find this movie. It's not that I'm judging. I have seen it myself several times, and all this makes me wonder what would have happened if Mr. Clinton had been allowed to install a Jacuzzi in the Oval Office. Hmmm
