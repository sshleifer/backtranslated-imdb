When I saw this movie, I think I was a freshman in high school and I still want to charge Master P for the hour and 20 minutes he took from my life and I will never go back. <br /> <br /> The boy who has already published is completely correct. Master P is an aspiring mobster. He, like all the other rappers in this country, won millions of dollars selling rap CDs to impressionable white youths in this country. It is well known that the Mafia was not a black thing and that blacks were not allowed to be part of it. As unfair as rappers may be, it can not be dealt with. Does this movie paint Master P as a mobster named Nino? The script is terrible with the gameplay. Completely incredible While searching, I came up with a link or something that said I was planning to make another movie called "The Black Sopranos." <br /> <br /> Please, avoid that and stick to Nickalodeon. You are not a white mobster, you are not even a good actor Master P, please, stay with your music for the sake of whoever listens to it these days ...
