From 2002, Dutch cinema finally improved again. This film is still part, and is an example of a school book about the bad period of Dutch cinema. <br /> <br /> The story is told unnecessarily in a flashback style. All the "current" sequences established in France are completely redundant and do not add anything to history, emotions or power. For some reason, European filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story, not chronologically. I never understood why, nor what is its appeal. <br /> <br /> The I of the story is not exactly the best either. It is not always clear where the film is going and what it is trying to tell. The story of an inexperienced young man who falls in love with a young savage, who later turns out to be quite psychotic, may sound quite good on paper and even shows some parallels to the "Turkish fruit" of Paul Verhoeven, with which this film I compared often. Before and at the time of its launch. However, the final result is far from comparable. History fails to capture the right emotions, which is also due to the unimaginative representations of the actors. The way the story is told also makes the film far from always interesting or compelling. I lost interest in this movie in about 40 minutes through the movie. <br /> <br /> At the time this film was made, both Antonie Kamerling and Angela Schijf were promising rising stars, with great potential and ambitions, but both races. They have almost dried out. Angela Schijf seems to pay more attention to her family than to her career (that's not a bad thing, of course), while Antonie Kamerling tried to start a career in Hollywood. He never got beyond interpreting some small parts in 2 failures of Renny Harlin. To be honest I'm not surprised. It's not that he's a bad actor and he certainly looks right, but his English is not good enough, to put it mildly. Just listen to him speaking in English at the beginning of this movie and you will understand what I mean. They really are not bad actors, but for some reason they are not shown in this movie. It is probably also due to bad dialogue. I still like Beau van Erven Dorens. He has been criticized a lot but his performance seems very natural. He always keeps the characters close to who he is. <br /> <br /> It is by no means one of the worst movies ever made, but neither is it one that I would recommend. A bad and uninteresting narration makes this a bad movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
