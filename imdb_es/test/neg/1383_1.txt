The motto of this program is: "He's saying what he thinks, we're hiring additional attorneys." If you look back in time, any classic comedian never takes pride in being controversial. Richard Pryor's motto was not "I am crude, racist and daring". Basically, that's how Comedy Central is promoting this show, on its face, without a PC and "honest", but how can a TV show feel proud of being like that? Where is humility and humility? And what has suddenly made Carlos Mencia this great figure for Comedy Central? Let's start at the beginning: Dave Chappelle cancels his show (which became unexpectedly popular and controversial) and Comedy Central is looking for someone new to press. They hire a guy named Ned who claims to be Mexican, although he is not. They splash their faces in some television ads and make it look like they are "daring" by unleashing it on the audience. <br /> <br /> I have seen many hate topics on the forums for this show, and I do not agree with the detractors of "Mencia". This is not a horrible sight. It made me cry with laughter a few times. When it's fun, it's very, very funny. Yes, it's juvenile, but so was Chappelle's. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlos is that he uses a lot of the same material over and over again. And it's too obvious. Leaving open marketing aside, "Carlos" has said so many times that I lost the account. He's trying to make it the next famous line (like "I'm Rick James, b ****!") But it's too obvious. <br /> <br /> In terms of repeating itself, Carlos uses many of them. The same jokes over and over again. For example, in one episode he said he would love for all Mexicans to disappear from the United States overnight. He would wake up and an American boy would say: "Room!" in a southern accent. <br /> <br /> He used exactly the same joke, literally, when he appeared as a guest on the Adam Carolla talk show. It was much less fun the second time, because he seemed more desperate. <br /> <br /> Is "Carlos" fun? I think so. There are some extravagant moments in your program. But he focuses too much on TRY to be controversial instead of just playing along and letting his comedy progress naturally. Repeating funny little phrases over and over again, along with silly faces and strong vocal cries, ages fast enough ... I just hope that Carlos, or his writers, can give a new touch to this show, because right now it's starting to diminish. in hell repeated
