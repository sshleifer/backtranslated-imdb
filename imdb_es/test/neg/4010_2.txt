This meaningless movie was a complete disappointment. None of the characters is sympathetic in the least, so you can see what happens to each one without really worrying. The worst thing was to rent this movie in a homosexual property only to discover that this story of male swindlers was full of young homophobes involved in many scenes of heterosexual sex and not in a single scene of gay sex.
