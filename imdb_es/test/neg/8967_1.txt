This is a really silly job of abuse, as bad as Hepburn playing a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. The main part played by Hepburn is a combination of Beverly Hillbillies granny and a healer! This movie is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady, because at least Bogart did not play a mountaineer, he was simply surrounded by them. And the dialogue sounds as if it came from a strip of Li'l Abner! However, the problems do not really end with the scandal scandal, since the plot is completely confused and the "love story" can make your head hurt. By no means married, Robert Young falls in love with this Ozark cat. Was it his charming personality that won his heart? I doubt it, since she, like the fiery "spit" of the film, bears her name and it seems that she really likes the fight, the fight and the scream. Were your feminine charms? Without the makeup and fashions that seemed to have been designed by Ma Kettle, I doubt that this was the case as well. To top it off, in the end, somehow Ralph Bellamy also fell in love with her, although once again, it really does not seem to make any sense. for an extravagant and unfeminine beast played by Mrs. Hepburn, now THIS is a recipe for a good movie!
