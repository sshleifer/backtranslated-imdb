The manufacturers ask for a great suspension of disbelief, you grant them with the hope that, if you give them a little time, they will convince you that it is possible. Unfortunately, with television movies it seems that they specifically set out to make cheap Cosmo quiz films. With a small budget and large claims, you must spend every penny on the details to convince the audience. Although not here. The film gets some points for the good performance that the two outstanding women give against the odds, but unfortunately it is not enough to save the day. Oh, and the less you say about the ending, the better. Happy movie for everyone!
