This movie is a disaster within a disaster movie. It is full of great action scenes, which only make sense if you throw away all the sense of reality. Let's see, word to the wise, the lava burns you; steam burns you You can not stand next to lava. Deflecting a minor lava flow is difficult, let alone a significant one. It scares me to think that some could really believe what they saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse is the significant amount of talent he invested in making this film. I mean, the acting is really very good. The effects are above average. It is hard to believe that someone has read the scripts for this and has wasted all this talent. I guess my suggestion would be that if this movie is about to start on TV ... look the other way! It's like a train crash: it's so horrible that once you know what's coming, you just have to look. Look away and spend your time in more meaningful content.
