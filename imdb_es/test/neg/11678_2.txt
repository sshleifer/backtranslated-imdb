The film uses random events of historical significance as a backdrop and traces the lives and timelines of its 3 central characters. For what purpose, one can ask? The problem with this film is that the script becomes the "story", not the characters or their lives. <br /> <br /> Start with a group of rich and aimless university students (and a couple of not so rich too) dragged into the Naxalite movement. Subject, rejection and separation continues. People follow their own paths, apparently. Only until the heroine prevails over them. Not once but twice. After a pause in the 'Movement', the next obstacle for these 3 is the Emergency imposed on the country by Indira Gandhi. Many political figures roam for no obvious reason. The subplots are too designed and do not add up to form a logical whole. <br /> <br /> The film tries to impose a false rhythm but never reaches a true rhythm. Hardly coherent at times, there is no maturation and growth in the arcs of the 3 former colleagues of the university. Even after they are presumably married, committed, established or whatever, they are always eager to get rid of everything and go to a village to have sex with their former lover or former flame. What fertile imagination the scriptwriter has. So many 4-letter words are used without any rhyme or reason that is downright abusive! <br /> <br /> Chitrangda Singh has a horrible American accent that she does not try to hide. It is horrible to hear his dialogue riddled with clich√© of the mouth like 'What's new? I did not think you would come (this, after the hellish nightmare that just happened) or, at first, "I appreciate your concern but I can take care of myself". Yikes What kind of clown wrote the dialogues for this? She invites her friend to have a cup of coffee from South India (not least), wishes someone a good day and then wishes a good night to someone else in the family. Now, what about ESO ????? <br /> <br /> Countless villagers and non-accredited tribes are the best actors. The editing is really erratic with too many cuts. Obviously, trying to make a bold statement, Sudhir Misra made a big mistake in this.
