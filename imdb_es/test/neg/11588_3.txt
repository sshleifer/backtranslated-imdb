I just discovered, before writing this review, that "Komodo vs. Cobra" and another movie called "Curse of the Komodo" were directed by the same guy, Jim Wynorski. That could explain why they are films of almost identical premises. Both have an island ruled by the military, a colonel who cares more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, people who run to get to a helicopter that is conveniently in a field somewhere on the island, and dragons Komodo giants created through genetic experiments that run crazed What differences are there? Well, the intruders on the island are now capitalists who want to expose the government's secret and there is also a giant cobra on the island, hence the title "Komodo vs. Cobra", although the conflict between the two monsters is not relevant to the " history.' "Komodo vs. Cobra "is more or less what you would expect given its title and its channel origin: the science fiction channel, although from time to time you will find one that, for one reason or another, may attract you (I liked a movie called "Komodo") I do not doubt that this one will do it. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs. Cobra "It's not just a boring movie, it's also one of the least enthusiastic sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time." In some of these films, there's an air to them that indicates that the filmmakers were giving at least one Some level of effort, but I see very little here, that's again indicated by being just a rehash of "Curse of the Komodo." The CGI for the monsters seems straight out of a second-rate video game, the cinematography and the misc scene in it's poor, the performance varies from passable to poor, the action scenes are boring, and then there are some parts that are, frankly, badly unforgivable.I see many movies where a person shoots a gun many times without recharging and I can deal with this. But in this movie, where Michael Paré takes a thirty-eight gun and shoots it roughly fifty times without stopping without reloading once, well, at first I laughed, but even Onces became exhausting. That would be the 'action'. A monster appears, people scream, Paré shoots without stopping without reloading his weapon once throughout the entire image, and someone eats. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs. Cobra" is a very bad movie. The only thing in the film that is worth mentioning in a charitable way is an actress named Michelle Borth, who is not only very beautiful, but has a surprisingly strong performance. Even with the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the script that was given, Michelle Borth managed to get a surprisingly good performance and I'm surprised that an actress as good as she can get stuck in a movie as stupid as this. Obviously, she took it for the paycheck, but it will not improve her career, I'm afraid.
