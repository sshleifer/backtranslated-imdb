The dialogue of atmosphere and grace does not redeem this overrated classic. Boyer is a French thief who hides in the Casbah of Algiers, while the police try to find out how to get him out. Meanwhile, he falls in love with Lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. The movie is slow to start and never goes anywhere. Reminiscent of Casablanca in some way, it completely lacks a broader theme than the sought-after man who seduces a good woman. Everything is talk, talk and talk, with endless scenes of Boyer staggering between his idiots and Boyer courting Lamarr in the shadows. Personally, I did not care about Boyer's character for a minute, so the tension was totally non-existent. <br /> <br /> The actors of the 1930s stumble through the soft plot as Boyer's henchmen, guys who clearly do not belong. Algiers Sigrid Gurie is the exaggerated and jealous girlfriend of Boyer. His cheeky woman in front of her does not bode well for any future he might have with Lamarr. <br /> <br /> Especially bad is a long sequence in which a subordinate comes to tell Boyer how another trusted man was captured. It sounds exciting ... Too bad we did not see it for ourselves. The ending is completely anticlimactic and seems to be remarkable only because it is not a happy Hollywood ending; That does not stop it from being boring.
