Barney does not teach children anything! Here are some of the 3 reasons why you should not allow your children to watch this show: 1. Barney teaches children that we should think EXACTLY that we want to get along. <br /> <br /> 2. Barney teaches children that you should not be sad, and if you feel sad, COME A LOT OF ICE CREAM! 3. If you make people take pity on you, they will give you what you want when you want it. <br /> <br /> Barney is just a fat doll who told the children that strangers are your friends. You should not trust him. And he is tall every day !!! DO NOT LOOK AT THIS SHOW !!!!!!!!!!! Your children will thank you when they are older.
