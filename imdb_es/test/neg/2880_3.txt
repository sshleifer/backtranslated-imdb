Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film because of its intrigue, I certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the structure of the scene developed was too much to ask of most viewers. Huge holes in the script, as the never-explained comment of "your father died today" on the part of the mother made it even more difficult to try to make sense of these characters. <br /> <br /> This won the first place at Cannes in 2001, which is a shock considering. Maybe the French had been hungry for black movies that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this movie. I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible, but when combined with the inability to relate to the main character, it was too far away for me and kept me away from the story. <br /> <br /> This is a film only for the most dedicated black film fan and one who does not expect gratification for having watched a movie once it ends. I ENCHANTED films like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream", which were much more disturbing, but at least they gave the viewer something in terms of editing and rhythm. Seeing this slow and painful silence of the masters scene after scene became so redundant that I found it tedious, and I really wanted to like this movie at all times.
