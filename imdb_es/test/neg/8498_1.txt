This movie is a gay love story disguised as a graffiti and friendship story. No ONE critique described this movie as a gay romance movie, and that is the weight of the plot. I do not know if this was to deceive people who otherwise would not be interested in doing it, hoping that the film is as it was marketed ... The film is out of touch with the graffiti culture, abuses and defamation of the culture of the graffiti, and the acting is abysmal. Oh yes, the graffiti stinks too. This movie was a clever way to hide the agenda of portraying young people who become gay. Just look at the rest of the films in which the director has been involved, all contain the same theme. Bored as hell, it's not what I expected.
