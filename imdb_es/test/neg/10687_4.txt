If, like me, it actively searches for the weirdest and weirdest (and often the most horrible) that world cinema has to offer, then it should not look beyond Hong Kong's supernatural horror production in the early 1980s. Often, they mix black magic with kung fu and silly comedy, and they are usually full of creepy crawlies (snakes, worms, eels, centipedes, etc.), these movies are as extravagant as possible. <br /> <br /> Succubare is definitely a good example: with a mountain tribe whose women prevent their men from deviating by throwing unpleasant spells on them (which, if they leave, cause them to fill with twisted creatures and die from dying death), some Then, this movie is just weird. <br /> <br /> It is a prolonged scene in which the women of the tribe hunt snakes and insects, casually throwing the creatures to the baskets on their backs, is quite fascinating; a tribal feast that sees a poor ox beaten on the head and then torn apart is totally unpleasant; and the moments when the worms crawl in open wounds and are vomited on the floor will make the squeamish lose their appetite for a while. <br /> <br /> However, it is chewing live animals that really qualifies Succubare for a legendary status among fans of outdoor cinema making. It is very vile to see and yet, strangely convincing: the geek eats a snake, cheats a fat and juicy toad (disgusting!), And devours a mouse hungrily (biting his head and then stuffing the rest). /> <br /> It's not a great movie (hell, it's not even a mediocre movie), Succubare is recommended only to people who think they've seen it all. He gets 4 out of 10, which is probably more than he deserves, but I reluctantly respect him for being able to make me feel a little bad.
