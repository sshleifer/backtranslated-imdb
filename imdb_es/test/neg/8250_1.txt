So many fans, so little to prove it. I know, I know, these words will find me in a large minority. A lot of people really liked the goodwill of hunting. But seriously, please, great filming, not even close, and we're going to blame what belongs ... on the writing. <br /> <br /> Now, I know you won an Oscar for it, and right? Looks good on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is a special ABC program after school with many curses and a slightly higher budget. <br /> <br /> What this film shows is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take dung, feed him and make him think he's eating bon bons. And that's exactly what the studio did with the movie. They created such a buzzing faluttin around him, that people believed, and wanted to believe it so much, that they saw a shine where there was none. <br /> <br /> Now, I know some people think it's a great movie, I do not think it's a horribly bad movie, I like to compare it with more movies in the middle of the road, and also with some great movies made for television (although, not HBO movies, HBO movies are unusually better than The good will of hunting would always be.) It's just a cute little movie, with some good performances, Robin Williams was not good at that , they only gave him the Oscar because he had been anxious to do it for a while. And, of course, Miramax's public relations machine assured Ben and Matt their screenwriting Oscar ... but a few people come ... there are better movies than GWH.
