What an absolute joke about a movie. The case of this movie would make you believe that it is a duel with Jeepers Creepers and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Three good films in their own right and one would think that, using their model, MM could not go wrong. Well, that's what I thought, and I was very, very wrong! <br /> <br /> We follow two college students as they travel miles across the desert to get to a wedding. Pick up a girl (no, she does not take off her clothes), then they are chased by a Leatherface scam in a Monster Truck, who they rightly call F ** kface (AKA Monster Man). <br /> <br /> The Monster Truck, I must admit that it is a very good vehicle, but the not so risky chase scenes ruin their potential. <br /> <br /> So MM decides he has a little grudge against these guys and chases for a moment, they lose him for a while and they stop at a bar full of amputees, then they go to a motel where the character Principal Adam sleeps with the self-hiker Sarah (although they both wear underwear!). Soon they are captured by MM, taken to their house where they escape of the death and try to kill MM, but they fail, of there the configuration of the sequel. Apart from a small 'twist', that's it. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the first 2 minutes? where Harley, Adam's friend, appears hiding in the back of Adam's car to try to scare him, without any explanation of how Harley got there, how long ago or how Adam did not even notice? Without thinking that you already hate it, then you can simply enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Monster Man has a very poor cinematography and direction, which is immediately unpleasant. This is the kind of movie you can choose as one of those movies in a set of 20 horror movies you've never heard. <br /> <br /> What is so irritating is Blockbuster store so many of these low quality movies that are recorded digitally by some amateur film students, and that is exactly what MM is (although IMDb claims that this director in particular he was born in 1961). <br /> <br /> The acting along this The movie is atrocious. The script, which the writer obviously considered amusing, is irritating and childish. You have the impression that only one draft was written before they started shooting. In fact, the script is very serious. It seems that much of the film seems improvised, full of boring and uninteresting conversations that are only fun or important for the people involved. Imagine that you have filmed yourself and your friends having a conversation, are you sure that the points are fun? TO YOU, but above all it's garbage. This is what the script for MM is like. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it for the gore either? It is quite scarce and there are much better bloody movies (Bad Taste, Evil Dead et al ??) <br /> <br /> Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2, even with their cheese and plot, are far superior to this movie. Compare the introduction of Jeepers Creepers with the introduction of Monster Man and you'll see what I mean.
