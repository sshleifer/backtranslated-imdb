I swear, I've never seen a movie as bad as Half Caste. Not only because it does not make sense, it's a huge piece of egotism and self-confidence that makes me throw up. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Apocada (in Spanish, Apocada has a similar pronunciation to "avocado" which means "outside" of life and happiness ") here makes a movie of the army of one man thinking that he is Sam Raimi or the guys who directed the Blair Witch project, this is Blair Kittie's project, with a low and expensive budget. <br /> <br /> The story, a couple of American filmmakers traveling to Africa to do a documentary of Half Caste, it does not make sense The way of filming, inserting high speed shots with shots in slow motion, simply makes the stomach stir more than the stupid lines (what the hell is that dialogue about Bestiality?) OR the unconvincing performances, by the way, I do not think this cast (or caste?) is American, they all seem European to me. <br /> <br /> To finish this, just say that the filmmakers made an intelligent move on the movie sale.They put an achievement of pr emio false (like the most original movie) and a nice cover (in Spain the cover had the image of Media Caste in negative), so now I feel unhappy, because I can not demand that I get back my 14 euros.
