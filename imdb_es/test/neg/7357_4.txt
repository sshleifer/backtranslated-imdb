When you get ahead of a movie, you know you're wasting your time watching the movie in question. This is exactly how I felt as I watched "Darkness." I could see anticipate each turn and turn easily. It is a combination of "The Amityville Horror" and a lot of films dealing with the occult. He is so foolish that I almost seem endearing his naivety. I can not say I was completely bored, but I thought the film was very derivative for my taste. The director Balaguer√≥ tries to redo his first success in Spanish, "The Nameless", but he can not achieve it. I admit that some sequences were scary enough, but I simply abhor when I can find out what will happen next. Also, I hated to see good actors like Lena Olin and Giancarlo Giannini sweating so much for this piece of dreck. Finally, Anna Paquin as the protagonist of a horror movie? This has to be a joke. She is cute, but she is one of those good children's actresses who have become a very monotonous adult actress. You can live without seeing this.
