It only has 2 stars because they put a lot of work into making this game look good. I played many good and bad games and I think this game has the most boring story I ever had to listen to. The best they could have done is to allow you to skip conversations (but no, you must listen to them speak for 10 minutes) and continue doing the same things over and over again. Go up to the building, save the citizen, go kill a guy. IT'S ALL THE SAME! Ubisoft should really hire someone with some imagination. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Prince of Persia series (the first 3). The story was good and you wanted to know what happened next all the time. I do not even hate the Prince of Persia 4. But I think that anyone who has been charged with developing the story of Assassin's Creed should be forbidden to write anything else for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> Boring story And the same missions over and over again! If only one of these two things were good, it would be worth playing the game.
