IMDb lists this movie as a comedy. I have no idea what genre this movie falls into, but it's certainly not comedy. Maybe the tragedy. <br /> <br /> I will not say if this is a good movie or not. All I know is that it is not a comedy. I wanted to laugh tonight and what I got was a strange notion that someone clings to an ugly chair. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what is advertised. It is the role of the film school that I can only assume that aims to "make people think". I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know, or even someone I do not know. It's ridiculous nonsense that does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> It made me think well. It made me think: "I wish they had given me back those ninety minutes of my life". <br /> <br /> I am sure that the world is full of armchair critics who have a liberal inclination in their view of the world that will make This movie is something worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of them.
