Oh dear, oh dear. It really makes me nervous when a matter of useless horror and low budget tries to look interesting in the credits to have a group of good names in the cast, only to involve everyone in the smallest and useless roles possible. In this film, we have Richard Lynch in a scene, a momentary appearance of Martin Kove, a brief place for Vernon Welles, a little more time on the screen for John Philip Law and a little time for Karen Black. This group of random cameos does not add up much, although Richard Lynch and Karen Black do raise some of the few smiles in this movie with their appearances, and it's really painful, since none of the main actors is very good at all. I could not help thinking that if more scenes were filmed with any of the veterans of the movie b on the film, it would be much better, but as it is, there are only a few tempting glimpses of good entertainment without the film having accomplished much. entertainment value. Of the main cast, the only charismatic or pleasant performances in my opinion were Steve Wastell, like Axel and his girlfriend who I think was played by Elina Madison (I had never heard of her before, but she has a certain presence on the screen and she is very good ). . The conspiracy in this is simple, the evil undead miner chases those who seek to steal their gold, and should make it fun, especially since it is run by John Carl Buechler, who has made special effects for many of them. type of films, including having worked in the three major franchises of Slasher (Halloween, Elm Street and Friday 13th) and gems as small as the Mausoleum. Unfortunately, the film lacks sadness, sympathy and satisfactory blood. There are one or two slightly bloody moments, but it's not worth the effort to watch the movie. In fact, apart from the cameos mentioned above, this film is really quite rancid and turgid with characters that could not be fast enough for my taste and an unfortunate lack of real interest. I did not even find it funny in a bad sense of the movie, which is weird for me, since I love a lot of pretty bad movies. I would say, avoid.
