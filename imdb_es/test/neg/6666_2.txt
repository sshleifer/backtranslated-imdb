I bought the DVD of this movie because I am a fan of William Devane and I was very disappointed with "A Christmas Visitor". The story of the film is so boring and slow in development that you only want to turn off your television or DVD player after about half. The dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily telenovela, but not in a television movie. William Devane was good on his part and was acting quite well, but he did much better on other films and projects. Meredith Baxter was horrible and I really could not take the mother to the spectators. Instead, he was playing very well and was no better than a middle-class actress. Absolutely I can not recommend this movie. Spend your time and your money for this.
