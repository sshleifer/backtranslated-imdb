This movie, "Desperate Measures," was ... I'm not sure how to put it into words. Was this supposed to be a comedy? I could not stop laughing at how ridiculous I was. I love Michael Keaton, and I really can not understand that he did this. They did a good job of keeping my attention because I could not wait to see how much more ridiculous it was going to be minute by minute. In fact, I just registered on this site to get it out. I do not check the movies. I do not have time for this, but I can not let it go knowing that I have not fulfilled my civil duty by allowing people (those with an IQ of 85 or more) to know that this is not an action thriller, it is honest to funny kindness You who really got excited about this scare me. Go see a good movie like Million Dollar Baby. The performance of Clint Eastwood is not excellent, but in the end I was spinning around. Exercise your brain america!
