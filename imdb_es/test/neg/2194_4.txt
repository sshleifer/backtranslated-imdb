The Net is a film that I never saw at the time of its release, I remember giving it a pass to the mediocre reviews and, since then, I may have noticed a fragment here and there when it has been on television. Seeing it now, fourteen years after its original release, I'm a little surprised at how time goes by. Being in the mid-20s, it made my childhood feel old. I felt that I should probably do some exercise before my body starts to accumulate fat in all the wrong places. Reduce the consumption of fat and sugar. Too much coffee and cigarettes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that was the best part of this cinematic experience for me. I would say that the first 30 minutes of this movie really kept me occupied with the retro sky. Look at those big cans that they call computers. Look, they chat in chat rooms! I remember those tank tops! They look ... stupid. And hey, even stars Sandra Bullock. First billed! You would look at that. <br /> <br /> Like a movie, The Net is just a Hitchockian thriller, simple and totally routine of Hitchock, cat and mouse. Nothing archaic about that, they did then as much as they do now. Bullock plays a lone computer nerd, whose job is to fix the software for people who do not have "all that computer roll". It so happens that she stumbles upon some sensitive information and after her vacation trip ends with her she almost dies by a sexy lay woman who turns out to be a murderer (played by Jeremy Northam, and she should have suspected by the fact that they are in an American movie and the guy smokes and has a British accent!) she erases her "identity". Your house is empty, for sale, and when you check it, it turns out that you now have a new identity. A convicted prostitute and impostor, nothing less. <br /> <br /> Now you could say that this is unlikely. How could they do that to her? Even in 1995, it is impossible! It's true, but in '95 many people did not even know what the Internet was. I can see what a plot hole you could have accepted back then. However, what is much more disastrous are the inconsistencies that have nothing to do with technology. The film obviously owes a lot to Hitchcock's films (it's one of those thrillers that presents a merry-go-round at night) but Hitchcock always made sure his films were plausible. The characters did not act like confused maniacs when they tried to prove their innocence, and the plot was not conveniently accommodated for a structure where one inevitable obstacle leads to the other. The characters also tried it a bit before devoting themselves to the whole pursuit of rouge. Does Bullock's character really have no friends? Could not a former high school teacher confirm his identity? Or like ... your closest type of pizza? Oh right, she orders pizza from the internet. No matter. You decipher the movie pretty fast. It seems that there is hope in an ex-boyfriend. Do you really believe it? You should always have at least ONE surprise. The network does not offer any. <br /> <br /> Internet seems to be a great danger, seems to predict this movie. But, if the film had been made today, imagine the problems that the villains would have to go through to guarantee the elimination of the identity. Not only do they have to do all those dull boring things, but they would also have their Facebook membership, with at least 100 friends or something, and image tags, not to mention it could be on YouTube or Linked-In, and on what. your video blog with 150 daily hits, or the webcams in your home and the recorded video of it on cell phones, webcams, other people's internet downloads ... your membership in the IMDb?
