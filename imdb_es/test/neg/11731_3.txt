The first review I saw of this in IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins in this role. It makes me wonder if he saw the original. It is difficult to review Psycho if you do not have the perspective of how revolutionary the film was in 1960. You have a heroine who is not very nice and is not very involved in the movie and a villain who is creepy, but who makes you feel for the Add to that some graphic violence and it has a pattern for some of the films of the 80s and 90s. <br /> <br /> What does this movie fail? Let's start with the casting. Anne Heche is fine as Vivian Crane, but like Norman Bates, Vince Vaughn is completely wrong. On the one hand, it seems too young. Second, he has no idea how to play the roll. His nervous laugh reminds me of Ron Howard trying to play a tough guy in Happy Days. Everything he does screams I did! The original movie, even for those who know everything, still makes you feel uncomfortable because of the mother's influence on Norman, and makes her a truly independent character. What about the shower scene. When I finally saw the 1960 film on a big screen, I was surprised at its power to scare me. Bernard Herrman's score becomes incredibly sharp and noisy, and goes further to scare you than Danny Elfman's synthetic renditions during the scene. This shower scene simply serves to show us the naked body of Anne Heche and a bit of nice blood color. Which brings us to the option of filming in color. It did not work <br /> <br /> There's something about remaking classic movies that almost never seems to work. Some may see this as a noble experiment, but honestly, if Gus Van Sant had nothing to add to this film, he should have left it alone.
