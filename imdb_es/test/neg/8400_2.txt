I really wanted to like this movie, especially after all the rumors I had heard about it. But unfortunately, it just did not work for me. Paranoid Park suffers the same illusion as Lost In Translation: if you use very little dialogue, you must be weighed in the slow motion approaches and concentrate on the pieces of cloth in the environment, then your story will magically be profound and reflective. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot line, if you can find a plot, of this movie is designed. I was not impressed that the confessional "write everything down" is the way the protagonist deals with the accident. So, what are we supposed to believe? He grew happy forever and wrote a book about his experiences, so he claimed that horrible incident? <br /> <br /> What, I suspect, is a film that evokes empathy towards a young man who is aimless and facing an impossible moral dilemma, instead creates a portrait of a future sociopathic personality. He has no connection with anyone around him, and at the end of the film he does not have a real sense of what is right or wrong. He has no address at home and he does not feel anything for his friends. What we have is a portrait of a non-person, a spirit that simply goes through life as it makes its way on its skateboard. I do not feel anything for him and, honestly, I wish he was caught. The whole film focuses not necessarily on his feelings of guilt, but on how he will avoid punishment or responsibility for a bad decision. Not only does he get his way, but he finds a way to subtly rationalize it. A pretty scary and negative message. The suggestion is that many of our young people are as disconnected from the right as the simple, that they simply invent the rules as they go, serving themselves for good or for bad. It seems to me an insulting treatment for the youth of today, and the pretentious arrogance of the filmmaker is filled with thickness with each laborious, excessive and changing step. <br /> <br /> (It killed the guard, but if it blinks it's hard to tell if it was an act of mercy or not, it could be that he was so mortified that he attacked with his skateboard.) When he runs to the security guard's car , one of the wheels on his skateboard is stained with blood.)
