This is a difficult movie to rate. While he really deserves his 3 (or maybe two) for an Al Adamson movie, it's exceptional, and practically the best of Adamson. That's because unlike many Adamson movies, there are times when NURSE SHERRI seems almost competent. But, being an Adamson movie, you know that, sooner or later, that shit MUST raise its ugly head! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a strange cult leader from a large congregation (six) trying to resurrect a dead guy who looks like he's made of blue cheese. However, in the process, the type of cult has a heart attack and took him to the hospital. Apparently he dies, but it also seems that many of these hospital scenes are missing and some of them appear much later in the film. In other words, when you see the movie, it seems that it may have recovered, only to know later that it had died. Because the boy is the b.f.f. of Satan, however, his evil soul can not die and returns to harass one of his henchmen and to possess Nurse Sherri. <br /> <br /> Now, Sherri is obviously a very disturbed lady: demonic possession or not. Sometimes she acts like a zombie and in others she is violently homicidal. Then I ask her ... "why did your boyfriend (a doctor) not think that this was, perhaps, problematic?" In other words, after trying to kill a patient, he does not get an exorcist or force him to go out the window of the pikemen !!! Oh, and talking about boobies ... this movie is NOT sex full of breasts, its title and posters would indicate it. While there are a few breasts discovered here and there, they are irrelevant to the plot and are only seen very briefly (approximately 1/2 second) in all scenes except one. So, if you are a pervert, this movie is not for you, although some places in the movie (like the nurse who undresses for a patient) make it look like the movie COULD, at some point, have been designed like a movie for not. <br /> <br /> If you're a movie fan, however, there's enough to whet your appetite. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that are not like zombies, and I'm not even talking about Sherri. Especially remarkable is one of the final scenes, I've never seen or heard a little acting and dialogue in my life, and this includes the Ed Wood movies! There are also some cheaper touches, such as the bad animation of "green things", the doctor finds a murdered nurse and continues to investigate in a house where the walls are covered in blood (I would put a policeman ... better yet, a police army). <br /> <br /> So, despite these problems, why do I think it's good for an Adamson movie? Well, the story is not all bad and he was able to increase the tension very well. Many false alarms from the beginning caused my heart to speed up a little. In addition, the car accident, although irrelevant, went quite well and was practically a big budget for Adamson. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not a good movie and most people would be bored to see it. However, fans of Adamson or inept movies will like it: it offers some entertainment in a cheesy way that will cause some laughter.
