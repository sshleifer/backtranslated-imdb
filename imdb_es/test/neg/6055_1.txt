Paul Telfer, who plays Hercules in this television movie, has to be the hottest thing in two stages. Wow <br /> <br /> But this movie is a 100% distortion of the story of Hercules. Like "Troy," this movie has nothing to do with the original story. Zero. What makes it especially insulting is that they actually devised a gay character just so people could hate him, making him as evil and evil as any character in the history of television or film. This is a threefold insult since Hercules may have had a wife, since that was the expectation of those ancient days, but he also had at least a dozen male lovers. So it's ironic that they should create a real gay adversary character for this movie. No, it's not ironic. Wrong. The creators of this farce must hang their heads in shame.
