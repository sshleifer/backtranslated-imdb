I do not understand the humor in this movie. I also found it offensive to see how the Koreans were represented in that film, even though it is really just a caricature of the Koreans in those areas. First, the actors are Japanese, and they make the grossest expressions of the Koreans in that movie. It disgusts me about how these people express themselves. I felt angry just seeing that scene, and how they were so poorly designed in the movie. Humor lasts only a laugh, and then you do not understand why it's so funny. It is raw humor with the most unpleasant representation of society there. I discovered that it was an offensive film in general ... Maybe it was because I never lived in the "hood" or saw any "hood" movie, but I do not intend to do it either.
