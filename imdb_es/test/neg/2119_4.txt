This is a perfect example of why many people say that the 90s were a disaster when it comes to horror movies. A boring story of terror and voodoo on the campus starring the promising Corey Feldman (STAND BY ME, THE PERD BOYS, etc.). It's possible that enough things happen to keep him from falling asleep and not seem too cheap, but this is still a horror directed at an audience that was in his early teens during the 90s. He could have been part of that audience, but still When I saw her now, I got almost none of that. And nowadays, teenagers are more accustomed and better, and I can not imagine any of them knowing or worrying about who Corey Feldman was. Or, "it is", actually, since the guy is still making movies. But the only thing that still links him to his glory days is the sequel to LOST BOYS 2: THE TRIBE that was recently made. And I imagine that not even one will encourage anyone to look for VOODOO. Just another movie that was lost in the horror of the 90s for obvious reasons.
