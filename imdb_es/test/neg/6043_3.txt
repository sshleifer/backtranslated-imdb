OK, we have 4 electricians in the city who find a mini nuclear reactor, convert it and fall into a parallel universe inhabited by a giant spider queen also from a parallel universe, who managed to slip with some of his relatives to seize the land. , but unfortunately she is the only one left? If so, why did not the rest of humanity join and persecute her? In addition, what happened to the military, in no way more than a few billion ammunition ammunition could have been exhausted and why hide in a basement when there were many more defensible places available. Also, it is not an excavation for city workers, but how did they know what a "mini nuke" reactor looked like and if they did not have one in the parallel universe, could they reopen the crack? I'm sorry but there was nothing nice in the movie.
