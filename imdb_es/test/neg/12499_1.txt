This movie was very bad. It was not even funny at all. Even sarcastic scenes were not fun. Oh man, bad, so bad. Thumbs down. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, Some Kind of Wonderful, Soul Man, and probably another or two. Chris Kattan at his worst as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer, who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. He has a jealous girlfriend, who breaks his ankle and his dance spot goes to the cute newcomer blonde for whom Chris has eyes. I thought the acting was really bad. I like to laugh out loud comedies, this was not one. "Not Another Teen Movie" was not fun, but it had much more fun scenes than Totally Awesome. "Scary Movie" is pretty fun. I always laugh when I see that, super nice. This movie is not funny.
