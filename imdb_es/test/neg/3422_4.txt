The work Macbeth was written by William Shakespeare between 1604 and 1606. Since then, many other versions of the work have been produced, including remakes completed in 1948, 1971 and 2006. Akira Kurosawa even directed a Japanese version of Macbeth. in 1957 titled, "Kumonosu j√¥". The play begins with King Duncan listening to the success of two of his generals, Macbeth and Banquo, in a recent battle against the Irish and the Norwegians. After a quick promotion of Duncan, Macbeth instantly has a strange feeling of lust, greed and power and does everything in his power to gain access to the crown: even if it includes murder. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey Wright tried to create his own version of the famous work in 2006 by placing it in the modern underground world of Melbourne. Just imagine a humble Macbeth killing hundreds of soldiers with an AK-47 and rapping his own interpretation of "Bass" at the same time. I'm just kidding about the latest, but one thing he does is pronounce the traditional Shakespeare. And it keeps it going throughout the movie. It's okay! Shakespeare meets the ghetto. It's everything you could hope for! Do not?? The new Macbeth is tough and violent enough to coincide with any other action movie of today, but lacks a decent performance, the right jargon and a good camera work technique. <br /> <br /> The modernized film begins with Macbeth (Sam Worthington) who works as a hitman / drug dealer for Duncan (Gary Sweet), a drug trafficker from Melbourne, Australia. After being promoted to Thane of Glamis by Duncan (as the three witches had predicted), the aspiration begins to take over Macbeth when he sets his eyes on the throne. After promoting Macbeth, Duncan invites himself to Macbeth's house for a night of drugs and alcohol. Before the festivities begin, Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hall) tells Macbeth to kill Duncan to take power over the throne. After the bodyguards get drunk and everyone is asleep, Macbeth sneaks into Duncan's room and stabs him to death. After his murder, Macbeth takes all of Duncan's belongings, including the hidden title and crown. As soon as he believes he has what he wanted, he discovers that he will take more than bribery and flee to solve his problems. <br /> <br /> A major flaw in the movie was the performance. Once seemingly extravagant and empowered, Macbeth suddenly becomes a sissy. And he looks like a sad puppy throughout the whole movie. I really do not know if this was Worthington or Wright's fault, but either way, one of them should have realized that Macbeth was a king, not a knot in a trunk that took away everything his wife had to say. literally. As I said before, Macbeth should have been rude, arrogant and spiteful. But when his character changes to a drug kingpin, he also changes his personality, I suppose. On the other hand, Lady Macbeth really knew how to nip it in the bud when it came to recognizing and personifying her character. He did not seem as spiteful as in the play or in the 1971 version, but he reminds Macbeth that, compared to the murder, anything else he could do would not match. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found unpleasant was all the nudity. This coincidence had to be Wright's fault. The witches did not act a little, unless you call parading in your birthday suit acting. At one point in the movie, I started wondering if I was watching Macbeth or Unique Positions Vol. 2. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong when I say that I find that Shakespeare's dialogue is out of place. It is spoken without problems, but when an Australian gangster speaks it, it is very rare. When Macbeth starts killing people, he first lets him know by speaking to them in English Ye Olde. Macbeth contains a lot of action, blood, blood and nudes to last a lifetime. However, you forget all the positive facts when you start to think: "Okay, what the hell did you just say in the last sentence?" In some parts of the film, I do not even think that the actors themselves knew what they were saying. The new age of the film could have been easily removed if it were not for "Thou's" and "The's". <br /> <br /> The work of the camera was just right for me. One thing I could not stand was the constant rhythm between the characters. The camera technique used gives off that Blair Witch vibe and made me puke a little in my mouth. Matt Reeves tried to try the same concept of camera work in the Clover field, but it just does not work. It makes me want to get up from my chair and look around at the little garbage bags that have been conveniently placed in each seat of the aircraft. <br /> <br /> Looking back on all of this, the gangsta 'Macbeth holds a positive one: a lot of action. Apart from that, the film contains nothing but acting without inspiration, the correct use of English and the work of the camera that turns the stomach. The soundtrack contains one or two of the same songs, but each song is edited or remixed differently for each scene. There is never a variation of the interesting or captivating media used. From now on, the directors must leave the dangerous world of drugs to Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. Future versions of Macbeth should be created just as Shakespeare intended the work to be 400 years ago. I would recommend wearing medieval clothes, Ye Olde English, swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by Enya. But anyway, the modern Macbeth makes you want some good folk music, a bonfire and a bustier.
