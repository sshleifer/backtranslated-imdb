I'm furious! It's been a while since the last zombie movie I've seen, so I really wanted to see a good zombie movie. HoTD2 was a big disappointment. A reasonable story but with horrible clich√©s and jokes of acting, filming, dialogues and nausea. I did not even see the first, which is supposedly worse than this ... now I'm curious how bad it could have been! The movie is full of mistakes and nonsense. Who on earth analyzes DNA using a blood sample? Why are these "special forces" who "have been in hell and come back" fighting like a spoiled 6-year-old girl? We see fierce zombies that could take a bite at any chance they have, then hundreds of them wave their arms at our two "heroes", take them to the ground and then let them go without even a scratch. I could go on and on with this, but life is too short and I have already lost a couple of hours watching this pathetic movie that is an insult to the film industry.
