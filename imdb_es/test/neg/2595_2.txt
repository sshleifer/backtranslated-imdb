Have you ever seen one of those programs that became so popular that over time you could get away with some nasty nonsense and tricks with little enthusiasm that your creators can achieve? If you have not done it, then you have never seen Family Guy. <br /> <br /> The fans of the show seem to think that he is witty, nervous and moving. It is nothing of this, however it is boring, repetitive, insulting and uninspired. <br /> <br /> The "humor" of the show comes from two sources. <br /> <br /> 1) Irrelevant idiocy. The show often has flashbacks of things that have nothing to do with the plot and are mostly just absurd and pointless. And then there are the random references of movies in which the characters show a scene from a popular movie without parodying it effectively. . . or parody at all (which is NOT FUN !!!!!). <br /> <br /> 2) the same shit that is in each episode of the show. Man is a sexual deviant with sexually transmitted diseases, AHA HA! Is not that funny? Hey, you know what's even more fun? Make the same joke about him anywhere between one and fifteen times in a single episode. And do not just count it several times in a single episode, make sure to lengthen it so that the whole scene is dedicated to just telling a joke. Now imagine also that this same routine is used again and again for virtually all the characters in the series. <br /> <br /> The unconventional "un-PC" humor is not as "un-PC" as you would do it. Do you think? Mostly they only say what the latest newspaper headlines, politicians and random celebrities think. <br /> <br /> The series had its moments, but now I think it's time to take the show off the air. and finish with this. <br /> <br /> Do you know what IS fun? I still like this more than Nausicaa from the valley of the wind.
