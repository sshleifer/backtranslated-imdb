You see a movie called 'battle space', what are you going to think? Space battles with fresh explosions like the devil and all firing at each other. What do you get with this movie? Well, you get SOME kindness from the space battle, but for the most part it's just stupid people wandering around doing almost nothing. DO NOT SPEAK. What is this nonsense? We got narrators and tons of British computers, but that's it. The main character must be the worst I've seen in my life, since she does not even have any dialogue, and nocturnal walks through scenes (literally!). Some of the things that happen are simply stupid, as if they were using a rocket (such as to go to space) for transport on the side of the planet, why not use one of those ingenious spacecraft? In any case, the music is almost non-existent, with some boring and lifeless samples, but the most important thing you will notice is the Atari sound effect that boats use ... you have to be kidding. I can also say that the budget was low, because everything seems false, which is not what you would expect from a movie, especially what should be a super cool space battle movie. I think seriously that the budget must have been in the two digits, it's so bad, it makes you laugh more than you should because of how bad it is. I'm starting to think that they paid the actors according to the amount of dialogue they had, because there's very little here (if you can not say that already is my main complaint here, since I've probably already said it 3 times).
