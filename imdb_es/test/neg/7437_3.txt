This was fine, but really a bit disappointing because I expected more laughter. Considering the story and the main actor (Bill Murray), it should have been a lot more fun than it turned out to be. Only part of this made me laugh a lot, like when Murray lost control of his semi and was accelerating down the road at a strange angle. (You have to see it, appreciate it). <br /> <br /> The cast of support was not pleasant at all. Just look at a sample of the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! The role of McConaughey here as "Tip Tucker" was simply annoying. He was the worst. <br /> <br /> Apart from those people, the film had some lovely moments, but in general it is not recommended. It's another failure of Disney.
