What can you say about a movie that makes "The Erotic Witch Project" look like "The English Patient"? Again, the plot and the characters are secondary, but the plot is almost an exact copy of "TEWP". <br /> <br /> Four buxom sorority sisters and a silly male guide enter a forest to look for the naked wench, and the women become sexually charged. The naked girl leaves porn devices and an inflatable doll, as in "TEWP". They get lost, the fool gets lost and the girls find their way back to their hotel. There, they recreate the end of "The Blair Witch Project", when the cameras are dropped and the guide is seen playing hopscotch, an integral game in the thin plot. <br /> <br /> At least three of the sisters of the sorority here have strangely large breasts filled with dimples and stretch marks, along with the rather obvious surgical scars. The only "natural" girl here is humiliated by the director. In a very unlikely and too long final credit segment, the outta scenes where she could not correct a line are played over and over again ad nauseam. <br /> <br /> Julie Strain appears with a frightened wig to touch the naked girl This unique scene seems to be added later, since possibly no one could be credited in the cast with her shot. In the background, as the women swirl, you can see someone's picket fence. This may be the backyard of director Jim Wynorski. <br /> <br /> This is simply a bad thing. Lesbian love scenes are kelvin degrees colder than those of "The Erotic Witch Project". Most love consists of the four women who put together their eight collective breasts. I think they are trying to form a silicone-based lifestyle that would rescue them. of this bad career decision. There is not so much luck. If imitation is the most sincere form of adulation, then the creators of "The Blair Witch Project" should be really angry. <br /> <br /> This is not qualified, and contains Physical violence, strong blasphemy, female nudity, sexual content and sexual references. <br /> <br />
