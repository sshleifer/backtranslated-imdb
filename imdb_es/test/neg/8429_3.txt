"Disappointing" is the best word you could think of for this movie, especially considering the enthusiastic reviews it receives from other users. <br /> <br /> One thing that really ruins the movie is that it is blatantly biased (in both senses of the word). Not only does it present a very selective description of the games (focused on the US athletic team), but it also contains several inaccuracies, most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties faced by the US team. UU <br /> <br /> What is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and mistakes (?) seem to glorify the sportsmanship of the USA. UU Excluding other athletes (with some famous exceptions). For example, the viewer is made to believe that EE. UU He won most of the medals in the Games, when in fact he only won one out of every four gold medals and one out of every 6 in total. Similarly, many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective countrymen (therefore, we have an arrogant Briton and a wine Frenchman). This attitude serves very little in the service of the Olympic ideals that the film is supposed to celebrate. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think this film will attract that part of the US audience. UU Who is looking for a quick boost of national self-esteem. Those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are encouraged to look elsewhere.
