A flower wall is thrown into the sea and dreams of a pirate fantasy like a damsel in love with a pirate apprentice. Energetic and good-natured, maybe, but a company of poor quality; a failed musical delivery of "The Pirates of Penzance" with a feeling of cheap backlot, wan bubblegum songs and constant overexcitement. The film career of Kristy McNichol had a real success after this, while the leader Christopher Atkins can not control any emotion in particular, his voice wobbles in search of the right tone. You have to ask yourself, if that is the best title they could create, what will be the level of ingenuity in the real script? The "Grease" affection of the film for the musicals is not combined with its slapstick fondness for the "Airplane!", Although McNichol works overtime being effervescent and almost makes the flaccid handling seem attractive. For the most part, it's a shame. * 1/2 of ****
