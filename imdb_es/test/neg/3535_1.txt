Why would a filmmaker with a track record like Wes Craven want to lend his name to a tedious collection of clichés like this one? And if he did not get money for it (all £ 50 judging by the looks), he should have knocked on the director's door to get a refund at the time the movie was released. There are many "extraterrestrial" scams and this is one of the worst. Even the reliable Lance Henriksen, loaded with a character foolish enough to allow his children to walk through a dangerous government laboratory, can not save him. As a cure for insomnia, this qualifies 10+. As a quality filming piece, forget it.
