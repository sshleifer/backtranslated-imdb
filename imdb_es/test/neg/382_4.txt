Start with Fulci playing a version of himself, writing some ideas about how people might die. Followed by a fake-looking cat that eats what is presumably a brain. The copy I saw was dubbed in English, which I always hate, but I was especially disappointed that I could not hear Fulci in his own voice. <br /> <br /> Fulci is in a kind of feverish state working on his latest version. horror movie. His stomach churns when he sees things that resemble the effects of his film, and he begins to hallucinate that he is witnessing acts of horror. Visit a psychiatrist, who hypnotizes you and unfortunately does not have your best mental health in mind. I remembered the psychiatrist played by David Cronenberg in Clive Barker's Nightbreed (1990). David L. Thompson, who is quite bad, plays this character. Probably, a friend of Fulci in real life, has a big toothy smile when he kills people, although this may be the black humor of Fulci in the work that, in my opinion, was also quite poor. <br /> <br /> The film is composed of a lot of clips from Fulci's films, either as if Fulci were on the set directing them, watching recordings on televisions or witnessing acts. I've never been too fanatical about the shows of clips in TV series, and I also think that Charles Band's Full Moon Entertainment is reducing its old films and putting together three cuts of this type, since the new anthologies are quite boring. I guess they need to make money? <br /> <br /> The shrinkage in Cat in the Brain makes reference to the theory that violence in movies generates violence in real life. One of Fulci's co-workers talks about a documentary team following Fulci to see what his life is like. Many self-referential things like this. <br /> <br /> In the end, some of the characters sail on a ship called "Perversion".
