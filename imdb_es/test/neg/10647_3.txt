By the time the Hellraiser franchise was reaching its next movie, the premise was running out. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a scientist in the future, who while imprisoned gives his captor the story of how his ancestors (all played by Ramsey) built the evil puzzle box of Setting Up the Lament that puts the wrong in the world and how his bloodline had to deal with that box later. The film is full of lack of continuity with respect to the other films and lack of coherence in it. Yes, this could be due to a combination of rewrites, massive cuts in the original version of the movie, or whatever. But I am reviewing the film as it is, and not as it was or could have been. And as it is now, it is a disaster. Surely the franchise will continue indefinitely with the direct consequences to DVD, but this was almost the death of his chances of getting a new one released theatrically again. <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
