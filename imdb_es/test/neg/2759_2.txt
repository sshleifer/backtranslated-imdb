I see high school and I'm surprised it's never been as low as Marvin did in this BAD movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Marv is the main character, and bad luck only gets worse and worse. Despite his intelligence, he manages to be intimidated, exploited, supports his lousy dad and many more bulls, including a daring heist that, let's say, does not go completely to plan. Of course, the viewer does not feel empathy with anyone in this movie, so all this disastrous darkness springs up like inoffensive zeta rays. Recommended for those days when you feel depressed, place this movie and you will smile and say: "I'm so glad I'm not Marv!"
