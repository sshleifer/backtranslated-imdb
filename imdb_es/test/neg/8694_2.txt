It is difficult to compete against classic greatness, but once you make that decision and make the decision, you need to find the best and brightest resources to keep your product in the foreground and with the highest quality. If your intention is to aim for the second or third best (or fourth), why even try? With that, I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced and transmitted. I would ask the producers: "What were you thinking about, were you trying to create a projected deficit?" If perhaps the producers thought: "We want to examine this biblical story from another point of view ..." Then I would say "Well, I saw the program, now what is the point of view?" The premise of this "theory of the possible point of view" escapes me. I can usually watch programs, and (right or wrong) at least have an idea of ​​what the creators were trying to achieve. It is not like that, here. I recognize names like "Robert Halmi" (the producer) and I can associate his work with a striking product; Tin Man, Earthsea, Flash Gordon, Jason and the Argonauts. Low budget entertainment based on myths, history and comics. A perfect genre for the science fiction channel. So I still have to ask Robert Halmi ... "What was the point of THIS Ten Commandments, what were you thinking about?" ???????? FJS
