I try desperately to stay awake while watching the movie Solomon Kane. I have about 20 minutes to go. If it improves, I'll come back here and I'll let you know, but somehow I doubt that will happen. Solomon Kane seems to be based on the game Dark Watch, and it seems that it is based on the videogame Legacy of Kane, but unfortunately neither of them is true. I heard it's based on some comic, graphic novel or pulp fiction or something else that I've never heard of, but on whatever basis, there's nothing original about this extremely boring movie. The atmosphere is stolen from the 300 movie, which was not so good in the first place. The tedious overexploitation takes itself so seriously that it is almost hypnotic, and to be clear, I say it in a bad way. The plot is practically nonexistent: the violent man who tries to be nonviolent meets the friendly family, the friendly family is murdered, the violent man becomes violent again. All the characters are stereotypes taken from Waterworld or Book of Eli or The Hills Have Eyes or, however, they simply choose another magical magic film of apocalyptic bar that you have seen and there you have it. Someone, somewhere, he said, that's how to make a movie: use a blue filter to make everything look mysterious, add a lot of slow-motion shots of horses' hooves splashing in muddy puddles, add snowflakes circling while two bored characters talk to each other, and oh yes, the rain drops dramatically to distract the fact that nothing is really happening, and do not forget the black silhouettes that walk towards us with fire burning behind them, and lots of lit torches, and of course fuzzy fighting scenes during which it is not clear what is really happening because we do not have the budget for the bloody special effects, so I simply add the sound of the metal sound and, by the way, do not allow that no character lives long enough for the audience The audience must understand them, relate to them or sympathize with them, and cross their fingers, wait for the fans penthouses of the swords and sorceries movies eat them, even if it is complete, and go directly to the video, do not pass GO. . .
