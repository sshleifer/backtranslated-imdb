As a DM fan, it goes without saying that I've seen this movie several times. However, I see it only to see the images of the concert ... the rest of the movie is, um, quite frightening, sad to say. <br /> <br /> The famous rock music director DA Pennebaker followed Mode for his afternoon. The tour of the 80's Music For The Masses, which promoted the magnificent album of the same name. The title 101 is derived primarily from the fact that the concert material included is from concert 101 and the end of the tour in the Pasadena Bowl, but it is also a reference to the film as a "beginner course" in the band and how it works . Depeche Mode 101. In the midst of the quartet footage playing live and exploring the United States, there is a second thread that covers a group of DM fans who have won a competition to meet the band, go on the tour on their own bus and attend the final concert. . <br /> <br /> Now, as I said before, the images of the concert are great. The modes are here, in addition to their form, like the stadium's rock gods, which was a somewhat unusual achievement for an electrorock band in the late '80s. Although the film catches the band before they record their 1990 masterpiece "Violator", there are still countless and excellent tracks seen and heard here, for example, Behind The Wheel, the majestic Never Let Me Down Again, Everything Counts, Just I can not get enough of the Vince Clarke years, Shake The Disease and many more . <br /> <br /> When the mode is on stage, they are bright. When they are not, they are, well, very boring. In the last days of the Reagan administration, nothing is of interest to the boys. As an example, the probable "highlight" of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes. Not exactly exciting things. I know that all the bands do not have to be crazy and reckless idiots, but these guys make the Mormon Tabernacle Choir look like Rammstein. <br /> <br /> The only real emotion comes from several clips focusing on the lead singer of the band, Dave Gahan Gahan appears in 101 as something psychotic, speaks of a violent power within himself that he can not control, remembering a strange attack of rage that involves a taxi driver, etc. There's a point in the movie where he throws a tantrum at a poor man behind the scenes, really embarrassing. The man clearly had problems back then, which fortunately have been solved. Composer Martin Gore and keyboardist Andy Fletcher present themselves as very articulate men, clearly talented, but also totally colorless; while the fourth member, somewhat enigmatic, Alan Wilder is the only one of the quartet that brings out the image of the rock star with some kind of poise. <br /> <br /> And as for the 'fan tour' thread, well, it's an incomparable scum. Let's not fool ourselves. Maybe it's just because it's very * very * late in the '80s, but the pack of young devotees does not do anything for me, but it causes a sense of irritation. They are, for a person, singularly superficial and insipid people, whose antics are banal when they are not shy. Let me reiterate ... * nothing * happens in images that are not on the stage, which is of interest. Nothing. The endless scenes of children spraying their hair, arguing uselessly, changing clothes, getting lost in the cities on their way to concerts and finding their partners in bed with another winner of the competition, I wonder one thing: if the fans of Cure they were that boring. in '88 / 89. The love that young people have for the band is something I can definitely relate to, and is sometimes contagiously happy, but if what we see is the most interesting thing that was filmed from them, then I would hate see the shots . <br /> <br /> But music is all that matters, and in this sense 101 stands out. The Pasadena concert, one of his best concerts of all time, makes the film worth seeing. The recent DVD edition of the film comes with an extra disc that contains what remains of the unedited concert recording (a good 80% of the performance), and therefore makes the DVD an absolute necessity for fans. The band's audio commentary (minus Wilder, who left Mode in the mid-1990s) on the first album is also, interestingly, much more interesting than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> As a document of the boys From Basildon during his idol period in the amphitheater, Depeche Mode 101 is invaluable. But if what you are looking for is emotion, it is better that you obtain the double live album that accompanies it (now available in Super Audio CD format).
