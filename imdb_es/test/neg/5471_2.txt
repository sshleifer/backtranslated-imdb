How can you make a mistake with a film that mixes the sophistication of Peter Cushing, the determination of Donald Pleasence and the bust of Luan Peters? Easy, you give them a terrible script to work with. <br /> <br /> Peter Cushing, in an evil role, runs a satanic cult that has captured a couple of friends of Donald Pleasence. Donald plays a determined but distant priest who wants to locate his friends, but he needs Fred's help from Scooby-Doo to locate them. Summons the help of a New York hound, who dresses like the hero of the caricature, in his task. Meanwhile, the girlfriend of one of the missing, Luan Peters, joins the search. If all this sounds interesting, then you, like me, cheated on us. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for the trio to sniff the bad guys, but their methods of bringing the bad guys to justice are fools. In addition, women will find this a crapfest. Every time they get in the way of the bad guys, our two male heroes tell Luan to stay at the hotel even though he can handle himself better than the delicate priest played by Pleasence. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $ (The script really disappoints us.) No tension is created, no valuable dialogues are given and you will need both hands to count the number of times Luan Peters is told to stay behind and let the men do the work, if you're interested in seeing a minotaur in the movie, do not get upset (we got a statue of a minotaur who spits out flames). <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$ (There are some attacks and some sacrifices, but those of you who drool because Gore will be disappointed). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (Although there are three of my favorite actors in this movie, there is nothing that can be exchanged here.) Peter Cushing does not have much time on screen, Donald Pleasence is clearly aware that he is In the scenario of a stinker and Luan Peters is misused, this should have been much better given the talent involved, but again, the Ya The nkees lose a game here and there too. <br /> <br /> NAKES: $ (Luan Peters takes a bath but almost nothing is seen, she is not as complacent here as she was in The Flesh and Blood Show).
