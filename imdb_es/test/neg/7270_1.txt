Officially I vomited in my own mouth, thanks to this movie. <br /> <br /> I expected the worst in this movie, but I expected the worst and the most pleasant. This is simply terrible. Absolutely terrible. Terrible as the Nazis spreading the black plague. Let me explain: the ewoks are speaking in English. It is awful. <br /> <br /> The villainous girl looks like she traveled from the future set of Power Rangers. I really want you to get up off the ground and say "Finally! After ten thousand years, I'm free! It's time to conquer Earth!" The putties ... er, I mean the big bad ones, whatever they are ... they growl a lot. Many of them look like an even slower version of the Cryptkeeper. The Cryptkeeper was very good, but these guys were not. <br /> <br /> The only merit of this movie was Paul Gleason. This movie could have been better if he had gone with the bad guys and said, "If I have to come here again, I'm going crazy." It would have been even better if one of the Ewoks was played by Judd Nelson, who insinuated his words by saying this. <br /> <br /> Besides, that little fast creature is pretty tough. Word to that. <br /> <br /> However, there is no word for the movie. I want to give this movie a two. I want, so badly. There is a passage that I have memorized: the road of this film is besieged on all sides by the inequities of the terriblidad and the tyranny of the fright. Blessed is nothing, because this movie blows.
