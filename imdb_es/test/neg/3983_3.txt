The beginning of this movie made me doubt that it would be little more than a typical science fiction movie. But, as I went along, I started to get interested and saw the whole process. The premise is interesting, original, and has the ingredients to make a classic. Unfortunately, it ended up being a mediocre movie, made by the usual factors that turn a potentially good movie into a bad movie (bad acting, low budget, etc.). I'm interested to see how this would turn out to be remade with good actors and a big Hollywood budget.
