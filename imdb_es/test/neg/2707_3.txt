The laughs are few and far between in this boring movie, and I can not help but wonder how this mess was made in the first place. The only good thing about this movie is the talent of Griffin Dunne, but his best efforts were easily eclipsed by Madonna's disgusting performance. I was able to sit through this without getting too bored, but that's probably the best thing I can say about this waste of time.
