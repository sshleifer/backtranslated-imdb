The worst movie ever made, without exception. Give yourself a pat on the back if you can sit in every minute of unbearable pain. Except for the part where the loser of bad luck became a psychopath deranged by forced medical experimentation, he pours his pea soup on the doctor's head and laughs like any good crazy delusional should ... that's all .
