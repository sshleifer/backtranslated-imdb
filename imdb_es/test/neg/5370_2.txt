This show, Paranormal State, has almost a feeling of "Project Blairwitch". As in, you're watching a "documentary" that is really just a movie with a script, which looks and feels like a documentary. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the program is its "going to" outside advisors from the Warren, who became famous for their "investigations" of the Amityville murders, which were completely fraudulent, based on Police reports of family deaths! (Just as the eldest daughter was actually involved in the whole thing, to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths!) Then there's the way they constantly jump to blame the demons for everything. Not to mention how arrogant the group is about the cases they take. They do not want to help those who need it most, they just want the strangest cases, that give them the most attention and attention. <br /> <br /> They are complete, simple and simple frauds.
