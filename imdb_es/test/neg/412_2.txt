I entered the film expecting a bit of action mixed with a strong argument. I understand that changes must be made between written works and films ... for many reasons. <br /> <br /> The change in the relationship between the scientists (they were father-daughter in the book) The Director of CERN was eliminated, which caused the scene between Carmelengo and the Director to change to Carmelengo and the boss of the Swiss Guard in the Pope's office. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard made sure that his father inserted himself as a Cardinal with a hayseed accent but all symbolism was lost. Both Lagdon and Carmelengo ascended into the heavens in the helicopter with the character of Hanks landing on the river and the priest landing in the chapel in what was described as an image similar to that of Christ. <br /> <br /> At some point this film needs to be redone by a director who is up to the job
