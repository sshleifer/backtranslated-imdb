This movie almost gave me a nervous breakdown. When I was recovering from appendicitis a few years ago, I had just started teaching in high school. The entire teaching business was a bit disconcerting for a beginner, but to prepare myself mentally to return to the classroom, I decided to watch some pretty awful movies. The Flintstones was one of the films I chose, and then I put "King Of The Streets" (the UK title of 'Alien Warrior'). Just before it was over, I found myself about to cry for the sheer waste of it all ... my life, the movie, the Â£ 2 I had paid a couple of weeks ago in the Blockbuster rental section, the moment when It must have been taken to print the art of the manga, the effort of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack (no matter how insignificant their efforts are) ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. Let me be perfectly clear: I LOVE watching fucking movies from Blockbusters. My partner and I, Dan, used to sit and watch many, many cheap horrors and laugh at them. But this was a different kind of fucking movie. I do not think anything has come close to this, not even Tobe Hooper's "Death Trap" (which is probably my second worst movie in the world). The whole act of making a car from the abandoned parts section almost killed me; the repetition of the music in any available opportunity, independently of the events on the screen; the set .... AAAGGGHHHHHHH !!!!! I can not even continue with this 'critical' dissection, since my gag reflex has begun. The uselessness of that film, even now, three years after having seen it for the first and last time, still leaves me speechless (but I can still write). The whole section of "making a car of strange parts" made me contemplate horrible things. <br /> <br /> I beg you, if you are interested in watching this movie, just look at the video cover and imagine the worst. Possible version of the synopsis of the story on the back. I can almost guarantee that it will not be half as bad as this movie. You must not, under any circumstances, really contemplate observing it for any reason. Not if you are a Christian and want to see an allegory of Christ; No, if you're a bad amateur movie and you want to experience the real nadir of garbage. not even if you want your life to seem longer (and believe me, every second that runs this movie seems at least a minute). Do not make mistakes about it, this movie is profane. It is the antichrist in the form of a video. As Bo Cattlett said in Get Shorty: "I've seen a better movie about teeth."
