Apart from some good moments of pretty crude violence, this painful film is more notable for making the 68 minutes seem like two hours. <br /> <br /> It begins with an endlessly long introduction in which the Leeds family is introduced, including two Tykes, and their adult brother and sister, are a clich√© of Pa and Ma, and the incredibly annoying grandfather (played by Charles "Chic" Sales). While they sit down to dinner, the family is bothered by the shots and runs to the window in time to see two men killed by gangsters in the street. Mafiosi flee through the family home, leaving them as witnesses to the crime. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film consists of Walter Huston as the Crusade prosecutor who sometimes interrupts long speeches against crime to make half-hearted attempts. Trying to protect the family from the mafia. Everything ends in a predictable way. <br /> <br /> The positive points about the film include a couple of decent shootings and a really nasty beating, Nat Pendleton as one of the mobsters, and the beautiful Sue Blane in a small role of the daughter of Leeds. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Huston play with his first registered trademark as a representative of the law, try the "Beast of the city" of 1932. Avoid this if possible.
