Very little: a bad movie. If you are looking for pure action and no brain (or brain 'illusion') or if you are less than 15 years old and you like Bruce Willis, this is THE movie. Also, do not expect the scenario to be consistent or even credible if you think a bit, so do not do it if you just want to have fun.
