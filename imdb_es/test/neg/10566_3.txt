An extraterrestrial extraterrestrial beast lands on Earth and soon wreaks havoc on the population, first uses his laser gun to dissolve in the dust almost every human he sees (that's when his target is not terribly bad) and then his naked claws . With what he likes to tear and eat human spleen! <br /> <br /> In general, they are pretty silly things. I have to give you some points for being fun sometimes. In fact, I enjoyed the pointless battle of the lightning guns at the beginning and some of the more important after effects. However, it does not help when the monster provides the only truly entertaining moments of the movie and is not on screen for a large part of the film's running time. The acting throughout this is simply awful and amateur, and our main hero, Sheriff Cinder, is too unattractive to pocket the sexiest girl in the movie. I also have to remove points for blatantly copying THE THING OF ANOTHER WORLD (1951) on several occasions. When the monster is not in a rampage, NIGHTBEAST is too boring and, finally, its attacks become so repetitive and predictable that they even become less fun. Look at this back to back with the THING OF 1951 and see the characterization of the difference, the attention to the plot and the details and the creation of suspense in a monster in the loose film.
