I only bought this DVD because it was very cheap and I found it interesting in its special way ("special" means "retarded"). The film turned out to be quite uninteresting: the camera's boring work, nothing really drove the story and, of course, the acting is horrible. It was not even "bad" in a rural way, it was just bad. Actually, there are a handful of great lines of dialogue, but for the most part it is uncomfortable and weak. All I could think about while watching this was that it could actually be a good movie if the script received a major revision (if it was written by someone who really understood the culture of drugs) and if some decent actors were chosen. I would not recommend "Weekend with the nanny" unless you plan a career in the cinema and want to learn what not to do in a movie.
