I saw the DVD in a store near my house, and since I'm addicted to the "horror / alien movies," I wondered how good it was. He even had two award mentions on the cover (I do not remember which festival he won), so I thought "Hey, this could be good". So I bought it (for five euros) and I came here to IMDb to see some reviews. Here, or people hit the movie to say it was bad, or people said that the movie was a wonderful feat in the independent films blah blah. Then I played the DVD, without thinking about any of the criticisms I had read, with an open mind and without expecting anything at all. <br /> <br /> Man ... I do not like being so critical, but the movie was really bad ... Well, I'm just going to give some suggestions of what I thought: <br /> <br /> 1 -Actuation / dialogue: the acting was so confusing ... sometimes the actors did a decent job, but there were scenes in which I could not see any effort on their part. The dialogue was even worse ... I think it was probably the aspect that most annoyed me throughout the film. The talking between the characters seemed ... off. Not only is it bad, but it is far from the real events of the movie. The monologues of the female character, although well delivered, became boring and annoying in a short time ... But, of course, the most ridiculous aspect was the ... "extraterrestrial" or the "infected" ... I will not even comment that , I'm just going to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took all the courage out of the image; 2-Visual: the strongest aspect of the film ... if you forget the terrible effects and flashes of light that used to simulate the explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be. The appearance of the "camera in the car" was actually quite good, but they did not even use the environment to inspire fear or fear. They left that to the cheap sound and the FX video and the three "infected" characters. The film becomes boring in so many scenes ...; 3-Sound: talk about editing ... this movie has no problems in showing how weakly edited it was. From computer sounds imitating forest animals to "alien dialogue" ... ah ... <br /> <br /> So, what did I like in the movie ... (SPOILERS) the only thing that really I liked it and that? Actually, it was quite scary the succession of two scenes in which the car is still and you see someone / someone walking in a distance. At first, I really thought it was me seeing things, but when the character realizes that the "figures" that came towards her were their own reflection, it surprised me! Pretty spooky idea done well! Apart from that ... I had a very bad time. <br /> <br /> And I do not recommend it to anyone ... not even the "teenagers who get together" because you can not even laugh at this ... <br /> <br /> I give it a solid 2. Only some technical achievements worked here ... apart from that ... yes ... nothing
