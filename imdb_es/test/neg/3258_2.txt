Caddyshack II is one of those images that makes you ask "Why?" Like in; 'Why was it financed?': 'Why was it done?' and 'Why was it released into the public domain?' <br /> <br /> To say the least, it's a bad movie. It serves no purpose other than to underline how superior its prequel was by establishing a set of characters almost identical to each other in a story similar to that of a "new money" land developer trying to buy the golf course's sanctuary. establishment. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, tracking 8 years after the original is a strange thing. I want to say that if you are going to take advantage of a highly successful image like the first one, then you have a window of some years to do it. But quitting it in 8 years means that the formula is not cool enough to simply follow up, or a bad imitation like this, so it is bound to reward fans of the original by giving them at least a reference to actual contributions, if there are not. For the actors who made the first so memorable. But there is little or nothing of this. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get cheap imitations. Granted, the death of Ted Knight in the intervening years would have made it impossible to retrieve the memorable Judge Smails, but the inclusion of Robert Stack as "Chandler Young" (an elitist fellow of WASP similar to the character of Smails) is not imaginative and lacks importance. of the anarchic frustration that made Caballero's turn so visible. Jackie Mason's 'Jack Hartounian' is a weak attempt to recreate the nonstop jokes delivered by the character of Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) of the first. While Dangerfield's role was infinitely quotable, Mason's is completely forgettable. <br /> <br /> The ridiculously ridiculous gardener 'Carl Spackler' of Bill Murray and his war of attrition with the annoying local gofer are replaced by his co-star of Ghostbuster, the role of Dan Ackroyd as the militant captain. Tom Everett's high-pitched voice simply splits your sides in frustration in anticipation of laughter. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid, brilliant as Cousin Ed in the National Lampoon's Vacation series, is quite the opposite here, interpreting the instability of Hartounian Lawyer. The looks of disbelief shown by the fact that the actor has contemplated the character of Quaid with the intention that they are hilarious acts of inappropriate violence echo the audience. You are not laughing. Just ask "What the hell is he doing?" <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase appears, all this in an occasional and wisely, rather fleeting way, considering the disaster that is taking place around it, as the club pro 'Tye Webb' in The movies only make direct reference to original, despite the golf course itself. Chase, with her deeply tanned skin and strong Hawaiian shirts, seems to have just returned from a long summer vacation and needs a paycheck. It moves away from the events in the real image, enough to take the blame and leave some, even if little, the credibility is still intact. <br /> <br /> Jessica Lundy, like Mason's daughter, 'Kate', takes over the 'Danny Noonan' role of the original as a teenager fighting against class divisions. It sounds ridiculous right? At least in the first Danny (an Irish Catholic from a blue-collar family) and his ridiculous attempts to make inroads into the world dominated by Anglo-Saxons and white Protestants, he played a series of memorable pieces as as dismissed by the Lutheran bishop resident, as well as mocked by the offspring of the local yacht club. Lundy's shame about his father's inability to adapt is implied by his Jewish roots. Apart from that, it may also have to do with him being a classless jerk, but such complexities are left aside although I stopped worrying long before they were solved. At the end of the day, Noonan was trying to get ahead in life. Miss Hartounian's biggest problem is getting the kitchen enthusiast at the local golf club to appreciate her multi-millionaire father so he can have an appointment with the club's prodigal white child. Or so I have picked it up. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in short, it is poorly written, poorly written with unconvincing pieces and wastes a lot of talent. In fact congratulations if you could sit through it until its conclusion. It really is a penance. However, there is a question mark about why so many original actors did not come back instead of being replaced by artists who, at least on paper, looked like their peers. Maybe they just were not asked. Or maybe I suspect they really read the script. Adhere to the original !!!
