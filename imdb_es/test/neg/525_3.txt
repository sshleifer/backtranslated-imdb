Some aspects of this production are good, such as the performances of Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal and Sal Mistretta. But am I the only one who gets distracted by the horrible performance of Betsy Joslyn as Johanna? She is terrible She silences the songs with her shrill voice and exaggerates in a role she clearly does not understand. I also think that the choir is not up to par. They drag the tempo and make the worst facial expressions. In general, I think this production is fine, but Sweeney Todd can be much more if done correctly. This production does not approach the level demanded by this material. The concert version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.
