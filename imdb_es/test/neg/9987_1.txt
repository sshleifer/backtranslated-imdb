Incomprehensibly terrible mix of the probably most notorious of all the Roman emperors who went crazy, leaving orgies of infamous parties and ruthless murders on their way ... I know there are several versions of this, and this is based on the 102 min 'that I see, but I can not understand how that can make a difference to get the rest of this movie out of the trash! <br /> <br /> I had listened for a long time about the alleged "shocking" content of sex / nudity (which honestly is not much here, and boring when there is) and blood, but beware, it's the technical production of amateur what really shocks: everything seems simple and simple, like a junior film school. draft! The camera work is irremediably inept, full of strange zooms, failed frames and confusing pans (from and to what appears to be a great theater stage!) With a grainy and cheap photographic quality. The lighting and the color combinations are terrible and unequal, is it day or night? Are they inside or outside? Have the scenes changed? Who is or is destined to be in the shot? The editing is the final sin here, making a confusing mess of everything with random cuts, continuity failures and random transitions that destroy any possibility of impulse, progression of history and participation. There is a potentially interesting dialogue and an equally interesting historical history ... but these failures are so distracting that it is tragic. <br /> <br /> A story with MANY possibilities of being great is just a gigantic one, burned (and Fellini). -like) the turkey that is only good for a few laughs and Peter O'Toole, who makes a memorable Tiberius. Oh yes, which brings us to the renowned actors. I would like to align them all one by one and just ask: Who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be part of this? There, I've lost enough lines in one of the worst movies of all time! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 of Ozjeppe
