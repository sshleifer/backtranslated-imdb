Bill Rebane's "The Capture of Bigfoot" is one of the most horrible horror films ever made. Harvey Olsen (Richard Kennedy), owner of a greedy sawmill, decides he wants Bigfoot to be captured at all costs. that Bigfoot used to live in peace annoyed by a geological expedition, and intends to protect the creature. There is nothing remotely interesting about this piece of garbage. The movie is extremely boring and full of horrible songs and cheap special effects. No Gore, no suspense, only gigantic boredom. Avoid this horrible crap like the plague.
