I made the mistake of buying this since I collect movies inspired by comics. Even at $ 6 it was too expensive. I thought there might be a bit of country fun in that, a "so bad" that it might turn into a good vibe, I was wrong. I had seen it once a long time ago and I did not remember any of that. Now I know why. I was bored with my mind and I was looking for distractions to do something else. I am in favor of grrrrl power, punk attitude and absurd humor, but Tank Girl does not work on any front. The script is bad, you do not care about the characters and the humor is quite scarce, except for some simple and funny sentences. Special effects or locations are deficient or are often replaced by comic panels or animations that are too discordant compared to live action. It's like they do not have the money to shoot cool stuff and draw on drawings, no matter how cool they are (an animated feature without censorship would be much better for Tank Girl now that I think about it). The action scenes were cheesy, but not in a funny way of movies. The tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic, although it was decorated in an interesting way. In fact, the best action scenes related to the tank were in animation. <br /> <br /> It has some interesting songs from artists known as Bjork, Hole and Portishead, but instead of improving the atmosphere, they do not fit most of the time. Once they even break into a ridiculous song and dance number that was simply meaningless and horrible. I think that was when I completely disconnected. I guess that Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, has a trashy look, but beyond her "attitude" and, sometimes, just funny, is more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst comic characters. Jet, played by Naomi Watts, is probably the only salvation of the movie and it's amazing how such a good actress was involved in this mess. Malcolm McDowell was not so bad at playing his usual villain role. It may be a cult movie for some, but keep in mind that it's really different from the original independent comics and that the original creators were disappointed with the movie (see the Tank Girl entry on Wikipedia). <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 of 10
