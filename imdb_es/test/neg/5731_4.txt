It is sad that Schwarzenegger was the best of this production, especially considering the fact that he had not yet recovered, and that he was still as rigid as cardboard in his dialogue. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is not as bad as some critics say, but it is not good either. It is fun, and YES plays like a poor cousin of the Conan line, which makes it a conflictive, unequal and poor job. And speaking of the poor, the quality is terrible, due to the time in which it was filmed, but that is not the only reason. <br /> <br /> The story included here is inferior, even to the Conan line, but also, it is lost in the "Red Sonja must be dominated by a great strategy of Schwarzenegger", and completely forgets its purpose , if you ever had one. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining, but on a low budget, guilty - please "B" kind of way. <br /> <br /> Rate a 4.2 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
