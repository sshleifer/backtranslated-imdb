This for one has nothing to do with the first absolutely fantastic movie. And, of course, Americans just have to redo everything successful in English, because the man who reads the subtitles is SOOOOO. Is not difficult! From what I've seen in the new trailers with the lovely Jessica Alba now pregnant (well, that does spoil the fantasy of all teenagers, it does not seem that way!) It seems EXACTLY the same but probably with double the budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror / suspense / mystery movies I've seen in any language in a long time. I would recommend seeing it and skipping it all at once, there is no reason to see it, since there is no reason for it to be called "The Eye 2", except to take advantage of the excellence that was the first movie. Do yourself a favor see "The Eye" at high volume and get ready for a possible jump. I saw it with headphones on and I was pleasantly surprised by the excellence that was the direction of the Pang brothers. If the remake of "The Eye" does well, I hope it does for the careers of the movie Pang Brothers, but at the same time it seems a pity that people do not see or can not see the original, because very often / Almost always the remake is not as good as the original. Look at it if you want to be a bit boring, but the original is not a comparison with this sequel to the movie-only name.
