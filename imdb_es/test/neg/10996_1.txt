Bad editing, bad production values, bad continuity, improbable, bad dialogue ... these films are bad, bad, bad. However, if you want a movie to mock (the MST3000), this is your movie. I would not suggest spending a lot of money on that, but if you watch this movie, make sure it's a bunch of witty and like-minded friends.
