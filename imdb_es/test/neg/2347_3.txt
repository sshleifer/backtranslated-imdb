"The Cellar" is a cheese parade of the 80's intolerably boring and too child friendly, directed by Kevin Tenney (creator of the much better films "Witchboard" and "Night of the Demons") and starring the incredibly untalented Patrick Kilpatrick, who supposedly represents a boy with feelings The rhythm is really slow, the plot feels too familiar, the effects of the monsters are almost petrifying and the film begins and ends with a tedious narrative that is not related to the real theme of the movie. The voice-over continues to insist on the wind and the creatures that ride in the wind, but what the hell, there's no wind in the plot? Like so many horror films of the '80s, "The Cellar" deals with cursed Indian landscapes and totally real mythical monsters hidden in basements and swamps. Mance Cashen and his family move into a house built in what was once the home of Native Americans, but then the whites came and turned the land into oil fields. Half of the script is wasted explaining the origin of the monster, but I can summarize it easily for you: an ancient Indian sorcerer summoned the creature (which looks like a large papier-mâché rat) to annihilate the white people who overflow their land , but he buried it again because, and I quote, the SOB also kills the Indians. Mance's extremely irritating son accidentally awakens the beast and, of course, can not convince his parents about the big hungry rat in the basement. The supposedly emotional family situation (dad constantly wants his son to love him) is very pathetic and redundant and the film needed much more bloodshed; Film for children or not. The young hero (Chris Miller) is quite annoying, but we've definitely seen worse childhood actors in the 80's. "The Cellar" is not recommended, unless, of course, you're a fan of the designs of monsters typical of the 80s. The great questionable thing about the rat is a real pleasure to see.
