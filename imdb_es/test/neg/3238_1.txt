Every time I think about this movie I feel physically sick. Reading such a good book and then discovering that there is a movie is a great sensation. Years later, imagine my joy at turning on the science fiction channel and find it in just 5 minutes! Upload the titles and then uggg. If only a couple of things had changed well. Everything is changed. Numerous characters are removed and completely new garbage is added. The main hero is shrunken and aged in about 30 years, and hilariously his girlfriend / wife is now his mother! Even the dog is reduced to sub-lassie abilities. This is the truly atrocious cinema at its worst. I would love to take off my toenails with pliers instead of sitting in another horrible sight, and I urge anyone who thinks to look at this, please do not do it. If you have a copy, quate it now, right now and think how much better your life would have been if this insult to celluloid had never happened.
