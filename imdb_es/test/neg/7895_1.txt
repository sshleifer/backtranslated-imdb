I watched this movie with my boyfriend, an avid hip-hop fan, and he really was eager to capture the "soul" atmosphere that the movie claimed to have. Boy, we were very wrong. When I finished watching the movie I felt two things: remorse and relief. Remorse because I regretted losing my time to see this horrible manure, and relief because I saw it for free on the wire. <br /> <br /> This movie really gives blacks a bad name by putting up such horrible stereotypes that I think all smart black people everywhere have been trying to spell. I am Asian, and I feel very sorry and sick for those who made this movie. What else to say? Bad writing, worse acting and a horrible story. <br /> <br /> Even if you are bored of dying and you have no other choice, do not watch this movie. Seriously. The film really has nothing to offer, except if you want to see things like the illegal consumption of alcoholic beverages, the killing of animals, the degradation of women and, in general: A FILM INCREDIBLY BAD AND WHICH IS NOT FOUND BY OBJECTIVE.
