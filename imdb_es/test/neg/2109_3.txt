The film begins in Mexico, where a girl has been cursed, spits snakes through green jelly and her friend tries all these crazy spells to lift the curse. He does nothing more than sing a horrible language that does nothing, so they decide to cross the border, get on the train to go to L. To see his uncle and lift the curse. Comic hilarity occurs. This movie has the same snakes again and again! It has garden snakes and pythons that will never bite. All make the sound of rattlesnakes that does not make sense. The whole movie has some fun lines, some weak effects, but the most important thing is a great ending that leaves you as WHAM BAM. The whole movie is about a 1, but the end is a 10, so for my crazy math you get a 3 in general. When blockbuster does not have anything else you want, get this to entertain without thinking!
