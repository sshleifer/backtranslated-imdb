The evil bikie band in this movie was called The Savages, hence the title, but Minor Nuisances would have been a better name for this unfortunate crowd of weak actors trying to look dangerous. Every time they wanted to kill someone, they generously mounted their bicycles very slowly so that their victim could avoid or push them. His leader had a bad limp, but he still thought he could face the hero and win. As for Karen Black, she did not seem to know where she was for most of the movie.
