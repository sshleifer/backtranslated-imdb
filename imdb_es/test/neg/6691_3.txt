Stars: Hayden Pantierre. <br /> <br /> There have been so many movies that have exactly the same plot, and this is just a bad repeat. The white girl of Populer moves to the ethnic school, it does not fit, soon it is accepted. Originality is non-existent in this, and neither are laughter. It uses so many old badly executed jokes that it's annoying. I do not know why they think it's a good idea to do for the aftermath of mediocre movie video, but it's not. That said, the positive thing about this is that all the people that compose it are quite competent actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> My rating: * from ****. PG-13 for language and sexual humor.
