I do not know, but the movie was too similar to other movies I've seen. The ring, the eye, the dark water, all are the same for me. Do not get me wrong, it's very well done, it's a beautiful camera job, great graphics, but that story is too ... too common. In the end, it is the score that makes suspense, you know: the screams, the rumblings. The characters in the film also do not react very naturally, they move very slowly, surprised by what they see. I know some people who love this kind of movie, and if you do, because it's a well-made movie, I think it's not bad to see it. But if you've seen the movie that I mentioned earlier and you did not like it, then I suggest you do not bother.
