'' Queen of the Damned '' is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie I've seen. The only thing I like about this movie is the soundtrack, besides that (since I'm a fan of Korn, Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park and Wayne Static of Static-X) <br /> <br /> There are so many mistakes and so many bad decisions that I do not even know how to start. They cut as many stories, as the legend of the twin (one of my favorites) the relationship of Armand and Daniel and even Louis is not present, to mention a few. (The plot was dead) First, they should have made a movie of '' The Vampire Lestat '', because it is the second book after '' The interview with the vampire '', and not '' The queen of the curse '' . They tried to squeeze so much information into one movie that you end up getting almost nothing unless you read the vampire chronicles. <br /> <br /> Many significant characters do not seem to have a real importance in this movie. . This is the case of Pandora, for example. <br /> <br /> The actors who choose to play all the characters do not match many of the descriptions of Anne Rice, especially Marius, who is supposed to be a beautiful, tall, stunning blond boy with blue eyes, like Lestat (Stuart Towsend is also far from being like Lestat) I did not understand why they changed the manufacturer of Lestat to be Marius instead of Magnus as well. <br /> <br /> '' Interview with the vampire '' was an incredible movie I loved the actors and Tom Cruise, since Lestat was PERFECT and far superior to Stuart Townsend. (It saddens me that Tom Cruise has rejected the opportunity to play Lestat again). far superior to this fucking movie called '' The Queen of Damned ''. <br /> <br /> Anne Rice was so sensitive with the interview that I did not understand how she had just sold the rights to this terrible production.
