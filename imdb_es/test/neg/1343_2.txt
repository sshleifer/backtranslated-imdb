The Women (2008) by Diane English is, unfortunately, a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman, who I like and enjoy all I've seen, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing and Eva Mendes, who may not be my favorite actors, but are Nice Look, how could the movie be boring, predictable, shameful, sloppy and just plain bad? It was made by Diane English, known as the writer of the hit TV show Murphy Brown, and it is her first film for which she wrote a screenplay. The film has been a work of love for the Englishman who had tried for many years to achieve it and I respect it. I even found the scenes with the secondary players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in brief but memorable cameos, fun, smart and nice, but in general the film is second hand "Sex and the City", which premiered few . Months ago. I did not think Sex and the City was very good when I saw it, but next to The Women, it was just brilliant. At least, Sex and the City saved us the long and insipid scene in the hospital's delivery room where one of the characters was having a baby and his friends supported her. Poor Debra Messing, what did she do to deserve that nightmare for which she was carried out and we, the spectators together with her? Movies like "The Women" give the whole genre, movies for girls, a bad name. There is nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so difficult to make a good comedy about the friendships and difficulties of women, about how to deal with marriage, motherhood and trying professionally? All these are very convincing and important issues with which any modern woman can relate. Why make films with lines, dialogues and situations so clich√©, predictable, not funny and insulting that they are forgotten as soon as the film ends? <br /> <br /> After seeing the new movie, I checked out from my local library, The Original Women and I really enjoyed it. The story was told much better 70 years ago, and it kept my interest all the time. The old movie had a true star power.
