First, I want to clarify a common mistake: it is not unreal that the school that Zoey attends gives laptops to students. At my school, those in grade 7 and above must have Apple Macbooks (this is paid in the admission fee). Keep going This show is very annoying. It has boring, predictable and bad performance plots. Often, the program takes the "feminine power" to a new level, with the girls surpassing the boys in everything they try. But that is not the worst. The worst thing is that, however, all the girls are portrayed as focused on their personal appearances and screaming when they are happy. Except for the intelligent girl, who is presented as a phenomenon obsessed with ugly children and science. However, this show is very addictive. I do not know why, but it is. Although, the most recent season has been so terrible, taking stereotypes, boring plots and bad performances to extremes that I never thought were accessible, so I'm no longer addicted, thankfully.
