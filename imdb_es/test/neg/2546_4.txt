They can be spoilers, so do not read if you do not want to. As for watching the television news, everything has already happened, a big tsunami looms over a bay in the city and CUT, there is nothing more to see, Tokay suffers a great earthquake, did anyone see? More than the 5 seconds that I saw? If you want to make a love story, make a love story, but if you want to use a disastrous movie title, please be kind enough to show me THE DISASTER, PS after watching this movie, go to JISHIN RETTO or any other movie GODZILLA to satisfy the part that was willing to see people screaming and collapsing buildings that did not have the opportunity to do so in this movie. Do not misunderstand me. I love disaster movies and I love the Nihon chimbotsu and Jishin original retto, I even like the latest Poseidon, not with much history, but a very good and graphic disaster sequence, New Nihon chimbotsu loses the point as many times as Pearl Harbor or the day after tomorrow, but at least these two films show good sequences of disasters, and also enough with the expensive FX that showed nothing, give me fake buildings if you want, as long as you destroy them properly. I know I must sound like a sadistic monster, however I went to see Love in reality when I wanted to go see a romantic movie, even grrrrrrr even kimpachi sensei makes me cry and this movie did not. There is also a television series called Chimbotsu nap made in 1975, I have it on DVD and it is much better.
