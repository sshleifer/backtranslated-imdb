Some people say that this show was good in its early years! I do not agree with all of them. The show is simply stupid and pathetic. My mother hates him, I hate him, my father hates him, I do not know about my sister, but hey. Here are some reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1. CHARACTERS: Babies who are used as adult-style characters are stupid. Babies are simply precocious and annoying. Adults and adults are mute and unattractive. The worst character is that Angelica Pickles (she really does it for your eardrums when you had a long, difficult and miserable day in the office) and also that Kimi Finster, who appears later; She is too optimistic and a pain in the butt. He can not decide where he is French or Japanese: it does not matter to know; You are an American citizen and that's it! Oh, what am I talking about, all the characters in this show suck! <br /> <br /> 2. THE STORIES: The stories are unoriginal and mute. They do it as if the babies were going on a great adventure, yes to the backyard shed. In one episode, that silly little brat, Tommy Pickles, the leader, broke into a TV control room and literally almost destroyed it. Do not give children the idea of ​​destroying the normal control rooms of the television station (since they are paid a lot of money in real life). I imagine what the television broadcasters should feel when they broadcast this episode, they will probably start looking at their machines throughout the day, afraid of a baby getting into it. OVER RATED!: The program has gone on for years and people are still inventing stories and new series and spin-offs for this. Get down! The Simpsons have been spending almost the same amount of time as this one, but they are much better and more fun than the babies. The show is simply overrated! People, where is your common sense? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I surprised the television stations around the world that want to broadcast this series even today. The show is total garbage and should never have been produced. The two films for these cartoons stunk the same! 2/10
