I really liked this movie. Sure, the performance was flat, there was no plot, and the villain was the vilest I've seen. Michael Bernardo as Dante is worth it, he laughs in his own right, with an incredibly funny slogan and evil laugh. But it's worth watching, just for the explosion of WORST that you'll see outside of the TV series Power Rangers. You will know when you see it. Honestly, this movie must have the budget of a low quality porn movie. I almost stopped looking after an hour, but I recommend looking at the whole thing; At least, there are a lot of candy for the eyes for everyone to enjoy. Recommended for viewers with a high tolerance for poor films.
