Okay, last night I saw the world premiere of The Exorcist: The Beginning, by Paul Schrader, at the International Festival of Fantasy Films in Brussels. With all the commotion around the movie, it was highly anticipated. <br /> <br /> The director was there and also most of the stars (except Skarsgard). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie was very bad. . It was a real disappointment for me because I am a big fan of the original film by Shrader and Friedkin (RIP) in 1973. <br /> <br /> What happened to him? Most of it actually. The FX (one would think that the Matrix and LOTR digital revolution never happened: it was so badly rendered!), The editing (without real rhythm or rhythm), the acting (only Skarsgard could sometimes convince). The script was an, IMO, created to explain the African scenes in the original movie. So the film had the feeling of a preparatory scene that just did not contribute. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the cinematography of Vittorio Storaro, although I have seen better of him (Apocalypse now). <Br /> <br /> All the time I thought this was just a cut, a work in progress. And that, given the circumstances (well known), is probably what it is. But that does not change the obvious problems with the script. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to meet Schrader (very briefly) but I did not have the guts to tell him what I thought of the film and I was so nervous (this is the guy who wrote Taxi Driver for Christ sake! ) That I forgot to ask him to sign my copy of his Taxi Driver script ...
