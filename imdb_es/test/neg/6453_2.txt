I tried to like this movie. I love Kevin Spacey and I met the other guy in his role as "Big Brain on" Brad in Pulp Fiction. But I just did not care about the characters at all. Kevin Spacey is an imbecile in the whole movie and even discovering some horrible things that happened to him, I did not like it. Especially the end --- which made me hate him even more. This was like seeing a bad car accident. Spacey played a good puncture (he does everything right), but other than that, I do not recommend it.
