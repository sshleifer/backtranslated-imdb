I do not understand. I just do not understand. "Barney and his friends" have been criticized by millions of people over the years, and I admit, I was one of those lambasters. Any child who sees this program does not realize that what they are seeing is just a piece of trash. Barney is very upset, and very selfish. Add Baby Bop, and it gets even worse. Add B.J., then you have a very creepy TV nightmare. Then, you have the children. They're old enough to know what Barney is trying to teach them! What are you doing there in the first place? It would be fun if Barney and his friends showed up on the Jerry Springer show. That would undoubtedly be one of the wildest moments in the history of television! Even more significant is that this program marked the beginning of the end of public television as we knew it, as we have seen fewer and less informative and interesting public television programs that aired in the 70s and 80s. What a difference it makes. a selfish son of a gun. When this program leaves PBS, it will feel a great sigh of relief among millions of people, but it will have made a big dent in the annals of television history. A message for Barney himself: he may not realize it, but his days are numbered. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, there are other options. Better choices
