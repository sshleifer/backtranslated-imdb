False documentaries are proliferating lately so much that the focus, therefore, needs an injection of new and creative material every time it is used to maintain its vitality. This film offers nothing but worn-out retreads of similar stories, an aimless script, weak ad-libs, uninspired acting and a lighthearted and rewarding humor. <br /> <br /> The premise seems quite promising; The legend of the Loch Ness monster is tailor-made for one of these mockumentary foolish misadventures, with a great variety of history and legend waiting to be attacked by outrageous satire. The filmmakers totally waste this enormous potential, however. We have a fool who inserts a fake Nessie in the water. Wow, that's original. Another scene has a hateful idiot threatening another detestable idiot with a gun. Hilarious Some free photos of a pretty girl in a bikini. Annette did that 40 years ago (and much better, by the way). Throughout the film, someone always seems to be screaming: I suppose this is designed to awaken the audience that has fallen asleep at this point. <br /> <br /> Worst of all is the implacable salvo of those realities. Show type "interview comments" made by the characters. Not only do they kill you with this tired joke every five seconds, but, apparently, the actors also improvised; That is the only explanation of how jokes are without humor. If lines like "I've never seen anyone write a book about no evidence" were actually written, then the writer should be filmed in sight and handed over to Nessie. obviously he saw this movie
