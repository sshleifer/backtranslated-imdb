This movie has the language, style and attitude down ... in addition to the great attractions of Occy (a world champion) and the great Jerry Lopez. John Philbin as Turtle has the pidgin surf below, and the surf scenes are the best in history. A true classic that can be seen many times. Nia Peeples is a baby, and Laird Hamilton shows the first things that have made him the number one extreme surfer in the world.
