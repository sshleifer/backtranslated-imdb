This has to be the most boring movie I've ever seen. It is sad and monotonous, it has no enthusiasm, the performance of Hulce is terrible, since Hulce can not achieve the right accent required for this film. The story is stupid and I would not recommend this shit to anyone unless you want to die of boredom.
