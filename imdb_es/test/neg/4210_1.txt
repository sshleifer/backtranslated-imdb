Save some Norris very early, "Breaker, Breaker" has nothing to offer that can not be found ten times better on any broadcast channel. A pathetic attempt to make movies, this is one of the worst movies I've seen. Despite that, I saw it, pressing the fast forward button, because the performance was so horrible that it was comical. Of course, the movie is supposed to be an action / drama but it turned out to be a treatise on how NOT to make a movie. Everything that could be wrong with the film is on screen in this "dog". If you go through it, take a look. It's so bad, it's funny.
