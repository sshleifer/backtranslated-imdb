In general, the movie "Heart of Darkness" was pitiful compared to the book. Anyone who has read the book and understood it enough could see the innumerable obvious flaws. There is an immeasurable difference between the two. It seems to me that the director was entering a lost battle. I could not imagine someone taking on the monstrous task of recreating "The Heart of Darkness." The immense detail and the magic of history would be impossible to interpret with justice. Conrad's story had so many layers and so much depth that it would seem futile to try to make a visual interpretation. <br /> <br /> First of all, capturing the details of the story is unattainable. The colossal fine points created by Joseph Conrad can not be legitimately recreated through cinema. Marlow's feelings and emotions can not be interpreted equally in the film. If he has taken on the enormous task of approaching Conrad's work, he knows as well as I do that Conrad only wrote half the story. The additional half is a series of connections made by the reader. You, as a reader, must be able to infer and connect the ideas of Joseph Conrad. As a result, several crucial details are missing in the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, although the film had a suitable duration, the film seemed short. It seemed that Conrad could pack many more details in 75 pages than the film could package in an hour and a half. The speed of the film prevented the viewer from knowing the characters. Marlow was much more of a stranger. The point of view of the book puts you in Marlow's shoes. However, in the movie, you're almost seeing Marlow from a distance. I began to think that the director was trying to use the same "reading between lines" method as Conrad. However, the connections were weak. I know that if I had not read the book, I could not, in any way, begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters. <br /> <br /> Finally, Kurtz also seemed to interpret himself. incorrectly. His paper was short and the details were not all included. It was impossible to understand the real Kurtz at the time he was shown. An important detail in the book was that Kurtz had become a god for Africans. I did not think that significant detail was defined. In addition, in the book, Kurtz represented a soulless being. He had died inside a long time ago. I think the director understood this detail. However, instead of recreating it, it only made Kurtz depressed and mumbled everything. On the other hand, it seemed that the director tried to make Kurtz look mysterious, but instead, he seemed totally unknown. <br /> <br /> Together, this movie reminded me of a teenager working to complete a science project, due to the next day. It seemed to have been crafted effortlessly and in almost no time. The characters were alienated, the crucial details were omitted and, in general, the central plot was lost in the translation.
