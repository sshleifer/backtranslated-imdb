The huge, grimacing tree trunk threatens the fake "natives" on a "Pacific atoll" (which looks suspiciously like southern California ...), provoking vengeance and revenge. Unlike the stupid stumps in "Navy VS The Night Monsters," the Tabonga is actually an adult tree-man. Well, grown in 2 days: most of the time they hated each other in those spikes of Miracle Grow ... Anyway, it does not come from hell, but from the grave of a false native, Kimo (Greg Palmer, "The zombies de Mora Tau ") Killed by the native elders for dating those terrible American scientists. Scientists include Dr. William Arnold (Tod Andrews, "Hang 'em High", "Beneath the Planet of the Apes") and Professor Clark (John McNamara, "War of the Colossal Beast"). Rounding out the cast is Linda Watkins ("The Parent Trap") as the obnoxious Mrs. Kilgore, the obvious comic relief that produces an obvious false "cockney" accent. A star cast indeed! Anycow, because his wavering and stout wife, Korey, played in an amateur manner by Suzanne Ridgeway ("Love's A-Poppin '"), helps him prepare him, Kimo declares his revenge against her and all the elders. Then, American dopey scientists uproot the tree, return it to life "in the name of science" and allow it SLOWLY roaming the island, killing all who have done wrong. Of course, we all know that the evil monsters take the beautiful maidens, so the Tabonga grabs the female scientist, Dr. Terry Mason (Tina Carver, "Hell on Frisco Bay") and goes with her. Vine-ally, a good shot with a Remmington hits a knife lodged in the Tabonga, and falls dead in the quicksand. This ridiculously silly cowncept is one of the howlers of all time. It could be said that the Tabonga is the slowest monster in the history of moovies, with the robust robot of "Robot Monster vs. the Aztec Mummy" and the perversely slow monster of "Creeping Terror". Try not to laugh while watching Tabonga throw false natives downhill and into quicksand, dodge spears and slowly navigate the "island". The writing in the shade, the wooden performances and the sappy direction all point to this pulpy fertilizer having much more bark than the bite. This lukewarm pile of wood chips was the last hurray of Dan Milner, who for a long time became a director and became a director, who quickly disappeared into the well-deserved darkness after this movie. You take it through the MooCow vine first: "From Hell it Came" is a classic compost! : ??
