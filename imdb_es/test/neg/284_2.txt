SPOILER !! Terrible camera work, horrible writing, non-existent plot and numerous plot sets. Wonderful performance! Except for Julia Roberts. Who misinterprets someone who is posing as Julia Roberts, wrong. Catherine Zeta Jones is adorable in this movie. <br /> <br /> During the film, we repeatedly approach each of the twelve (!) Characters. Twelve is too much, even for a classic like 12 Angry Men. And the problem is that we tediously approach the characters, when everyone is in the same room, doing the same. <br /> <br /> Yes, Clooney is eating. Yes, Pitt is eating. Yes, the "Jew" is eating. Yes, the geek is eating. Yes, the bodybuilder is eating. Yes, Mr. Sensitive is eating. Yes Yes Yes yes Yes. Yes. Ugh! This happens at least three other times in the movie. Yes, everyone is sitting in cars, bored. Yes, everyone is being arrested, scared. Yes, everyone is being taken out of prison, depressed. <br /> <br /> But it was not until I was at home that I realized how badly they had "gotten me" in this case. This is a robbery movie, right? That's what I went to see, right? But when I got in and put my car keys in the change bin, only then did I realize: NOTHING WAS STOLEN ON THIS MOVIE! It's okay. It's a robbery movie, where nothing is stolen. Oh, they try. They try to steal some boring document or something like that, from a guy's house (whatever it is), and it turns out they've already stolen it. 20 minutes of my life, wasted. Then they try to steal an egg from a museum (YAWN!), They ruin it and they are arrested. <br /> <br /> Then we see how a French fairy stole the egg even before they did, and we get all the joy of "Atrapment", except that this time the person who is inside the tight cat suit dancing around fake lasers is ... an ugly and ugly French guy. Um. <br /> <br /> But it turns out that he did not actually steal the egg either. In fact, our heroes stole the egg, LOOOONG ago, in another movie completely, which would have been a GREAT movie to watch, if they had made that movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, we see a 30-second clip in black. and about how they stole a backpack from a college student. You heard me ... the audacious career, the final robbery ... the accumulation of these 2 and a half hours of totally boring shit ... is the theft of a backpack of a university student, creatively entering a fight for baseball . Teams and distract him, and replacing his backpack with an identical backpack? What?? <br /> <br /> Ugh. I tell you that this was so bad, I did not even realize how bad it was, how badly it had been stolen, until I got home.
