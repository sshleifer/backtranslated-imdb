Be careful, the next time you see "Richard Kelly" involved in any production, run away. Quick. <br /> <br /> Kelly showed the world after his latest movie, "Southland Tales", that he is a pretentious director. It was indulgent and convoluted. In "The Box", it has not changed much. <br /> <br /> I can imagine what its release was to Warner Bros, and I bet the studio executives ate it: a full movie based on one of Richard's old short stories by Matheson "Twilight Zone". <br /> <br /> Big mistake! Do not continue reading unless you want this movie to go COMPLETELY: <br /> <br /> Norma (Cameron Diaz) presses the button. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an Alien who uses his body as a vessel to perform "experiments" on which the fate of humanity rests. His face has scars because he was hit by an alien ray, which killed him, but then he returned it to life to do all these tests of the red button. Obviously, given that Norma presses the button, knowing very well that someone can die, she must suffer the consequences for not considering the life of another person instead of his. In the end, she and her husband (James Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of her son growing deaf and blind. <br /> <br /> Kelly dances around the "message" of her film, trying to make the audience know what the moral of the story is. Obviously, anyone with a brain is saying at the beginning: "What would happen if I were the person who dies?" Richard Kelly does not even let his character have this normal, HUMAN conversation. In fact, they avoid everything together. It seems that both are educated, that they work in a prestigious school and also for NASA, so, why would not they have a better capacity to LOOK OUT OF THE BOX? The characters really have this conversation, the whole movie could have ended there! Instead, we have to see weddings that go on forever, NASA and the NSA are complacent with Arlington Stewart, who takes over these government programs, teleports to show Marsden's life beyond our world, so It will be "easier" to kill his wife, and the drones controlled by Steward, who can be anywhere and at any place, at any time. <br /> <br /> The most painful part of this movie is the rhythm. Nothing really happens. It's a confusing mix of ideas that are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It is unbearable how this movie is being marketed. The commercials make it look like "Saw" and even use the music of those movies to sell it. Actually, what you get is a slow, boring, laughable movie (yes, half the theater laughed at the acting and visual effects) and a messy movie that is neither imaginative, nor interesting, nor cohesive. At one point, Cameron Diaz and his son are kidnapped and then, suddenly, he returns to the big black NSA car with his husband on the way home. Where was he? Why did they take her? Do we really care? You will not do it anymore. <br /> <br /> In the end, you will not care what happens with any of the characters. You will be encouraging everyone to die for the movie to end. Go see anything else that is playing. Do not waste your time or your money.
