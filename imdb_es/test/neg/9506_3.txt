In part, I'm a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "in part" because most of his films fall into two categories: bright and boring. Unfortunately, this movie belongs to the later category. <br /> <br /> This movie has the same fundamental problems as the recent Miyazaki movie "Howl's Moving Castle." An intriguing premise is established, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot instead of explaining it. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film reveals the post-the apocalyptic world in which the story unfolds, and in fact it seems that a very interesting story is about to unfold. From then on things go downhill. The middle part of the film is mainly composed of an echo propaganda of fine veil, and the end is strongly affected by the confidence in the kind of impenetrable spiritualism that ruins a lot of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> In general, the film feels as if someone has ripped out all other pages of the script before passing it on to the animators. What remains is something that is visually impressive (although, unfortunately, the version I saw was a copy of generation n, with a poor color, which gives rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows its lower part when flying), but that makes little sense and in the end it left me confused.
