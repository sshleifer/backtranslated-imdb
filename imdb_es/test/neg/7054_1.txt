My brother was working in a cinema when I saw this movie; I saw it for free and even then I left. I have seen many movies in my time, but this was the worst. When people ask me what is the worst movie I've seen, I mention this movie in less than a second. This movie is bad because it goes from one plot to the next, promotes stereotypes about blacks that are disgusting and the flow is horrible. If you want to see how to make children cry and vomit at the same time, study this movie. Ok, this movie is not good "bad" but terrible bad. If you are like one of those people who watch horrible movies for fun, like me, you will not even be able to overcome this very short video. Please, for the love of God, destroy all the copies of this movie.
