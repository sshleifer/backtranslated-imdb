For Jove, that profane disaster! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games such as struggle, incessant and absolutely unnecessary violence, a primitive "music" that strikes bewildered victims, the great "surprises" (which in reality tend to be as "revealing" as the headlines of The National Enquirer). Add some shoddy camera movements that claim to be elegant and creative and have already impressed the crowd. The totally undeserved popularity of this film indicates powerfully that the very low level pop subculture has achieved not only in recent decades, but also in imposing the dominant taste in a powerless audience. (For a much deeper understanding of human suffering under mental illness, without the vulgar excesses of "Oldboy," I recommend an older Dutch / French film, "The Vanishing.") <br /> <br /> Well, no You create There is absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. In fact there is. The (in) famous scene in which the hero (is he really a "hero", an abject father who sleeps with his daughter and then tries to obtain oblivion instead of redemption?) He eats a live octopus that benefits enormously from the vivid presence of the best Actor in the entire cast: the octopus itself. Too bad that the poor beast, having eaten, could not survive his only act to obtain another worthless diploma, for the "best actor", at the Cannes festival. <br /> <br /> What a festival, by the way, between the foolishness of Moore's propaganda and this epitome of worthless rarity, albeit somewhat exotic, became a festival of the insipid and the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Sic transit gloria mundi
