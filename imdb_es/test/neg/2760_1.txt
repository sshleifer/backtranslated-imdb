I was forced to read this "love story" between a 24-year-old German prisoner of war and a 12-year-old Jew. That has "political correctness" written everywhere. It's like the movie "SPIRIT" in which a horse wants to be free, but those "evil" Americans do not leave because they need it. Well, I have good news that Americans are "evil" in The German Soldier and his summer book. Why!!! The horses were given to us by God and if the Americans needed a horse, they could use it. In the same vein, the German had been trying to kill the Americans, but this book / movie seems to be fine! The casting is absolutely horrible !!!!!!!!!!!! The girl is Hispanic, the mother is white, the father is probably of mostly white descent and the little sister is "shirley templish." The acting is also pretty bad, the serious parts become comedy! Conclusion-Bad movie, bad book, but both have different endings, do not read or see any of them!
