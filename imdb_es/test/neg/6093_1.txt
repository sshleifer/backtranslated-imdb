If you make a thriller, it is important that the "villain" is not more understanding than the "victim". And this fails miserably. It was so terrible and frustrating to see that I was moved to register and comment. OK, then the husband is rich and arrogant. There are worse vices, and the boy and the wife of the cabin show a lot. The husband is an imbecile because he ... did not approve of the boy in the cabin physically assaulting that woman, the witch who had absolutely nothing to do with the BTW plot. The boy in the cabin threatens the husband and repeatedly tries to seduce the wife. Then she forces herself, that the woman finds so hot that she stops thinking about a rape and begins to think that she wants it. UH Huh. The misogynistic thoughts and inferiority complexes that the director shows are simply disgusting. One thing is when a good movie like American Psycho deliberately tries to identify us with the villain, but on Survival Island I felt like I was watching a movie about Ted Bundy, but the director did not get him to like it and instead made us hate his victims What was he thinking?
