I'm not sure what the director and the editor thought when they were editing this poor excuse for a movie, but what they thought did not help this movie, it just hurt and hurt this movie a lot. The performance, for once, is not the problem, it is the horrible edition, the scenes will end for no apparent reason, while in the middle of a sequence of action or people will be cut in the middle of the sentence. I'm not sure what the story was, but it did not really matter, since what I saw was quite uninteresting. Just bad, a big scam "Jaws" and not a good one at that. However, the MST version was fun. 7 for that, none for the movie itself.
