This is my first "horrible" rating on IMDb and I could not think of a more deserving movie to honor her. I was hoping to entertain the trash and I found the trash of the saddest and most boring guy. I found a movie that nobody cares a bit, including its creator. <br /> <br /> "Hell Ride", directed, written and starring Larry "Friend of QT" Bishop, has a simple argument. about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two bands of motorcyclists and a horrible murder in 1976 that has not yet been avenged. Larry seems fiercely determined not to tell this story, focusing instead on putting his main character, strangely outraged, in situations where he can caress the women they pretend to like. It also has a dialogue that contains enough puns and metaphors of horrible fire to put one of the word "fire" for life. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper escapes from complete humiliation, others are not so lucky. Sometimes they hit the road on their bicycles, making one feel even more distressed by Michael Madsen, as their high handles seem to add insult to the injury of having to appear in this movie. There are a lot of nudes improved with silicone, but quite little action and no humor, which makes you wonder what kind of audience they had in mind. <br /> <br /> I think most of the people who watch this movie, including fans of the motorcycle movies of the 60s, will feel cheated. Do yourself a favor and revisit the real things instead.
