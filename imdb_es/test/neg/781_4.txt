This is a flic that you can safely avoid. child plot and Cameron's bad acting (she really should not assume these serious roles, they do not fit her) Besides that she looks very unglamorous, let's face it, she's great at Charlies Angels and she was great at There Something about Mary. .. The Pope would not be a good president of the USA. UU And vice versa, my point is that there are some actors / actresses that adapt to a particular type of character and that Cameron is the most inadequate for this type of serious housewife. There's a dozen other actress' would have done a much better job. The movie itself is quite amazing and youthful in its plot (do I spell Juvinile, right?) I noticed a comment from another reviewer who gave The Box a rating of 10, who was mocking in his comments about other reviewers who gave him a rating to the movie. 1 or 2 rating and could not spell. I mean, what does the spelling have to do with a movie review? Do you mean that people who spell perfectly could appreciate this movie more than those who could not? Come on, professor
