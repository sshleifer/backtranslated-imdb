He had his moments, but in general, when I saw this caricature of a girl, I got bored in the head. The only thing that kept me seeing was the fact that it was a caricature, probably my first anime exposure. It is also one of my less favorite animes, I remember others that involved a giant ship in space that did not make sense, but it was more pleasant because they were in space. I also remember one with these people dressed as birds that was a bit strange, but more entertaining. Although I do not really like car racing, I did not do it at the time and not yet, so it's probably one of the reasons why I was not interested in this show, although today I'm an avid fan of anime. The characters were also a bit silly, and then there were the horrible scenes where practically no action was taken that would probably be used to reduce the cost of animation and to fill the show. The gadgets in the cars were great and they gave me some entertainment back then. In general, I find that this program is quite inopportune compared to the newer animes and some of the same time, but this is just a personal opinion. I'm sure many other users love the program, which is great.
