Well, Anne is too old. Wentworth looks younger than her and he should not. Louisa is too young and very cheerful Oh sister Mary is too pretty. It's supposed to be normal, not pretty. When this actress complains about the way Mary should, all I think is that she is too pretty to be complaining about. Lady Russell is too old. This is crazy. If you read the novel, she is Anne's most mature friend, maybe as old as Annes' mother, who would be about 18-20 years older than Anne, so about 50 NO 70! It's crazy, it does not fit. How is it that Anne is so happy at the beginning? She smiles when she says "oh, the worst has happened, I've seen it now, the worst has happened", yes, of course. Okay, if someone has seen Roger Michell's 1995 version, he can not compare these two. That is the correct one. This is very far. Read the novel and you will know what I mean.
