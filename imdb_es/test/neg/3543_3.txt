Nightscream is a movie for television, so it is destined to be quite serious, especially because it is a supposed horror movie. This girl is obsessed with dreams when she arrives in a small town where there was a murder of a woman a year before. He is amazed when everyone in the city thinks he looks like the murdered girl. The people of the town are surprised when she continues to enter into dreams as trances where she reveals precise details about the murderer and the murderer because the police apparently made a mistake. Thinking that they are in danger of being discovered, the murderers (there are two of them) begin to devise a plan to get rid of her before she gets to the real truth. By now, you probably have already fallen asleep and why do the creators of the film have the 'fog machine' at full speed in the sequences of dreams?
