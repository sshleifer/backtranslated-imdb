While the dog was cute, the movie was not. It was not the premise, or the issue that was a problem. The premise had great possibilities for both humor and pathos. The theme is worthy. Helping other people is more important than accumulating a fortune. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the adorable dog, the only premise and theme were undermined by bad acting, forced dialogue and amateur filming. Even my youngest son, who will sit through almost anything, gave up before we had reached the middle. How many times can that dog run up and down the same aisle? I can not spoil it for you, since I never saw the end. It just was not worth looking until the end.
