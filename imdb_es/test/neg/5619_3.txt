With this film directed by Roger Avery and Quentin Tarantino doing the script, I was sure that it was going to be a jewel. I was wrong. I do not hate this movie, but I do not like it in any way. <br /> <br /> I love Roger Avery for his incredible direction in the rules of attraction and his scripts for pulp fiction and silent hill, but he made a mistake in doing this. Do I really need to comment on Tarantino? We all know that he is a genius. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around a gang that steals a bank but fails due to silly people participating in the theft <br /> <I'm disappointed in Tarantino and Avery for making this movie, but I do not change my opinion about how amazing both are. everyone makes mistakes ......... 3/10 ............ j.d Seaton
