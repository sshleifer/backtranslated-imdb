A very horrible movie, I'm surprised by the likes of Derek Jacobi and Vanessa Redgrave agreed to be in it, it's like a too long episode of a bad series of television detectives. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw has to be Vinnie Jones, he just can not act, who had the brilliant idea of ​​considering him an important man who wants his head examined unless he puts his money in it? draft? I should keep playing bullies, looking threatening and NOT talking! <br /> <br /> There was also central heating at the time of Dickens, as there were three large radiators behind his desk. <br /> <br /> No wonder they gave this away for free with a newspaper that no one would pay to see it.
