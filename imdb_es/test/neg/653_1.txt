Renee Zellweger is radiant, but the rest of this movie just does not work. It's like a hamburger salad, jelly, an interesting idea, but who thought it would work in a movie? I like the two previous films by director LaBute, who were ruthlessly honest and chilling. This film only manages to be ruthless and chilling, with gigantic parts of the characters. (As a high concept, think: the Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie that Sam Peckinpah could have made, now lower your expectations to match the current mass-produced Hollywood state). Such talented actors as Freeman, Kinnear, Eckhart, Vince and Janney ALMOST make their scenes come alive is a testament to the immensity of their talents to rise above material that simply does not come together. I would have found it funny (in the manner of the lyncheans) Freeman's cheesy speech to feel good about yourself if it were not for the lingering suspicion that this moral not implicitly hinted must be seriously accepted. .
