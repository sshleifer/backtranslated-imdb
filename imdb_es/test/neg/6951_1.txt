Bad. Personal opinion? The people who did it? They knew when they did it. To star in this film, once again my opinion, you needed to meet three criteria ... # 1: You had to own your own Gothic style clothes and jewelry. It makes the costumes easier and cheaper in that way. # 2: You must be able to remember and repeat your lines without reference cards. Keep in mind that I did not say you had to do it right. Save time and paperwork # 3: You had to be willing to undress. Give a rating of R and therefore reinforce sales. Do you want to see a better movie? Easy. Get a camera and some of your friends together and do it yourself. Trust me, you will not do anything worse. As vampire movies go, well, this sucks. And a hint here for people like me who likes to look for little quirks in movies ... Consider the link between vampires and crosses. Now, take a look at the symbols and names on the tombstones in the parts of the cemetery where they were filmed. Ed Wood could not have planned that kind of accident.
