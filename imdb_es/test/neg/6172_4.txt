I decided to watch this movie to sleep. He kept me awake, so it was interesting; however, it was quite smooth. <br /> <br /> The acting was good. I do not think any of the actors did a bad job. Mickey Rourke is as credible as a hit man can be above the hill. The dialogue in this film does not provide many opportunities for these actors to show their full potential, but they still shone. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere was great. The music was good and the colors matched the mood the director wanted to paint for the audience. Even the weather improved the mood of the film. Everything was well done. <br /> <br /> The failures of this film are in the development of its history. The story with the mafia against Blackbird does not get enough attention. The story of Carmen and Wayne's divorce is not explained. The FBI seems to work faster here. Is there no paperwork for all these processes? Is it really that easy to take your brother's body out of his grave, burn the corpse and identify you like you? There are too many loops in the story to give this film something higher than a rating of 4 out of 10. I would not recommend this movie to people unless they are really bored and have smoked a really good herb. Even if WoW is out of service for maintenance, go find something better to do than watch this movie.
