The bored characters of an almost undeveloped note, the unimpressive interpretations of people who sound as if they were simply reading lines, and the ridiculous special effects combine to make this a genuine smelly thing. The story begins with the eminently insipid command Russo and his fellow soldiers attacking a training base of Al-Qaeda. The scene tells us that Al-Qaeda has recently come looking for a definitive weapon, and it also serves to illustrate Russo's only character trait, a tendency to avoid teamwork. With the help of a collection of blank slates and stereotypes of walking, including a Russian spy, Russo travels to the territory of Chechnya to catch a mad scientist who works for terrorists. Along the way, they encounter vast hordes of carnivorous bats that fly in broad daylight for some reason. From there, the film becomes nothing more than a torrent of ridiculous action, which includes a scene in which a swarm of bats cuts the arm of a soldier.
