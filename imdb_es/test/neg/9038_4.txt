While not really terrible, this film is still largely a waste of time, and presents an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of the history of the Beach Boys. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie would make you believe that Mike Love was the brain behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psychopath. In fact, none of the characters develops beyond a one-dimensional parody, but this is a television movie, what do you expect? The bad smell of Mike Love is all over this turkey while he tries to rewrite the story with himself in the role of band head and resident genius. Yes, as if ... <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the music is excellent. Unlike the Summer Boys biography made for TV, "Summer Dreams", this movie actually presents real Beach Boys music, rather than versions of anemic covers ... In addition, it presents a surprising number of Beach-related oddities Boys and rarely - tracks listened to: the Sunrays "I Live for the Sun" are just one example. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally shown in two parts on the American television network. The first part is the superior of the two and documents the first days of the boys and ascends to the top. By the time the second part begins, the character of Brian Wilson has become a mere caricature and the actor seems to be playing to laugh, but how could anyone take this shit seriously? If you're not a Beach Boys fan, you probably will not get much from this movie, except for an extremely distorted and unilateral view of the band's history. But again, why would you see this if you were not a fan?
