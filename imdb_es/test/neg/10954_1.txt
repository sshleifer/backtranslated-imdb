This movie disconcerted me. I could not control it. I thought I might be missing something. I'm glad to see that most of you agree with me. This is not always the case (see my recent revision of RE: Extinction). <br /> <br /> Exposing about the faults of this film beyond would be a glorious waste of time ... so I will. .. <br /> <br /> They're dressed like cowboys, but they're modern times, right? Do not? I do not get it ??? When I picked up the box, I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! GUAY! This is how it was presented. I have not seen that yet. I hope you have done a good job. <br /> <br /> They did not do it! They tried to create an iconic character that would engender a series. They did not. <br /> <br /> They tried to make an Australian indie zombie movie in the caliber (and perhaps riding in the queues) of the very well done "UNDEAD". They did not. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe they just wanted to make a confusing, disjointed, messy movie salad that, ultimately, could be edited into something that can be seen. They did not! This is the new number 2 on my Worst Zombie Movies Ever list. Actually, there are only two so far, being "THE DAY OF THE DEAD: CONTAGIO" the first (not to be confused with the "DAY OF THE DEAD", which is one of my favorite zombie movies of all time). If you're going to make a zombie movie (and I'm not a zombie movie maker, I'm just an expert) make a good movie. Flight of the Living Dead is a good example of the recent and decent filming of zombies. FYI <br /> <br /> If you're really forgiving, you might think, well, at least they did not throw something to make us feel like we did not want our money back? Guess what ... they DID NOT!
