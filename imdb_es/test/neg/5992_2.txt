A piece of trash that only the Full Moon Studios can have a group of college students, who stay for free in a former hospital without anyone knowing, as a demonic creature with two faces (barely visible the entire film due to an incomprehensible illumination) it crosses the walls killing each member that has a certain sheet of paper with old marks. Someone among them (it will not be too hard to prove, but a little twist is so uninspiring and simply executed that you'll just mock) is the brain behind who kills the beast and must be revealed before he kills everyone. <Br /> <br /> The cheap, badly acted mess has a "That's it ?!" kind of weak ending that will exasperate you for the reason you lost your time. Tanya Dempsey, who could not act through a wet paper sack, has the duties of the heroine as the newest member of the college housing group named Clark. Oh, and the title refers to the sound the beast makes before attacking its next victim.
