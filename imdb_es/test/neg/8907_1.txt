Honestly, this is a very funny movie if you're looking for a bad performance (Heather Graham could never leave this like that ... she has three titles for a reason: to protect the guilty!), A beautifully bad dialogue ("You like it. ? "), and a plot that only a mother could approve, this is your Friday night entertainment! <br /> <br /> My roommate rented this under the title "Terrified" because he liked Heather Graham, but what we felt after the final credits was scary. Not because the movie is scary, but because someone really paid money to make this shit in a film reel. <br /> <br /> Horrible movie. There are some unnamed actors who offer some unintentional comedy, but nothing worth seeing. The dramatic climax of Heather Graham was also one of the most pathetic and disturbing things I have witnessed. I do not grant any point to this movie, and may God have mercy on your soul.
