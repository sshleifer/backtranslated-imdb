This movie was one of the few that really caused me pain. It can be enjoyed by anyone who thinks it would be fun to see their mother in a crowded nightclub full of people half their age "inventing" a totally ridiculous dance in a totally wrong effort to be "hip" (in the language of that age). See Ingrid Bergman bowing to such a pitiful performance on the dance floor of the nightclub was hard to see. I felt embarrassed. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the music in the disco was not realistic at all, it is the false idea of ​​a Hollywood director about what pop music was like at that time. That is always a total disgrace in most of the films of that era: the music of Ersatz is canned and has a painful and passing resemblance to the music that was actually popular in the 60s. <br /> <br /> Mathau is as useless as some kind of ladies man; He only looks lustfully grotesque. The innocence of Hawn's open eyes is too silly. The beautiful neighbor in her apartment is portrayed in a very serious and serious way. He looks like a Brady boy who got lost in this farce. Painful, unfortunate mess.
