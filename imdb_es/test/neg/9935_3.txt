The series does not start, since it means to continue. Although its first two seasons are full of incredibly average episodes, as well as numerous failures, then the pace accelerates and one of the best space operas is born. The first episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation is notable for two things: it's a very nice presentation for all the main actors, and the peculiar accent of Marina Sirtis that would later disappear. Seeing how everything started is very satisfying, and the rest of the series is taken into account, instead of moving. Otherwise, it is a very mediocre episode with Q, and some giant jellyfish. It's okay.
