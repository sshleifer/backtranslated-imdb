When I think of Bollywood. I think in lite feel good numbers of musical dance, with magnificent suits for men and women. And catchy melodies. The horror, the thrillers, the mystery and the suspense, do not come to mind. And this, to my Western eyes, is like an abstract comedy. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been a better movie, even shorter, if the writer and the director had made a final decision. Whether for the Thriller-Horror, Comedy-Mystery, Supernatural-Suspense or Musical-Romance, instead of an uncomfortable mix of all of them. <br /> <br /> I'll have to say more than once that I thought the director should have seen "I know what you did last summer" and tried to give it a touch of Bollywood. My first movie was Bride & Prejudice. That I thought that it acted well. <br /> <br /> This looked like what a Western public would consider a direct Cheese festival. <br /> <br /> The performance was exaggerated, at times it felt as if they intended to intentionally parody Western thrillers, but when you saw them try to inject dramatic crying, screaming or fear, they felt out of place. <br /> <br /> The viewer was left wondering when one of the actors would wink an eye at the camera. More than a few times when the audience was supposed to be horrified, we could only laugh at the absurdity. <br /> <br /> I see many foreign films, and although I do not know Hindi, I must say that they did a bad job subtitling the movie. Sometimes it was hard to read the white letters against the bright background. <br /> <br /> The villain was particularly funny, at least for me, because he came with his own music of encouragement. The supposedly surprising turn, actually felt like a police exit. <br /> <br /> The leading couples were pretty / beautiful enough, and the musical numbers made it worth my rental fee. I would suggest it to somebody as a musical comedy, but I would tell them to just advance the rest of the movie, because it was not worth the effort to read. If you are determined to read a full subtitled Hindi movie, check out the top romantic drama 'Namasteay, London'. <br /> <br /> But I was not afraid ... unless that is really what they think is horrible in India. 1 out of 10 so it is promoted as. 6 out of 10 for their involuntary speed and capacity for many illicit laughs and their musical / danceable numbers. Enjoy :)
