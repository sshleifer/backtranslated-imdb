The mod squad starts 'after' the formation of 'Mod Squad' without even bothering to develop any of the characters or show us why someone is doing what they are doing. <br /> <br /> In addition, most of the events in the film seem to be complementary to the plot. Without even a touch of character development, the plot snakes from Gen-X club scenes to action scenes and vice versa. <br /> <br />
