Besides the comments about the technical merits of the production, or the lack of them, the performance is absolutely horrible. What really scares this movie is that, actually, I HAVE A copy of it, of course, was in a gangue bin and had been renamed as "Dark Harvest 2", and after having seen it, I can understand why I was in La Ganga: they should have paid me to take it out of their inventory. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie, if you want to call it that, is spent by a frantic father running through a field of corn. Laberinto looks for his daughters because he has the premonition that something will happen to them. I suspect that the camera with which the girls played at the beginning of the movie was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco. In the labyrinth, he meets the ghost of some children, who are badly made, and the film goes terribly south from there. <br /> <br /> I can see why they changed the name of this movie, otherwise, they would never have Discarded them. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've had to watch, and it was not worth the $ 2 I spent on it.
