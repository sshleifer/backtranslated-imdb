I just watched this movie last night. Within 30 minutes of the start, I expected it to end. <br /> <br /> It had a promising start; The first 10 minutes. The premise of this film (the friendship that goes nowhere after spending days (and years) together in "separate" beds in hotel rooms) is simply not credible. He kisses her somewhere along the way, and she feels it is so terrible. <br /> <br /> Very little substance to capture your interest. The performance simply does not hold. He is very passive Regardless of the amount of the film shown, the viewer never develops any kind of solidary connection with the characters on the screen. You learn that your next statement will be as boring as the previous one. ("Do you have a cigarette?", He does not smoke, he wants her to stop smoking, do not you know?) <br /> <br /> She calls him in the middle of the night to visit him after a year of absence , she enters through the door, they do not even hug, they do not kiss or express any kind of emotional connection. She does not even lean forward to lift her suitcase to help her get inside. This is not how real people behave. This is not how best friends behave. <br /> <br /> When she receives her phone call in the middle of the night (she is in town for a day), she shows little interest in seeing her face, acts more as if she were a burden for the night. At this point they met two years ago and he has not seen her for a year. Not credible, not real. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, he has written a book about Entropy and Entthalpy, however, we never see him writing, reading or discussing any of his interests in Physics with her, not that she can handle the discussion. We learned that a watermelon in L.A. It costs $ 50 (it was not the kind of silicon you have in mind), you have no problem paying for that fruit. We also learn that the airport goes off when a few really fake snowflakes fall from the sky. I'm sorry, but was that also in L.A.? / / <br /> We never see how these two characters survive, we never see them at work. We never see them fight, they are always on vacation. They have infinite time, they have no worries at all. <br /> <br /> Good life. Unreal life Unreal characters Bad title Bad movie.
