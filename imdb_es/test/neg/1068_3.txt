This movie made me think ... how could I write something about it without personally dissuading the director and all the actors, of which, as an Australian, I'm proud to have come out and make a movie. <Br /> <br /> But the movie itself? Let me tell you a story ... <br /> <br /> I found this DVD at my local rental store yesterday and I had vague memories of the reviews at the time of the movie release here, so I thought about giving it a Go. < br /> <br /> For some reason, I decided to see the "special features" before watching the real movie, it's not something I usually do. I deactivated the 'making of' halfway, since I had had enough doubts for not being so wonderful to put together such an impressive film with such a crude script attitude '. <br /> <br /> The movie? Ugh Full of clich√©s and pathetic character development. Actors? Well done guys, you are Australians and I applaud you. And, just like a football team is as good as the coach who directs them, unfortunately he did not have a great script to work with. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie really trivialized many of the subjects that it seemed to want to cover. I have seen many comments here that refer to him as nothing more than a soap. In agreement. <br /> <br /> Finally (and forgive me if I do not express this correctly), I was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic nuances at all. Yes, we all know that life is full of difficult things, and yes, we know that things like incest DO occur, but I really find it difficult to applaud a movie that does not have a single piece of joy. I think a director has the responsibility to put it there SOMEWHERE. Otherwise, the film has to do with THEY and their feelings, they have created it for themselves, not for an audience. <br /> <br /> Which I think is the basis of why this movie is not so good. Special features mention that the director wrote the script in a 36-hour session, the day after he himself tried to end his own life. Well, it may have been cathartic for him to do this, however, the movie reeks of complacency when you know the story behind why it was written. "I feel horrible, I'm going to write a movie about feeling horrible." (Note: I read the interview with Andrew Urban and I understand WHY Thalluri needed to write something to help him solve his own problems, but I think there is a line in the movie that can not be crossed: the line of making a movie exclusively for his own emotional needs, and I feel that this is what has happened here accidentally. <br /> <br /> By his own admission, the director had no technical experience whatsoever, and unfortunately, this makes the film seem nothing more than One year, twelve media projects. <br /> <br /> Regarding the recommendations that this film should be studied at school, or that all teenagers should see it, I am not sure either. Because there is a VERY dangerous line at the end. I have also been in a place where I thought that someone who no longer has to "face life" is "lucky", but as an adult, I worry that this line may influence a young spectator who is in a vulnerable situation. State of mind. It could be there to promote the discussion, but again, it does not reflect the possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. In fact, it almost indicates that there is more sadness. <br /> <br /> I have not seen Elephant, but I could find it, given all the comparisons here. <br /> <br /> There's nothing personal here, I hope they can make another movie someday, and we all have to start somewhere, so forgive me if I've been too hard. I'm glad you're proud of what you created, that in the end is what life is about. However, it is not a movie I would recommend. <br /> <br /> I did it in the same way that time frames often collided, I thought it was an interesting way to film. <br /> <br /> But the set "They are the quiet you have to see" - we already know that.
