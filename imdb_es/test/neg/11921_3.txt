I started to see this but I did not believe in any of the characters. In particular, the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress simply did not work for me at all. The scenes between the owner of the bakery and the assistant were pleasant, but the rest was very slow. It was a very shallow film and I got the feeling that I was watching a play instead of a movie. The characters were very "staggered" and the story was very similar to a stage farce. At the moment when the arsonist attacked the assistant, I got bored and did not care what happened next, so I turned it off. I'm glad I did not pay to see it. I did not laugh or even smile once. It seems that there is a strange tendency for Americans to classify their films as "comedies" when they are funny, quirky instead of funny, ha ha. Finally, I have learned to avoid what Americans call dark comedies, which often turn out to be dreadful, strange and unfunny. Now it seems that I will have to be a little more demanding when they also call a movie romantic comedy. Maybe comedy means something different when applied to a movie instead of a series in the United States. I do not understand why the United States can produce incredibly funny comedies like Two and a Half Men, Will and Grace, King of Queens, but it seems that they can not produce really funny movies without resorting to bathroom humor. This movie was not disgusting or anything. But it was nothing at all, just a big yawn ...
