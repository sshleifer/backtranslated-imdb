First of all, this movie is disgusting to the point of being nauseating, and my advice is to avoid it at all costs if you ever want to eat ice cream again. I tried to look at it because it looked like it could be fun, but soon it became quite annoying with the ice cream made from body parts and surprisingly graphic effects. It opens with a boy named Greg who witnesses the horrible murder of an ice cream man (Greg subsequently goes crazy and becomes the main character) for what appears to be mafia killers. There is no explanation for this murder, which makes it the biggest WTF moment in the entire movie. Other minor WTF moments include the surrealist asylum to which Greg goes (with evil clowns), a woman who speaks in tongues because she has been possessed by the Holy Spirit (what this has to do with everything I do not know), and the fact that Olivia "Holy crap has ruined her career so badly" Hussey is in it. <br /> <br /> None of these are enough reasons to see it. The only reason is for the tuna character, who is a thin boy with pillows tucked under his shirt to make him look like a fat kid. For some reason, I found this hilarious. I stayed awake much longer in the night than I should have seen this movie just to find out if there was any reason they could not use a fat kid for the role. Although I fell asleep before the end, I have met in other reviews that the tuna ends up losing the "weight". Well, then they did not have the budget to achieve this realistically. Suggestion for the director: what about making the character ... not overweight? <br /> <br /> That's it; If the perspective of the tuna has not interested you enough, there is no other reason to recognize the existence of this film. If disgusting horror movies about ice cream are your favorite source of entertainment, take a look at "The Stuff" instead.
