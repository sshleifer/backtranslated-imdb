Reluctantly he gave a 3 - a point each for Fonda, Stanwyck and the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> I've never seen this before, I'm seeing it right now and it's just coming to the part where Henry Fonda is carrying Babs over the threshold. If I keep looking, it will only be to see if Fonda and Stanwyck can get him out of the dumper. <br /> <br /> But after reading the other viewer's comments, I'm not very optimistic. <br /> <br /> The opening of the ski scenes was enough to get me away from my lunch. The voice-overs were obviously made in a sound studio, and the editing between the exterior shots and the close-ups was terrible. I do not know much about the technology of that era, but I can not believe there is not something they can do to make it more credible. <br /> <br /> My second gasp of disbelief was when Fonda erased and (I imagine that due to the extreme speed of travel) he sinks headfirst into the snow to the torso - Stanwyck takes him out with an obvious difficulty by stages - and, (I imagine because she is such an experienced doctor) does not react at all to her seemingly unconscious state and relaxed posture. <br /> <br /> Look, I am completely capable of suspending my disbelief, but I could not forget the fact that she had only pushed a man with a possible head injury and that he could be paralyzed for life. It's not my idea of ​​the big yuks. <br /> <br /> So, when I finish this comment, we just saw Kirk's first outburst, and Dr. Hunt is ready to perform an appendectomy! I'm not sure which one I hate the most: the script, the background music or the story! Argghhhh! I've finished. Game over. Click.
