I saw the progress of this film and I found the cinematography and what was presented interesting. I saw the IMDb rating and 6.8 confirmed that it was an above average movie. So he went to see him. <br /> <br /> The story is about Mandy Lane (Amber Heard)? A beautiful girl in high school who is a subject of male sexual desire. The provocation of Mandy's friend, Emmet (Michael Welch), to another fellow student to show his love for Mandy, leaves the drunken fellow and springs to his death. They spend nine months and Mandy is invited to a weekend of summer to a ranch isolated by her teenage friends. Three girls and three boys go there! There is a security guard Garth (Anson Mount) who works at the ranch. During the first night the murders are carried out. One by one the members of the group are killed. Who is behind the murders? I will not say here to spoil sports? I liked the movie? DO NOT. After the usual interesting opening? The film takes a downward turn with each display of the event. At half time, when the murderer is revealed, one loses all interest in the remaining procedures. There is one last turn in history to surprise the spectators, but rather it made me shake my head in disbelief and laugh! All this for suspense? Eh ?? Amber Heard acts and performs well as a shy and conscious child. who is aware of her beauty and the desire of men for her. The rest of the cast are usual? nothing to say about Are there so many films made of boys and girls who go to a secluded place and little by little someone kills them one by one? that I'm not interested anymore <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Levine strives to make the film interesting by using contemporary teen-friendly talks, laden with sexual connotations, but does not allow the film to go beyond the mundane. <br /> <br /> The only and most attractive salvation of the film is its cinematography of Darren Genet? Who captures beautiful images of perfect images! (Stars 3 of 10)
