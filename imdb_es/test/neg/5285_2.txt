Possibly one of the best and most horrible b movies in history, since it's so bad and random, it's pretty funny and I do not know how to feel about it ... it reminds me of Cabin Fever ... there's something about that boy jumping Outside the porch doing karate and shouting 'pancakes' which is intriguing. Since many people have already described the plot and all I'm going to do is summarize the quality of the film with a quote: "I'm the park ranger that is going to fuck you". Yes, have you said enough? If you are looking for quality or a really scary movie, I do not recommend it. but if you like this kind of movies, then I think you would enjoy it ... I do not know how, but I think some people would.
