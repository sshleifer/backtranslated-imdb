This is your typical junk comedy. <br /> <br /> Almost no laughs. There are no genuine moments. There are no memorable lines. There are no scenes in which you think, "that was smart". Nothing. The plot is shamefully bad. <br /> <br /> It's ugly to look and bored as hell! There is no substance here. This movie has nothing. It does not matter if Farely was in this or not. A fucking movie is a fucking movie no matter who is involved. <br /> <br /> In addition, David Spade is an awfully graceless comedian who plays the same lousy character in every movie / TV show he's on. <br /> <br /> This movie was dead on arrival. There is no life here. It's not fun There is no intelligence. There are many other "silly" comedies more enjoyable than this one. This movie is just pathetic. <br /> <br /> 2/10
