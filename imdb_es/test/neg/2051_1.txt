Bled begins when the young female artist Sai (Sarah Ferooqui) meets a mysterious but charming man named Renfield (Jonathan Oldham) and ends up back in his studio apartment where he gets the bark of some kind of tree that is used as a hallucinogenic drug . when it melts Sai is quickly hooked while it becomes an alternate fantasy reality involving vampiric creatures. Royce (Chris Ivan Cevic), Sai's photographer, cares for her as she gets away from reality as she becomes addicted to the drug, can Royce kick the drug or end up ruining her life? First of all, do dream trips like fantasy travel have any meaning? <br /> <br /> Co-produced and directed by Christopher Hutson, this anemic and artistic vampire film has almost 95 minutes of tediousness and is completely deserving of all the bad comments. The script was written by the interesting Sxv'leithan Essex (how the hell do you pronounce it anyway?), Who is also credited as a production designer and his unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that happens in Bled, I suppose the creators set out to make a horror movie based on a very serious fantasy with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs, drug addiction and rape in its essence. Most of the film is devoted to the drug issue with Sai's initial introduction to the drug, how fantastic it was the first time and how she becomes an irremediable addict that eventually destroys her, her life and that of her friends . He never explains where he gets this medication, since Renfield only gives him a little time during his initial meeting, but who cares? The first twenty odd minutes of Bled are really boring and boring, the next hour is not much better before a final ten minute mess involving a vampiric monster and Renfield making a comeback. The moral elements are condescending, the elements of fantasy seem a late occurrence and horror does not exist. There is also the dialogue that is horrible, every prayer tries to be profound, has a lot of hidden depth and only tries to have so much meaning that it becomes boring to listen. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is It is terrible and so is the execution, since there is absolutely no bleeding or violence to talk about and everything is located inside an apartment that does not seem to have any light . The fantasy scenario looks a little better, but it is little seen and little used. Here there is no fear, no atmosphere, and to make matters worse, the creators have decided to use dull colors that are very muted, that I hate and I find annoying, what about a beautiful and colorful image? I think it's a fad with current filmmakers who seem to think that it automatically makes a movie great or adds an atmosphere that probably does not, most of the time it just makes your movie look boring as shown here with Bled . <br /> <br /> This probably had a low budget and was filmed in Los Angeles and has reasonable production values, but everything is so boring. The performance did not impress me, it did not interest me or anyone, which is never a good sign. <br /> <br /> Bled is a terrible vampire movie that pursues psychological and physical horror on all kinds of subjects. of parallels to the addiction to real life and what you can do with little or no effect because everything is so boring. There may be an audience for a movie like this, but considering the other not-so-big comments.
