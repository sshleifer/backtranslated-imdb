Dreck tired, confused. The chemistry between Argento and Madsen was as exciting as a wet donut. Their dialogue was dramatically uninteresting. The plot was a disaster. The forced action. The cinematography was delayed in the non-inspired. Lazy and meaningless. Kim Gordon and his character had no reason to be there. Nor anyone else for that matter. I could not have given two farts for any of the "characters". His emotions jumped and jumped like a drug addict who hates his heroine. Empty and boring. Why do I have to write ten lines of text here to make my point? I think I summarized it in the first three words. But, obviously, it's not enough. I think this is the last time I'll bother wasting my time criticizing a movie. Anyway, I saw "Clean" and I thought that that was also quite ineffective. Once again, I did not care about the characters, whether they lived or died.
