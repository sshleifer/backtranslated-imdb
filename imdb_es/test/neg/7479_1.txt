He seems to be a control freak. I heard him comment on "losing control of the show" and telling another guest that he brought live animals that had a rule: "no snakes". You need to hire a comedy writer because your jokes are bad. The only reason I see it is because he has some great guests and bands. <br /> <br /> I've seen Craig Ferguson's show for a while, but his show is even worse. He likes the hustle and bustle ** to burn time. I do not think either of us has much future in the evening talk shows. <br /> <br /> Daily also has the annoying habit of sticking out her tongue to lick her lips. He must do this at least 10 times a show. I like Joe Firstman's band. Carson Daily needs to lighten up before it's too late.
