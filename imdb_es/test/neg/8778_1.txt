There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is difficult to choose just a few. Let's start with silly and annoying songs. As "Little Cowboy Ride," which only tended to accentuate the look of the fans of the city of Klinton Spilsbury. The silly songs of childhood cowboys that are heard in the background during the film hurt the credibility or the momentum of the story. <br /> <br /> I had seen the exaggerations of the media before this movie was released, and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewed on various television shows and had a very soft, sweet and cheerful voice. His body language was not exactly what people remembered as fans of Clayton Moore and the television series Lone Ranger. Spilsbury did not help things by acting like a diva and talking badly about Clayton Moore after the Producers obtained a court order barring Moore from appearing at Conventions and other events like the original Lone Ranger. Clayton Moore was not even allowed to sign as "Clayton Moore, The Lone Ranger." He could only sign as "The masked man". The incredible amount of negative publicity that this movement gave to the film only added to the smug attitude of Spilsbury, who rushed to tell reporters that Clayton Moore would quickly forget once the movie came out. Unfortunately, even after the movie was a total failure, the company that owns The Lone Ranger refused to raise its Injunction against Clayton Moore, and was never again allowed to sign anything except as "The Masked Man "and could not put his black mask on any public appearance. Between the personality of the Spilsbury diva and the negative publicity that the film obtained, it certainly did not help to make a good impression on the public. Worse still, a few weeks before the movie was finally released, word leaked out that Spilsbury's voice in the movie had been dubbed by James Keech because the producers thought Spilsbury did not look very convincing like a cowboy. The ridicule and ridicule that this news brought in the talk shows and comedies of that time put the final nail in the coffin. <br /> <br /> But then there was Merle Haggard narrating her way through the movie. Apparently, the producers hoped that the macho image of Haggard (one of the outlaws of country music) added credibility to Spilsbury as The Lone Ranger. Merle Haggard's narrative was just another nuisance that the public had to deal with. Sometimes, Haggard rhymes his narration, and it sounds like a strange movie for children. Combine the rhyming narrative with the songs of "Ride Little Cowboy" and any credibility that Spilsbury could have obtained was destroyed by Haggard and the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Foolish was played by Michael Horse, and as others have pointed out, The Horse had much more personality than Spilsbury. In fact, perhaps due to Spilsbury's supposedly combative attitude during filming, it seems that Horse was given much more dialogue and screen time than anyone would have expected from Fool. Silly takes charge and is often the leader instead of Lone Ranger. I expected (or expected) Billy Jack to make a cameo like Tonto's brother (I would have made the movie much better). Horse is not only more interesting than Spilsbury, it says more and has better scenes. Maybe it was a case of Horse stealing the Spilsbury show. However, because the movie was so unhappy, Horse did not get much recognition. Unlike Spilsbury, Horse has had a very productive career in the film industry. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the last negative aspect of this movie is the Powder Blue costume from The Lone Ranger. The material that was chosen for Spilsbury was more blue in powder than the one Clayton Moore normally used in appearances. That choice of color for the dress just made Spilsbury look more effeminate in his role. The comic book version also showed The Lone Ranger in a red shirt and black pants, and that alternative outfit would have helped Spilsbury look more convincing as The Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast, mostly sent by mail in their performances. . Everyone seems as if they were working on a television episode and nobody seemed very convincing. Even the villain, Cavendish lost his advantage due to the people around him. In general, I'm sorry for Spilsbury. Not only did he do a terrible acting job, but it is obvious that the production and the publicity were horrible and effectively sabotaged any possibility the poor man had. Even if he had been an excellent replacement for Clayton Moore, I doubt that the film would have worked well as a result of the other factors. As it is, this movie is funny in a sad way.
