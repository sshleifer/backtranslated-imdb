This dreadful piece of Tripe was based (conveniently) on a true story that involved two members of my family (played by Jack Thompson and Jacqueline Mackenzie). <br /> <br /> This movie is offensive; besides the fact that, in any case, it was not a good movie in particular, it in no way captures what it was like to lose a member of the family so close and completely omits those who were really affected by the tragedy of the real life. <br /> <br /> As for the director; he managed to take advantage of a family's misfortune for the price of a Porsche. <br /> <br /> If I could have given a zero, I would have had it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
