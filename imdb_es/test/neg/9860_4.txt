I was disappointed with this documentary. I thought it would be the second game of chess between the great master Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue, the supercomputer designed by IBM computer experts to beat any human chess player. Kasparov was and still is, considered the best chess player in history. The movie takes us back to 1997, where Kasporov agreed to have a rematch with "Deep Blue" after defeating it 1 year earlier. But instead of focusing on the game, it focuses more on what happens before and after. There are fragments of the game, but not many. Most of the film focuses on Kasporov's paranoid obsession that the party was formed as part of a conspiracy theory and that he lost the game unfairly. The film also includes interviews with people who have no interest. They even talked with the manager of the building where the match took place. Who cares? I also found it very dry and slow. In the end, this movie was not satisfactory. This is just my opinion, of course. If you like it, conspicuous Spicy theories, this movie might interest you. For people who are not involved in chess or conspiracy theories, this movie probably has no value. I'm a chess fan, and I just put it in evidence for that. I give "Game Over: Kasparov and the machine" 4/10
