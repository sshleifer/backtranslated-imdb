I hate a movie that does not have an ending. I do not care how good or bad the rest is, I do not like being left without a conclusion. Such programs should insist on a disclaimer ... something like: The movie you're about to watch has no end or is so ambiguous as not to be conclusive. <br /> <br /> In the movie, the last scene we are What remains is that Dee and Dominic have a bit of a fight and he says, almost with regret, I thought, that it could not be him because the fingers were the of a girl or a boy. THEN ENDS! Of course, the smoking gun, so to speak, is in the hands of Dee's son, but what about Dominic's daughter? Actually I thought we could discover what it was! Anyway, unless you like unfinished films, I would avoid this one. Otherwise, I thought that the movie in general is good.
