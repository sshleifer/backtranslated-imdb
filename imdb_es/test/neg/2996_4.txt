I was pretty much lost during most of this movie, and I'm the one who generally understands the works of great enigmatic filmmakers like David Lynch (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) and Darren Aronofsky (Pi). It does not mean that Northfork does not make sense at some level, it just does not combine to form a totally coherent film. As time goes by to watch the movie, its themes and intentions become clearer, but during my initial viewing, I felt really confused, and I think this is the main flaw of the movie ... its lack of direction. The plot focuses on the city of Northfork, Montana, in 1955. The city has been emptied and will soon be flooded to make way for the creation of a hydroelectric dam. The main problem is that not all of its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and relocated. A group of men are hired to force the remaining residents out of town before they drown, and for the most part they succeed in the midst of some rather strange situations and townspeople. Simultaneously, the film tells the story of Irwin, a very sick young man (or is it a fallen angel?) Whose adoptive parents returned him, due to his illness, to the Northfork orphanage from which he was adopted. Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) worries about the dying Irwin, but Irwin imagines (or does he?) That a group of angels (including Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards) have arrived in the desolate and empty city in search of an angel fallen. Irwin has scars on his back and on his head, and he tries to convince the angels that their scars are where humans amputated their wings and halo. Oh yes, and during all this there is a strangely surrealist walking animal on stilts that wanders through the landscape. There are many other small events that happen in the movie, but none of them ends up being much more than a momentary intrigue. You can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it is obvious that the filmmakers really cared about this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film is still trying to be different and then surrenders and moans until the end without making much noise. As I wrote earlier, it is clear, long after seeing, what possibly happened in the film. Irwin is dying, as is Northfork, and in coping with his own loss and death, Irwin has probably created characters, from the ideas he gets from the objects that surround him in the orphanage, to comfort him when he is abandoned and his life . Its end is near. But, again, he may be really an angel, and he has found his kind and now he can return home. I must emphasize that there are some truly beautiful moments in the film, heartbreaking, vivid and full of loneliness and sadness. Unfortunately, the film as a whole ends up feeling disconnected and somewhat incomplete.
