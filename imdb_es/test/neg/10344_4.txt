Corben Bernsen directed a horror film about a chemical weapon launched at a sporting event and turning everyone into crazy monsters. We observe how the staff of a radio station takes reports. <br /> <br /> It has moments, but mostly it plays like a horror movie for life with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas here, but they just do not work. Actually, the ideas of the film are best handled in a movie called Pontypool, which works quite well and creates tension by showing us nothing. This shows us things and it just seems cheap. Given the option, I would see Pontypool again instead of watching this movie again.
