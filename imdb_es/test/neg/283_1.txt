Unfortunately, I think this is one of those movies that if you or I took her to the studio and said, 'Can I do this great movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school?' The studio would kill you on the spot. However, if a group of Hollywood big names says, 'Look, I want to go to Italy with my colleagues, what do you think?' the study writes a check. <br /> <br /> We started with the head of the Ocean's 11 casino tracing the thieves who stole his money, and then Brad Pitt is throwing himself at Catherine Zeta Jones, and then there are some jokes. about Amsterdam and Italy and things like that, and then everything ends somehow. <br /> <br /> However, the film includes the most embarrassing moment of the careers of Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis, which is a jewel movie. I almost threw up in my lap and tore my eyes out when Julia Roberts, playing Tess in the movie, pretends to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis asks himself clearly when he can leave, and how much the check will be. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, to be fair, I would have done it for money, so I guess I can 'I really criticize the poor loves, but I'm a lazy guy with no money, not a Hollywood legend. I guess what really bothers me about this movie is not that it's boring and meaningless and has a terrible story, but I think probably all the actors had fun doing it. I think all the actor's job is to project the emotion out ... I feel like I paid to go to the party, but I had to stand outside in the rain. Booo! <br /> <br /> See if you like it Like, or if you like CZJ or something like that, but otherwise, go for a walk.
