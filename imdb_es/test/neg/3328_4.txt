I want to say that I liked this movie, I really like it, but when it comes to that it was too boring. It begins with a promising appearance, and even once you enter the mines, the spooky atmosphere and mood are excellent. The problem is the monster, or lack of it. As people have said it is a stop-motion monster, but that's not the problem (stop-motion can look good if done correctly). The problem is that we do not see enough and we do not see any death. This is supposed to be a horror movie, so the lack of monsters and the lack of deaths equals boredom. There were some scenes that I liked, like when a girl uses her camera in the dark and the monster approaches her. There are also some other spooky scenes, but they are too few to keep your interest and definitely not worth watching the movie. It's a shame, because I can see that if it had been handled correctly, it would have been a really scary horror movie. The saddest thing is that films like this one will never be done again, because filmmakers polish their films in excess these days and trust CGI effects.
