Last night I saw the director's cut ... I'm glad it was a free rental, even a dollar would have been too much for me to see this "black cinema" attempt. The anachronisms (modern phones) bothered me, they were not smart, they seemed more budgetary restrictions than anything else. The "non-traditional" casting also distracted me. If I have to stop following the story to ask myself "what the hell is the black girl / drag queen doing there?" Then the storyteller failed me. Again, not smart in my opinion, but annoying and irritating, and the final project of the film school. And, on the contrary, if you are going to film in black and white, at least use some of the techniques used in old movies that make the most of the fact that they have no color. There were no nuances in the lighting, no shades of gray, no depth, no texture ... only black and only white ... boring!
