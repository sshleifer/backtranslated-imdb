"How many people know about this?" ... "Let's keep it that way!" I wonder if at least new dialogues can be made or not. The movie is a really poor copy of the original. Bruce Willis probably made this movie while he was half asleep. The way he looks at Richard Gere's face with his cold-blooded look when they're near the harbor ... Oh my God! I was really scared. Why does it kill Commander Koslova and her comrades are still unclear to me? Another thing I could not understand was the poison solution he put in the car (what the hell was it?). <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is a disaster and the climax is boring. Another funny thing was how they killed the Russian in the club. I fell off the chair laughing when I saw that scene. Besides, what was that thing about the gay guy? What was it for? I think the film is too fast to be easily understood. You have to really think what the hell was in the Director's mind. LOL. <br /> <br /> And the best scene after all was Richard Gere trying to hold on to the column between 2 fast moving trains. He must have made someone lose his head if he did not come into contact with the pillar.
