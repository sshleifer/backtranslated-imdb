Can they be worse than this? Probably. But after all Steven Seagal manages to do what he does. Well kind of this time, instead of mortally hurting the bad guys, he just hurts them. Because of his reputation as a bad agent, Seagal is hired to deliver a special package from France to the United States. But it is not an easy task with so many people trying to intercept and disrupt the mission. The fights just do not have enough value and the big bangs are big and that's it. Anna-Louis Plowman seems to be the only cast member who does not appear to be of wood. Also in the cast are Jeffery Pierce, Max Ryan and Harry Van Gorkum. Do not blame Seagal for this pileup.
