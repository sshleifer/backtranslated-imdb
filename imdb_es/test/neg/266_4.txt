I enjoyed Oceans 11, I thought it was quite nice, helped by the performances and the direction. However, I was disappointed with this movie. Do not get me wrong, it's not a complete failure, thanks to the stellar performances of Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon especially and the efficient direction of Steven Soderbergh. However, the film really suffers from a truly lethargic rhythm, part of the movie was so slow that I almost fell asleep between a key turn. Secondly, the plot is very complicated and there are many twists and turns that make it difficult to keep up. The work of the camera was not as innovative as in the first film. While in the first film he was smooth and professional, here he was uneven and clumsy, and the music was not particularly memorable. The script was not as witty or funny, and the film felt anti-climactic. At the end of the day, everything felt a little lazy, despite the skill and direction of the experts. A lot of potential, but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox
