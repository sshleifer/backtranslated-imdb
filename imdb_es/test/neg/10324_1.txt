I entered Blockbuster, wanting to see some good old-fashioned action movies. So I navigated through the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had a big bold font SANDRA BULLOCK. An action movie with Sandra Bullock in it and it's rated R !? HURRAH! Although I must admit that I prefer it in a comedy, but if this is something like "Speed", then they sold me. Unfortunately, Sandra is not really in this movie, her role is minor: "Kidnapped Panic Girlfriend" (She is in fifth place on the Jeebus Shakes actor list!) Apparently this was her first role in the movie (and After watching this movie, I thought Sandra is the only human alive in this movie, everyone else could be Zombies in a horror movie B-Horror.This movie tricked me by saying that Sandra was the protagonist ... I fell in love as Biff 'Back to the future' when Marty yells "God, I wish I would have seen that instead." <br /> <br /> Sandra is the only one The positive side of this movie, every time you're in front of the camera, it's like you're picking up shock paddles and yelling "CLEAN!" to get these movies going, but flat lines no matter how hard you try. The film is boring, very boring. In the most boring moment of your life, then imagine living that moment for 110 minutes (for me, it's this movie). This movie, even somehow, makes the effects of Gun Fights and Bullet time boring, so boring that the Elephants Tranquilizers are embarrassed. And the idea of ​​this Bullet Time movie is a close-up of a slow-motion AK that makes fun of you when the spit caps represent every second of your life as you go slowly. And I knew I was watching a bad movie because I found myself moving quickly "THROUGH ACTION!" The plot? . . . There was a plot? Music? . . . Even for the 80 muck standards it is bad, but at least it is the only thing that kept me awake. Interim? Sandra Bullock was good and. . . ummm . keep going Is it good since it is rated R? No, unless R represents Ridicules-snooze-fest. <br /> <br /> And it's really a cliché from the 80s when a movie starts with an aerial view of a city (guitar strings or power ballet) and ends with a gun fighting in a grim factory, with walkways of steel and assorted pipes. Both of which this movie satisfies. At least this movie establishes what was unnecessary, since Sandra's hair was screaming "1980s". And a movie gets really nervous when you see a stripper murdering a nerd in the bathroom and putting his body in a box, to which you say sadly: "That's probably the biggest action the poor sap has ever had." Another moment of Hammy is at the beginning when a "Secret Agent-Friend" locks up a crowd of people and, apparently, this film believes that people jump in the air and fall to the ground when they die. All that scene that was needed was the tide of Mario or maybe the sound effects of Contra, but Nintendo could have sued. <br /> <br /> And it's sad when the main action hero of this movie pulls out other BEST icons from the movie. Before the big gun scene, Da hero stands in a boxing ring (someone '' Rocky ''?), Sporting a leather hat (not 'Indiana Jones' too) with sinister bulbs behind him (Terminator the second before owning the T-1000). ) What is really VERY sad is that people on YouTube or Dailymotion can shoot better quality videos (with a fucking webcam, not less) and then this movie. Seriously, most of Rant's videos recorded with poor audio quality and blurry are more entertaining than this movie. I can not even call this movie by its name given by its name. I get back horrible memories of seeing this cruel and unusual punishment (a damn violation of human rights!) The only bright spot in this dark abyss is Sandra's career that began to take off thanks to this movie But oh Sandra. . . Why did you have to be in a nightmare? The paycheck was worth it. The DVD also gives Sandra a little background story as an extra, since it is the only one in this movie that ends up being a house name. Which explains why this movie uses its name as bait for unsuspecting film fans, Crafty little critter. <br /> <br /> I do not have much experience with bad movies, but I know BAD when I see it. I could recover from 'Mazes and Monsters' with a good comedy by Bruce Willis. But not even Bruce could cheer me up after this movie. I have not seen Ed Wood or Uwe Boll yet, but I think I'm looking for them now. Well I can not even imagine a movie worse then. . . "GAG" . . 'Hangmen'. . .
