Although this begins in a promising way, a woman in a car walks on dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until she almost hits a man holding a lizard! This gave me the impression that we were going to see something special, something almost like David Lynchian (if there is such a term), but unfortunately, the film starts going everywhere, without having a central center, just a kind of serpentine story about a woman trying to solve a mystery of a small town. The study of the characters extends everywhere, and I really could not care about any of the characters that it seems, especially when part of the story suddenly goes into flashback mode. I had some hopes for this movie, but overall, it was a bit disappointing.
