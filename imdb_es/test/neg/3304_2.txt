I have no idea who these others are, but this movie is just horrible. They have to prop up Joe Pesci when he is a secondary character. Come and change the movie as they did the studies with Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey, etc. The DVD that I saw said "this dark gem revolves around the MOB character of JOe Pesci, who is a character who starts a war", etc. Joe, he does not even carry a gun, he plays a whimsical character and gets SPOILER - (beaten). So much for the film that revolves around Pesci. The only memorable mid-way scene was a bad comedy attempt when they passed the gas while waiting for a score. If you see this movie after reading this, I warned you. Please stop and do not lose the 87 minutes of your life.
