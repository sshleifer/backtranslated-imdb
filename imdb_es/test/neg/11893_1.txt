Can you, please, stop believing everything that this man says? Get <br /> <br /> your data directly before starting to praise this liar. It's not even <br /> <br /> from Flint. He just says to keep his "blue collar" look. He is <br /> <br /> from a rich suburb by Flint. I mean, he went to a private school. <br /> <br /> His parents paid him to go to school. Wow, it sure looks like <br /> <br /> as if they suffered a lot for Flint going to the dumpsters. He was also born in Canada. Oh, wait, that makes you a Canadian citizen. I wish he moved there. Instead, he lives here in his $ 1 million apartment in New York. That's working class right there. I'm sure I can not wait for his DVD set to come out. I want you to talk about how big corporations are bad here. Where will I get those dvds? Oh yes, at Target and Wal-Mart. The two largest corporations in America, which were also the only two stores authorized to sell them.
