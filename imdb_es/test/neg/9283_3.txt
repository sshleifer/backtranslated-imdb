Anthony Wong stars in both this story and the original (very superior) Untold Story, but the similarities stop there. Wong does not repeat his role, obviously, and instead plays a clumsy cop who gets involved with a rather suspicious woman, Fung (Miss Singapore, Paulyn Sun, 1994) who is a repressed madman, of course. But his docile jealous "wants to be with a boy who is with a girl", the murderer is not as convincing as what Wong played in the first. The film itself seems tired and by numbers. Yeung Fan as the unfaithful girl of love interest of the physiotherapist tries to avoid total boredom by undressing whenever possible, and Sun has a good ass, but even that can not save this problem. <br /> <br />: D <br /> <br /> Mei Ah DVD extras: subtitled interviews with Cheung Kam Ching and Paulyn Sun; The filmography of Anthony Wong; a very brief synopsis; Theatrical trailer for the movie; and trailers for "Chinese Erotic Ghost Story" and "Twenty Something"
