I did everything possible to get this movie and I was lucky to get it on VHS. Being a big fan of Gloria Grahame, it was an excellent addition to my collection. Apart from that, I really can not say much to recommend this photo. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is to see Sterling Hayden get into major problems with his own apartment. Mrs. Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like, like me), but the dubbing of her singing hurts this image very much. She works on a dive, so let her use her own voice. You can only lend to the environment. I must agree with a previous critic; the end borrows heavily from THE GREAT HEAT. To the point of subtracting value at the end. I have seen worse movies with Mrs. Grahame (MACAO), but I will never pass the opportunity to see her on the screen. If you're having a movie night and looking for a second movie, this is your movie. Enjoy the photo
