weird.this is a television movie, but the classification in the box says that it is classified as R. There is nothing in the movie that qualifies remotely to get a rating of R. Also, the movie is very slow and meaningless. The idea was good, but nothing was done with the plot. It just did not develop. It's a bit creepy, and the acting is pretty good, better than the movie deserves. I do not see myself seeing it soon. ever. There have been other films that treat the same concept that are better made than this one. I have not seen too many Wes Craven movies, so I really can not compare them with any of his other movies. However, I think it is poorly conceived and poorly executed. For me, I can not give Chiller a rating higher than 3/10
