I remember seeing a clip of this movie on HBO when I was a kid and I was scared by the shit I always lived. When I found it, I saw it. I wish I had not done it. The movie was not scary. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around an old woman who runs the castle. She feeds this horribly disfigured person in the basement of a 12th century castle. She continually hits the poor boy every day and feeds him. Well, that day, she dies. Then, a few months later, a family moves. A father, a mother and their blind daughter. The father was involved in a horrible car accident that killed his son and left his daughter blind. <br /> <br /> Later, through the film, the daughter listens to sounds, things break, etc., and everyone does not care about anything. absolutely. That is until a few people appear dead. Apparently, the creature in the basement has been freed and is killing people. How this thing survived during the last months without food or water is impossible! Every time I saw the creature, it gave me chills. The creature leaves a wave of bloody murders and the police blames the father for the deaths. <br /> <br /> It was a pretty bad movie. <br /> <br /> I give this film 3 stars out of 10 Creepy is not scary!
