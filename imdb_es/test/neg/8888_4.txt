I swore a while ago that I would never get another Joe Castro movie (maybe after "Near Death") but I ended up with this by accident, since it was a Troma release and I did not read the cover carefully. Ups. Well, I saw it, and it's not good at all, but it's, I suppose, a kind of "tongue on the cheek" ... if it's not, it seems like that. Some intrepid people from the University of the Rio Grande set out to find out if there is the Chupacabra, due to the images of the GOAT BARN surveillance camera of someone showing this rare thing jumping through the field of vision. And also because the person who supposedly killed was the uncle of the leader of the expedition. There are a couple of cameramen, one of whom complains all the time, and there's an ex-Marine named "Army" (?!), Who is an expert in ammunition or something like that. In any case, they find the Chupacabra in a guy's ranch and they set out to find him, getting involved with two supposed witches on the way. The creature itself looks rather ridiculous, with spines on its back and a large, long tongue through which Gene Simmons would die. Finally, after they kill a group of people, so does the Chupacabra, and they take him back to the university for an autopsy. So, is it from another planet? Is it a genetic creation of a laboratory in Puerto Rico? Uh, they do not really tell us. It's not exactly intriguing, but it's not terrible either. Definitely not a broad audience for this. 4 out of 10
