This movie "Vampires: the turn" is not even worth the 2 out of 10 I give him. The film is very predictable from the beginning to the end when our hero kills the leader of the vampire hunters. The use of music in this movie was even bad, it was still playing as if it expected something important to happen at any second, although it never happened. The acting was B-Rank at best ... And the movie was just boring. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story had potential, but ended up being unable to offer it. Oh, and did I mention the costumes? The costumes of this film were obviously cheap to "nonexistent" because our hero and his girlfriend (whom he is trying to save throughout the film) wear the same clothes throughout the film. I would suggest this movie only if it is really boring, and it does not have a good wall with fresh paint to see dry. ~ Dave, the Cowboy Horror
