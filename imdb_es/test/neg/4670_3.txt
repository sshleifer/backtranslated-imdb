I remember thinking that because of the cast, the theme and the director, I would love this movie. <br /> <br /> Upon entering the theater and occupying my seat, I was like a dazed schoolgirl as my anticipation for the opening scene built. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the opening and I felt that I would really love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes can be seen as a spoiler, please stop reading. I'm not going to reveal anything really important, but it could be seen as such, so that's the warning. <br /> <br /> The spoiler can be included then be careful. <br /> <br /> I think the first scene that really caught my attention was the scene of the Russian space station. I mean honestly, refueling a transportation service without a real prior warning, and then simply show that the station is so fragile that a small mistake can cause everything to explode. <br /> <br /> Although all this is possible, I seemed to be very above. I'm not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the cheesy performance, the silly vision of Russian technology or just the camper attitude of the scene itself. <br /> <br /> It only got worse after that, because we endured what seemed like 2 hours of constant super-strong explosions in space ... you know, that place where there's no sound because it's a vacuum. <br /> <br /> But the knockout For me, honestly, it was the gun scene. (possibility of spoiler) - At the beginning of the film, we see Bruce Willis destroying his land vehicle (the vehicle they will use to drive when they get there and help them drill) when told that this is what they will do. being using He is taking away the pieces and complains about it because much of its content is heavy and is not required for what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Then, when we go to the asteroids, we see that they have opted to add a massive gatling as a gun to the vehicles ... you know, the standard fee for NASA is to have heavy weapons in all Space missions in case you, you know, aliens or something like that. <br /> <br /> I could have taken the explosive 2 hours, the stupid refueling scene of the Russian space station, the cheesy love scene near the end, the Bruce Willis character was no more than most his other past characters, but Steve Buscemi went crazy and shot the spacecraft weapon. about the place and causing havoc / damage, well, I threw the whole thing over for me. <br /> <br /> Save time and money and avoid this movie. If you want a good meteor movie, go Deep Impact, if you want a fun space movie with awesome special effects, go to Space Cowboys, but no matter what, avoid this movie.
