"Riders of Destiny" was the first of several westerns that Wayne made for Monogram Pictures 'Lone Star arm between 1933 and 1935. In this entry, the producers try to turn Duke into a singing cowboy named "Singin' Sandy Saunders with hilarious results Any fan of Wayne knows that the Duke could not have performed a melody if his life had depended on that, his voice was apparently doubled by Smith Ballew, whose deep baritone bears no resemblance to Wayne. Cowboy singer finished soon. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it contains a Western "B" standard plot of the water rights struggle between the villain (Forrest Taylor) and the local ranchers. , of course, he plays the hero, he had not yet developed his character on the screen and he still looked like a cowboy of poverty. <br /> <br /> He also appeared in the film to George (before Gabby) Hayes as The Father of the her OÃ­na, Cecilia Parker as the heroine and Yakima. Canutt as "one of the boys" who performs his trick of "falling off the racehorses under the cart" while doubling Wayne. Both Canutt and Hayes would appear alongside Wayne in most of the other entries in the series. Canutt, in particular, would have a profound effect on Wayne's future development by teaching him, among other things, how to move, fight and look comfortable on a horse. <br /> <br /> As the "B" Westerns go this is not too bad, however, I have to give it a failing grade due to "singing".
