I'm not a purist of Jane Austen, but why make a movie like this if you have nothing to say? <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was so wrong about the part that it's hard to know where to start: wrong personality, modern make-up, completely wrong hair (there's no way a young woman of her age would have fucked in public with her hair loose and without brushing that way), did not seem especially gentle or mistreated by the family and I did not understand why everyone seemed to think that she was particularly holy or kind. <br /> <br /> The picnic (replaced by the ball) had such a low budget that it was embarrassing to see it and completely miss the Portsmouth section. It destroyed the point of the piece (in addition to the lost scenes that could have added a sandy counterpoint to that pink living room so claustrophobic). <br /> <br /> To those responsible: -If you do not have the imagination (even the budget does not matter as much as the imagination) to do something meaningful with an adaptation, please do not pretend to be prying Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> They were about 10% of Mansfield Park and 90% not much. <br /> <br /> PS Edmund was very good
