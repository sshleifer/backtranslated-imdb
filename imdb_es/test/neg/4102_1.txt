Usually, I will not review movies that I have not seen in a long time, so I'll put them in or rent them out to give you a complete and fresh view of the movie. In the case of 'A Sound of Thunder', I remembered my vow never to see this film again, so I'll just remember. In fact, I have not thought about how bad this movie was until I read another person's review and I remembered the experience I had in 2005, when I saw it in the theater. My movie partner forced me to see him, although he was not interested, and wow. (Later, I forced him to see 'Basic Instinct 2' in the theater, reminding him that he made me see this shit.) So, I guess that has matched us.) I certainly had my share of deep laughs (at the expense of the movie, of course,) that did not make him happy, since I really wanted to see him. The time travel movie / butterfly effect had a lot of bad graphics, the loudest laughs of me were every time they showed the dinosaur (God, I loved seeing that dinosaur and they were really scared of them, it was hilarious!) OR simply, Ben Kingsley. It's great, Kingsley can remind us how human actors can be: moving from 'Gandhi' and 'Schindler's List' to, uh, this. (Even a Meryl Streep can do a 'She-Devil' from time to time, so they are forgiven). For months, I took out an MST3k with my friend, systematically referencing this movie to any inexpensive science fiction movie or Kingsley Movie. Yes, the movie would be a great movie to see drunk (or otherwise drunk): horrible exaggerated performance, "special" effects that even the Nintendo64 would reject and ridiculous twists of the plot. The biggest disappointment was that the Razzies did not even nominate this movie for any prize.
