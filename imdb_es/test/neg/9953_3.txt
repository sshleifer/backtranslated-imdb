For reasons I can not begin to understand, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) begins to inject wolf blood into his ingenious little hands, Petro (Glenn Strange). The result ?? Petro transforms into a murderous beast (as horrible as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth). Dr. Cameron uses Petro to avenge those in the scientific community who mocked and ridiculed his ideas (and why not, Dr. Cameron is crazier than a fruitcake). <br /> <br /> In general, The Mad Monster is a boring and badly done Poverty Row thriller. There really is only one positive thing that occurs to me to write in The Mad Monster. George Zucco can be fun to watch while playing the mad scientist and anyone. His Dr. Cameron is a regular insane asylum. He has no qualms about killing; He has entire conversations with people who are not there; and, like most mad scientists, he gets into "God's domain" (actually, I'm not sure that someone will accuse him of this, but it fits). But beyond Zucco, there is nothing to recommend here. Everything else, from the effects of monsters to the cast of support for music, is simply old. There are much better examples of the Poverty Row horror of the 1940s than The Mad Monster.
