I have tried to write a summary of the plot for several minutes and it seems that I can not do it. But with a film as bad as The Night of the Blood Beast, the plot hardly matters. An astronaut crashes and thinks himself dead. His body then reanimates, but is found to carry embryos of some alien alien form of life. But how did they get there? And where is the alien who implanted the strange creatures in the body of Major John Corcoran? <br /> <br /> IMDb lists the execution time of The Night of the Blood Beast in 62 minutes. It's okay? 62 minutes? It had to be longer than that. I felt interminable. Even with the MST3K comment (which was very funny indeed), the film felt much, much longer. And he's almost a sleeper from start to finish. I like many of these extraterrestrial invasion movies of the 50s, but it is not. He could not capture my interest at any level. The extraterrestrial babies were too stupid to be taken seriously, the titular blood beast was pathetic and none of the characters did anything for me. Add to that Roger Corman's low-budget adornments and you'll have a real loser in a movie.
