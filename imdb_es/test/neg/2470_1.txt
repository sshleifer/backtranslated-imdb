According to the article at http://blog.ifeng.com/article/2737487.html, one of the film's actors, Carina Lau, was forced to appear in this movie for free. She was the victim of an infamous kidnapping shortly before this movie was made, and later she published photos of her in a hurry in a magazine, which since then was forced to close and her editor was sent to jail. The actress denies having been assaulted but there was a film leaked on the network that supposedly showed that she was raped in a group. (The Hong Kong press, out of respect for it, has refused to report the incident, but Google will find some articles about it.)
