If you saw this movie for the first time with Maria of the Fourth Form, then it is possible that the haze of nostalgia will stimulate your charitable side. If not, it has no possibility. The hipspeak of young things is a complete nonsense, people may have used the occasional word that they will hear here, but not large amounts of them in one sentence after another. It is not so much the date of Dracula AD 1972 as the blow in pieces, from the moment someone under thirty years old opens his mouth, it is impossible to take the film seriously and, for being a laugh, it is not even a smile. The idea of ​​throwing Dracula into modern times is good and deserves a script much stronger than the one Don Houghton can provide. The River Thames and the Chelsea Male are no match for the puppets, the model castles and the terrified extras, but you can not help feeling that with better writing it would have been so different.
