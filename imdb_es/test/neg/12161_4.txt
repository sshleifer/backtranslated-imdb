I went to see this movie because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go. <br /> <br /> We were both trying to look at our watches long before the film was over, to see how much more he had to endure. Two hours and six minutes in length, it is. It is roughly equally divided between the battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable) and the development of the plot. <br /> <br /> One would have thought that with the theme was the son of a minor tribal chief who would beat half the world, the conspiracy would have been relatively easy. There is a good amount of raw material to make a good story. However the writers left it completely. We do not have a real story. Instead, we get a Hollywood version of the story. <br /> <br /> What sustains the young Temudjin through his long, almost infinite, in reality, or so it seems to the viewer, tribulations? Why, the love of a good woman, of course. <br /> <br /> How do you get out of jail? Well, an old monk, who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness, moves across the continent to bring this good woman a talisman that symbolizes Temudjin's love for her, dying close enough for her to find him there. , talisman in his hand. And, of course, she then leaves and, having become (inexplicably) rich and powerful, rescues him. <br /> <br /> How do you escape from the chains? Well, he goes to the sanctuary of the great wolf-god Tengri (or some name like that) and Tengri releases him by magic. Yeah sure. <br /> <br /> Why do you want to become ruler of the Mongols? The wolf god again, apparently. Outside, Temudjin leaves to ask for guidance and, surprise! surprise! - He gets it. "Laws," he says to himself. "What the Mongols need are laws, good and simple." Golly, it was awesome. <br /> <br /> And finally, how do you win the decisive battle against your opponent's most powerful forces? Of course, better tactics, but also with the help of the good old wolf-god, who sends a storm to the height of the battle. All the troops shrink when the thunder rolls and the lightning (the Mongols are afraid of the thunder, as you see), but not our Temudjin. The troops, completely captivated by their courage, cheer him up as king! <br /> <br /> I do not know what induces people to continue producing this type of garbage. The funny thing is that it is interspersed with all kinds of harsh realism: many sips of milk, dirt and violence. It is as if the producers of this film wanted to understand trivial things well so that the spectators did not realize how childish some of the big things are. <br /> <br /> There are lots of violence in the first graphic: cuts, impalements, spurts of blood, spurts of blood, clouds of blood, the blood guys had a great time, really. Despite realism, it is impossible to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> I must mention the ridiculous scene of the final CGI battle. How someone can think that these things seem realistic is beyond me. They do not Oh, and everything is filmed in the standard Hollywood style: breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery, and the super-close-up Stedicam for the battle scenes. And the Dolby standard super effects of shock and shock and the constant low-frequency hum to maintain tension. <br /> <br /> Tedious. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
