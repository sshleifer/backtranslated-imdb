Formula about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilean who can inherit a fortune and gets confused in the affairs of the bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful lawyer (Vargas). It looks a lot like a television movie, it's not really exciting. The only reason I bothered to see him was because Valentina Vargas was there. There are no real surprises here, although it is good to see Vargas. Magnificent Chilean landscapes on display, but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and does not add much to the film. Michael Ironside always plays a bad guy, but this is not one of his most memorable parts. The chase scenes are standard fare.
