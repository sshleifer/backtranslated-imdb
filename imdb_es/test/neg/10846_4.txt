This movie only draws attention in its banality and use of clich√©s. Unfortunately it was obvious until the end. But do not get confused thinking that it ended strongly. Just a little bit unexpected, although nothing is worth seeing through the thing. <br /> <br /> From the taciturn and mistreated hero, to the Germanic enemy, to the expendable equipment, the characters were completely wooden and obvious. The two FBI agents, Smith and Wesson (geddit?) Gave some hope of humor, but came to nothing. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of science fiction, but it's hard to find a redeeming quality in this movie. . A turkey! <br /> <br />
