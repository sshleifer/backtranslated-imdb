This is one of the most stupid and worthless movies in history. It really does not qualify for the state of the movie. It's VERY cheap (apparently filmed on a videotape), it acted horribly, and it's just rotten. I could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of shit was. It looked like a home video! I mean, I think a guy I know in some houses must have taken out his video camera and done this shit in 2 or 3 hours. It's so bad I noticed the name of where this "Asylum" came from and I will NEVER rent anything with that name again. When you rent a movie, check if it is from this "company". However, one thing is certain: if you like amateur films with a horrible performance, you may like this loser. It is absolutely boring and terrible !!! You have been warned !!!
