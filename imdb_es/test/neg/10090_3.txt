Imagine every exaggerated and stereotyped clich√© of every movie and TV show that takes place in the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1980. Fill it with a cast of interchangeable cartoons instead of real characters. Add a mix of "vintage" music and electric guitars during the "rumor" scenes. Then, spend time trying to figure out (or worry) which of the Deuces will be killed in the final (anti) climate rumor. <br /> <br /> I will give points to this film because it is not just another one. Romantic comedy, teen slasher, explosive action movie, teen sex comedy, children's musical or Oscar nomination vehicle. But bringing something new or interesting to the street gang tragedy genre could have been good.
