So, this is the WORST movie you'll probably see. It is at the height of "Crossbones" and "Southern Comfort", but if you are a fan of movies like me, this atrocity of a movie will be the most fun you've had in years. WHY does the camera make old school kung fu noises when it approaches? WHY does that guy randomly put a commemorative nascar plate in his bag? And who is he anyway? WHY do vampires fire lightning after they die? What is this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares! Just laugh at that. This movie has no continuity, no plot, nothing, really. Ron Hall's range of emotions is always off. He seems happy when he should be sad, angry when he should be confused. The rest of the cast could not get out of a paper bag. The special effects ("Short bus" a little special) are placed at random, and are never necessary. Most scenes are illuminated with a desk lamp, if they are on. Mel Novak has the audacity to look for his line off camera, and is not even edited. They just keep filming. In fact, half of this movie is not even in the movie. It's 1/2 movie, 1/2 sony hand-cam. For most of the movie, it seems that they left their boom microphone at home. This movie not only has some holes in the plot, it is a field of confusion and mental pain! But oh I love it! Thank you Ron Hall, for this cinematic abomination. I went out and bought it, because it's very funny. ($ 1.99 on Amazon, and it was delivered to me quickly!) <br /> <br /> "I have guns! I have guns! I have WEAPONS!"
