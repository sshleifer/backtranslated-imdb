For a good view of the Roman Empire, see the excellent miniseries produced by the BBC "I, Claudius". This just sucked. The performance was pathetic and you could almost see the actors looking at the camera. Hans Matheson was irritating. The cheese factor was so high that it promotes constipation with repeated visits. Even Caligula was docile. I think this movie was silently supported by "religious" groups that will remain nameless;). The overtones of Christian favoritism and persecution were flagrant if that gives any clue. Stay away from whatever you do, the execution time is so long that I could read the first Harry Potter book faster than the time it took me to see this gut. <br /> <br /> Italy has done better, do not Let Hans cute face fool you. He's not a great actor ... he's a big bore.
