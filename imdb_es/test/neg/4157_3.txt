I like to think that I can appreciate a movie that is a little out of the ordinary, and I certainly love a good movie that makes me think. <br /> <br /> If you like the unusual movies that make you think, then look elsewhere. This movie is so bad and so unrelated that the only thing you will think after it is over is how you can waste 90 minutes of your life watching this. <br /> <br /> A movie of this kind needs a driver to get to buy from the viewer. Why are we interested in the main characters? What motivates these characters through their existence? Why do they make the decisions they make? This movie makes a very weak attempt to do this and fails in the process. There is no chemistry between these two actors, who are excellent in their ability to feel comfortable in any role. So, why did they fail here? I firmly believe that they also did not know what their motivations were, and when an actor does not know it, his audience can not continue. <br /> <br /> In summary, I've seen macromedia flash videos that I offered more in the way of provoking thought, at least I have more interest in the transformed hamster that loves the moon than why this married family man I would risk everything for a violation of "Code 46".
