It is not often that I give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre. A film can be BAD, since it is not a masterpiece, but it can be enjoyed on the basis of unintentional humor, strange characters, etc. . They are nice for lovers of the genre and seekers of guilty pleasure because their "evil" is entertaining. However, this film does not have the humor or the actual bloody scenes of the original "Piranha" (1978). <br /> <br /> I suppose that in 1995 was the apogee of political correctness, so the gore on television was minimal. Now in the middle of the 2000s with C.S.I. Shows, television is a festival of absolute blood! (Good for us, the terror fans!) <br /> <br /> William Katt and Alexandra Paul are not Bradford Dillman or Heather Menzies (the original stars of 1978). It is not the failures of Katt and Paul, but the writers and directors who created this lukewarm turkey. How the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie. I will not say how because that is part of the plot. <br /> <br /> This television movie probably had a bigger budget than the original, but it failed like a good horror, as can be seen in the votes of the users here. Stay with the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer fish movie!
