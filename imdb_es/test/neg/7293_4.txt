Because Disney often ignores the quality of the animation and the need for a good plot in its aftermath, this was actually a pleasant surprise. I do not know why Disney does not pay more attention to its aftermath. The quality of the graphics is always inferior; there are no funds worthy of the Disney name, inane plots and worse dialogue, with little or no attention to real history, and cartoon drawings are almost always worse than the Saturday morning cartoons in detail and quality. > The quality of the animation is still low compared to the Disney originals, and the dialogue is quite trite, the story and the overall execution were really nice. <br /> <br /> While it is not so captivating, it does not stop capturing the charm and / or the mystery from the beginning. There are some indications of it, hidden here and there. <br /> <br /> Children will like it, at least. <br /> <br /> It has a rating of 4.5 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
