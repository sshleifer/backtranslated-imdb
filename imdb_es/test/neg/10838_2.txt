This was, by far, one of the worst movies in which Sandra Bullock has performed. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. This is definitely his strong point and acting is not. In fact, I spent 54 minutes in this movie before I got bored so much that I felt compelled to leave the theater. It's a bore from the beginning until well, well 54 minutes in the movie anyway. The premise of "Guess what happened to me on the way to ..." has been done again and again until death. Somehow, there seems to be nothing funny or romantic about the fact that people deceive each other. Parents should keep in mind that this may not be a suitable film for their teenage children, especially the impressionable ones who may consider Sandra a hero. There is a scene in which the writers / producers / directors thought it would be good to show how "acceptable" it is to smoke a joint ... while driving ... and then have no consequences when you capture it. I'm not rude, and I smoked my part when I was younger, but I guarantee that I will not take my teenagers to see him and that they are solid A & B students. If you want to see a good Sandra Bullock movie, rent "The Net" or "Hope Floats", which I think are two of her best works.
