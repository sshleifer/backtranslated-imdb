Okay, when I bought this movie, I thought that this must be the best movie B, the landing of space monkeys on Earth and it starts killing people! <br /> <br /> Well, it was almost everything I expected, a typical low-budget sci-fi movie from the 60s. Acting has to be the worst thing I've seen, especially the girl who plays the lead role and the girl who played the waitress made me laugh. <br /> <br /> So, why does 'Night Fright' not fit in the 'so bad that is good' category? The reason is that some of the scenes were too long and boring. For example, the scene where the cops are looking for clues in the forest were only a few minutes of walking without a purpose. And then in the grand finale, people are waiting for the monster for about 5 minutes and when the space monkey appears, it disappears in 20 seconds, the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, 'Night Fright' is boring, but it has a couple of fun moments. I can recommend this movie to everyone who liked movies like 'Zontar, The Thing from Venus' or 'Curse of the Swamp Creature'. <br /> <br /> I give 'Night Fright' 4 Space Monkey of 10 slaps. . <br /> <br /> -Rob Gruesome-
