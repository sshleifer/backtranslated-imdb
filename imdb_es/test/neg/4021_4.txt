I've seen about half a dozen of the low-budget B westerns that Ken Maynard did in the 1930s, and I'm constantly surprised at how poor actor he was. How did you become a leading cowboy actor? They say it could go pretty well in the silences, but it does not do anything particularly impressive in these latest sound movies. Still, maybe he got the clues because he was big and could travel. <br /> <br /> Phantom Rancher is not as bad as some of the other Ken Maynard films I've seen, but it's still not much. . Some of the other characters refer to him a couple of times as a "young man", where I think he is as old as the other major actors. <br /> <br /> And if that's not stupid enough, there's a fairly significant script problem in this movie. At one point, one of the characters commented on how the ghost had prevented the poisoning of a well, something that had not happened yet. Only a couple of minutes later, we see that particular scene. No, it was not a flashback. At first I thought maybe when Treeline Films was doing the DVD transfer, they could have invested two of the reels. But in those days the film rolls contained approximately 11 minutes of film, and the total investment only took about 3 or 4 minutes at most. Everything else was in a logical order. So, it seems that this was a genuine continuity problem in the original movie. Maybe that's one of the reasons why Colony Pictures did not last long.
