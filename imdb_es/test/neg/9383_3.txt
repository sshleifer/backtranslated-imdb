When Jan Svankmajer lets your imagination fly, get ready. Dark and harrowing films like "Alice" and "Little Otik" await you, or short gems like "Down to the Cellar" and "Jabberwocky". All these are excellent films that represent the best of surrealist and disturbing cinema. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, when Svankmajer tries to make a political statement of any kind, we recommend that you leave the room in a hurry. Svankmajer's films in this sense tend to be both adolescent and servery, and present straw man cartoons repetitively to express their pseudo-brilliant ideas. <br /> <br /> "Lunacy", unfortunately, is this last type of movie. The ideas and the cartoon characters stretch like paper for two hours. There are some moments that interest you briefly, but these few oases are separated by vast deserts of boredom. <br /> <br /> If you find the short and monotonous short film "Et Cetera" by Svankmajer, brilliant and hilarious, probably love "Lunacy". If you have never seen a Svankmajer movie before, start somewhere else.
