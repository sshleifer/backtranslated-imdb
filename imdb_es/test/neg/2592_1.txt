"The new hope of Romanian cinema" ... if this is the new hope, then I really would not like to see the saving hero of such a prolific cinema (that is, Romanian cinema). Now seriously, where should I start? 1. The fucking scenario: are you kidding, this is not even credible not to mention its high degree of stupidity 2. the Direction: in what direction? This movie should have had psychological tension, at least that, since they have decided that it looks as unpleasant as possible. Oky, I admit, Radu Muntean is not Polanski, Hitchcock, Fincher or Lynch (the list could continue), but at least the minimum effort would have been appreciated. 3. The language: Oky, I do not understand why (almost) all the Romanian directors believe that if you make the film as miserable and obscene as possible, then you have art. I do not care about explicit language or poor image quality as long as the final result is worth it. In this case, it does not. There is nothing to comment on, since everything that this film means is already told thousands of times, the characters are portrayed too accurately to be memorable, the "shocking events" that occur are also poorly illustrated and unimportant . This film is based solely on self-induced emotions, on the exaggeration of "we must do it". Someone was found murdered, so "WE SHOULD" feel sad, scared or scared, someone went through this and that "WE MUST" feel a certain way. That's silly. Because a movie is a piece of fiction, nothing is real here. So the only true emotions are those that you discover when you go into their world (that is, in the movie) <br /> <br /> * / * * * * *
