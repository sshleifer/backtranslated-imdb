Well, I got and saw this movie based on the quite high score here (7.1 now), and in some of the good reviews. Generally, IMDb is a good guide when it comes to scoring, although in this case I was very cheated. <br /> <br /> The film is a detective story of today, with Vinnie Jones as a research journalist, investigating The Death of a Construction Worker. Mixed with this, is an invented Dickens novel (called The Riddle, set in the eighteenth or nineteenth century), which also deals with a murder story. Both lines of the story are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript. <br /> <br /> Sound interesting? It could have been, however, this film fails horribly in several areas: 1) Acting. Mediocre at best, but observable. It's not worse than your UK comedy average, although for a movie you expect a little better. Especially with a score of more than 7. 2) Music. The music used is simply horrible, distracting and annoying. Especially the pub music and the music played in the journalist's department. 3) Storyline. This is a great joke. There are huge plot holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it's almost funny. Also, without going into any detail, I can safely say that the end is absurd, and one of the worst pieces of performance and history of the year. 4) Camera work. Sometimes, the positions and views of the camera distract, and they have no purpose for "history". <br /> <br /> I'm a bit of a movie fan, and I see on average 1 to 2 movies per day, but this is easily the worst movie I've seen in months. Do not waste your money or your time on this garbage.
