Request that you do not watch this movie ... Start with a promise and, as you go forward, long for the movie to end ... Predictable, not entertaining at all, wasted movie ... Save time and watch better thrillers. ... The synopsis sounds good and that's why I saw the movie ... But it was too predictable with nothing to give it a start ... There's no great suspense ... there's no great direction ... nothing great with the acting ... get away from this ... low rating ... There's nothing to write about this movie, so I'm filling in the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much time I wasted this movie ... really irritated by how a good premise that it was and how badly a script was written about it ...
