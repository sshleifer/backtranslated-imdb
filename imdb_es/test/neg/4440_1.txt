The "Quintet" by Robert Altman is a dismal, grim and difficult to follow thriller that you finally give up after a while because it is very complicated. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this on my local twin sister the opening weekend with a full house. By the time the picture was finished, it was less than a full room. I have never witnessed such a massive exodus without an emergency to expel people. That should tell you how bad it is. I think it's the worst movie ever made that involves such an important talent in front of and behind the camera.
