The copy cats have copied this movie from a Hindi movie of 1974 called "Call Girl"! "Call Girl" had an identical story. The way the protagonists fall in love, then they rebel and the climax is the same in these two films! "Call Girl" is better than water, at least from the point of view of history. It was not as slow as Water! Water on the other hand does not progress at all. The goal is perhaps to make the audience sympathize with Kalyani forever! Are Indian filmmakers better than just being great copiers these days? Well, they call it "being inspired." In his language it is: "to be inspired (without any appointment!)"! :)
