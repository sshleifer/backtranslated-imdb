There are times when, less than half of a movie, I begin to wonder what the creators thought that made them decide not to record every roll of footage and release a movie that has no real merit of any kind. And I mean any kind. This movie does not even hold up like pornography made by cable. In fact, Heaven's Tears is totally and absolutely boring and, at times, a bit disturbing in its naivety. The girl, who, as I recall, is eighteen years old, masturbates while thinking of a senior Nazi who hit her with a car, the "hitting her in the hall as a way to introduce ourselves" the syndrome of comedies and movies Robert Zemekis Then, in his second or third meeting, get this, he is the shy one, the one who resists the girl's sexual advances and, nevertheless, all he has to say is: "I'm old enough. I want to," and He takes her to bed. Then, after going to bed with this girl she barely knows, she feels complete, as if she could die right there in bed with her and have lived a full life. It's like "Lolita" without a bit of social and personal comments. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is the most boring part of the movie. There are no interesting angles or originality at all, not even for sex scenes, which are supposed to be the main attraction for this type of film. The scene of the masturbation is only a camera that surrounds the bed of the girl (with a very false aspect, as if it were in a scene), and it is interrelated with his fantasy of the man who takes a shower in a waterfall. The "I completed" scene is just a close-up of the girl's right side (head down to the breasts) with the guy on top of her, and it's the same shot all the time, although there are repetitive cuts to a scene quite unrelated to the older sister of the Nazis, who has some kind of incestuous infatuation with him (it's ridiculous and silly, so it does not matter). I think everything lasts from five to ten minutes, and it's neither enlightening nor exciting.
