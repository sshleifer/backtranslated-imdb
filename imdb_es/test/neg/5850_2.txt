If you are a slapstick fan that has terrible writing, a horrible performance and a cliché after a cliché, this is for you. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to list for the reasons why this movie stinks. In a brief synopsis, people with a combined iq of 100 travel to New Mexico in a $ 200 million race. And yes, they are all apparently super heroes, as they can do many things, such as jumping on trains that travel more than 80 km / h, surviving numerous car accidents and endless examples of comedies of cartoons and coyotes. <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager, or do not want to think about a movie, this is for you. No actor outside of Lovitz is credible at all. Lovitz saves the movie of a 1 with the Hitler bit. <Br /> <br /> 2/10 (save 2 hours of pain and $ 4)
