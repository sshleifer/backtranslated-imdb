This really is a movie of two halves. The first one detailing the lives and friendship of two children (one, a privileged Pashtun and the other, a trampled Hazara) in the late 1970s in Afghanistan before the invasion of the USSR works extremely well. The young actors become convincing performances and seeing Afghanistan as it was before, they highlight the current situation there. <br /> <br /> The real problem arises when we enter the last phase of history in which we join the Pashtun As a man who lives in America. The old debts with his young friend take him back to his homeland and it is really at this point that things break. It is clearly assumed that the central adult character is sympathetic, but in fact he presents himself as a weak man and wallowing in self-pity. It is difficult to really worry about him and one can not help feeling that the really interesting story is the one we do not see: that of his childhood friend. <br /> <br /> Once he returns to Afghanistan, the narrative becomes entangled in a series of highly artificial coincidences. The most remarkable thing is that he manages to face the enemy of his childhood after all these years almost immediately (although he is not looking for it), despite the chaos that has since consumed the country. This allows you to face demons from the past in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible. The resolution of the narrative is also carried out with a sensational and serious sentimentality that undermines the really serious points that the film could be trying to make. <br /> <br /> Although it is possible to begin to see the characters and the abuses of their As the symbols of a state that has been destroyed by world politics, it is difficult to see this as a film that gets involved in any political discussion more espacious. Instead, the narrative is reduced to the emotional journey of a character of self-discovery and healing. Unfortunately, this character is so boring and self-involved that it's hard to really get involved in his story, while the opportunities to make a really interesting movie about Afghanistan itself are wasted.
