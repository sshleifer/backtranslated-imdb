Well, first of all, the twins are exactly the same. there's no one female and the other is tomboy (although Ashley is taller than Mary-Kate) and her boyfriends are not even French, so that's bad because they're faking the accents. Lamo Nor is it so bad, not the best of them. I'm a big fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley, do not get me wrong. The story is good and it's fun to watch it. It's not the kind of movie you'd see over and over again. But hey, when they made this movie they were still new in general, making their own movie. The girls also act as if they were over 13, but if you are a young spectator, this is a good movie. It is not so good if you are over 13 unless you are a father watching a movie with your children. then it's okay. Good luck MK + A with your future movies!
