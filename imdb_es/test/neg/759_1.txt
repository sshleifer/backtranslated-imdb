This movement is bad on so many levels that I do not even know where to start. Okay, the good points: Peebles is beautiful as a dirty outlaw in black leather. Some of the landscape photographs were impressive. That is all. Oh, and it was a nice touch to have the buffalo head over the bar door in Freemanville, I guess it was a nod to the Buffalo Soldiers. The movie starts quite well, but the characters are so flat, so funny, so "a lot", the bad guys are too bad, I drown trying to describe them more. The Spanish-Cuban-American War was 1895-1898, with the United States involved only in April and August of 1998. I think the film said it was carried out in 1893 (I could be wrong, but I do not want to see it again to verify ). A large part of this film depended on the KKK killing Jessie's father. Well, guys, the original KKK started in 1865 and was destroyed by President Andrew Johnson in 1871. The Klan was not even present during the period of this movie. Of course, the bad spoils were again occupied in 1915 and we know the rest of that. BUT for the purpose of the film it is historically incorrect and that was an important part of the plot. I think I could go crazy with a lot more, so here are some hits and I'm done. I did not know that Boyz2Men and other bands like that were inspired by street singers in New Orleans in the 1890s. I also did not know that fetish collars were a rage to Sioux women in the 1890s ... but then I was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while wearing acrylic nails of 1 "... We almost died of laughter and I like a western cheese more than most people, such a waste of talent and money, this really had the opportunity to show a part of the history of the United States that is not well known http://www.coax.net/people/lwf For more information, visit /bkcwboy2.htm This could have been so good, but it was just .. bad from 1-10, you get a 1 instead of a zero because Mario looks good with his hat and there was an Appaloosa horse in the movie.
