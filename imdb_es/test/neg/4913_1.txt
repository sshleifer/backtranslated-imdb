Aksar is a horrible movie. The script, the story, the acting are simply laughable. Dino Morea plays a man who pays Emraan Hashmi to seduce his wife. Yes, this is as ridiculous as it seems. Both Morea and Hashmi offer an incredibly bad and surprising performance. Udita Goswami plays the aggressive, capricious and angry wife. She is beautiful but she has no talent to act. The film has a hit song called "Jhalak Diklaja" which is composed and sung by Himesh Reshammi. I could never understand the enthusiasm for this song, since I never found it particularly good although it is catchy. The film is supposed to be a thriller, but instead, it looks like a comic strip thanks to the terrible direction and writing. Avoid this cheapo at any cost.
