Ed Wood is rolling in his grave. I could have done a hundred cult classics for the price of this garbage pit. The worst script in memory (makes "X-Men 3" shine as "Citizen Kane"); the most amateur direction; pre-K cinematography; the "cheesiestos" special effects (I refer to the sequel to "Friday The 13th"); and throw in a sequence of meaningless, disgusting, deeply disturbed motherhood. The lack of talent or sensitivity that put this garbage on the screen is amazing. That the "industry" can reward any person involved in this celluloid fund with future projects should be cause for serious alarm
