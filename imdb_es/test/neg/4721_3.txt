Cult buyers are undoubtedly familiar with the term "video nasties". This was a notorious British list that contained all the films that could cause 'harm' to society if it were seen by irresponsible audiences (dramatization). For gore buffs, this is an excellent checklist, as it contains inhumanly cruel and disturbingly realistic films (Faces of Death, Cannibal Holocaust, Driller Killer), as well as extravagant and ultra-sick horror films (The Burning, Nightmare City, The Toolbox Murders). Bearing this in mind, it is quite unusual to see "The Night of the Bloody Apes" among the other "unpleasant". I'm sure it's bloody, but blood and violence are so badly presented that I can not imagine anyone being offended by it. And the absurd plot (about a desperate doctor transplanting the heart of a gorilla into the chest of his dying son) is not exactly what I would call disturbingly real. All that remains is a rather funny horror and pulp movie with a horrible performance and a senseless sordidness. The make-up effects of the ape-man are ridiculous and there is no tension or atmosphere to detect them anywhere. Nice only if you are in the right mood, in other words. The few sequences that show detailed matches of wrestling (which makes one of the leading actresses to make a living) are very interesting.
