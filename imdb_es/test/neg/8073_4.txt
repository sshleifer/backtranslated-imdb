I remember being on vacation in Florida when this movie aired. I had configured my VCR to record it. The anticipation was killing me. He knew about the movie since it was announced half a year ago. We returned from Florida 4 days after the film aired, and I immediately saw it. I tried as hard as I could to be liked, but I did not. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of stooges 3. And as such, I know quite a lot about them. So it was not like I was waiting to learn something from the movie, and I did not. He was more interested in the representations and in seeing how accurate his information was. There were many things wrong with this movie. The actors, the script, the recreations, EVERYONE could have been much better. <br /> <br /> Paul Ben-Victor is a tremendously talented actor. But let's face the facts, Moe Howard was very far from his reach. He does not look like him, he does not sound like him, and therefore, he can not act like him. Michael Chiklis is also very talented, but his interpretation of Curly was not very good to me, although when Curly got sick, he did very well. The representation of John Kassir of Shemp could have been rehearsed better. It was more a bad impression than a portrait. Worst of all was Joe Besser. They made him skinny, and more annoying than he really was. It was simply laziness. I do not like Joe's underpants, because, as the movie illustrates, he was almost never hit. But he was not so annoying, and WITHOUT DOUBT he was not so thin. The best performance belongs to Evan Handler. He had the most accurate portrait of the puppet. The problem with Larry's character, his hair is too curly and too red. I know that's too technical, so I will not say that on my list of why I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> Back to Shemp, who happens to be my favorite puppet. He is written like a whimper, shaking, chicken. It is true that I had many phobias, but it was not so bad. Initially, he did not leave the group because he was afraid of Ted Healy, although he did not like it, Shemp left because he received an offer from another studio that he simply could not refuse. Instead of the truth, this film chooses to make him wet the bed, in Larry nothing less, run to a closet and make a shame of the group. Another problem is that Shemp made almost as many Columbia shorts as Curly did as a puppet, but only one, Fright Night, which was his first short, is shown. His career was almost completely ignored. In addition, the bad edition caused a terrible and unforgivable error. Shemp was born at the beginning of 1895 and died at the end of 1955. Would that make him be older in death? Well, here's a clue, it's not the 59 as the movie indicates. <br /> <br /> Now, for the writing, which I think was wrong just because this movie was rushed. Some of the lines are silly and could be developed and / or introduced much better than they were. The only line that really caught me was at the end of the movie, when Moe shows the promoter how the eyepoke is made. <br /> <br /> "This is how we do it, we make contact with the eyebrow bone, However, not the eyes, it seems real in the movie". This line was badly written and misplaced in the film. It is meant to be one of those lines that make the public say OH! With astonishment and I'm sure he did it with some people, but the end of the movie was not the place for this line. You ask a better place? How about when they show up at Columbia for the first time and show up at the sound effects machine? I know initially there was no sound for the eyepoke, but Moe, for example, could have said, "What about this?" And the circles of Curly or Larry. Jules White then says "Are you okay?" or "How did you do that?" There were many misplaced lines in this movie, which is a clear sign that the script was rushed. Another has to do with the origin of the name Shemp, although that is not so bad, so I'll let it go. <br /> <br /> What does this movie do well? It illustrates how the puppets were fucked by Columbia, as they were. I'm not sure if Moe was an errand boy, but that was the kind of dramatization that is intended for the viewer to sympathize with them. I know that this movie was a dramatization. I know that not everything will be clear, clean and absolutely perfect. However, some of the things they invented and the real things they ignored were in serious conflict with each other. For example, Curly's hit is not even close to the way it happened in real life. I know, I know, the dramatization, but the purpose of the dramatizations is to make the real events more dramatic. Curly's blow in real life is more dramatic than what they showed in the movie. This is what really happened. Curly was sitting in a chair off the screen while filming a scene, he was called for the final scene of the cake fight, but there was no response. Moe went to look for him and discovered that his brother's head had collapsed, half paralyzed, unable to speak, and tears were streaming down his face. Moe then said "Honey?" And he tried to help him out of his chair. Poor curly falls on his knees. Then the ambulance was called. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was not terrible, but it was certainly not good, it was not even good. This film portrays the puppets helplessly and inaccurately and, sometimes, is exaggerated with dramatizations. There is a very, very long list of inaccuracies in this movie. If you do not believe me, check Stooge's list on the threestooges.com news forum. It is about a page and a half long. Some things in the movie that I can let slip. But others were unforgivable. The Three Stooges were geniuses, and much of today's comedy is based on what they did. Do not believe me Take a look at the Simpsons, and more, Ren and Stimpy. But this movie can not capture his genius. He captures his difficulties more inaccurately, which is important, but if the title of the movie is going to be The Three Stooges, he has to portray his wit and originality more than anything.
