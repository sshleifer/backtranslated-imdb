What can I say about this? A great prestige production, but in the end? Wasted time, money wasted. <br /> <br /> This work is a disaster seen historically. Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> * Augustus is often called 'Gaius' - his name (Pronomen). But the ancient Romans do not use this name. Correct would be the Surname (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or the 'Octavian', 'Caesar', 'Augustus'. <br /> <br /> * Livia was shown as a tyrannical wife. But this is historically incorrect. <br /> <br /> * Iulia was shown as a good young lady, but she was not. Adultery and (perhaps?) Prostitution and arrogant behavior were the cause of his exile. <br /> <br /> * She was not in the bed of her dying father. He was never allowed to leave his exile. And she had about 50 years at the moment! Not as young as he was shown. In the same year that Augustus died, he committed suicide, because Tiberius stopped giving him a pension. <br /> <br /> * Augustus was much more scrupulous than in this movie that is shown. But the author and the director seem to believe in Augustus' own "Res Gestae". <br /> <br /> What is left? Historically extremely doubtful, bad performance, bad construction and equipment: 2 points out of 10, one for Peter O'Toole.
