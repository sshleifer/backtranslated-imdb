A typical old b & w movie. The dialogues are sometimes good, but all too often, especially in the second half, they become naive, sometimes terribly naive, sometimes near the point where they are comically involuntarily. The first third, with its background information on Ladd's Gatsby shown with a series of interesting retrospectives, is the best part of the movie. But once Gatsby moves into his new villa and makes his moves at Betty Field, the film becomes too melodramatic. The end is another ending with no way out; I do not know if the novel itself contains this stupid or clich√© ending or if the producer of the film made some changes, but I have always considered that automobile accidents are a poor way to add drama to the conclusion of a story. I've seen this plot device a million times (or if it's not a car, then it's a horse's fall); the writer does not know how to finish the story but he knows that he wants it to be dramatic, for what he adds in a car accident. Lame. And to make things worse, the accident is scandalously coincidental and absurd, both by plot and by time; in a plot, because the lover of Field's husband (Winters) is killed by Field, and the fact that Winters leaves the gas station to the street as if she had never noticed in the years that she had lived there was a dangerous road He crossed his house and, of course, the moment he left, he saw Ladd's car and confused it with Field's husband and then shouted: "Here, here I am! The tragic end that way! "; in time because Ladd and Field are involved in an accident the same day they are preparing to tell Field's husband about his adventure. Basically, there is too much artificial and forced irony in this accident. Nor does this film exactly help how Winters' husband, Da Silva, goes on a revenge mission to kill the man who ran over his wife; Basically, he does this by walking like a zombie, going from one car to another looking for scratches, and acting very badly. Both the performance of Da Silva and the behavior of his character throughout the film are horrible and confusing, respectively. <br /> <br /> Scott Fitzgerald was annoyed a couple of times by the way his novels were adapted for the screen by Hollywood writers and, although he died long before this film was over; I could have been right to complain, judging by the naive script of this movie. Or maybe his novels are even more foolish and more naive than this movie, and were actually enhanced by the adaptations of the screen. Or, the movies are very similar to novels. I could, of course, read this particular novel to find out, but I just can not bother. Fitzgerald's name does not exactly inspire me to read any of his books (and I do not mean what his name sounds like). It certainly was not Heller, Clavell or Twain. More like Hemingway? A lot of noise for nothing.
