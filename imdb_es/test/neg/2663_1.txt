A friend gave me this movie because she liked it. I decided that I would finally see it. It was incredibly long. I kept waiting for the suspense to pass but it never happened. I kept waiting for something to happen after the initial scenes, and it never happened. I stopped the movie and came back later. In fact, I forced myself to look at the rest in the hope that it would improve. Got worse. I kept asking myself, who are these people? Do you have feelings? Are they just robots? I'm glad I did not pay to see it or pay to rent it. The ending would have been better if Dutch had died from the gunshot wound. At least we would have got some emotion from the audience. Or maybe not.
