(Very serious spoilers) <br /> <br /> this movie was a big disappointment. There are so many problems that I do not know where to start. Then, I will talk about what is good about the movie. <br /> <br /> The cast was great. Steve Martin offers a really funny performance of a white middle-class man, tall, tense. Queen Latifah plays a great, beautiful, urban, black gal. And Eugene Levy, well, he plays a lot. add betty white and jean smart and you'll have a great cast: everyone interpreted their roles very well. And if looking at these guys for 1.75 hours is worth $ 8 for you, then you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> but the movie makes many serious mistakes. First, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone. All whites are tense fans. All blacks are ghetto ebonics-speakers. Blacks are modern, cold, with-it and poor. The whites are nerds, rigid and rich. (Except for Eugene Levy, he's clearly taken with Queen Latifa and "speaks the jargon," so Latifa calls him "freak." So, if you're a white man and you like black women and you know street slang, you should be a monster). The film is full of racial slurs towards black cast members and, in return, whites are depicted as idiots and boobs. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the race card, let's look at the main flaw in the movie: destroy the latifa character. She comes to Martin's house under a false pretense, but Martin likes the girl anyway. He is supposed to be wrongly accused of theft, Martin assumes his cause. 3/4 of the way through the film we discovered that the Latifa character escaped from prison. Then, our sympathy for her goes out the window. <br /> <br /> There is no real plot. the film moves slowly from scene to scene with latifa appearing in a place where "no" is supposed to be (like a country club or Martin's house) and Martin tries to hide it. that is the gag running then, in the last minutes of the movie, they decide that they are finally going to deal with Latifa's claim that she was wrongly accused of bank robbery. Martin takes cover as a friend to extract a confession (let's be honest, unusable) of the former latifa boyfriend, and they all live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> finally (but there is much more wrong with this movie)) this movie seems to be a lot of clips from other movies. the premise is clearly taken from another martin movie "the house-sitter". where Goldie hawn comes to live with Martin and shakes off his heavy middle-class life. Martin and Latifa are online - wing "Youve Got Mail". All the "strange nanny arranges the life of the rich man" goes back to "the sound of music" and "Mary Poppins". <br /> <br /> I would never watch this movie for free.
