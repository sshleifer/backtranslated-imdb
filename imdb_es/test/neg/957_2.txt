POSSIBLE SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Quaid and I like Meg Ryan. I wanted to see them together, be married and everything, I wanted to see their chemistry on the screen. Okay, that being said, I suppose that the fact that they are actors, their off-screen relationship did not have to impregnate their performances, especially with this script. <br /> <br /> How stupid can a teacher be to stick the same to anyone. I do not remember the original, but I can only assume that O'Brien was probably handcuffed to his protagonist, probably in a more inevitable way. If he were "united" to someone, he would be very angry. The infatuation I would have done would have definitely dissipated quickly. Meg did not show a little annoyance, just a slight surprise. Dennis would have to take me kicking and screaming. The entire section of the movie was so horrible, especially Meg that he had to go to the bathroom (# 2) between the garbage dumps in the dark at night. Ewww. There is no way to fuck! <br /> <br /> What about Dennis hitting every suspect in the movie? Sock first ask questions later. Not one, not two, but too many, I could have kept track if I was so inclined. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the movie was Nick and his family drama. Too bad it could not have become more of a plot. The supposed drama off the screen that leads to this tragedy. I think it could have been written without distracting from the search for Dex. <br /> <br /> My fault lies with the writer of this script. Unless the director and others have investigated it so much that it is unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> I'm not even going to go into the real reason why poor Dex was killed. How ridiculous that is. Even when Dex confronted the real murderer and explained the reason, (a true moment of "black cinema") everyone on the screen seemed bored. Oh, _____ happened. Oh (yawn) "Dex even says that this is a stupid reason for a triple murder Oh tension, you can cut it with a spoon. <br /> <br /> If someone, except Dennis, had been in this movie, I have to give him 1/2 star (only because I've actually seen worse things), but in this case 1 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> For the stars Dennis and Meg, see ANYTHING.
