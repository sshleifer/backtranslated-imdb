This movie was a disappointment. The story is essentially The Shining with a castle (or a very cheap set that passes as a castle, to be specific) replacing the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. The budget is the same as it would be in a Cinemax porn movie, like the photography, the stage, the lighting and the video in which it was filmed. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there is no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic to your characters than to show them that they experience emotional trauma. And the trauma in this movie is pretty trite. Do you want an example? However, a blind girl who listens to a tape of a language that teaches words in Italian for colors starts crying for what she will never see. <br /> <br /> However, this movie had some things in its favor: the monster is really cool, it looks pretty scary. And there's a pretty decent amount of nudes by Raffaella Offidani, herself a star of Italian "erotic" movies. However, the blood leaves much to be desired, as does the performance, including Jeffrey Combs. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, I've only seen two other Stuart Gordon films: Re-Animator and From Beyond, both outstanding. But I will not let this little footnote in his career prevent me from seeing many of his films.
