The movie tells you to be conscious and conscientious. It also destroys each and every one of the things, the Bible says to be true. For people like me, the first episode was interesting and the second was disastrous. It has been called "blasphemy," and it is, if you are a believer. It is sad to hear that many people think it is a good continuation of the Bible. However, the film shows many things and themes, which can be interpreted as a film version of the "Revelation". Some of us think that such things should not be abused. One good thing about the film is that it promotes ethical awareness and makes you consider your actions twice. It seems that the director forgets that some people act in that way based solely on the fact that they believe and love as prescribed in the Bible ... Why try to change that, unless you yourself are the Devil?
