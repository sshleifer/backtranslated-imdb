When something can be anything you want or mean, you are required to register with someone as something special. But just like the shape of a cloud in the sky can appear to one of us or remind us of a warship, and another of the rear of his aunt, and yet for another absolutely nothing more than a cloud, this does not that this cloud is significant. Except for the interpretation of the spectators. Anyone who may find that throwing a stuffed giraffe out the window is brilliant, or worthwhile, without relating it in any context, is possibly simply trying to impress us with their intellectuality. <br /> <br /> Send to This movie, like the dreams of a madman, does it quite well, especially because there is no standard or expectation of what the dream would be like, and even if we were crazy, this would hardly give us points of sensible reference for comparison. A love story with this film carries the same risk as seriously interpreting Nostradamus. Whatever the real meaning that was being conveyed at that moment, it could be buried in private jokes, reflections or provincial details of his time, and for a few selected radical intellectuals! However, I could see a bit of an agenda even with my limited capacity. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely antifascist and, to a certain extent, anti-Italian.

Without an understanding of the potential historical relevance, even the apparent irrelevance is beyond the competence of academics or other intellectual possessors who indulge in irrelevancy to impress us. <br /> <br /> I gladly add my own buckets of paint to the disfigurement of this cinematic joke. But in an adaptation of the famous mot by the little boy; The movie really does not have a face (to disfigure). The painting would help him burn.
