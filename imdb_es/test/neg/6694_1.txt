This show is perhaps one of the most boring and graceless shows I've ever seen. While the humor was subtle, and I am in favor of subtle humor; The jokes were not fun. <br /> <br /> The show is about two thirty-something Kiwis living in New York trying to start their musical careers. <br /> <br /> I saw one. episode where Brett leaves the other Kiwi behind during a robbery. Well, the idea of ​​the plot has potential; but I have the feeling that half of the episode was just filler, and the other half was really important for the story. <br /> <br /> What I want to say is that they kept explaining how the one who stayed behind felt betrayed. and I had a lot of distrust of the other boy. I have a tip for writers: mention it once for idiots who can not understand it by the way it is acting, and move on. <br /> <br /> And I discovered that the characters were annoying. The character who left the other behind, Brett, was too innocent and naive, the one who stayed was talking with this monotonous and robotic voice. <br /> <br /> A third character, who was the manager of the band. I was obviously incompetent, but he was the only character I liked. He is also the one who won the program with a rating of one star. <br /> <br /> In short, a program that I do not intend to see again.
