When the word "presents" finds its way into a title, preceded by a famous name, the work can usually be discarded immediately. For some reason, people who are capable of creating good art do not seem to be able to see it in others. However, I have always been willing to try the second installment of the Devils trilogy. On the one hand, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. Most of the American directors would have sacrificed small animals to align the type of talent in the soundtrack of Demons 2. On the other hand, well, two words: Asia Argento. (Of course, she was eleven years old when this movie was made, and several years after her apparent decision that she would design her performance after the early Helen Mirren: steamy looks and little clothing). In addition, Lamberto Bava comes from one of the best dynasties in Italy in that strange genre sub genre known as Giallo (is the son of Mario Bava, who may well have invented the genre in the sixties). And the original Demons are a must-see for fans of horror films B of the eighties. So, how bad can this be, right? Well evil The demons continue their assault on the Italian media, as the film opens in a modern Italian skyscraper where many people who live their lives have their televisions in the background. Everyone is looking at a kind of combination of news / video reports of some investigative reporters trying to get evidence of the events of the first movie (which seems to indicate the term of this no more than a few days after the first movie). Through the usual additional inability to concentrate on the horror film, reporters manage to bring a demon back to life, and he appears on the TV screen to start the plague again. <br /> <br /> Yes. It's so bad The only good thing that can be said about the movie is that the soundtrack (when you're not being hit by people like The Smiths, The Cult, Gene Loves Jezebel, etc.) is awesome. It comes from the keyboard of Simon Boswell, who began his career as part of the Argento Dynasty and has since made films such as Lord of Illusions and Hackers. <br /> <br /> It makes a decent half rent free if you're thinking about drinking a lot, but it's certainly not close to how much fun the original was. Cronenberg's tremor, wonderfully funny, of unpleasant creatures, Shivers (also known as They Came From Within), is much better.
