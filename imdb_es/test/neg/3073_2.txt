Some movies are so badly made that they can be seen simply because of the crisis factor. The disciples made me tremble so much that I was uncomfortable. I saw everything without believing what I was seeing, did not someone know how bad this was while filming? It mixes most of the performances of the wooden actors, an abysmal script where all the comments of the "actors" sounded as if they came from the same character and the most hurried edition that tried (and failed in great) to give the film a touch forced. He passed. All this combined in a movie that will steal some hours of your life and will not give you anything in return. Avoid EVERY cost.
