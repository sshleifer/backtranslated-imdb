Oh my God ... where to start? "Chupacabra Terror" is one of the worst B-Horror movies ever made. This shit makes "Demon Slayer" look like "The Exorcist." Special note: a horror movie B must have at least one sex scene. Do not expect a hot girl in this. With that inexcusable error, I should start with the complete bash. <br /> <br /> First of all, if you're going to make a horror monster movie, you should spend a lot of your budget on creating a "good" monster costume. The monster in this movie looks like a $ 10 Halloween costume. There's no way the chupacabras (yes, that's how it is written) look threatening in the movie. He is an actor in a Halloween costume please! It looks so cheap that it drives me crazy. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the gore effects are the spinal cord of any direct horror movie to monster video. Once again, the producers decided not to spend on decent blood effects. The blood looks damn false! Please take a close look at the guy who cuts in two. That's probably the best scene in the movie and it lasts about ten seconds. The end is a very poor scene that will not leave you satisfied. <br /> <br /> The performance is the last thing you should expect to have quality in this type of movies; But in this film it is beyond the terrible. A cast of nobodies without acting experience is done to fools for about 85 minutes. Special mention deserves a blond boy with curly hair who tries to convince SWAT members that he is sick. The cough that pretends is more than laughable. He's probably the worst actor in a B-Horror movie, no kidding. In addition, Captain Pe√±a offers a terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> The TRUE story behind the Chupacabras is not even counted. All you have to know is that the monster sucks goat's blood. Why bother with this piece of garbage? Plesae, do not even look at it even if you have the chance. Not even if it is transmitted by cable. <br /> <br /> I usually support low-budget Horror movies because the people involved in them at least try to do something "different" to Hollywood, but that does not mean Horror fans like me should accept this type of garbage.
