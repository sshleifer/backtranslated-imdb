I have seen previous films by Cédric Klapisch and, therefore, I expected a quality film with psychological depth. Being an Erasmus student myself and visiting several friends who study abroad, I know very well what it means to spend time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time. Yes it's very funny! That's why I thought you should not miss this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to discover that L'Auberge Espagnol does not satisfy in many ways: the characters are stereotyped, the events are trite and the story is superficial. Although there are many familiar situations, they are an irritating cliché and do not go beyond trivial events. This made the film not interesting to watch, and it gave me a strong "fact of not having done that you have nothing to add". sensation. Apart from that, the film lacks a firm story. Sometimes it looks more like a documentary or a "real life" show than a movie taken seriously. <br /> <br /> However, I can imagine that if you have not studied or traveled abroad, it could be fun to watch it. .
