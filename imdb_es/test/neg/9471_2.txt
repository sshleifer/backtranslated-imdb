This movie was definitely boring. The acting was decent and the movie looks pretty good, the soundtrack is definitely for the fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. Speaking of the soundtrack, I found it very ironic that a film about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in their titles that was a BLATANT RIPOFF from Paul Simon's "You Can Call Me Al", except they do not. recognize it at all Is not there something a little hypocritical there? The scene in which the main child was where he imitated the presenter of a game show was my favorite. 10 lines? Do I have to write ten lines about this film to be included? What a scam, I do not think it's too fair to force people to write more than they would do to include it!
