I remember seeing this for the first time in the 80s when I was a teenager. Man, I read the comments about this garbage and I am surprised by the vote. This movie does not deserve four stars !!! This movie is NOT better than Topgun. Topgun has its own problems; do not get me wrong This movie should be banned just for its own stupidity. So many stereotypes, so many loop holes, so bad dialogue. I can not think of a redeeming quality of this vomit. This is not action / adventure. This is a bad joke in the movie. A bit like seeing Plan 9 with images of F-16. This film not only challenges logic and common sense in the context of a military environment, but also sends a disturbing message. The army is not going to save your father from the impending evil of the Middle East b ***** ds. So go out and save yourself a multi-million dollar gun and throw it out of the sinister claws of the anti-American Arabs. Because you can not reason with those animals. This is a Bruckheimer movie without a budget. Soft direction, weak acting, lame music, idiotic plot, equal to ... Iron Eagle.
