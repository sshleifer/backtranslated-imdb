Part of the low rating of the film is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure. While this is good for drama, in comedy, we know that it is not necessary to emphasize the pains. As a result, Fun with Dick and Jane is not an appropriate title and I was simply disappointed to see no fun with Dick and Jane. It is true that it is a copy of the film of the same name, but it fails in the execution and the title was not appropriate for the story line. <br /> <br /> However, if the film was renamed to "The Art of the Steal" and the emphasis on the most stolen slapstick comedy assumes the theft and plans to steal (of course, stupidly) they would have given a big boost to the movie. While, at the same time, the film must show the CEO at least as a thief at the beginning, so it will be easier to project the pains to someone responsible from the beginning and leave it at that. The film suffers from a point of view problem and with that in mind, a comedy can not work if the point of view is not made correctly. An intriguing husband character that is that of Wile E. Coyote in the Road Runner would be more fun, including the slapstick comedy. But in this case, stealing instead of catching the bird with complicated contraptions would be extremely fun here. I mean you can do many of these and put them in the movie. But since the point of view was made incorrectly, the part of the theft had to be limited. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy the film for the first 15 minutes (during Jim Carrey's great promotion), but to face the problems you had to face. To be more comical, since it is a comedy, that is the part that needs a major revision. It can be more fun, if the problems were more to face the civil action of John Travolta during the fall. That movie was serious, but the problems they faced were somewhat comical.
