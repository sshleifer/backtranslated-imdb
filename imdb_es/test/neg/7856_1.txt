C'était complètement minable: à fuir absolument! <br /> <br /> This was a stupid attempt to destroy the material of classical origin, and it was successful! <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie under any circumstances unless you want your ten euros destroyed and put your nose through a bunch of bland and atrociously funny characters. <br /> <br /> This type of film clearly illustrates the abyss that still unfortunately divides the directors and the public. If the individual (so heaven forbade a collective could have conceived this dross) behind this would have been sufficiently considerate to see the version that is currently being played in the French cinemas, he or she would have endured what I I was forced to endure, and thankfully he rewrote it or just discarded it. In my opinion, the vein of adult humor drawn here goes back to Fritz the Cat, but it lacks the avant-garde status of that film or even of its basic attempt at social commentary. <br /> <br /> With the proliferation of remakes and remakes. Increasingly confidence in the pre-existing source material to finance the storytelling these days, one would expect that choosing Snow White and, therefore, not having to worry about conceiving characters or a radically new story, would have allowed more time for, Oh, I do not know Interesting animations, smarter jokes, maybe a coherent movie that has something to say and does not telegraph its emptiness from the first frame? <br /> <br /> A manifestly atrocious production.
