A group of young dirt bikers are in the forest circling. They are having fun. Little do they know that nature is about to be triggered by an emo refugee from a film by Deliverance or Hills Have Eyes. It is armed with matches and fire. And he has an eye that is bleeding or something. Why burn a park? I dont know. Maybe he does not like Smokey the Bear, or something like that. But if you wear a military / naval uniform, if that helps. <br /> <br /> Rangers send a single helicopter to combat the resulting fire; that's all you see, except a group of people on a base somewhere talking a lot about the fire, but doing nothing. Some policeman, ranger, militiaman or whatever falls from the helicopter onto a faulty rope. <br /> <br /> Everyone now travels on their dirt bikes as if they were doing a motocross test. They always jump on wheels, make Evel Knievel jumps, spin, etc. They argue incessantly. The firing of the fire is as false as a $ 3 bill; it is the same image from a dozen different angles, and the glow never grows or moves. And you still never see any fire fighting equipment. <br /> <br /> The SyFy channel movie, which has a 0% science fiction associated with it. What you can expect from this: bad acting, cheap effects and a story that is not going anywhere (like bicycles and fire are not going anywhere). Insomniac cure laughable.
