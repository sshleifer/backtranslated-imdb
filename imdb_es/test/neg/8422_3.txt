For the first fifteen minutes, the story of NAKED FAME is interesting: two male porn stars in the late thirties in a seemingly healthy relationship decide to leave the porn industry and try the world of singing and acting. The two very skilled and groomed men are Colton Ford and Blake Harper. With the help of Kevin Aviance and Marc Berkely, Colton makes a dance floor that is then commercialized in New York with the hope that Colton Ford will become an instant star, a single-album singer who promotes her experience as a porn star for PR. <Br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is grunts, fights and comments from porn producer ChiChi LaRue and the film slowly sinks in repetition and heaviness. It is not a bad idea for a film if it revealed a little more depth in the impulse of each character to move away from a successful career (although very influenced by the youth that both characters have lost) in an alternative. It's just that a one-note song fades away quickly. Grady Harp, November 5th
