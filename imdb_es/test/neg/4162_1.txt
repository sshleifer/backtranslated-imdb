If you are a weirdo who thinks it is "romantic" and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother, leave her pregnant and then have sex with her once she has had an abortion. And not Tell him what is related to you, then you would like this movie. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that the man is married and has a child at home, which makes it even more unpleasant and deplorable that he is not aware as to what he is doing He can not do the right thing for your work, your family, or Mary. He's a loser. There's nothing romantic or positive in this movie, it's vile and incestuous. <br /> <br /> It moves slowly and does not lead anywhere during the first half of the movie. I could not even finish seeing this pathetic excuse for a 'romance'. I'm glad we did not waste our money at the movies in this case. 0/10
