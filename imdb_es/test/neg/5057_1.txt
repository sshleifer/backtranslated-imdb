I'm sorry for any spoilers that this contains. But if you want to continue reading anyway: I really wonder why so many people are so tall with Kevin Williamson. Let's take a quick look at his work as a screenwriter, okay? There's Scream 1 and 2 (plus the story for the next one), which I think are pretty funny but very overrated. Also, by turning Scream into a franchise, it stopped becoming a parody of horror movies and simply became another. Then there's I Know What You Did Last Summer, which is essentially the same movie again. He co-wrote Halloween: H20, but even he had the feeling of not taking credit for what he did in that monstrosity. Then comes the Faculty, which I can only say was frightening. (A lot of fun to tease, though). I do not even mean the ridiculous, soap opera Dawson's Creek, I could tell how bad that is for hours. Then we come to Teach Mrs. Tingle. First of all, there are a lot of small improbabilities in this. For example: in most of the high schools I know, the valedictorian is NOT the only one who can go to college! This idea that the character of Katie Holmes would never go anywhere unless he was a valedictorian was absurd. You've never heard of financial help, damn it? Also, I do not think that you will be expelled from high school or that you will not enter college for cheating on a test. There are a lot of others, but I'm going to jump to the big one now. The end really bothered me: they committed a crime, but it was fine because the teacher was a bitch. Cool. Do you know how many of my teachers I could kidnap based on that logic? I'm sure the police never took any statement to discover the whole story, either. That sure would not be necessary. Helen Mirren was good, she added a nice touch to a character who (as one previous commentator pointed out) had NO reason to do anything. And has anyone else noticed that Katie Holmes can not act? His own justice became incredibly annoying. "You wanted me to fail, Blah, blah, blah." His last two scenes with Mrs. Tingle were the worst. The only reason I do not regret losing $ 8.25 in this disaster is because she was hit a bit. No, wait, I'm sorry I lost the money: it was not real and she survived. Mr. Williamson, if you are reading this, you have made the same movie (some violence and / or frightening things compensated by clever children who make sarcastic jokes and references to other movies) just a few times now (Story 6, so, not including Scream 3 and whatever it follows), and I would really appreciate it if you stopped. Otherwise, he might have to kidnap you and threaten you with a crossbow. OK? :-)
