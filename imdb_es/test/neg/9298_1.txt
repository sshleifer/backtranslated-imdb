I love Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. However, this is easily the worst movie I've seen in 10 years, and I watch my share of movies. A stinker This is a bad idea for a movie, poorly executed. None of that is funny, credible or interesting. I was looking for wit, irony and genuine humor. Instead, it seemed that most of the cast members were heading to the set to do Tea Leoni a favor. It is a pity that such acting talent will be wasted in such a vacuum. Do not bother. I have to wonder what opinion the creators of this film have of their audience to submit them to the idea that the Polish mobsters in Buffalo, New York, send a hitman to San Francisco to become an assistant the funeral home while attending AA meetings. Bill Pullman should start reading scripts before agreeing to be in a movie. Sad.
