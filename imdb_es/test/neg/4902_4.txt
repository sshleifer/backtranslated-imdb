It is important to keep in mind the real meaning of the phrase "Inspired by a true story" when seeing the Pride. It is something like "I could save up to 50%", which can literally be translated to "Can not save more than 50%". Everything sounds good until you realize that the bottom of "up" is "zero". Similarly, "inspired by a true story" means that someone heard a story and made them think of it. The only certainty is that the real story and the one you are about to see are not the same. <br /> <br /> There's a real Jim Ellis who started training the swimming team at the Philadelphia Recreation Department in the early 1970s, but I have a feeling that the real Jim Ellis should not have I was able to hide some feelings of disappointment at the way the movie turned out. Clearly, he takes liberties with the story of his life, and I just imagine him responding to the strange looks of his friends who wonder why the movie is so different from the man they know. <br /> <br /> In Anyway, one thing that surely will be proud is that it is played by Terrence Howard, one of our best actors, who starred with Bernie Mac, who, despite the lack of An original and powerful story, it still gives you a sincere and moving heart. performance. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in the 1970s in Philadelphia, a time and place where racism was the norm, not the exception, and the educated and professional Jim Ellis, who is also an excellent swimmer, He is having trouble finding a valuable teaching position, until he was finally relegated to a crumbling recreational center, and assigned the task of cleaning up before his demolition. We can certainly understand his feeling of contempt. <br /> <br /> When we meet Elston, the maintenance man (Bernie Mac), he is a disillusioned grumpy man sitting in his office surrounded by piles of junk that touch the ceiling and watch television during the day in an old and dusty television set. Needless to say, when Jim appears to start cleaning the place and cleaning it, Elston is not exactly friendly with him. He knew that his recreation center was being closed, and all his anger over that was transferred without problems to Jim. <br /> <br /> Given his past as a college swimmer, Jim is especially interested in the pool, which cleans, fills and contributes to the best form. A group of black teenagers who play basketball outside the recreation center are interested in the pool when they take off the edge of the basketball and the heat is still suffocating, and soon the group has a developing swim team in their hands, that enter a city. Meeting to swim. Calling them homeless, of course, would be an understatement. They are not organized, they are not professionals, they are not sufficiently trained and they have no idea how to behave in a swimming meeting. <br /> <br /> That does not matter, of course. The film is his usual sporting history, so the first sporting outing is not as important as something more than a learning experience, a catalyst to boost his training much harder and more focused that will lead to the final sport output, which For now, the only thing that has a sports movie is that the protagonists do not have to win in the climax of the film, we just have to understand the meaning and meaning of their effort. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film has all the character development of an old Seagal movie. The good guys are the good ones because they're supposed to be, and the bad guys are the nasty white swimmers who laugh and tease and make racist jokes on our team. Oh, and there's a scene where one of the whites kicks one of the blacks underwater while he's in the middle of a race. I did not know it was really possible to kick someone underwater that way, but you have the idea of ​​how deep the development of the character is. <br /> <br /> We understand that this is the group of children Jim Ellis converted to. from children who walk the streets doing nothing with their lives to an organized and competitive team of swimmers, but apart from that, we can not really know who they are. <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that the only real claims made by the film are that effort and organization lead to success and that racism is bad. Both are so obvious that when a movie is made with them alone, it feels empty and unnecessary. Racism was much more powerful in the United States in the 1970s that feels like a huge loss that the film dealt directly with that issue but it really did not say anything about it. It's kind of a movie to feel good, but when it's over and you realize how much I should have said it is much bigger than what I said, the feeling of feeling good turns into a sad disappointment.
