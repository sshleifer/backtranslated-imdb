I saw this at Sundance, and I can not understand why it won the management award. It was painfully slow and literally colorless. It is the kind of film that only filmmakers of the film festival appreciate, who think that any movie that many people like must be under them. <br /> <br /> This year's Sundance jury seems to be making a conscious effort to reward the weakest, very low budget films. That's fine, but this wandering and dragged mess looks like a home movie. The mini-DV photo in a snowy gray winter results in a monotonous look for a monotone movie. <br /> <br /> Certain motives (snakes) are killed to blows even though they do not add anything to the story and do not make sense as symbols. <br /> <br /> Now, not everything was bad. Vera Farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. She will go places, and she deserves it. His co-star Hugh Dillon also does a good job. Frankly, there are many good times in this movie, but they just do not fit very well.
