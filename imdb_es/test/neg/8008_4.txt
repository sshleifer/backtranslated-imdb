I think saying that this movie has too many is not what makes this movie bad. The turns are not the problem of the movie. The story is quite intelligent and could have been very good if filmed correctly. The main problem that everyone complains about turns in the movie is that the film is not fascinating enough for people to follow. The movie is badly shot (at least compared to its brother genre, Lock, Stock). Worse still: the characters are (although they are often well acted) simply flat. The characters do not have enough time to be presented well enough to allow the viewer to get involved with only one of them, much less to understand them. Oh, and the locations are just terrible: person-locations (I did not bother to see the credits by name): get another job (maybe photography or interior design)
