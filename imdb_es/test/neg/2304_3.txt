It's a nice idea that Dionne Warwick makes the voices of the song for this adaptation film from Jacqueline Susann's best-selling book (to the "Valley of the Dolls") ... although it's really a shame that this sudser does not have Neely O'Hara of Patty Duke to nail the story. "The love machine" is undoubtedly boring. Even the final fight (with an Academy Award as a fight support) can not save him. Dyan Cannon seems embalmed in his heavy pancake makeup and his uncomfortable fall (although his small tanned figure is a beauty to behold), John Phillip Law is a block of wood at the top, David Hemmings embarrassing in gay mode as an extravagant photographer . And where is Robin Stone walking at the end? Are you walking to the coast to pick up some sailors? After Cannon deflated his masculinity, it would be a safe bet. In that case, "Love Machine - The Final Episode" could have been a more interesting movie. Certainly it is better than this snooze-opera that induces yawns. * 1/2 of ****
