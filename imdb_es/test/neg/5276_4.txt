The German regional broadcasting station WDR has shown "The General" and ODC. On Saturday I saw "The General" and I thought it was not very bad, but not very good either. But yesterday I saw ODC and I turned it off after about an hour. Although Kevin Spacey was the main actor, the film was totally confusing and seems restless. "The general" told the story directly and orderly, but ODC just wanted to be cool. There is a reference in Guy Ritchie's films "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch", but it does not have the freshness of these films. <br /> <br /> Then, in the end, I would rate it 3 out of 10!
