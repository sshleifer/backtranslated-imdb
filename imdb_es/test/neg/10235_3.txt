Carole Lombard stars in this film of the transition period. This film is a typical example of a very early "talkie" (the first practical sound movie was "The Jazz Singer", 1927). In general, the acting in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic. <br /> <br /> The viewer can easily notice that the actors are still "acting" for a silent film, and this combined with the excessively pronounced, overly serious dialogue (seems more likely than a diction-elocution-drama coach has been used extensively to teach the "silent" actors to speak), creates some pretty funny scenes that were not meant to be comical. <br /> <Later, Carole Lombard's great acting ability is almost unrecognizable beneath all the broad gestures, the melodrama and the fervent yearning. <br /> <br /> Mainly interesting as a historical curiosity of the time, and for his completely involuntary comedy. value of the camp.
