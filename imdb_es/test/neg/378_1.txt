I love the first and the third Beast Masters, but this was an abomination. It was almost as horrible as 'The Never Ending Story 3', for the same reasons. They took a fascinating fantasy world of barbarian tribes, farming peoples, witches, supernatural creatures and a cult of religious fanatics using a pyramid; and I thought it would be fun to mix in our materialist world of rock & roll pop culture, sushi (I think that's what it was) and flashy sports cars. These two worlds do not belong together. I do not want to see a group of old barbarians dancing a rock song on the car radio. I have a sense of humor, but this is stupid. This is what Hollywood does with good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas. However, do not give up, the Braxus Eye is much, much better. I gave him a 10. Este, Portal of Time, I give him a 1. Believe me, I do not always give him such high or low grades. I only tend to comment on just those movies.
