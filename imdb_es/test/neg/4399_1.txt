National Lampoon's Dorm Daze is easily the worst movie I've seen, and I've seen the film Kazaam. Anyone who reads this and thinks that this movie was good in any way, shape or form has no idea what a good movie is, and should never watch another movie because they are really so stupid. <br /> <br /> It's hard to name everything that is wrong with this movie. First of all, the plot is everywhere and all the multiple "misunderstandings" can not follow very well. The acting is horrible to say the least, and everything was badly done. Anyone and everyone who worked on this film should not be in another movie of any child. Never again! <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to summarize this movie in only a paragraph or two, because it is very bad, but for anyone reading this please, DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE! If you want to see a good movie, turn on anything else on TV. Even the USA UU They have better movies than this one. <br /> <br /> _friend.
