I took the opportunity to see if maybe a good movie of the First World War had escaped me, is not this. John Phillip Law and Don Stroud are rigid in their acting and moody for their roles. The dialogue is silent or non-existent; The flight sequences are fine but they are quite repetitive. Compared to the fantastic "Blue Max", this movie should never have been made. Look at George Peppard, James Mason, and Usula Andress at the WB and you will see why this movie is one of the best war movies that have been made and this is not. Recently released on DVD Richtofen and Brown is presented as a great 'lost classic' of the 70s, I resold mine the day after I bought it. Do not waste your time or $.
