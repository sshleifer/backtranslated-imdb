The great theme, the director and the cast somehow add up to a truly abysmal film, told in that flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular at the time this movie was made. (And hello, this is NOT a black cinema!) The disheveled, overly complicated and overpopulated story has no arc, no focus point, little emotion and it wobbles from one scene to another without any discernible purpose, except as Valentine's Day to the alleged and highly dubious cooperation between the governments of the United States and Mexico on the issue of illegal immigration. <br /> <br /> The scene that made me HATE of this movie is when Montalban and Mitchell escape their captors, run to save Montalban's wounded companion from being killed by a thug with a gun that handles a piece of farm Machinery, Montalban says something like "fast, we should try to save it", but instead, they lie face down and watch in agony for about 5 (!) Minutes of screen time while the machine stops over Murphy and FINALLY run over (or we assume, the machine simply stops, another thug detects the presence of the two "rescuers" and shoots them when they run again). The scene ends. Everything is terribly filmed and it is absolutely anticlimactic. There is nothing worse than a protagonist (apparently, Montalban, although he is off screen for more than half the movie) that he does not even try. My God, Ricardo, do SOMETHING! <br /> <br /> I know it's Anthony Mann, but hell, not ALL of his movies are classics, people. How bad does an old movie have to be to get something lower than a rating of 6?
