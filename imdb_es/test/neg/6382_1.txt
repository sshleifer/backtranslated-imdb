I got this movie from the library and saw that I had many actors that I like (John Cleese, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, etc.), so I got it and saw it. I expected Cleese to have a great role since I had the first billing, I was surprised to discover that I had about five minutes of screen time, along with all the others that I liked. This movie is incredibly useless, the characters are nobody, the plot does not exist and the end is one of the worst endings I've seen. There were some funny parts, but that's it. Stay away from this movie if you want to avoid "What?" and "huh?", a lot. And if you do not want to waste your time. Ignore people who say that this is a very funny movie ... it is not. Just stay away from it at all costs ... please.
