This program can be described more accurately as TV Bubble-Gum: it is chewable, tastes good and lasts a long time. But, like Bubble-Gum, it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after too many chews. <br /> <br /> This program presents very simple questions that take the form of simple games, like Hangman, guessing a simple phrase or divination elements in a short list. The callers are the contestants, and anyone can play. <br /> <br /> However, the questions are terribly easy. There is some techno music pumped into the background that forms in a continuous loop. He never seems to grow old, but he never adds much to the show anyway. However, the hostess, no matter what, is extremely nice, pleasant enough to look at and can make some very funny facial expressions. I prefer to enjoy that British woman. <br /> <br /> But there's nothing in this show. It is simplistic and unconvincing, although it can be entertaining if there is nothing else.
