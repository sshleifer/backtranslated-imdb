This movie is number 1 in the list of the worst movies I've seen, with "Lessons for a murderer" in the number 2 place. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible (sorry, Sandra Bullock, but even your performance was horrible!), the musical score could come from a bad movie with an x ​​rating and the story was downright ridiculous. It had this in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one-syllable words. But contrary to the average action movie, there was no real action on it. Boring. <br /> <br /> The only reason I kept seeing it was with the hope that at some point, there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Thumbs down on this case.
