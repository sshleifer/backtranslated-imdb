A woman in love with her husband (is suicidal) decides to have a baby to save her life. She has been in a fertility clinic, just like the lover she takes, so they both know how artificial insemination works; But, instead of using the method that thousands of people use every year around the world (the $ 5 turkey collector), they engage in intercourse. We must also believe that while the immigrant is in love with his girlfriend, he does not suggest the obvious alternative to coitus. In addition, although it is a commercial agreement, the first time you are with your sperm donor, you remove all your clothes, as if it were a seduction. Also, your husband does not realize when there is $ 30,000 left from his bank accounts. Does all this seem to require a more willing suspension of disbelief than even most Hollywood rates? Far in all aspects.
