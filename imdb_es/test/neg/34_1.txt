Jacqueline Hyde starts like any other normal day for individual telemarketing Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) dismisses her for answering personal calls at work, however, not all is bad news, as the call What he received was from a lawyer informing him that his grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) has recently died and that he left his mansion and fortune (why do not things happen to me like that? Very excited, Jackie goes there and feels at home, while looking for the thermostat late at night, Jackie is in a secret room where her grandfather keeps the bright red formula he invented, which allows whoever drinks it change your appearance. Being a bit clumsy, Jackie finally complies with the glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz), however, Jackie's best alter ego begins to take control ... <br /> <br /> Written, co-produced and directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought that Jacqueline Hyde was complete and absolute from the beginning to the end and is as simple and direct as that. According to the opening credits, Jacqueline Hyde was "inspired" by Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel "The Odd Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", frankly, if Mr. Stevenson could see what was being done with your story here, turn in your grave. For starters, I think that Jacqueline Hyde was / is destined to be a horror movie, the IMDb certainly mentions it as such, but there is no horror in it, apart from how bad it is. I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more a soft porn than anything else and extremely domesticated by that, why sit down and watch this softer porn crap when you can see your own hard core that really offers the goods? Wow, that's the question I ask here. Porn is not even good, besides being too soft, it's boring, boring and sex scenes that are not worthwhile are few and far between. The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title that would have been quite intelligent if it were not for the fact that another film used the title of Jacqueline Hyde (1998) during the last century and, judging by the summary of the plot of IMDb , hell sounds better than this piece of garbage. This is one of those movies that you must see to see how bad it is, but I just hope you never have the chance. <br /> <br /> Director Kanefsky was obviously working with a low budget, but that's not an excuse. These days, filmed on a digital camcorder, the movie seems cheap and the few cases of CGI seem to come from a Nintendo Gameboy. The last "shocking" turn probably has the worst moderation effect I've seen and it's pretty good for a laugh like the scene when Jackie's breasts grow through a more terrible CGI. That's another thing, the movie is taken too seriously. The theme sucks, it's too predictable and it turns into a bad movie, but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with a dirty conversation about pornography, the movie could have been more fun to watch, but it's not like that. Forget about any horror, violence or decent gore, because in the end there is nothing apart from a surprising decapitation without blood. <br /> <br /> Technically, Jacqueline Hyde is a kind of home-made film, photography is of the flat hand. The variety of points and shots, music, production design and special effects are of a suitable standard to fit the script. The acting was horrible, seriously, this is bad. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Hyde, in my opinion, a lot of garbage, there is nothing positive about this turgid movie you can think of. Any lover of the movie will have an almost impossible time trying to find some redeeming value in this shit, definitely one to avoid.
