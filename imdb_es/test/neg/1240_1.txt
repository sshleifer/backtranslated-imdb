Did the writers pay people to come here and write positive comments? I mean, really, it's a bit trite, and Spike is not that funny. He looks more like a serious guy who tries too hard to be funny. There are so many mediocre concerts in this show; as once, the opening sketch was "Interview program, applied directly to the forehead", over and over again. And another one that showed Spike and another guy who used drugs, and it was not even funny. They did not even do anything but sit and laugh, over and over again. LOL! And another that showed Spike talking to a Korean boy who ate duck and told him he had a pet duck. LOL! I mean, really, Spike only receives funny guests on his show, that's why people like this program.
