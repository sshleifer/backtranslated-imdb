What a disappointment! I have enjoyed Jon Cleary's books about Scobie Malone, but there is little resemblance between him and the Malone cinematic. In the books, he is a city detective, who is dedicated to his wife and does not get involved in fights. For the movie, the character has been seasoned, in an Outback Copper who uses his fists and is not averse to getting into bed with a beautiful girl, although what she and the other sexual interest of the film see in him I do not know . ; Taylor was 39 years old at the time and his face was swelling. <br /> <br /> But the resistance of his character is remarkable; he flies from Australia, apparently goes directly to the Commissioner's house (he is trying to arrest him imprudently during a black tie reception), saves him from the murder (engaging in a fight in the process), goes to a casino with a girl, leaves with another and takes her to bed. So much for jet lag! On the way back to the Commissioner's house (which shows a good knowledge of the back streets of London), the wicked hit him, but he's still below breakfast! It is also remarkable that the commissioner's limousine miraculously repaired the windshield and headlights within minutes of the assassination attempt and that a character has a touching faith in the precise timing of a pump activated by the clock. <br /> <br /> The best is the disdain of Joseph the Butler for the rude Malone. And at least the film avoids being a London traveler, although some scenes take place during Wimbledon tennis week.
