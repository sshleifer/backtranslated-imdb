Anyone who qualifies this film above 3 has a very distorted view of the films, anyone who has rated this piece of sh! T 7 or higher, I have absolutely no respect for your taste in the movies, and I doubt that you have ever seen a good one. I am always willing to give any film a chance and I did it with this one. I tried to pay attention. I tried not to let my money go to waste, but 15 minutes in my friends laughed at me because I listened to 2 my iPod. , 25 minutes later, I could not even see the overacting that was happening inside the movie, so I got up and left, I never left a movie, until this crap, anyone who said they enjoyed it is a liar, or they should be expelled from this site. I get so angry when I see that a person qualifies this with an 8 when the general rating of the Godparents is a 9.1 is like saying that the movie was close, but it is not.
