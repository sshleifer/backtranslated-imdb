This soap is worse than bad: it is poisonous. Of the many television programs that have had a corrosive influence on British society over the past twenty years, Eastenders is the best example. For two decades, this show has celebrated the oaf, the hooligan, the wide boy, the cake, the bumblebee, the violent, the sexual incontinent, the criminal, the ignorant, the non-ambitious ... <br /> <br / > How many times has someone or another said that Eastenders "reflects life"? Life on what planet, exactly? <br /> <br /> It is written about "working class" characters, as imagined by middle-class people who have taken a creative writing course. Eager to show their middle class classmates how familiar they are with the "working class", they dream of the agglomeration of Eastenders citizenship. <br /> <br /> This has a toxic effect on some minds less well equipped than others to handle fiction, so we find members of the real population who take on the attitudes and behavior of the Walford people. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it happened that Eastenders reflects life; but only after life had become a mirror of Eastenders. <br /> <br /> Other soaps followed in the footsteps of EE, filled to their stinking whale with ugly, potato-faced, shaved-headed, and pot-bellied characters, frowning at each other and issuing threats constantly. This is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this garbage. The writers will be enriched with the product of that production and will continue to enjoy the best things of life in their rarefied enclaves. Meanwhile, the growing number of new drones induced by television will inexorably move towards cultural bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> And there are the new priests and the new creatures of the beginning of the 21st century. Much of this is due to the immeasurable power of the illuminated pixel box dancing in the corner of your living room. It's your fault, kind reader: that's what you chose as the only window through which to look from your prison.
