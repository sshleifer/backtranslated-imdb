I saw this movie at a party, we were very disconcerted by the end, it ended up quite poor. Even though the whole movie is not too surprising, I expected something a little better. This movie is trash, but I suggest you see it if you find cheap horror movies with a weak script, quite funny. Personally, I loved the announcement, it was my highlight in general, the fight scenes were basic, a shot of a knife, some shadows in a window, fake blood. I must say that the grandmother's costume was quite scary. This movie is a mixture of slaughter, camp blood and creek boggy creek 2, except that this film has a camera effect and a slightly better color treatment than camp blood.
