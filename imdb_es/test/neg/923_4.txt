As a newcomer to Curb Your Enthusiasm, which prompted me to watch all the episodes of the season, I expected more, much more from Jeff's efforts. <br /> <br /> When I watch a movie that offers a portion of an average "Joe's" life I need reasons to be interested, caring, feeling and believing. And with Jeff Garlin at the helm, he also expected a lot of brilliant comic moments. This movie failed me again and again. <br /> <br /> Jeff makes his living with mom, a sad sack that is a social disaster. He has not had a relationship, real or even casual, for many years. He seems to be almost unemployed and, as noted, lives with his dearest mom. Can they make things worse? Of course. In a short time, he is fired by all those around him, including Silverman, Second City (his comedy workshop) and his agent. All reinforce their status as 'loser'. Silverman's "greasy" experiment was as cruel as it was absurd. His obsession with the role of "Marty", as the means of salvation of his career, also reaches a great dead end. <br /> <br /> While the last moments of the film offer a glimpse of the best things to come in the film journey, although unfortunately some golden flashes were missing.
