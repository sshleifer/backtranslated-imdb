Let me see ... I've seen all the movies that Lou Ferrigno has made. I've seen Batman and Robin ... twice. I've memorized the dances in Breakin '2: Electric Boogaloo ... I've seen unfinished scam student movies from Blade Runner ... however, this movie is the most painful thing I've seen. <br /> <br /> This was the first film for the "direct market to video". So you can thank Blood Cult for all those mysterious Michael Dudikoff movies in your local Blockbuster. You should know that this is not a high quality video. This is degree of consumption. This is your father's video camera that he never uses. This is what you have to watch for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will not bore you with the details of the plot since I am only dreaming of thinking about it, but I will tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. I only see this movie when I'm angry with myself. So I recommend this movie if you are suicidal, or if you face a big challenge. <br /> <br /> If you rent this movie (God, have mercy) you will know what you are in. first 10 minutes This is when you hit the usual intro of the horror movie. You already know what to do. There is a lot of suspense and it accumulates before a girl dies. Yes, you have seen it before, but not like that. This is the most boring introduction I've seen. Honestly, I think you could take out an eBay camera for ten dollars, pick up the lazy one that smells the most of gin and candy, and tell him to film your mother cooking dinner and it would be more interesting than this introduction. I got bored to tears. I cried like a baby. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes this film so incredibly painful are its actors. Yes, I have seen bad performance. TRUST ME. I have seen Oliver Twist's fourth grade productions with a more realistic dialogue. The main actor makes me sick. The actress "of support" is a train collision of a human. <br /> <br /> I'm not even going to comment on the boyfriend. True horror. <br /> <br /> Then, rent this movie if you can find it. You will never be more depressed than you spent $ 3 on something else.
