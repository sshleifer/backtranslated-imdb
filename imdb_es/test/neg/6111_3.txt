Somehow, for some years I could not see this movie, although it has been quite successful and has generated many discussions in Israel. I'm sorry I did not postpone it indefinitely when I saw it. <br /> <br /> The theme of 'Kadosh' is very real and painful for those who know the Jewish religious world: the place of women in the Orthodox family and society. The basic situation that is based on the premises of the film is possible, the problem is that the way in which it is presented to the screen and the "solution" that the conflicts described in the film receive is incorrect. Gitai does not seem to have much sympathy for men in the religious world, but his approach to choosing characters who are fanatical or who can not express his human feeling makes the whole story seem simplistic. Nor is it a much better service for its female characters, although here at least it shows more sympathy and also enjoys the participation of two beautiful and talented actresses in Yael Abecassis and Meital Barda. In general, Gitai's vision is too partial, his film media are too basic, he focuses on the technical details of Jewish religious life, which may be interesting for people who do not know them but who are not really relevant at all. in the context of the complete story. Starting from interesting premises, what we get here is a boring movie that seems longer than it is, with a very static way of acting, an obsessive use of music that plays in the same record, not only from a musical perspective but also emotional. Final very inconclusive if not even confusing. What difference between this film and 'Ha Ushpizin' was inspired and described the same social landscape and managed to convey human feelings on the screen? In 'Kadosh' there is very little cinema and very few human emotions.
