I did not expect much when I went out to see this, but my God, what a disappointment. The original was quite funny within its genre, but this is so bad that I felt abused when I left the theater. There is no plot, it is not funny, it is not pleasant to see, it is totally embarrassing. After an hour, I hoped that my patience would be rewarded, but now I regret not having left the theater. Do yourself a favor and ignore this, look at it when it comes to the small screen. Or watch it on an affordable DVD, whatever you do, do not waste money on it. Do not say I did not warn you.
