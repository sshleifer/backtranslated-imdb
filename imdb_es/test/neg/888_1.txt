I have seen many bad movies in my life. Appointment at the cinema. That was bad. But this ... this is just ... it's not good. House Party 4 is the worst movie in history. It's as simple as that. It's basically Ferris Bueller with black people. Oh, and it's not funny. It is awful. So frightening Chris Stokes can be a superstar in BET, but he's an idiot. He can not write a comedy. Or a horror movie. I like to refer to him as a more black and less known Uwe Boll. Except that Uwe Boll's movies are terribly horrible, if you know what I mean. You can invite some friends, pop in Alone In The Dark and have a good time laughing and eating sandwiches with your friends. Chris Stokes is like that, except that if you invite your friends to see House Party 4 with you, nobody will laugh. Not even the black man token biased or the illiterate athlete. Seriously, I did not laugh once in this whole movie. The acting is terrible, and the movie seems like a bad independent movie. What was the budget for this movie? 5 damn dollars? I mean, what the hell? This movie just sucks; Do not waste your time with this shit. It's disgusting.
