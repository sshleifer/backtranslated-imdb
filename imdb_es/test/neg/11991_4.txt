One of Bolls' best attempts. It only shows that if you do something long enough, you should improve only by chance. It's still not good, but at least it's visible, which is an improvement over the blood. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry is that Farcry's story was not the strong point of the games, while Bloodrayne had a solid story and, therefore, Boll had more opportunities to ruin it. <br /> <br /> The action on this The movie is pretty good. Occasionally, an exaggerated touch, but in a good way and it's worth seeing for that alone. <br /> <br /> Acting wisely, it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good, but you can say they do not take it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. But the lighter mood that this gives the movie really helps. <br /> <br /> Although I think being closer to the history of the game could have contributed to a slightly better movie, the changes made are quite practical and not big enough to make a difference especially considering that the The plot of the game was just an Oscar that won only one vehicle for the FPS kill. I would have liked it to be in the jungle, since it was a fairly integral part of the game, but Canada does not have much jungle and at least it is in a kind of tropical forest. <br /> <br /> Why? Boll feels the need to change the game plots directed and guided professionally that I do not know but he does. And until you start letting the source material speak through your adaptations, it will always be missing. See the movie to laugh, it's good for that and maybe to see it during a party as a forage for a party.
