Lame. Lame. Lame. Ultralame. I keep going? There is one, I repeat * a * funny scene in this special, extensive, anti-fun Amateur Hour Special of a movie: the fat father of Fares Fares hitting someone with his beer belly. That's. The rest of this amazing and mediocre pile of nothing consists of the usual boring-looking Swedish "actors" who provide a dialogue that goes through one ear and on the other, a banal story, a sloppy direction and, well, little more than worth It's worth mentioning. The nuptial cast of Fares Fares is as charismatic as an authorized accountant and his nose rivals even that of Adrien Brody in terms of absolute ridicule. Torkel Petersson should only work with Lasse Spang Olsen. The rest of the cast is, fortunately, easily forgettable, while the giant titanic nose of Fares will always chase me in my dreams. <br /> <br /> Josef Fares helps ruin Swedish cinema. Do not support him or his nonsense. Jalla Jalla is for the comedies what Arnold Schwarzenegger is for the performance of characters, Kopps would have been much more respectable if it had been a Youtube video without a budget, and Zozo was simply the most presumptuous and pseudo-trash trashed by a Swedish director. Wake up and smell the roses: Swedish films can be much better than this, so stop pretending that it's worth watching Fares films simply because they are "good for being Swedish". Please.
