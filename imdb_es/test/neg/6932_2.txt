I can only guess that this movie was an experiment that failed. Years before, images accompanied by music would have moved. Later, it would have been sound added to silences. Eventually it would have been Technicolor, Cinemascope or Imax. This movie must have been a wrong attempt to introduce a new element in the spoken image. During all the emotional scenes, the character stops in the middle of the dialogue and his inner thoughts are narrated while they look towards the distance or appeal to the camera. This interruption is painful at least. Imagine these top-level actors trying to look busy while the narration continues. Painful. I have no idea who this trick came up with, but it was the only time I saw it used, and for good reason. In each scene, the actors were forced to roll their eyes, wring their hands or act excessively to such an extent that I really wondered if this was really a comedy. <br /> <br /> The story is a hopeless telenovela that takes place over a couple of generations. Norma Shearer, disappointed in love, looks for a reason to live. She has a friend, played by Ralph Morgan, who loves her, but she takes it for granted. She is attracted to a doctor, played by Clark Gable, but he is absorbed in himself and is not interested in her. She is content with a weakling who desperately needs her. She marries him only to discover that there is madness in his family and that he will never be able to have a child with him. Along the way comes the doctor who, selfishly, puts a bun in his oven, but then discovers that he loves her. The girl creates confidence in her husband, who becomes a success, but realizes that he really loves Clark, after all. Confused already? Forget the rest, just watch a couple of episodes of "As The World Turns" and everything will become clear. <br /> <br /> If you are ever forced to watch this movie, wait for the final scene. The turns of the actors embarrassed Harold Lloyd. You can not miss it.
