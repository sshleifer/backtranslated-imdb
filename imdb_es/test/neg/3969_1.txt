SLOOOOOOOW, lukewarm, poorly produced in the 70s, Schlocker caused Moore to be convinced of the headlines of today; however, this film is worthy of stinking due to its unconvincing performance, its lack of direction and the silly clothes of the 70s (unfortunately, MooCow remembers when the Adidas clothes were fashionable). This has the same feeling as some of the best sci-fi moovies of the 70s, like "WestWorld" and "Logan's Run." While the premise is interesting (rich people are cloned to maintain a supply of body parts to keep them alive theoretically forever), the film makes the mistake of saddling us with Richard (Tim Donnelly), a clone that is both boring and irritating. . The hollow performance of Donnelly does not help, but it fits perfectly with the rest of the cast. Even B illuminators like Dick Sargent ("Bewitched", "Ghost with 1,000,000 Eyes"), Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "The Dark", "Laserblast") and Peter Graves ("Beginning of the End", "Killers from Space "," Conquered the World ") provide only the warmest and warmest performances. Produced, directed and edited by a group of nobodies, it is not surprising that "Clonus" does not horrify anyone in the least, much less, keep everyone's attention! Truth be told, there is nothing in the weak film that even schlock fans would like to see some really bad and funny movies from the 70s, played by Greydon Clark. "Clonus" is not an advantage; MooCow says even the MST3K version is already a yawn, so take the risk at your own risk !: = 8P
