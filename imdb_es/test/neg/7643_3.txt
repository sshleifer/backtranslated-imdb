Sayles had a very interesting film with Silver City in her hands, however, somehow it became very confusing as she went from beginning to end. Chris Cooper did an exceptional job in embodying the essence of his character, a kind of Dubya, but they almost did not give him enough screen time. Instead, we found ourselves in an uproar with a character who felt less personal, less developed and, in general, too confused. The road that Danny Huston takes us, inevitably, becomes the fall of the film. Too many characters are presented to us in such a short time. These characters were randomly involved with the progression of the plot, which became too complicated with every minute that passed. Sayles knew what she was creating, I feel that she was not translating well to the silver screen. <br /> <br /> Sayles is a master of his trade. His films continue to inspire and evoke thought even if they are not commercial successes. The problem with Silver City is that I think it was too deep and I did not have enough money or time to explain it. At the beginning of the movie, I had an idea of ​​what was going on, but as more and more characters were introduced, as more and more plot twists tried to happen, I lost the meaning of the movie at the end. Although the ending was very intelligent and very dark, I needed more explanation. I think part of the reason why I lost the train of my thoughts with this movie was due to the casting of Danny Huston as our guide. It was pathetic. I did not see him as a very exciting person to guide us in this adventure. It seemed to go through the motions, but in reality it did not achieve much. This was the first fall of the important Sayles film. <br /> <br /> Although I will admit that the characters played by Richard Dreyfuss, Miguel Ferrer, James Gammon and Daryl Hannah were interesting, I just needed a better guide to help me understand their roles in this political scandal. Danny Huston did not cut it. Outside of the characters, Sayles needed a stronger script. Sometimes I felt that unless I was deeply rooted in the political world, some of the references were far above my head. All the reasoning for Silver City to be built and the corruption behind it eluded me. I'm a simpleton who loves advanced movies, but this did not make much sense to me. There were several times that I asked myself, "Why", instead of seeing the whole picture. I felt as if individual stories were as clear as glass, but at the same time the whole image was dusty and murky. Sayles needed to concentrate more on the larger image instead of these smaller problems, which ultimately marred this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I entered this movie with the wrong idea. I expected to see another version of Primary Colors, but instead I witnessed something less sincere and more technical. Without leaving aside the end, I thought that the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in the history of political cinema. The brilliant symbolism has remained in my mind for the last two days after watching this movie, while the rest of the film quickly disappeared from my mind. Maybe a second visit would be better for me, but for some strange reason, Silver City just did not click with me. There seemed to be too many gaps that were never explained or explained. A piece of set is always good to me, but when the characters are presented without explanation, it simply loses strength. This was one of those rare occasions. <br /> <br /> In general, I was very upset with this movie. Being very democrat, I wanted to see one side of politics that I was not aware of and another side that would make you laugh. I wanted to be swallowed up with the corporate money world and the dufus that are elected. I wanted an intelligent humor framed by the words of George W., but instead, everything I found was a very confusing story directed to a certain audience of which I will never be a part. Sad, this photo had a very wasted promise. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of *****
