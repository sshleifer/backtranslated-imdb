I saw this movie at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. His reputation had preceded him, and although all my friends were also of legal age, only I had the courage to enter the video store and rent them. We met in a house where parents had left the city during the weekend. Although we sit very close to each other, we do not speak or acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film deserved and did not deserve the anticipatory shame we feel. He did not disappoint in terms of totally free content, but he disappointed in all other aspects. <br /> <br /> Caligula tries to transcend the genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn movie. It fails miserably in its ambition, subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds. The obvious selling point of the film is its pornographic appearance, and in fact it provides much more than its share of real graphic sex. But by establishing this sex in the context of the depraved reign of Caligula, dignifies the act even less than the average adult film. Sex without context could at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even consent are absent in much of Caligula's world. In it, sex, in the best of cases, serves as an idle hobby and, at worst, as an instrument of sadistic domination. Nowadays, it is common to hear words like "sin" and "depravity", which are used facetically to describe acts that are pleasant and that are considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. Caligula takes the spectator beyond sympathy to represent true depravity and to show that there is no joy or pleasure. <br /> <br /> The historical parts not only fail to contextualize sex significantly, they do not entertain, enlighten, intrigue, or interest the viewer in any way. They only provide long stretches of constant tedium. Rarely has a movie been so boring. Sex, after the initial shock and astonishment fade, only contributes to the general monotony of the image. <br /> <br /> In the discussions of this film it is rarely about violence. While many movies have been made more violent than Caligula, few can rival in terms of the shock value of their violence. Apparently, relentless barbarism as well as hyper-depraved sexuality characterized the condition of Emperor of Caligula. Violence is even less for those who are weaker in heart than for sex. <br /> <br /> A review like this will probably generate as much curiosity as it does. I understand why someone would want to see this movie; After all, I succumbed to the same curiosity. I simply hope that my review, by clearly describing its lack of redemptive value, will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not. The criminal justice professor at my high school described police work as "hours of boredom interrupted by moments of sheer terror." This statement perfectly describes Caligula. You have been warned.
