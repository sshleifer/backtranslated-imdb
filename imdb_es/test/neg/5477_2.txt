This must have been a gritty, gritty film that remained in the memory as an exposition of a relationship where the dominant personality only survives because the personality that is being dominated has no hope of change. Skillful, the dialogue worked but the film was irritatingly ineffective: too many remote shots suggesting a lack of focus instead of a larger image. Poor flow. The first 5 minutes could have been completely lost. <br /> <br /> I suspect that, with a different edition, this movie could have been convincing. <br /> <br /> In its current form it is flat. Without form and tremendously disappointing.
