My friends and I have just seen a preview of this new Australian movie. Everyone who was in the cinema agreed, what was the point of this movie? There was not a good story to follow, the characters were underdeveloped and the plot seemed unmotivated. I find it strange that this movie, which probably cost millions of dollars, was financed and made. It does not serve the dramatic community at all, it adds nothing to the palette of Australian cinema. It really was a waste of time creating this funny impassive work and more time should really be spent on buying scripts and creating good stories, not creating a disaster like this. Hugo Weaving and Rose Byrne were fine, but severely hampered by a bad script. The character of Pia Miranda was unnecessary and abstract of the plot, and his lines were average at best. A real waste of talent. Salvation was the cinematography of Geoffrey Simpson ACS, who, like most Australian films, was excellent. <br /> <br /> Come on, guys, think about it next time, please. <br /> <br /> 4/10
