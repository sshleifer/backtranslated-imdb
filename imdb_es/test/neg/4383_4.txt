When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I just started taking out all your old movies on video so you can see them through the eyes of an adult. I remember that I really liked this one in particular, and I thought it was one of the best. Now that I am a little older, I can say that although it is quite normal, I still consider it one of his best movies. In a stretch of performance for him, Norris plays a policeman harassed for his part in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie. Serial Killers is fashionable nowadays, and people would like to think of them as an invention of the 90s. In contrast, it is good to see where the current, most obvious infatuation of action movies has arisen (as well as from Stalk N 'Slashers) of the 70s and 80s. While Norris' attempts at both humor and any form of human compassion are ridiculous and ridiculous, no one could kick someone in the head like Chuck. Besides being a big fan of Steve James, I can recommend this movie, the same for the legend of the genre Billy Drago, as well as to see Mitch of The Blue Brothers in a supporting role. It's not great, but it's better than everything Norris did in the 90s.
