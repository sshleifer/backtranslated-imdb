I would label this show as horrible if it were not for the fact that it is on the same network as Arrested Development. Because it is on FOX and it is renewed while AD is canceled. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely beyond the words how atrocious this show is. But let me try and describe it. Take an extremely low rate Archie Bunker and ask him to emit a humor that would have been out of date if he had married Children. Then, take excellent lines of the plot of AD (the son has an ugly and boring girlfriend) and wet them so that the idiots who see comic books can understand them. <br /> <br /> If you look at this, I will have completely lost respect for you, just like your family. However, if you are a fan, you will love the new FOX comedy 'Til Death'. It seems like something really fun, cutting edge. I mean, married couples do not get along ... bright.
