This is the second adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol for the screen: the first was "The Rupture" (1970) (from the novel "The Balloon Man") and it is really a pity that no one cares. He's Chabrol's sleeper, and I urge any of his fans to see him. <br /> <br /> "The chocolate cobweb" was not such a strong detective story. I read it 20 years ago and I forgot everything. The movie promises something. good things at first, then, finally, disappoint completely. This is a confusing film by Chabrol, which combines elements of the apogee (around 1969), and a lot of things that are learned from the eighties, such as "poulet". au vinaigre ", is not a particularly memorable job. <br /> <br /> Part of the disappointment comes from the cast: this is a terribly poor meeting: Jacques Dutronc plays like a zombie, Isabelle Huppert reveals herself as an actress something limited, finally, quite vulgar, it worked in "une affaire de femme", not here, not supported by the young couple: b Others are bland and not at all flashy actors of the past, for example, Stephane Audran or Michel Bouquet (both in "the break") were brilliant and contributed to the unique atmosphere of Chabrol. <br /> <br /> The story itself is not distinguished: Starting as a kind of "serious" "la vie est un long fleuve tranquille tranquill "(in addition, a character insinuates Etienne Chatilliez's very funny film), the film continues as a ridiculous psychological drama afterwards.We will not congratulate the young female pianist, who, after all she learned about her evil hostess, accepted to drive a car on a dangerous road. <br /> <br /> Because he makes too many movies, Chabrol often throws turkeys. One wonders why people want. to see one of his films, he should choose this one among all his things at stake. <br /> <br /> It seems that Chabrol's bourgeois satire has finally given way to indulgence. In "la rupture", the first adaptation of Armstrong, an average detective story that Chabrol fully transcended-, you should Ar Arran says "They have so much money!". Here, Chabrol has lost his bite, his strength.
