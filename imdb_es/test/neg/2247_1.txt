I was debating between this film and 2012, but I chose Inglourious Basterds because of its amazing IMDb rating. I must say now, what a disappointment. I expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence, but I also expected many witty dialogues. I received a large dose of the former, but not enough of the latter. I felt dejected. The relationship between violence and the plot is very important and I think that this film is completely wrong. And the plot? It's that credible or really so entertaining either. Save your time and money. I can not believe what this classification says for the bloody and violent tastes of the modern masses.
