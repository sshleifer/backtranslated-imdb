Now, let me see if I have this right, a lunatic serial killer is out there murdering real estate agents ... well ... what's wrong with that scenario? I can live with that. <br /> <br /> What? Next, a killer with tax inspectors massacred? Traffic guards cut to death? Are we supposed to feel sympathy for property people obsessed with money, with empty heads and shallow heads? Er ... no. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, joking aside, it's not a very well made movie with bad acting and raw effects, the climate scene is particularly silly. You can almost see the director shouting, 'action' towards the double as it falls through the windowpane. <br /> <br /> As another critic said, after starring in 'The Fog', this was the Nadir of Adrienne Barbeau's career. So, I was glad to see that she had rekindled it by becoming the voice of Catwoman in the animated series of Batman, while watching the extras of the live action film Catwoman. NB: it's not the horrible movie that's been made, by the way. <br /> <br /> However, this is a bad movie, think of a bad episode of 'Kojak' or 'Streets of San Francisco', and you'll have an idea of ​​what is offered here.
