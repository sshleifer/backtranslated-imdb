This starts interestingly, since there is a carnival right next to someone's house with an oil rig and a kind of church across from the store across the street with a neon sign "Jesus saves", all in a small area ... Now, that's pretty dazzling, though unlikely ... and then we get into the movie that leads improbably to new levels. Of course, this is a remake of the 1979 thriller starring Carol Kane as nanny Jill Johnson ... now Jill is a girl who ran minutes from her cell phone so high that her evil parents are punishing her by doing her job . Probably something that the audience that this film addresses can be identified. Jill is taken to this huge and elegant house on a lake in the middle of nowhere (of course) by her dad to take care of the Mandrakis family. The children are already snuggled up comfortably in their beds when Jill arrives, and the housekeeper is still there, eh, she could not take care of the children? Of course, despite the remote location, one of Jill's friends appears, one with which she apparently has problems such as "boyfriend theft" or something like that. Anyway, of course, the alarm in the house is activated without any reason and then the calls of someone, the calls of someone who wants to kill her begin to arrive. Of course, Jill calls the police and, since there has been no real threat in her life, they surprise her, but tell her to call again if there is anything else they can do for her. Check out the scene with Jill calling her friends at the high school hogfire / pep rally or whatever it's supposed to be, it looks like a kind of "Burning Man" festival, ??? ?? There are all kinds of artificial scares in this, including the great Chester cat that, of course, appears here and there, one of the most "tired" clich√©s of the horror movie. I must admit that I fell asleep at some point during this, did I miss anything? Difficult to say, or care, the truth. This is one of those movies that makes me wonder how bad the remakes of "Amityville Horror", "House of Wax" or "The Fog" could have been. Anyway, when reading reviews online, it seems that the people who were most scared by this were girls of 12 years, and I can only assume that statements like "made me piss my pants." Well, you can only expect this to end the remakes of Hollywood movies that were not exactly stellar to begin with, but do not bet on it. 2 out of 10 and I'm being too generous.
