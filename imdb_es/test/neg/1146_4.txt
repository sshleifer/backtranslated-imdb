I just watched National Lampoon Christmas Holidays 2 on DVD, hoping to see something at least close to the original and fantastic Christmas comedy, "Christmas Holidays." I did not see anything like that. It can be said from the beginning that this movie simply was not going to be up to the task. It is a pity that it has a title that links it to the original Christmas holidays. It is really a bit sad. The film can not be sustained on its own merits. I think a lot of people will see this movie about the strength of the title and it does not come close to that level of comedy. Apart from the title, there is very little connection between the film and the original "Christmas Holidays", let alone a connection to Christmas. The comedy is very simplistic and the plot poor. Kids can find some humor here, but most adults just laugh here and there. This movie is a failure. Do not waste your time with that.
