Tom Cutler (Jackson) is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene cleaner. In his latest job, he cleans a new crime scene, destroys evidence and does not know that the crime has not been officially reported. Uh oh, this can not be good. <br /> <br /> You hear about Cleaners all the time, but usually when a gang or gang hit is involved when it is necessary to remove bodies, etc. and clean the area. This is different in the sense that Tom Cutler works with the Police to clean up after the police have done their investigation of the crime scene. Hey, someone has to do it. You know the police will not do it. The film makes it quite clear and it is up to the family to clean the area. <br /> <br /> This is almost a good thriller, but a side story that involves Tom's daughter (Palmer) makes this story a little uncomfortable. I guess they had to fill in some time. Oh, they brought this side plot to connect to the other side plot, but it was still a reach and an uncomfortable one. You see? <br /> <br /> This was almost a good thriller because there was a remarkable lack of tension, suspense and the pace was a little risky. The music did not help either, since I noticed that the music was more appropriate to see people make a long trip. You know, the music of the trip. Get it? HE HAS! <br /> <br /> Everyone's performance was excellent in this almost a good thriller. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No
