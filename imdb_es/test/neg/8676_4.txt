Well, this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try and take the nervousness of the 1999 theatrical version (in fact, copied some of the ideas of the same), but it slightly attenuates things to align them more with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is a rather mediocre and schizophrenic production. And, as with all other versions of Mansfield Park, Fanny Price's character is nowhere to be found. Instead, there is a strangely blonde, whitish woman who runs around and who never fully develops as a character. At least in the 1999 film, the character they call "Fanny Price" is firmly established as a rebellious tomboy who is too smart for his own good. This "Fanny Price" is a complete enigma. Someday, I would really like to see a dramatization of Mansfield Park that includes a representation of Fanny's character as written by Jane Austen. A sweet, kind and compassionate girl, with a shy personality and a fragile constitution. She is reserved and painfully honest, but also strong in her convictions, always loyal, extremely intelligent and remarkably clever. A little late, it is not until her eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from a clumsy teenager to a young woman with a little life. And she wants nothing more in life than to be of some real use to those she loves most. It is a wonderfully complex character that I hope some day to see faithfully portrayed.
