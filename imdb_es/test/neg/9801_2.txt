In the 1940s, Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom, thanks to her sensual beauty and her highly peekaboo hairstyle. She starred alongside big names such as Alan Ladd and Fredric March, and made film hits in films like "This Gun For Hire" and "I Married A Witch." She also defended herself with female stars, and even surprised her detractors with her performance as a bitter nurse in "So Proudly We Hail." But the changing times and their own failures reached it, and at the end of the decade, its apogee was over. With two unsuccessful marriages behind her (and two more in her future), Veronica headed to New York City, where she made occasional television and summer appearances before disappearing completely. It was briefly great news when she was found working as a waitress in a second-rate hotel in the early sixties. But at this point, his long-standing alcoholism and years of hard life had robbed him of his appearance. Without them, the public interest in it soon vanished again. She returned to the stage in several vehicles, but her success was minimal. Finally, he moved to Miami, Florida, where he lived in relative obscurity. In 1966, she went to Canada to participate in a dark film called "Footsteps in the Snow", which had no launch in the United States. The following year, it was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial film. They approached her to star in his movie "Time Is Terror" and they convinced her to invest in the project. As one author put it, "If ever a movie queen suffered a terminal crisis, this was". Surrounded by amateur artists and pathetic production values, she did not even reach a minimum level in this fast shot from Miami, Florida. With an absolutely ordinary appearance in long shots and with a cruelty aged in close-ups, poor Veronica did not act as much as walking on her part. As a deranged doctor, who has found a successful restoration formula for young people, uses carnivorous worms, looks bored and confused, her most hilarious moment without intention is when she is forced to improvise while fighting to gamble. Pair of rubber gloves. The cast of support is not of any help, simply advances the plot and says it to death. Director Brad Grinter apparently only required the actors to move while the camera was aimed at them, without needing anything that resembled entertainment (there is undoubtedly an unintentionally hilarious scene involving a private detective / nurse and a corpse in a wheelchair that precedes "Weekend in Bernie" for almost 20 years.) According to Veronica herself, the film was archived for three years because no master shots were filmed.But in 1970, the production company put it together, changed the title to "Flesh Feast" and he released it to take advantage of the newly published biography of Lake And, since the ex-distinguished ladies like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland had unexpectedly revived their careers in horror movies, This parody was touted as Veronica's "return movie." However, this seems to be a strange course of action for the filmmakers, because it is unlikely that aud (young) audience of a horror movie of this quality knew or cared who Veronica Lake was. As expected, he did nothing for Veronica's career, and she died in poverty, three years later. A previous critic cites a scene in which the detective who works as a nurse in the laboratory (supervising the theft of bodies from a nearby morgue) requests the help of a multi-talented driver to cut the body parts. "Poor Mrs. Lustig," he sighs, "I hope he does not mind leaving his body to science." "Try not to think about it," advises the driver, cutting. "I guess you're right, Hans." concludes the detective / nurse, "What is done is done". What a sad ending to the career of a star that he still remembers with affection.
