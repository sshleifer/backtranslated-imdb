This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I can not believe that people really a) write scripts like this b) have a budget to make a movie c) really expect it to be successful. Words can not even describe how horrible this movie is. I enjoy my fair share of movies for teenagers, but this did not even come close to being fun. In fact, it was funny for the only reason that it was so horrible. I can probably count one (maybe two) parts in the movie where I even managed to squeeze a giggle (apart from the laughs about how bad it was). <br /> <br /> Rent this was one of the biggest mistakes. I've never done a day ago I do not see the movie and I'm still shocked by how horrible it was. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> 2/10
