This movie was a horror movie made in Mexico in the late 60s. It's not so good, but it's really not that bad either. There is a lot of mess and it is very quilted with nudity and violence, but it had a plot and at least it tried to maintain it (even if the plot was the same cursed inspiration of Frankenstein "do not manipulate the dominion of God" b -movie fare). There was a bit of stuffing mixed with the female fight, but it was done in Mexico and the fight seems to be popular in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a doctor wants to save his son, who is dying. of leukemia. The other doctors have not given any hope for the poor man, but Dad has the idea of ​​transplanting the heart of a gorilla so that his son saves his life (I do not know, I'm a lawyer and not a doctor). The transplant works, but the little boy ends up becoming a monkey-man who terrorizes naked women and kills anyone who gets in his way. There is also a secondary plot that involves a policeman and his girlfriend who is a fighter (this really did not add too much, but if they wanted to include some masked fighters, this is a good reason to do so). <br /> <br /> The movie was somewhat cheap, but it's not too bad for a b-movie of the day. The plot was basically recycled and there were some things that were not tied so well. However, this movie is quite funny in its own way (I do not know why, maybe because it's a Mexican horror movie and excels in my normal diet of bad movies). I guess it can be because it's a mix and mix of some very strange things. <br /> <br /> Look at it if you like nosy foreign movies, nudity and fighters.
