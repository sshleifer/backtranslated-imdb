This is an extremely horrible movie. And if you think you've seen another horrible movie, exactly like this one before, you probably did. You probably saw Scarecrow 2 in 2003. Yeah, that's what I said, Brian (the director) stole the idea from the movie. And not only did he steal it, he could actually have made it worse. I bet even the actors were afraid to tell people that they were really in the movie. I also have to mention that the manager was trying to compensate the amount of cheese by showing as many tits as possible. Also the kissing scenes were put together like a porn movie. In fact, that's probably all the director has seen, and he tried to put together a decent movie, which will never work.
