The film opens with beautiful shots of landscapes of the northwest field. Post fences protruding from the damp earth, a freight train that crosses fields of hay in the distance, clouds of clouds, small structures on the sides of the road, a motel or a restaurant in the middle of nowhere. On this touches a languid but mysterious piano arrangement of Twin Peaks and everything is properly set and atmospheric in an American Gothic way. However, through this, the director Jon Jost continues interlacing uncomfortable frames, blocks of letters, opening credits with annoying sounds, color boxes that announce "BLUE", numbers that count for the "12 steps towards a conclusion" announced in the opening credits. It is obvious that during the first couple of minutes, although Jost is more than capable of capturing the landscape and the environment, he does not care. He has neither the affection for the open expanses of the Pacific Northwest that Terrence Malick in Badlands nor the time nor inclination of David Lynch of Twin Peaks to weave the mystery and intrigue around a certain location. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie It's more Jon Jost's frustration with experimental tricks that serve his own purpose. The use of the split screen is interesting, I like in particular how we get the first image of Ricky Lee divided into two, one is to tell memories of childhood that only interest him, the other is to curse and hit his head against the wall, and More In the course of the film, the second Ricky Lee prevails, the male nonconformist and unconcerned with the shadows, who is irremediably involved and stupid. On the other hand, motion stop animation and the option to play most of the movie in voice-over narration does not work. He does it sometimes because Jost writes as well as he takes static shots of the small American city Nowheresville but the monologues of Beth Ann, delivered in the flattest nasal monotone imaginable, a voice that sounds like the computer program of Stephen Hawking crossed with a horse that neighs. so annoying to the ear that it somehow defeats the purpose of trying to pay attention. <br /> <br /> Each of the couple tells us about their past experiences, their little triumphs, follies, doubts and past relationships that went nowhere. They say very little to each other and what they say they say with blank faces. But they humbled like rabbits. That seems to be their only communication channel that remains open, perhaps the only one they can trust with confidence. Jost clearly chooses his main characters in Frameup between the naive and the delirious, those primed by an American Dream that got bitter, but does not stand above them. He is not condescending or presumptuous in his interpretation. They may be wrong, but they are graced with the moments of humanity, although they can be uncomfortable. We are called to empathize and show affection instead of pointing and laughing. This is the most successful Frameup that becomes; The characters in the film come to life even when their expressionless faces do not, even when Jost gets in the way of his forced framing and his intricate camera games. <br /> <br /> Then we get enraged again at the destructive effects of money. played on an inserted shot of a dollar bill, we get a strange psychedelic sequence where Jost's camera slides under large leafy trees that soon turn red beet while Beth Ann reflects repeatedly on the "redwood trees" in the voice In off, we even have a sudden turn to the plot and the genre when the couple of Beth Ann and Ricky Lee, small losers who have nowhere to go or anything to hold them back to their dead ends, arrive in California and decide to steal a 7/11. The film does not rise to an emotional crescendo after the failed work of 7/11, as you might expect from a road movie "couple in the race", slows down and stops Window to see it really has no particular place . Parts of the trip have been hypnotic and almost moving and fun parts, but everything else has been mostly annoying.
