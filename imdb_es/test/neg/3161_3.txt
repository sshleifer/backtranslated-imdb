This is a film with a lot of potential, well done and acted, with a fairly weekly and inconsistent script. A young woman with two children moves to her mother's small apartment, because the husbands who are at the top of the workshop, where she cuts the stolen cars, are aggravating her son's asthma. The husband ends up in jail when the stolen car of a parent goes back to his shop. Ex pat ends up being kind, generous and naive shmoe (and rather cardboard and we learn almost nothing about him), but ends up with the girl, who "trades" despite being sexually satisfied only by her husband. I hope this film is successful in Czech, where it will be welcome due to its obvious premise: "It is possible that expatriates have money, they can even get our women, but they are old, soft and our women want to be satisfied, we can be poor, But ... Now if only Evzen could keep Marcela satisfied so she would not have to play with herself, or if he already had a family in Italy ... but that would complicate things.
