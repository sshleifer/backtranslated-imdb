The New York family is the last in their neighborhood to get a TV, which almost ruins David Niven's marriage to Mitzi Gaynor. Comedy bedroom that rarely ventures into the bedroom (and anyway nothing sexy happens). Gaynor, as an actress, has as much scope as an oven: it turns on, it goes off. The only compensation for the film is a supporting performance by the cheerful Patty Duke, before "Miracle Worker", as Niven's daughter. She is lovely "Happy Anniversary" is not. * since ****
