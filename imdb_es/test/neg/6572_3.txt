The trip here is a search for God, the big guy in heaven, the big cheese with a beard. Disguised astutely as the thirst for ultimate knowledge. Under the command of Leonard Nimoy in the executive chair is Shat himself, Captain Tiberius William Shatner Kirk. In an attempt to mix the fun aspects of the series with science fiction histrionics (Klingon's dialogue consultant, really?), Shatner and his co-writers have only achieved what is almost an embarrassing parody parody. Where is the danger? Where is the spirit of the brothers in arms? In fact, where is our crew badly insured? The humor of Star Trek is a wonderful thing, when it is in the right places and is done with a straight lace, according to what has happened before The Final Frontier. Some light moments exist, but they do not compensate for the lack of serious moments. While we really need another revelation from Spock,? Seriously? <br /> <br /> A few beautiful sets and small moments of Trek knowingly aside, The Final Frontier is just a bad cinematic experience. 3/10
