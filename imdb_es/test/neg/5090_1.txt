This is by far one of the most boring movies I've seen! And if you do not believe me, go see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, the story does not make any sense. The people who fight do not make any sense. I could not understand what they were talking about during the movie (in most cases I did not even bother) It does not do anything to keep you watching the movie, the only positive point would be the cinematography. New Zealand looks amazing. Everything else just sucks. <br /> <br /> The actors do their best to keep us awake, but unfortunately, instead, you will go to sleep. <br /> <br /> Do us a favor to everyone, even if this is put on "On Demand", DO NOT LOOK AT IT!
