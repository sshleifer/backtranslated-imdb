First of all, this has nothing to do with the 18 much better Kung Fu weapons starring Gordon Liu. I mention this since my Kung Fu Theater DVD presents a totally misleading picture on the cover, the wrong plot on the back and continues to mention (with no idea why) The Young Hero starring Hwang Jang Lee. Apart from an introduction to the history of the style of 18 weapons told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is looking for, the weapons never appear again and the fights are boxing style. The hero is Lee Shao Hwa, whom I've never heard of or any of the other actors. The film mentions another director, Wu Yuen Ling, as well as the IMDb lists. The other actors are Wang Fu Quen, Wang Wing San, Chen Fei Fei, Wang Ki San, Suen King Kai and Hwa Yue Suen, who seem to have sunk without a trace after this movie. The fights are reasonable and frequent, but they are not great and the 'star' does not have much charisma. The turn at the end is just stupid and the movie seems to end abruptly as if they had gotten bored. The landscape and the training sequences in the river are a little different from the usual. Unfortunately, the beautiful sister drowns, not the boy very irritating (although acrobatic).
