Silly Disney movie about a college student accidentally discovering a potion that makes things invisible. It's not a bad idea and some of the special effects are pretty good. Even so, the script is VERY bad ... all the jokes fail and the performance is terrible. Everyone is trying to be fun and they are not. A real boring and stupid Disney movie. But it was fun to see Kurt Russell so young.
