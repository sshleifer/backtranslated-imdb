Contrary to most comments in this section, I have to say that this movie barely escapes the definition of 'junk'. The only readers who seem to be aware of what a catalog of clich√©s is are those who, like me, live in the northeast and know first hand what the area is like. I'm totally fed up with movies that are supposed to be "realistic," but that represent the working class (from anywhere) as stupid, low-life criminals, but then apologize for their social origin. And fun? I smiled twice briefly and laughed once, but that was because of the incongruity of two male actors with Sunderland accents who were supposedly trying to hide their Newcastle accents from Sunderland football fans! There was only one nice character in the whole movie, and that was the senile grandfather played in silence but with great competition for Roy Hudd, the only one who is not Geordie in the cast. <br /> <br /> As for writing - Well, I wonder in what department of university sociology the author studied. I certainly did not have an ear for the local accent. And I've also never heard the expression 'Purely Belter', and not only am I a native speaker, I'm a linguist who has written articles in the local dialect. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time and Vista about this garbage. It's not fun, it's not realistic, it's not entertaining and it's fundamentally dishonest.
