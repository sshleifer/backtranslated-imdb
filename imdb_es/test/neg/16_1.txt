For years, I've been a big fan of Park's work and "Old boy" is one of my all-time favorites. <br /> <br /> With many expectations, I rented this movie, only to find the worst movie. I have seen in a while. It is not a horror movie proper; there is no suspense and even the "light" part is so boring, that I did not know whether to laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> I introduced my younger brother to Chan-Wook Park and what a disappointment. he got from this For me, an idol has fallen. <br /> <br /> If you loved movies like "Old boy", Mr & Lady "Vengeance" or even your short films about "Three extremes", do not waste your time. , the movie is not worth it.
