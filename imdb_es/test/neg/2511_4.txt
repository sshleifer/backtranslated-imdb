Foreigners thieves of bodies in the desert. Small blue rocks that look like they are made of cheap plastic. The general plot is not bad if you like that kind of thing, but the acting is so bad that I'm surprised that some of them really entertained me in The X Files. And the special effects? Hello?! Where did you get your FX equipment from high school? Well then; There was a lot more they could have done! He was amateur and extremely basic. I did not particularly enjoy it (and my dad fell asleep during that!) And, of course, our hero falls in love with the protagonist! It is so typical and highly predictable. Bleugh !!!!!
