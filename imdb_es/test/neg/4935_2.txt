Disconcerting movie about two girls and some men who are in an airport that get on the wrong night bus and end up in a world of problems. The big twists and turns are totally, and I mean totally wasted, in a movie with such an incredibly stupid plot to defy description. What is happening in a general sense is fine, I mean the idea that a man kidnaps unattended girls for nefarious purposes is good. The problem is that the details are beyond the belief that I would be surprised if you did not turn off the movie with absolute disbelief. Wow, a guy who is supposed to take you to your house does not go in any of the ways you know, and do you stay on the bus? It gets worse from there, think about every bad choice and this movie makes the characters achieve it, even to the point where they could just walk away, but never do it. What is annoying is that some of the twists and turns could have worked if there was something smart before, but there is almost no intelligence anywhere in this movie. Okay, maybe there is, in the end, the end is smart. The end is the kind of thing that should scare you. it must be the "oh # $ * @ !!!!" Moment and become a horror film classic. Instead, he is simply there among the stupid ruins of a stupid movie. One of the most intelligent films of the year.
