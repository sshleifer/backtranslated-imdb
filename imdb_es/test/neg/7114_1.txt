When you first sit down to watch this movie, keep in mind that you are about to see something you have probably never seen before. Keep in mind that this is a movie in which, obviously, they spent an EXTREME amount of cash in explosions and not enough in acting or anything else for that matter. The crazy thing I noticed is that all the characters are completely portrayed, and it seems (most of the time anyway) that the movie was accelerated so that the characters moved faster. (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was dubbed too?) I understand that the cartoon had this, but it does not work for live action. It just seems strange ... as if the camera crew decided to act because they could not afford real actors. <br /> <br /> The English version is horribly bent and the character's words do not match at all. . I would have preferred subtitles, but since this is a movie for children, and since some children can not read well, I'll let it go. But there is something extremely strange about this movie. It is supposedly a movie for children, but there is a lot of material about SEX, VIOLATION and PULLING that is not exactly for the young western audiences. (In the East, they have different laws and sexuality in children's films is much more accepted). But parents are warned! There is a scene in which two characters talk about rapes, multiple scenes where people say "sexual maniac" and a scene in which this young Japanese woman incredibly makes a sexy dance for one of the "sex maniacs" and shows her breasts ! Who was this movie for? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the special effects are ridiculous. Things like a spaceship bombing the town are cardboard cutouts (or animation, I was not sure) that do not seem convincing, even for a child. The creators of this film left out many great things about the cartoon, simply because they could not budget the amount of money they would need. I did not like how the names of all the characters were changed ... it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z. <br /> <br /> I really do not recommend this movie for anyone. Children, adults or fans of Dragon Ball Z. It is just a bad representation of the cartoon, and obviously, one can say that this movie was hurried and that he did not care about anything. I'm not even going to get into camera work ... just wait until the final credits in the still image that stays there for 2 minutes ... most of the shots are not framed correctly and the movie seems to be done by amateurs . Grainy film quality too. <br /> <br /> Simply everything horrible !!!! <br /> <br />
