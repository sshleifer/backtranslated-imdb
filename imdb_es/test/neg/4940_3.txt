I found 'Shuttle' an incredibly frustrating movie to watch. Start quite well and move forward vigorously until the first "injury" (which is a good dose). After that he becomes very lazy and subscribes as a story. It was the case of the plot that controls the characters and not the characters that drive the plot. If you hate the movie where you can not understand why the characters do what they do, you will detest 'Shuttle'. In particular, the last act is strange and seems to occur in a world without common sense. Also in the end, one of the characters confessed a misdemeanor to his friend, instead of generating sympathy from the audience, most people began to laugh. This was probably because the "heroines" of the story were complete idiots. Finally, there is an ending that seems to be "shocking" and that comes from the horror school of "the people are bad, the audience, so accept it without any explanation". <br /> <br /> 'Shuttle' is neither good nor bad, but mediocre. And upset.
