There are no serious spoilers, but some very minor ones. <br /> <br /> "Acacia", a Korean contribution to the ever popular wave of Asian terror, refers to a husband and wife who decide they are getting a little bit and decide to adopt a child. The child, who has a habitual obsession with the dead tree in the family garden, finally disappears when the couple finally has a child of their own and the tree mentioned seems to hold a grudge against their own family. <br /> <br /> And that's it. The film moves at a snail pace and is recorded in more than 100 minutes with 80 minutes of material. It is essentially a thin family drama with a creepy tree, and there are very few ways to scare, just taking the tree with strange whispering noises that play at the top. However, the idea that the tree is the mother of the child is quite original, but it is not exploited to its full potential. This type of "Acacia" separates much of the new wave to which it belongs: films like Ju-On and Ring tend to do the opposite, and soft ideas until they are red in the face. <br /> <br /> The film starts to move towards the end; However, the realization of the child's destiny and the actions of the parents not only restrain the previous curiosity of the story, but they are revealed with a machine-gun edition that is difficult to assimilate at the same time. The final sequence is undoubtedly creepy, however, it feels like too little too late. <br /> <br /> In general, the film does not look too much like a Ring money, however, with the "cinematic rebirth" that Korea is currently going through, I could not help but feel that this movie could have been much more.
