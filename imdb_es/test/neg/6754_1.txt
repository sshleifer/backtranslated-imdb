Let's see how many ways you can insult my gender: 1. Of course, the # 1 girl is a horrible fox who cheats on her boyfriend and looks like a heroin addict. <br /> <br /> 2. Of course, the # 1 girl sleeps with the boy on the first date after it is wasted. <br /> <br /> 3. Of course, lesbians are butch "Germans" who are in S & M. <br /> <br /> 4. This was actually a surprise. Finishing the film with a torture note held by most of the characters was disgusting. Seeing a woman beaten is not my idea of ​​comedy. <br /> <br /> 5. Director's comment: talk about connecting with actresses in the movie, so you know, it's coarse and incredibly unprofessional.
