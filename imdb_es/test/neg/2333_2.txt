ok, we have a movie that some call one of the best movies in history ... but I'm sitting here thinking about hell! Sux stories (that there is no story), the diolouge is quite simple, artistically nothing great! , and the acting is not real, so if you want to pretend that you are an art, say that you like it, but if you have a real opinion, say that you do not like it or if you explained why.
