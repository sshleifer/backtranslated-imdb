I want to recover the 99 minutes of my life that were wasted in this pathetic excuse for a movie. The acting was horrible! I used to be a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I will never see them again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not a surprise. Everyone knows they could never act. Fortunately, only Dan tried an accent. His accent was a disaster as expected. I think he was confused about the location of the movie or had never spoken to someone from Minnesota. I hope this review will help anyone who is hesitant about what to do with their valuable time. The only reason I could sit down for the whole movie was because I was stuck somewhere with nothing better to see or read.
