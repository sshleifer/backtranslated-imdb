In its essence, this is a pretty typical western revenge, loaded with spaghetti, and if you follow it as such, the protagonist will successfully defeat the main villain. However, there are so many things at stake that have nothing to do with the story that you have to wonder what the filmmakers thought. I mean things like how Miss Rosie's singer number appears out of nowhere and the boxing match in the center of the city. Granted, they have a weak connection to the influence of the villain Mash Flanagan, but why does it suddenly appear with an alias? Mr. Donovan. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I thought it was quite innovative in how the camera shot that shows Wallach's sight wound from the road could have been shot by someone with a real bullet in his shoulder. And was not it great how the Donovan girl uses the old headache routine when she gets a little playful? Do not let them forget the great trick job of the gravel evils, as Wallach shoots them as part of the final. <br /> <br /> However, there was one thing that had not been counted, and I kept waiting for the whole movie for it. What happened to that trio of hoods that Flanagan / Donovan hires near the beginning of the image? You know, the Martel guy that a funeral home wanted to hire for his skill with weapons, the devil's minion Mitchell with the rifle and the Lincoln Tate knife thrower. Each had a reward of five thousand dollars in his head, and they were supposed to protect Donovan from the guy who survived the massacre of the initial scene. We have never heard from them again! I like to think that maybe Donovan just made them kill and kept the 15K all to himself.
