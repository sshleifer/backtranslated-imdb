ABC prepares its repertoire company for another unrealistic representation of rural Australia. Yes, friends, it's all there is. Baca Bourke (Jeremy Sims, a little talented actor) Fire hero, Lill (Libby Tanner plays Bronwyn Craig in the jungle), Fifi city slut (Nadia Townsend), preggers by Baca Joe's brother. Then there's Uncle Geoff, Big Daddy from Lost Springs. Uncle Geoff's scenes are like Tennessee Williams in speed. The only salvation is the Russian actress Natalia Novikova as the crazy Baca. She's great. I can not understand why John Waters took the concert as the psychologist of Lilly's husband. He must have needed the money that I hope for! Even so, it will not last long, since Lill and Baca will have him out of the game. Just watch this lemon to see how bad an Australian show can be. Frankly, I'm embarrassed.
