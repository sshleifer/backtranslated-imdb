I've only seen this movie once, when I was about 14, but I was thrilled that they made a film about the 45th Division. Being from Oklahoma and especially now that my two children are members of the 45th, I'd like to see it posted on a DVD. It may seem a bit biased, but Division 45 sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today. The History channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about WW2 and Korea, but you rarely hear it mentioning the 45. One of the scenes that really stood out for me was when the Indian Code Talkers worked and the perplexed look in the faces of the German soldiers when they could not understand this language. I'm glad that all Code Speakers of Native Americans receive the recognition they deserve.
