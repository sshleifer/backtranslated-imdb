I can overcome the political parody; even if this was SUPPOSED to be a "Masters of Horror" movie. <br /> <br /> But, what I can not overcome is the flagrant use of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as pawns in some washes Until the political statement of the horror maker. <br /> <br /> It was totally insulting to me to desecrate Arlington and our heroes. I have family in Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) even portrayed that the Arlington tombs are being disturbed just makes me want to throw up. <br /> <br /> I'm done with Dante, and with MOH.
