I guess people who talk like this are friends of the director or something like that. This is bad, and not in the song of Michael Jackson. To compare the rhythm of this film with the progress of a snail would be to insult the snail. This movie goes on for what seems an eternity, all to introduce us to some zombie children who are not scary with a silly makeup and some kind of revenge, or thirst for blood, or whatever. Believe me, you will not mind. The very idea that Mom would move her two daughters to this ruined house and full of FILTHY is absurd. And even worse, I found myself simply not caring. Backstory about zombie children? Snore. Danger of mom and / or daughters? No matter. <br /> <br /> In summary, WOW was that boring. Do not bother yourself
