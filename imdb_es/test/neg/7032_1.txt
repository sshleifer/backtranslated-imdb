I'm a big fan of Shirley Temple. When I saw this movie, it made me appreciate what a talented girl Shirley really was. Ashley Rose Orr made possibly the worst screen of Shirley. Imagine an 11 year old boy playing Shirley Temple from the age of 5 years. That in itself is incorrect. But making her imitate Shirley's voice? And his singing is lamentable. The dance was good, I'll say it. As previous users have said, there were small dramatic scenes, nothing that made the story interesting. Not even Amelia Earhart ... I would have liked to see more of the world phenomenon that Shirley Temple created. Too much attention was paid to the Wizard of Oz, when in reality, Shirley was considered for Dorothy. The film portrays him as if it were the end of the world when he does not get the role. Shirley said she is happy that Judy Garland played her. For me, the star of the show was the lady who played Gertrude Temple. Otherwise, stay away! To see the fantastic films of Shirley Temple, look at Heidi, Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway.
