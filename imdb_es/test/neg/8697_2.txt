This movie could have had a lot of potential. Certainly, with current technology, one would expect real special effects. But movies are not made with special effects alone, of course you need to act. This movie was missing both! <br /> <br /> First, let me tell those who are upset about not following the Bible: why can not a film get an artistic license? If you want to know about the story of Moses, read the Bible. I have seen very few movies that follow a true story made for granted. Watch the film from its artistic qualities. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you will inevitably compare it with the 1956 version. It fails miserably in that. Heston and Brenner had PRESENCE. They became their roles. Do not see this here. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not compare, this movie is too hasty. Parties where a scene must be developed, it is not like that. It gets boring. <br /> <br /> My advice: skip this and look at the other one. As country as the other one is, it is the best film.
