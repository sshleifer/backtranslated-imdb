One of the few reasons to make these films punctual is to give some actors the chance to star in better films if they are acting well. The only good thing about this movie is the acting, the three protagonists are better than most horror films like this one. There are 2 scenes that can cause an unexpected jump. <br /> <br /> Small toddlers are used to crawl through the holes and place dynamite to exploit the mines. When one collapses causing a cave in all the children die, becoming zombies. The adults in the mine remain dead, there is no reason to explain why children eat meat. While they were still alive, they seemed terrified before the entrance to the cave, innocent, so they must be furious with any adult who exploited them in the mines (the only reason that comes to mind). move to a house near the mine, along with a land operator who wants to build a tourist center and another one of those creepy people who seem to know exactly what is happening, but nobody believes him. They are the usual, predictable clich√©s, many negatives for this film, very few positives.
