On the heels of the well-received and beloved classic film of the age of majority, in relation to the lives of adolescents as they headed to adulthood, the American graffiti of George Lucas, we have Cooley High. An adaptation of the type by Eric Monte, co-creator of the popular CBS comedy Good Times of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Cooley High was, and is, seen as a black version of American Graffiti. Instead of central California, like In American Graffiti, we have the black neighborhood of Chicago's Cabrini Green as the backdrop to the story here. Instead of America, in 1962, Cooley High is located in 1964. Movie stars Welcome Back Kotter, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman are the main protagonists of the film and its main characters. Garrett Morris plays the director who tries to keep the characters of Jacobs and Turman, called Coceise and Preach, out of trouble most of the time. <br /> <br /> You know, I would like to say that Cooley High is a piece of comparison worthy of American Graffiti or that it is a great movie in itself, but I can not. The problem lies in the fact that the producers of the film could not or did not hide the sad lower part of black life in the United States. Having the film in the green part of Chicago by Cabrini does not help at all. <br /> <br /> Nor the gross attempts at humor here. When Coceise is looking for a letter of intent from a university, he discovers that his little brother has flushed a toilet. When the gang visits the Chicago Zoo, one of the gangs called Pooter, throws dung on a monkey. When Turman's character, Preach, is being chased by two thugs in the school meeting place (a dirty and depressing place to eat, let alone meet people), he opens the girls' bathroom door while a girl goes is relaxing. He escapes through the window of the same bathroom! The high school, the houses of the characters, the bathrooms, almost everywhere in the film show the unfortunate aspect of urban decay and poverty. <br /> <br /> If that was not enough, there was a rough display of humor. in the film. The use of violence and blasphemy in the film. Cooley High may be a coming of age film, but it is a harsh and harsh movie with little or no experience or taste for the nostalgia that made people like and appreciate American graffiti. <br /> <br /> Motown Records intervened in the making of the film. The music of the company was part of the soundtrack of the film. But even here you have the feeling of having heard these songs before a million times. Not that they were not great songs within themselves but black music, that period of time was more than Motown. Especially in Chicago. The song that approaches the end of the film, from the Spinners' G.C. Cameron, it was not that impressive. There have been better Motown ballads that have made, better Motown artists than Cameron, without a doubt. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie that shows where the characters went to pay homage to the film Cooley High pretended to be, American Graffiti. It shows that Preach, an intelligent but underperforming student, went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer. Eric Monte may have modeled himself as Turman's character. Preach's latest take of the film program that escapes Coceise's funeral, held on a dark rainy afternoon, and all the desolation that Cooley High came to represent. Eric Monte, through Preach and that final scene, had a little lesson for all of us when we saw Cooley High and for the love of the past. Do not look back
