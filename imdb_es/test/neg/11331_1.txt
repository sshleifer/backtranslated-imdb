It is difficult to distinguish actors from non-actors. Bad American films can be seen by all the young people who appear in each line of dialogue with "You know what?" Bad Canadian films can be seen by all the young people who end each line of dialogue with "Eh?" Have we not learned anything in a century of cinema? Can not the weight of millions of aspirants who descend on Hollywood with scripts and reels in hand rescue us from these horrible made-to-order television movies?
