I realized this with Cinemax very late at night ... there was nothing else, so I practically had no other choice. In short, a terrible, slow plot, loss of good movies and actors' time. To keep it short, do not even bother with this. It's a pity we can not give zeros as a rating; This really is not worth a consideration!
