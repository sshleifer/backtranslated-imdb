Lame is really the best way to describe this movie. It has a really poor script, dialogues and uninteresting characters, and basically lacks everything else. <br /> <br /> There are too many characters and the problem is that you do not care about any of them. What is missing in the film is a good and clear main character. Instead, now the movie has a bit of everything, it has a bit of a hero, it has a bit of love interest and it has a bit of a villain. However, I would like you to have only a little less Ghoulies, since they are mostly very annoying in this movie. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies are supposed to be diabolical creatures, who kill for pleasure. In this movie, however, all they want to do is drink beer and watch college girls naked. Also, someone had the "brilliant" idea of ​​letting the Ghoulies speak this time. This works very badly and annoyingly. Ghoulie-puppets have been definitely improved for this film and are more detailed and can do more, however, at the same time they are more false than those of the previous films of Ghoulies. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the objective of this film was more comedy than horror this time. The movie is like a lame high school comedy (although this movie premiered in 1991). His humor is really the worst and most boring of the whole movie. It's incredibly annoying and it's just not fun at all. <br /> <br /> The story is not going anywhere with its story and the movie is basically a big mess, which never seems to end. The plot of Ghoulies seems that basically has nothing to do with the other plot of the film, which involve the human characters. The film is not about the Ghoulies that terrorize a university, with humans trying to hunt them and stop their uproar. No wonder this is Brent Olson's only written film to date. He simply has no talent for it and I think he has also discovered it and has returned to college instead. <br /> <br /> Even compared to the previous Ghoulies movies; This movie is just terrible! <br /> <br /> 2/10
