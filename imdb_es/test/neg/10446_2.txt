Hi, what a good idea to open a movie: show someone's home movie. Theater schools must be full of idiots! , there they are taking drama lessons with the hope of becoming the next big thing in Hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio. Hey, I think I'll send the video of my wedding and I'll call it THE GREATEST ROMANCE THAT WE HAVE SEEN or I'll send a tape of my honeymoon and I'll call it THE GREATEST SEX WE HAVE SEEN. Oh, wait, I'm not married and I've never been on my honeymoon. Do not worry, I'll send a video of someone else to the wedding / honeymoon <br /> <br /> !!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> You would think that with an opening like SHARK HUNTER could only improve, right? As shocking as it sounds, the home movie is the best part of the movie, best written and best performed. Unfortunately, everything is downhill since the family goes to the sea (actually a pool covered in fog) in three. yacht on foot where mom and dad eat them a CGI fin and their son Spencer swears revenge against the fin. Forward to the present and the French are using a submarine research base for oil exploration. The only thing is that - and it's so obvious that you can not help but notice this - it's not filmed underwater! , the director has not made any attempt to use the unconvincing technique of filming the scene through a fish tank. The submarine research base is flown by the shark (maybe it is hired by Greenpeace?) Killing everyone inside and Spencer, now an adult man is hired to hunt the shark that killed his parents and a handful of Frenchmen. What else happens I have no idea because I decided to see something else <br /> <br /> I do not have resentments if any of the cast members and the team is reading this and I hope that Matt Codd becomes a big shot in Hollywood. Do you think you know about sharks Matt? You have not seen anything yet.
