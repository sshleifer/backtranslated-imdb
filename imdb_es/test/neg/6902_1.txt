I can not find a redemptive value for this movie. It seems to be loosely based on the school of thought of the Lion King. The father dies, the son can not fill his shoes and tries to flee, etc., etc., etc. The only difference (apart from being in a corral instead of a jungle) is that Barnyard tries to "animate things" with the stick. -kind of music. They go beyond the top in trying to be cool. The problem is that it really is not great. It's like "that boy." Everyone knows at least one of "those guys" who are older and who are still with younger people in a futile attempt to hold on to their youth. They try to be great to fit in, but in reality they are not. That is this movie. <br /> <br /> But hey, if you have money to burn and you feel like paying someone to suck 90 minutes of your life, do not let them stop you.
