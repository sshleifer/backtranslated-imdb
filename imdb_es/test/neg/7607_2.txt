This is a student movie and it's a piece of shit. I would use a much stronger language to describe it, but then the review would not be published and the world needs to know, beyond any reasonable doubt, that this movie DROPS REALLY. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a difference. Rule used to measure the early work of an already famous director. As if he were somehow a genius, we were too stupid to understand him, since he finally understood it right now. I'm not buying it. The early film "Bad taste" made by LOTR Peter Jackson's sucks and this "early work" by another famous director also sucks in the same way. These "early works" are representative of everything from the budget to the scripts, to the actors, etc. Everything is lower part of the garbage. Do not be fooled by the big name. <br /> <br /> If you like to see a handful of men with hippies from the 70s, pretend they could ever command a ship with the worst special effects you've ever seen: this is your movie. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this won a Golden Scroll award for the best special effects. That's a joke, right? Or a joke prize? <br /> <br /> If you want to see what we want in this movie is rent a season or three of Red Dwarf you smeghead.
