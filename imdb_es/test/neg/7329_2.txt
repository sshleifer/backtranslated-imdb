This movie is available as a special "bonus" feature on the double disc of Horror 101 and Horror 102: Endgame. It has nothing to do with those films, except that it shows that producers / directors Dudelson and Clavell are in a rut. Like those other films, this one has young people who go to a building where they get trapped inside, and run a lot through the corridors, while being eliminated one by one. In the end, it is revealed that one or more characters have another identity. This is by far the worst of the three. <br /> <br /> Here, people are invited to an opening of the Museum of the Dead on Halloween night. The museum does not have many exhibits, and they are all a kind of related Central American antiquities. There are also zombies that eat meat and spread infections in the museum, as well as an old cannibal warrior and two warriors. <br /> <br /> The movie is very repetitive. Kill people fairly quickly, to the point where you wonder who will be left to kill, at which point some more people appear without explanation, so they can be killed. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, one of the characters has a cell phone, and can actually call the police, who really takes it seriously and shows up at the museum. When one tries to open the lock to enter, the other tells him that this would be "forced entry". If there are people trapped in a building that are injured, I think that is irrelevant. The cops are also stupid, because when they shoot a zombie in the head, it falls, but then they shoot other zombies in the chest and do not fall. They happen to shoot another zombie in the head, and it falls off. They continue shooting the rest of the zombies in the chest. Stupid. <br /> <br /> The opening credits and a nightmare sequence are made in a kind of animation effect on video, a kind of poor man of waking life, but not so caricatured. It's something interesting, however, parts of some of the attacks are performed in the same way, so they have no logic. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
