In general, I do not appreciate the slight attempts to create humorous stories, which means that "Anita does not lose the Train" can not get a very high score for me. The story is good: a middle-aged but still pretty woman finds a new love. But attempts to make this film like a romantic comedy only managed to be somewhat funny at times. <br /> <br /> Rosa María Sardà has skillfully demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in productions such as "Amic / Amat" (qv), "All about my mother" (qv), "The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant "(qv) and" The Embrujo de Shanghai "(qv). However, the powers they have had over the years have given him many trivial things, for the cinema and for television. Something similar could be said of José Coronado: perfectly capable of producing serious performances. María Barranco belongs to this group in a safe way. <br /> <br /> In such a way that, in the end, I was left with the feeling that I would like to see a new realization of this film, in a serious tone, that would allow the actors to really show their acting skills. And the funny thing is that it must be done exactly with the same main actors. Talent wasted in a rather silly movie that could have been very promising.
