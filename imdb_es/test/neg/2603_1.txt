Everything about this show is terrible. Your premise even prepares you to get cheap laughs with bad writing. A "dysfunctional family": the theme has been used too many times, especially by the Simpsons, which is an excellent show with great writing and lots of laughs. Meanwhile, Family Guy has about five minutes of history in each episode, with tons of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks. Now, if this was original or funny, sure, I think it was smart. But no, it's not funny at all. In fact, the only reason why the episodes are like this is because it is the easiest way to trigger episode after episode of this garbage. Much of this show is not original, and what is original is simply scarce. It is also amazingly crude and irreverent, which again may be fine if it is still intelligent. Animation is not everything either, but from an artistic point of view, this show also fails, which shows once again that Family Guy strives to get as many cheap jokes and easy shortcuts as possible. People enjoy this show, and I really do not care, because people can enjoy whatever they want, no matter how much they point to the lowest common denominator. But no, I do not recommend it, especially for anyone who wants to study film someday or become a writer. This is a cheap entertainment that aims low and has been successful in this. The fact that this is so successful says bad things about America.
