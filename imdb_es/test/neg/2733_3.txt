Terry Cunningham directs this original Sci-Fi Network. Not everything is fine in the state of Washington and in Oregon; Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to drop most of the Pacific Rim into the ocean. Trying to prevent the world from falling into ecological chaos, a team of scientists led by Dr. Jake Rollins (Luke Perry) takes a massive earth-drilling vehicle called "The Mole" to chew its way to the fire core of the Earth to avoid the imminent death. . The technical dialogue does not really help or accelerate this movie. The acting is scarce, but then Perry has always been relaxed. You can only blame him for participating. Others in the cast: Michael Dorn, Adam Frost and Michael Teigen
