"My blue sky" is boring. The plot is insipid; The characterizations and the dialogue stink; Musical numbers, although occasionally presented in interesting ways, are not only often absurd, but also lyrically trite, painfully bright and emotionally hollow at the core. The leaders, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, are attractive professionals; however, despite each of their talented efforts to elevate the gloomy and inflexible material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, for all their talent demonstrated in other projects, are more or less staunch here. <br /> <br /> There is really only one reason to see "My Blue Heaven". One reason ... one star: Mitzi Gaynor, in his film debut. Your total screen time is probably less than ten minutes, but so what? His pert and promising screen personality, his feline beauty and exceptional charisma shine gloriously and make these minutes the most visible, memorable and exciting moments of the entire film. If you would value the opportunity to see a huge young talent on the rise, then check out Miss Mitzi Gaynor in "My Blue Heaven." <br /> <br /> By the way, I despise (and I urge you to avoid) Drew Casper's obsessive-compulsive DVD mania for this movie. Wordy, digressive, excessively annoying, often badly programmed with what is playing on the screen and galloping with an excess of nervous energy, his comments are absolutely indigestible.
