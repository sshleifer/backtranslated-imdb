<br /> <br /> to make this short and sweet: I hope this film is not considered as the seminal work for the "gener-asian" of American cinema. the performance was unsatisfactory, relying on stereotypes, high voices and exaggeration of the eyes to convey his message. chris chan park does not delve into any of her characters, which allows them to remain as angry / frustrated / distant / non-communicative Asian cartoons. these representations do not make the characters mysteriously attractive; It makes them confused and unfriendly. I like to think that we Asians are more complex than that. <br /> <br /> I left the movie without being convinced. I am not convinced that these characters had a lifelong relationship, similar to a blood brother, to do everything possible to help their partner. He was not convinced that the main character had more than a superficial attraction to his girlfriend. I am not convinced that immigrant parents who work hard would not pay for their child's college education. He was not convinced that all the characters were even necessary, that is: Janet, who lies down in the back of the car and quickly forgets. <br /> <br /> The story line, which I actually believe had potential, was not allowed on its own for two reasons: 1) flat characters for whom I did not feel sympathy / affinity, 2) the plot it is overshadowed by scenes without sequence and without sequence, such as the sequence of session session / donuts with Amy Hill, which was ridiculous and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I congratulate Park on his efforts, as I am sure it took me a lot of work to even produce the film, and I will even give him the benefit of the doubt. as a novice director / scriptwriter, but I sincerely hope that next time it will be a little deeper. The fact that the film is one of the first experiences of this kind in terms of the Korean experience does not mean that it is automatically good.
