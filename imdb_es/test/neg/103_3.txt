Too bad that this movie is not. While the "Game of Nemesis" is somewhat entertaining, I found it difficult to suspend my disbelief throughout the film, especially the situations in which Sara was getting involved. Are we supposed to believe that: <br /> <br /> 1) this hot girl is going to go to the unarmed slums around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some puzzles? <br /> <br /> 2) the protagonists are supposedly experts who play guessing games for fun, but they do not put the whole "I Never Sinned" enigma to the end ... and then ... and then ... get this ... does she have to do all the mirror to finally put the pieces together? I know it was the filmmaker's device to show the audience what was going on, but do they really think we are so stupid? <br /> <br /> 3) When Vern and Sara go to the Chez M to ask the blonde, there is NOT a topless girl in the whole building. Nothing Come on I know it's Canada, but I would expect more from a country that Shannon Tweed gave us. <br /> <br /> And anyone else realizes that when Vern was surfing the Web and found that Riddlezone site, that when he hovered the mouse over the link the cursor remained an arrow, and it did not become on a small hand (HOW DOES ALL CURSORS DO WHEN YOU CLICK ON A HYPERPINATE)? I mean, if you're going to make the Internet play such an important role in your movie, at least do things right. Wow
