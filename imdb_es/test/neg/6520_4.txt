There is nothing bad or evil in this movie. It is terribly boring. Photography is boring, the film looks old and discolored and discolored. Maybe it was even 16 mm blown up to 35 mm, I do not know. Dull is the script, which is tedious and 'Jules Pfeiffer'-ish. That is, a kind of bossa-nova cocktail from the sixties. Like our beatnik grandparents could have talked if they had tried to look really straight. The characters in the 'life segment' were mostly annoying. True, they were real in life, but hey, if I wanted to see really ordinary people doing really mundane and ordinary things, I would just take care of myself. I would not get caught up in the movies and I would throw five pounds, and one afternoon, watching someone else do it. <br /> <br /> I expected a bright and funny romantic comedy. What I got was more like what two young people of 19 or 20 years smart and moderately talented could have produced on their first day with a new video camera. <br /> <br /> I gave this to 4 out of 10, because it seems that someone tried, at least.
