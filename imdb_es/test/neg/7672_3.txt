It is possible that this film is reduced to some extent due to the fact that it was made in 1979. That said, it really is quite serious. <br /> <br /> It does not matter the retrospective laughter or the horrible, horrible camera. the tracking of the supposed objects "in flight", are the maneuvers that the Concorde makes which will make you blink in disbelief at the absurd. Barrel rolls, loop-the-loops and violent "evasive" maneuvers made me wonder why the Air Forces of the world not only flew Concordes as their main fighters. <br /> <br /> So, here are the important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheese festival: <br /> <br /> 1. The Concorde is at least as nimble as a Phantom ghost fighter 4 . <br /> <br /> 2. You can fire a flare gun at Mach 2 by simply opening the cockpit window and pulling out the arm. <br /> <br /> 3. If the flare gun does not discharge, do not drop it, as it may fire. <br /> <br /> 4. The Concorde can dodge up to two Sidewinder missiles fired at once. <br /> <br /> 5. A flare will distract a missile in search of heat each time. <br /> <br /> 6. Turning off your jet engines is a sure way to launch missiles that look out of place if heat fails 5 (above). <br /> <br /> 7. When making a forced landing on the Concorde, it is apparently impossible to get rid of your fuel beforehand. <br /> <br /> 8. The Concorde pilots are all veterans trained in combat. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, this movie is not very realistic. The effects are primitive by today's standards and that, along with the mindless acrobatics performed by the Concorde, makes this a film that deserves little but disdain. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Not recommended at all!
