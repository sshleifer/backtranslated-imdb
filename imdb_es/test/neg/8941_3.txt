As much as I like trains, I could not stand this movie. The premise that one could steal a locomotive and "drive" from Arkansas to Chicago without colliding with another train on the road has to be up to the dotted line of Impossible Plot. Imagine two dissatisfied NASA employees who steal the "tracker" that takes the ferries from one place to another and take it to New York and the idea comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it's a good try. Wilford Brimely is at his best in Quaker Oats, and Levon Helm performs well as his foolish but well-intentioned partner. Bob Balaban is a suitable worm as the Corporate Man, and the story of the "small assumes Goliath" is transmitted again.
