Another television program becomes a movie. Steve {The Office} Carell plays stupid actor Maxwell Smart in a movie so bad that it makes the worst movie you've ever seen become the second worst movie you've ever seen. The story of the seventh, if you can call it has a megalomaniac who tries to conquer the world. It's so funny, it's absolutely pathetic. Almost everything Anne Hathaway does as agent 99 is to look good, she seems incapable of doing anything else. Bill Murray has the good sense to limit his screen time to about 90 seconds, and some faces of the television series appear in very small roles. The movie is supposed to be part of a thriller and an action movie. It is none. Even though I was not really a fan of the television series, at least I was light years away from this piece of shit. All this is dragging through dirt and cheapen the good memories we have of him. Thank God, Don Adams is not here to see it. Keep it up Hollywood! Keep doing fucking movies like this and keep sending them to multiplexes weekly. It is not surprising that the film industry goes through the tubes. This movie is so rotten, it's not even good for laughter. If this movie were a newspaper, it could be used to cover the bottom of a bird cage. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. A root canal is more pleasant than this. Rating- zero minus five stars. Unless you're a masochist, stay away. Better yet, do what the title says: be smart and save your nine dollars. You can buy about 2 gallons of gasoline with it. Put it in your car and thank you it was not wasted going to a multiplex to see this bomb!
