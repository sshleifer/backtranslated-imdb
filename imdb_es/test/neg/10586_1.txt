It's not unusual for Hollywood to like to throw crappy movies. Once in a while, a handful of good movies come out of them, while most just suck. It is also not surprising that these bad movies are retreated from old television series. Every once in a while a surprise appears with "The Fugitive" (who saw coming to the Best Film of Oscar?), But for each "Fugitive", there is a McHale's Navy or some other totally original film that lacks argument or interest. The modulation squadron, in my opinion, enters my list of the ten really lousy films, in which Hollywood should receive the unfortunate thing for producing what could have been a good movie. We change right into the middle of a story that just does not seem to make sense, wastes talent, and dialogue is just bad. Actually, we do not know who the hell these characters are, and we could give you an idea of ​​what they are. Instead, they are expected to know automatically who they are and what they are going to do. There is a particularly bad riff, on the line "I'm too old for this s ** t", that's just stupid. Something that my friend noticed verbally when we were asking for the film to end. It's just an insult to Hollywood movies. Grade: F-
