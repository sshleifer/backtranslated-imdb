This movie should never have been made! It stinks, it's horrible, it's not good, it's bad, it's terrible. Starting to see a pattern here? Jackie Mason is certainly not Rodney Dangerfield. They disappeared Ted Knight and Bill Murray, who, along with Dangerfield, were essential for the first film. It seems that the three (the stars) all knew a stinky script when they saw it. The one who did not have the sense to withdraw from this was Chevy Chase, who remained, but in my opinion was alien to both films. This movie is just NOT FUNNY. Nor does it have other endearing qualities. This depends largely on anti-Semitism to function and works to the detriment. I hated this thing. A waste of time for everyone.
