If you plan to see "Companion" and you're in IMDb reading reviews about this, you've already wasted too much time with this stupid, idiotic, horrible movie. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible, horrible, horrible copy. from the movie 'Hitch'. I choose to ignore all the other negative warnings and criticisms I had heard about this movie, and wasted a precious 20 minutes on it. I thought that, after all, it is David Dhawan who is doing it, and he has Govinda. How bad can it be? ? But after 20 minutes of seeing this nonsense, I could not take it anymore, and I turned off my computer. <br /> <br /> Standing out for everyone in the movie, stupid dialogues, total loss of time, I gave you a 1-Star Rating because that's the lowest you can do. If I could go down, I would have given it a rating of -100.
