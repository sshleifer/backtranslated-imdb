What we have here is the standard Disney direct sequel to DVD, where I would expect the cribs to be cut out in all areas, which results in a good animated movie that does not reach the original. That does not mean that this is a terrible movie, it's just that it's a very mediocre movie full of messages of preaching with the intention of showing children the virtues of friendship and being kind to others and, unless it's done in a subtle way (which is not here). ) can quickly become a grid for adults. The film has a very thin plot with Kronk trying to win his father's approval and ending up finding the true meaning of wealth and success. This has its moments of comedy, but it really is not enough to bring a long film.
