I am and have been a serious collector of Christmas-related movies, TV shows, holiday specials, etc., for more than twenty-five years. Please pay attention to my warning and do not be fooled by the excellent reviews and media hype about this movie. This is not a Muppett movie, as we have come to know, and it certainly is NOT for children. The fact that this has occurred for an important television network was not a surprise considering its level of operation at this time. What I find hard to believe is that Jim Henson's organization crouched low enough to involve me in this Christmas parody. I wish I had read comments that warned me before wasting my money on this piece. of garbage.
