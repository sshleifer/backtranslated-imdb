Thank God for the DVR and the high speed of its fast forward. Even with that I could not take more of that farce. When they met the old Indian who asked for beans, I gave up and erased it. Is this the best thing that the SciFi Channel can offer for Saturday nights? How about some old classics instead? The idea of ​​a coed special forces unit was pretty bad. It seems they wanted to save money by having everything filmed in the forest. What more can I say? It was so horrible that I do not think I can find enough lines to qualify for the space to review it. But, it seems that one more line will do it. Save your time, let alone your money on this dog from a movie.
