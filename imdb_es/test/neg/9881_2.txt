My first impression when I read the synopsis of the next movie was that it was going to be very, very different from the book. The movie trailer said the film is supposed to take place when Vivian is 19 years old after her parents died in a fire in the United States. Meet Aiden, an aspiring graphic novelist. Working in a chocolate shop in the day, you must accept that it will never be normal, because with each full moon it becomes an amalgam, a mythical creature thought for the future that can be compared to a werewolf. <br /> <br /> Most of the little changes did not sound so bad to me, even though I'm a fan of the book with the title shared by Annette Curtis Klause. I knew it would be different, but I wanted to see it to support the book, thinking that an age change, a configuration change and some small changes of occupation would not have an impact on the story as a whole enough to make me want to break . My eyes were out of their sockets and I left bleeding in the cinema. <br /> <br /> The film unnecessarily killed many important characters, one of them is Esme, Vivan's mother, in the fire that was supposed to have killed her father. I pushed that aside and ventured into the movie, tired and a little annoyed. Running through Romania, the camera angles were decent, the scenery was beautiful and the music was ... interesting ... but it left me with the impression of "Why does Vivian look like this and why does she wear a sweatshirt with Hood?" ? "Jumping into later parts of the film, I must say that I am surprised that the writers seemed to support incest in a way and instead of sticking to the character relationship of the book between Vivian and Rafe, the leader of The Five now became in its protagonist, cousin through it (surprise!) Aunt Astrid, who, in the novel, was the bitter and hated rival of Vivan's mother, and, I may add, is not related to any of them. /> <br /> At first out of character distortions, Gabriel had somehow become the leader of the pack and had become obsessed with Vivian being his companion so that they could fulfill some non-existent prophecy. he only took 180 percent of the book's description, but, apparently, he was also Rafe's father, yes, it's true, it's a nice little knot of incestuous wolves, all tight. <br /> <br /> The little things that bothered me They were scenes like forest hunting. There was a redhead who stood out from the rest of the crowd, the one who "kissed his enemy" before his prey was released to run and be hunted. Why was she there? Why did she look like Astrid? I guess my mind is not vast enough to understand why that character had to exist in the movie without any explanation of WHY it existed, apart from kissing the beautiful victims. <br /> <br /> I loved the way the Ameba was completely cut out of the movie. I loved the way Aiden's past was legally intertwined, between the supposedly dramatic scene in which he told Vivian how his father wanted him to learn self-defense and then beat his father "in self-defense" to make it look like that. . a tragic character. <br /> <br /> The 180 are very funny when they are completely unnecessary. At the end of the film, I felt like a person flipped through the novel, wrote down half of the list of character names, drew some connections here and there, mentioned that Gabriel was a bit of an idiot, Vivian fell in love with Aiden, fears her when she discovers that she is an amalgam of legends, and "someone" is "killed by a silver bullet" and there is a happy ending because Vivian finally feels accepted by someone who loves her. Who is she. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2/10 because the camera shots were relatively decent, and the casting could have been worse, but in regards to the direction, why give the great jump? in the air in human form as if they wanted to fly (with their bows and the inclination to jump from high places), shine briefly and then fall to the ground like wolves. The only aspects of this film that even made me see the very sordid and unfortunate ending were the wolves, the beautiful landscape and the boys with the sweet eyes. <br /> <br /> All together, I must say that to enjoy this film, one must be prepared for the misconceptions, the strange events that are not always explained, the incestuous innuendoes and they did not like the book or not They have read the book.
