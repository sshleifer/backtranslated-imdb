I kept hoping that this film would improve, but, this is the worst escapist film: a confection of spun sugar that sinks under the weight of its own great importance. The rhythm wobbles like a legionary stranded in the Sahara. The absence of a good dialogue leaves attractive stars with little to do other than look good in white linen. Irons plays another wealthy charmer who has had a touch of sunshine. Kaas is a nice singer, but not a great actress. Luckily, the script does not usually ask him to emote away from the jazz club's microphone. All enviable, relaxed, beautiful and unnecessary characters take turns chewing the landscape with an air of tired sophistication. The entire exercise appears as an endless advertisement for Ralph Lauren. <br /> <br /> If you are over forty years old and you think that francophilia is the key to sophistication, you can confuse this piece of cardboard with a baguette. Well, if you liked this movie, you probably felt smart to appreciate Ã‰loge de l'amour, Godard's protagonist, and you could even have sat in Le Divorce without shrinking.
