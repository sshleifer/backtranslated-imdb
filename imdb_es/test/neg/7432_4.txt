Mainly a biography of a lustful doctor, "Robert Merney", (Robert Downey) who has his way into the royal palace during the first half of the film and then helps the oppressed in the second half, mainly "Katharine" (Meg Ryan ). <br /> <br /> The GOOD thing: the fantastic decoration of the stage (that is to say, the palace of the exuberant king) and the clothes make of this a visual event. The language is also very docile. Ian McKellen and Hugh Grant provide interesting support. <br /> <br /> The BAD: after 50-60 minutes, this movie just gets too boring. It was desperately needed to be given a little spark after an hour, but it does the opposite: it goes on again and again. The script certainly needed a much-needed "restoration", would we say? The movie may look good, but it's two long hours to sit ... too long.
