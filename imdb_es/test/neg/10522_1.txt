Even my five-year-old son was bored. <br /> <br /> Very predictable and exaggerated. This movie could not decide if it was a slapstick or an ironic comment about the state of sports "pee -wee". <br /> <br /> The characters were underdeveloped, they could have done more with the connection between the father and the son came from an orphanage. <br /> <br /> I did not like the reference about the goalkeeper who passes the laxative to his teammate ... very mean for a child's movie. <br /> <br /> The typical behavior of the "mafia" was boring and stereotyped. <br /> <br /> The dog, however, was so cute!
