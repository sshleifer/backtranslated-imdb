So many great actors, so little worth seeing. But with a script that misses a lot of what it did to the special book, I do not hold it against anyone on the screen. Although defective, the book was one of the only ones from Grisham that I really liked, especially how it captured the flavor of a small city in the deep south, a world slightly different from a coastal urbanite like me. I also loved the naturalness, the naturalness of what happens in the book. In the film, the characters are given a "nobility" of personality that seemed so forced. The villains and the plates are flat and 1 dimensional. But as with much of Joel Schumacher's work, authenticity and authenticity are notoriously absent, and each point must be delivered through hammer to the middle section. Therefore, favorite, forced and superficial about such a horrible tragedy, I would like someone to make a remake and make the story a bit more correct.
