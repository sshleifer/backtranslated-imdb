At the dawn of human civilization, the cavemen sat and made jokes, hit each other with everything they could grab, and women were never seen and apparently had tails. These cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey, but not women. This film tells the "hilarious" misadventures of seven (more or less) cavemen, having burned their land with the new discovery of fire, going through the water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendix. Along the way, we have "as good" comedy moments as a fat caveman who swallows a frog that keeps croaking in his stomach. A monkey throwing stones at their heads. A man who swallows a mouse to put the frog in his stomach. The obligatory "gay caveman". The list could go on and on. This movie is the very definition of the movie dreck. I got bored from the beginning and it only got worse when the cavemen went around hitting each other, making bad jokes, like puns in the word perch, hitting each other, and attacking poor Seta Berger, who looks like who lost a bet for a producer. to appear in this nonsense. She is in fact one of the two bright spots in this movie. She is not a great actress, so you have to guess why she's a jerk. The other "bright" point is music. As soon as I heard the result, I told myself that it sounded very familiar to me. I had never heard the real score, but the music was unequivocally that of Ennio Morricone. It is a good score and the best in an otherwise raw, boring, lascivious, unimaginative and ridiculous film, essentially about a group of Moes that meets a woman for the first time and, first wishing to eat her like an animal, learning what could do. Awwwwh! I'm sorry, I'm drowning a yawn while I relive the plot! The end of the film has about 100 mostly naked women on the screen with all the erotic sensation of tearing a crust from the knee. This movie was painful to sit on and offers no real merit at all. The fact that it has generated a sequel does not surprise me, since it offers that one thing that will awaken the viewer's interest: the tail.
