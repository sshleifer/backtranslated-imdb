The stealing of Jaws is the most trash of all the Italian "genres", and the director Joe D'Amato is the second after the great Jess Franco in the production of garbage films. Put the two together and what do you get? A gigantic piece of garbage, of course. Unfortunately, it is not crap in the good sense of the word either, since Deep Blood offers more boredom than hilarity. To credit the movie, actually try something that skirts a plot; But to take that credit away from the movie, the plot is trash. It has something to do with a group of friends who make an oath (of friendship) and then an Indian curse that manifests itself in a shark. Or at least I think that's what was happening. Anyway, most of the film is completed with boring dialogues and "drama", and the shark itself, which we do not forget, is the only thing we really want to see, is in a merely popular role. Or not even that, since most sharks are actually archival footage! Despite being a garbage genre, there are actually a lot of funny Jaws scams; but with this, Joe D'Amato makes it clear that he could not even bother trying, and the result is what must be the worst Italian shark movie of all time. Avoid this scum.
