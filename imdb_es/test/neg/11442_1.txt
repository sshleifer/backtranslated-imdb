"Catchfire" or "Backtrack", as it is sometimes called, is not very good. That is, it is bad. Jodie Foster had already won an Oscar at this time. Why did she agree to do this? I dont know. <br /> <br /> The hostage / kidnapping relationship is not credible, even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, this film tells a scene in which Hopper and Foster travel in a boat under the Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle), which means that the traffic had to stop so that the bridge could open. I had to wait for the bridge to come down many times, almost everyone on the bus. It is not a pleasant wait. This film caused an unnecessary wait for bridges and the world is a worse place for her.
