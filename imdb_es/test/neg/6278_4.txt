I'm not a big fan of the Spielberg / Cruise version of this movie. And so I should throw myself with the humblest version of Latt / Howel. Thomas Howel had more heart and more sympathy than Cruise in the lead role (at least in my opinion). Now, this is hard to imagine until you eliminate everything in the Spielberg version that costs more than a thousand dollars. Nothing would be left, neither special effects, nor sets, nor Cruise. Because I doubt that something costs more than a grand prize in David Michael Latt's version. So, comparing apples with turnips, I think I have to go with the turnips. At least it gives independent films a chance in the epic sci-fi disaster market.
