OK, this movie was much worse than the first and the first one stank! The zombie makeup was extremely false! The acting is very poor! And it really does not follow the first one! While watching this, I kept thinking: the first is a masterpiece compared to this. I'd say take it on TV, do not waste your money on it! It's not the worst movie I've seen, but it's on the list. I started seeing him last night and I fell asleep, so I saw him today and almost fell asleep again! The plot did not make sense, I mean the fact that a small military group is sent on a mission to get the blood of the zombie leader and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop the zombies, but they did it where you I wanted everyone to die. They made a lot of bad guys that were really just annoying. If you ask me, this was a scam of the resident bad and not a good scam either. The plot could have done if the performance was good and if they really made you afraid to see what's behind the corner. With these zombies, my grandmother could have gone to that building and survived! From a 1-10 I give it a 2.
