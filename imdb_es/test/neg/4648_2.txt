Cameron Mitchell plays an actor who is dating a young actress who used to date the director of a movie studio (she's too young for both of them!). At a party, when he is lighting his cigarette, the head of the studio throws a drink with high alcohol content on his face and burns. In the hospital, his face is completely bandaged and he still lights a cigarette! He becomes the resident sculptor of the Movieland Wax Museum and Palace, where he also lights cigarettes! <br /> <br /> Mitchell recovers, more or less, after having really badly burned makeup on one side of his face that looks like gray spackle and tape, and a patch on the eye. When Mitchell is not smoking, he is killing people. Well, he only kills people sometimes, since he prefers to inject them with something that puts them in a kind of waxy coma. If you do not manage it regularly (and it seems you never remember it), they start to move around a little bit again, although they are in a kind of hypnotic zombie state. However, not all of his sculptures are people. Evidently, he has talent as a sculptor. <br /> <br /> The ending, which seems to have been hit from a much poorer impression than the rest of the movie, is really absurd. They seemed not to know what to do and returned to the title to get an idea. Apart from the strangely grainy final shots, the rest of the movie is in pretty good shape, except for the audio in some scenes that sounds as if it had been played through a speaker. Definitely not one of the best wax museum movies.
