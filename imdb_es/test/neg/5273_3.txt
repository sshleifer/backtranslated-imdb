Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly one of the best actors of the 90s. After his performances in The Usual Suspect, Se7en and American Beauty, you expect more and more of him. That's why Ordinary Decent Criminal is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Michael Lynch is the most witty criminal in Dublin who is never in a bad mood. His next robbery becomes an obsession when his teammates begin to question Michael's ability to plan everything perfectly, although this is the only thing he does when he is not playing with a good father at home. <br /> <br /> I guess it's partly my fault for not paying enough attention to the thousand details of the plot that sadly turn out to be the "essence" of the movie. I gave the movie a shot calling it parody and ... well, parodies are always fun, no matter what they do or how they do it. So, it was not after all a complete parody on purpose. It's just a different scam that desperately tries to be fun and fails. <br /> <br /> Unlike some of his "colleagues", Ordinary Decent Criminal depends too much on the development of the story and logical continuity, forgetting what the main reason is, the viewer has chosen this type of movie to entertain himself . This is definitely not entertainment. It includes one of the most ridiculous scenes in history: the introduction of Michael's TWO wives. I do not know if it's a meaningless metaphor or a strange and dark humor, but the girls are sisters. Remember, Spacey's character has children. <br /> <br /> The ordinary decent criminal is complex and confusing. You are not waiting for a funny scene. Instead, carefully follow the dialogue, because there is a great possibility of getting lost in the boring and pale universe, the film has inhabited. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to Spacey. I wonder what condition he has been in, signing for that movie. It is not evil, but something much worse. An insult to his work on American Beauty, released a year before Ordinary Decent Criminal. Michael's character is eccentric and talkative. Spacey is almost pathetic at times. The only cure for this is to think of Lester Burnham and Roger Kint. <br /> <br /> The writer, Gerrard Stembridge should definitely re-consider his screen writing skills and be more objective this time. Because, the dialogue is very weak and the scenes often do not make sense. And we're still talking about a comedy. <br /> <br /> Ordinary Decent Criminal is a very bad comedy about crimes that does not deserve your attention.
