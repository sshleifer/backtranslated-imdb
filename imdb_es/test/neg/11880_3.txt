What a stupid waste of money! 30,000 square feet of rebuilt ancient Rome, 2 million cubic meters of buildings 50 feet high, 10,000 costumes, 2 years of works, an International Committee of Ancient History (sic!), Some actors and first class actresses. The final result? An empty TV movie for a single-digit IQ assistance.
