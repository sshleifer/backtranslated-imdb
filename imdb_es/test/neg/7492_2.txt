What trash, really there is no part II? If this movie really ends like it did, everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. This movie does not look like anything like a movie like Outbreak, which was actually a pretty decent movie. This movie was rushed with the hope of being able to earn a few easy dollars. I started watching the movie under the assumption that it would be bad, but I never imagined it would be so bad. This movie was just a way to exploit the fears of the American people for profit! If you have not seen this movie, do not bother. The movie is full of poorly developed characters and bad acting. I really hope that the production of this film was only a couple of weeks. Keep away! Do not be fooled by exaggerations!
