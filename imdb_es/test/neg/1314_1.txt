I would have thought, given the cost of this heap of exaggerated garbage, that the budget could have been extended to a decent scriptwriter. Instead, they seemed to have opted for a plot and a dialogue from the Hollywood movie 'Paint by Numbers' standard bog. The only cliché that seems to have been lost was that of Cute Kid. But everyone else is there. There is the bad-tempered hero, united by fate with both his ex-wife and his estranged father. There is the loving dad and the rebellious teenager. There's the "Professor who all thought he was wrong until it turned out that he did not" (played horribly by the usually excellent Tom Courtney who seems to be in the grip of some powerful drugs), plus the comic duo wandering the desert underground train . <br /> <br /> I sat down to see this full of anticipation. The cast is, as noted, incredible. However, in a few minutes it became clear how bad this was going to be. Things of this useless must come with a warning. Something along the lines of: <br /> <br /> 'This film may have been made in Britain but aimed at the US market. Therefore, it contains tired clichés, common characters, forced dialogues and a plot so unintelligent and simplistic that even George W. Bush could understand it. "<br /> <br /> Avoid.
