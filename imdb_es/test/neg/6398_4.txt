"Blame it on Rio" is a style of romantic comedy of the 80s, with more than one eye full of sex throughout its 101 minutes. <br /> <br /> The argument concerns two middle-aged men in crisis, one of them is classifying through his divorce, the other deals with the possibility of that same perspective. Both good friends, decide to take a vacation in the exotic Rio de Janeiro, each with a daughter by his side. Complications appear when one of them becomes involved with the other's daughter. <br /> <br /> This potential disturbance of a story is quite funny and there are some good lines, however, it never becomes hilarious, as it could have done. Any attempt to handle the moral problem seriously does not work either, and maybe Director Donen should have gotten stuck in the mood of the situation. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, but what really ruins it is how horrible Michelle Johnson is. Acting as Jennifer's naughty little temptress. While she uses her body to profit, it is the only thing she has. Michelle's acting skill leaves a lot to be desired. No wonder we have not seen it in anything else. <br /> <br /> Friday 7 January 1994 - Video
