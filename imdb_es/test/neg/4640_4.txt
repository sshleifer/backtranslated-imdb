Another day: this movie requires you to see it another day to understand it. I really enjoy watching Shannen Doherty and I was very interested to see how well Julian McMahon and Shannen appeared together following the roles they played in Charmed. I can certainly PRAISE the acting skills throughout the film, including the direction, but the plot ... what happened? I do not have words because I'm still confused. I have to be loyal to the actors who really did a good job considering the madness of the plot. I also have to recommend that you look at it because, despite the madness of the plot, I would still see it again and again.
