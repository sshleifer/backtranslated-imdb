The worst Wrestlemania in history. <br /> <br /> This did not have to see fights and many crap. This happened in Las Vegas and WWE had its employees dress like Egyptian gods! They even changed the name of Howard Finkels to Finkus Maximus, which probably means nothing. The sight of seeing Jim Ross in that terrible dress still gives me nightmares to this day and I am 21 years old, so you can imagine it when I was 7 years old! However, Bobby Heenan was fun. <br /> <br /> Matches included The Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales in a poor match *, The Headshrinkers vs. The Steiner Brothers in a useless match, Doink vs. Crush in a comedy game and a boring match With Razor Ramon vs Bob Backlund. Hulk Hogan joined Brutus Beefcake to fight Money Inc. You could clearly see that Hogan had a black eye. In regards to the story, Ted DiBiase and the IRS hit Hogan while playing poker or something like that at the casinos, which is a poor story, but in reality, Mandy Man's Randy Savage hit Hogan because Savage believes that it's like The Hulk (no pun)) No, not the fighter, but the character in the movie. <br /> <br /> The main event was that Bret 'Hitman' Hart faced Yokozuna in a very boring main event match. Mr. Fuji threw salt in Hart's face and Yoko won, but not until Hogan came down and crushed Yoko in 21 seconds. <br /> <br /> General Grade - E
