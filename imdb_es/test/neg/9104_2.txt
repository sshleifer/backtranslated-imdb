This movie was bad on many levels. The writing was horrible, so even the best actors could not have made this film visible. It's a shame because they had some good actors in this movie. I mean, if someone had seen any of the movies in the Police Academy, he would know that Steve Guttenberg was good. His character in this movie was very serious, which was a big difference from the characters that had seen him play before, so that was an advantage. And I thought Steve Guttenberg was extremely good at this movie. With or without the shirt you can not deny that it has a GREAT body! Sexy face too. I loved the 5 o'clock shadow, it made it look dangerous. In one part of the film, he is lying on the bed without his shirt and I have to say that he would gladly have jumped there and tried to stop thinking about his problems. So, honestly, I would see this movie just to fantasize!
