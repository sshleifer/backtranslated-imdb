I saw this movie with great expectations. The propaganda on the back indicated that it was going to be unpleasant. But it was quite docile and a little unsatisfactory. The violence was not anything I have not seen a thousand times before, the general level was only average (keep in mind that there is probably more than what has been seen in Hollywood in the last 5 years, maybe more), and at no time I went even feeling uncomfortable getting carried away scared. Again, a CAT 3 film with large wrappers has not lived up to its expectations. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that you hire this movie, but do not enter with expectations. I really want to get into the whole Asian horror scene, but I'm constantly disappointed. I loved Ichi and Audition, but, again, Miike is alone at this moment. <br /> <br /> Please, inspire me ... there is a large group of jaded genre fans who are hungry for quality horror!
