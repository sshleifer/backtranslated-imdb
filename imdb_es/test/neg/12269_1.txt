I love watching Australian movies, but this pile of smoking garbage was just embarrassing. The cover of the DVD seemed promising, but you know what they say, do not judge a DVD by its cover. <br /> <br /> I also noticed that he won Best Actor for a prize, but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic. It seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he really should focus on one part of the making of films and do it well before spreading too much. The music was pretty ordinary. The story really did not go anywhere. It was just a sequence of fights linked by a bad script and a cheesy dialogue. <br /> <br /> However, I will say this to all aspiring filmmakers. Watch this movie It will give you hope that your movie will win something at some festival. <br /> <br /> However, it is good for them to enter and be successful. I hope you have learned some lessons and that your next adventure is a little better.
