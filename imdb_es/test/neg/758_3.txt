It's not just that the movie is lame. It is more than that. This movie is simply unnecessary. Do we need another western? How about a western with African Americans in the title roles? Does it sound stupid, implausible and a boring attempt to modernize the genre? It is. Incredibly lame and simple minded. It's like the film "Romeo and Juliet" by Baz Luhrman, in which, in modern times, it attracted young people and created some enthusiasm with its renovation of a classic story. Well, Baz Luhrman failed miserably and this disaster too. The story is not really bad, however, the whole idea of ​​eliminating racism from a racist genre when casting an African-American cast is racist in itself. It is also childish and simple (as Baz Luhrman-man is a bad director). Hey (I hear you say) this was directed by Mario Van Peebles! He is also IN the movie! How can it be racist? It is not. I said that the idea of ​​choosing all African Americans instead of Caucasians was. The film is not racist, it is useless, stupid and very boring.
