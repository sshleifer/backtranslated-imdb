It does not mean that this movie is good. I was really frustrated by that on many levels. It's something like the tip of the bukowski hat. Hi, I read that guy in college, let's see what Matt Dillon does with him. and I like matt dillon. I thought it came close to looking a bit like a skein, but mostly just because of the reddish cheeks. However, I have to worry about a character, and there just was not much to worry about. I think that time can be cruel for bukowski, and that bothers me a lot, because the writing was solid in a kind of post-show culture time. Difficult to sit, scenes that went nowhere, and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit. I ask very little, I have less.
