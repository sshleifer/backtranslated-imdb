I'm sorry, but I can not understand what people smoked when they wrote how well they thought "Ethan Mao" was. I've seen better acting, character development and plotting in pornos! WARNING: I will give a key element to the "plot". After holding his family hostage during the night, Ethan lets his vile, evil and hated stepmother go to the bank - ONLY !!! - to retrieve the piece of jewelry from his deceased mother that he so desperately wants. Guess what? She calls the police! Wow ... what a turn! I could not see it at all. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was that it lasted less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Pure and unadulterated garbage!
