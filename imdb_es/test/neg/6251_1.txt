Even as a big fan of horror genre from low to no budget, I could not find this mess slightly fun. With a horrible performance, a painfully generic "plot" and no dimensional characters, no matter how boring and drunk you are, this is not worth your 81 minutes. Do not make the same mistake as me. Rent something else. Anything else!!!
