This film gave a completely new meaning to that worn-out phrase "like seeing dry paint" because it was "like seeing paint dry in the middle of a monsoon". <br /> <br /> I was attracted to the film because of its location on the west coast of Portugal that I visited. It is a beautifully beautiful place and the black and white introduced a new dimension to beauty. That was the only good thing. The story was frighteningly banal and, frankly, you have to have some history. <br /> <br /> A film crew runs out of film and the whole team has to wait. Well, a wait is a wait. I can wait for a bus number 15 on Princes Street in Edinburgh, I can spend hours at a remote train station in the middle of nowhere on the cold Sunday afternoon of winter. However, the wait is boring and yes, this wait was also boring. <br /> <br /> So the leader goes to the United States to protest with the supplier of the film that punishes him for not doing all the color. After a series of arguments, two blessed bullets resound from anywhere and the expected end finally arrives, and not before time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I would watch this movie again if someone arms me with a couple of colored film cans so I can throw them on the screen.
