I just saw this old stinking kettle on television. Better seen with a large jug of jungle juice from Dr. Jurd on hand, this cheese festival is extremely fun. On the positive side (very thin), Raquel was at her best physical moment, she looks good, and you can see a bit of her, since she plays a go-go dancer; She had big legs, that's for sure. There is also a small interest for screen fans in the images of Los Angeles ca. '69, and in the detection of actors in minor parts that followed better things. Veteran actor Ron Rifkin ('Brothers and Sisters') offers an early performance as "Sailor," the bartender of the "butterfly addict" who tells Raquel he is the bad guy. It is also possible that he recognizes the security guard with firearms in the escape and flight scene: it is a very early appearance of Gordon Jump, who gave such a lovely performance in 'Soap' as Piece of Chelief Tinkler. <br /> <br /> The 'plot' of 'Flareup', as it is, follows the tribulations of an exotic dancer (Welch) fleeing his murderous ex-husband (Luke Askew). This turkey is a classic of the Hollywood sludge production line: a paint script by numbers, pedestrian direction, Hokey shots, editions and effects, music in stock ultra cheesy, plywood sets and performances that combine. > The cast is as frightening as the script. Even though Raquel is able to have a good performance in the right vehicle, this old and old fucked is so bad that she does not have a chance, and neither does the audience. One of my favorite moments happens when Rachel wakes up in the hospital, sees the Las Vegas police who are chasing her former killer and asks "How did you get here?" - to which of course he answers "On a plane". Oh, humanity ... And you can not take your eyes off the doctor (Michael Rougas), who has what could well be one of the worst comments in the long and sad history of bad cameos. I think I've never seen anyone standing in one place before. <br /> <br /> Joe (James Stacy), Rachel's love, walks through the movie with a fixed gaze that is somewhere between bewildered and embarrassed. - And no wonder. This bomb puts the cast through all the clich√©s made for television in the book, from the spectacular and terrible turn of Raquel in the terrible montage of nightmares, to the pure imbroglio of the "romantic" walk along the Leo beach Priced. <br /> ** Spoiler Warning **: almost the only interesting thing about the whole movie is the ending, in which Raquel finally gets her own back, and hilariously promulgates the title by setting fire to the bad guy. Whoever the trick wins his money in this case, rises like Yorba Linda in a heat wave. However, even this rather spectacular scene is compromised by the fact that one of the crew members is nearing the end. <br /> <br /> There are so many shitty things in 'Flareup' that are strangely convincing; I found myself wondering if this could be one of the worst movies I've seen. The answer seemed to be a resounding 'Yes' ... until I saw the movie that followed, the classic 'The Big Doll House' by Roger Corman, the 'classic' mega-trash, which takes Awful to a whole new level . I can wholeheartedly recommend these two shlockers as a double bill. You will laugh at yourself silly.
