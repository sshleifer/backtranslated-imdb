I'm a fan of the horror movie, regardless of the hemisphere it comes from. I know what to expect from the West, the East and most of the horrors in between. So I received the 'Acacia' DVD in the post and I waited for the tension to increase and the increasingly fearful children with strange and disconnected movements that hide under the quilts. <br /> <br /> The main point of sale for this film was that it has a much more linear story line than many of these people: you know who the characters are, where they are from and what they do. You get the reference information (good couple, I can not have children) and you realize that the premise is too normal for something strange to NOT happen. <br /> <br /> And then comes the bad. The number one complaint is that the story is OBVIOUS. I understood it almost at the moment when the child embraced the tree. I knew where the movie was going and I could even predict the order of death and for what reason. <br /> <br /> The edition is shocking and, unfortunately, does not benefit the film. Even when I was still thinking about the events, you can not increase the tension because the director seems to have gotten a new editing suite for his birthday and wanted to use it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> And my final The complaint is this ... the tree was unnecessary. This would have been a perfectly good story of subtle horror with only the couple that collapsed because of the child's death: the titular tree did not give anything new or exciting to the film. So I'll finish where I started, my general impression was "Oh."
