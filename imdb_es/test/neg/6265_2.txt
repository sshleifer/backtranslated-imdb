Stop me if it's hard this time, some cheerleaders, your trainer and a couple of guys are trapped inside a cabin in the woods when an invisible killer kills them one by one. What a shame, after I wrote totally to Jim Wynorski after the horrible "Busty Cops" (it came a long time, since his last really good movie was "Hard to Die" in the 1990s). a supposed sequel to "Slumber Party Massacre".
