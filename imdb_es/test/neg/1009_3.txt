This movie lacked credibility for two reasons. One, no mayor of a major city, and New York is certainly as important as it gets. It would allow a county in your city to degenerate into such a violent place to live; especially for voters who might have a lot to say about their job security in the future. All the victims in the film were mostly elderly, Jewish or defenseless. At 62 years of age, I've never seen a movie that shows as much disrespect for authority as this movie did. Even "Escape from New York", which was fictitious, in front, that is, they told you that this was science fiction, did not resort to such profound violence. In this film, most of the elderly victims were victimized and still had weapons but were not willing to use them. Also, in this film and I have not seen the two previous ones, it is more illegal than the movie "Escape". Second, gangs, to the extent that my research shows, have never been as cooperative as this movie does. On the one hand, they catch a gang member from another gang that works in their area and he is killed. However, when the heroes begin firing at local gangsters, the next gang is welcome with open arms. Members of outside gangs are always seen as outsiders and are detained. We are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs want to get involved. Why did outside gangs come to help? I think more than one gang from outside came to help. What did they come for? Another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why do jail fellows ask permission to attack the Bronson character? This was not a great movie and I could continue, but I will not.
