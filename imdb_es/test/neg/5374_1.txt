Initially I tuned in with Paranormal State because (more or less) I find that the genre of paranormal search is interesting for television, if nothing else. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy Ghost Hunters because more than half of her research results in total discredit, and she finds Most Haunted to be hilarious with her use of middling and moody British women with Paris Hilton Parisian eyes that they faint from fear / demonic presences, all with a beautiful green night vision. State does not have any of this resource. It feels like it's improvised from "clues" that the Ghost Hunters rejected. The episodes ranged from trailer families and single mothers with emo teenagers sitting and panicking, to an "interview" with a 5-year-old about the monster that lives in his room (the monster says RAWRRR, they tell us). All these people ask a university club to solve their problems. The whole show is about Ryan and his partner, his huge ego. He directs his group of men from all over the world, except when a case is considered "too extreme" and orders them to stay at the HAHAHA hotel. It is better to leave it in the hands of the professionals, that is, of himself. <br /> <br /> The involuntary comedy of this show is as gullible as the participants are. Ryan tells his stories of being hunted, followed, etc. by a demon who met for the first time when the Catholic Church recruited him to help him in a case. I'm sorry, but the Catholic Church has people who can do that, they do not need the day shift manager at Quiznos to pay their 2 cents. <br /> <br /> This show is horrible, it's a shame for A & E for its funds. This stupidity, trying to follow the steps of some much better paranormal programs. It's almost funny unintentionally, except that Ryan is so arrogant and lacking in charisma that watching the show enough to make fun of him is not worth it.
