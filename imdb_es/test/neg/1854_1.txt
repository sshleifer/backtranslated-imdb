It's hard to imagine that two actors of this kind and experience like Michael Caine and Michael Gambon get involved in such an inept movie. The responsibility of this misjudged production must be the writer, Neil Jordan and the director, Conor McPherson. I doubt I've seen such a bad movie with such good credits in a long time. The comedian, Dylan Moran, who left his mark as the irritable and incompetent owner of the bookstore on the television series, Blackbooks, becomes the same routine here, except with such excess and lack of comic control that it leaves one writhing. It is easy to see how the story could have been made to work, since the situation is interesting and full of comic potential. A classic actor (Caine) tries to cheat the mafia (Gambon and company) with the assistant of a crazed colleague (Moran), with predictable results. It could have been and should have been good. Unfortunately, it was not like that.
