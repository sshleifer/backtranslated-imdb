This was a horrible and miserable movie based on sublimated male fantasies. A shame that it was based in Texas, an otherwise excellent state. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I wish it had never entered my consciousness, since now I am so irritated that I wasted my brain cells even paying the least attention.
