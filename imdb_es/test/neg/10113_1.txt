I do not even understand what they tried to achieve with this movie, I really mean it. Do you have this guy running away from a group of cats, because he's dead, but to be really dead, this girl has to shoot them? And they leave a corpse even though normal people can not see them because they are dead? The script already has a hole the size of Nebraska, then you have the main character played by Susan Paterno, who has just made drones in his lines with a monotonous and boring voice and with so little emotion in his face that he could have starred in a robot female terminator. It's absolutely horrendous and I do not even understand how I managed to see it until the end of the movie. The ending is as stupid as the whole movie, and without any reward for the viewer. They could also have called this movie "the little movie that could choo-choo ka-choo".
