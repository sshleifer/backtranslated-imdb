While I was watching this movie, I never thought I would defend it. He is honest enough from the beginning about not having a big plot. There are no real characters to cling to, except the killer. Some of the performances may be better, but most are capable. <br /> <br /> I know, a three out of ten is not stellar, but there are reviews that say it was filmed poorly and completely useless, etc. I think he set out to do what he's supposed to do pretty well. Lighting is minimal at times, more natural than most audiences are used to, but it is supposed to look like a camcorder film. In fact, sometimes the quality is probably too high to be true to that, but no one would do it with the camera work minutes that are really so bad. <br /> <br /> It is not particularly scary, but it is. annoying sometimes. There are one or two characters that are not considered so believable at all and the soundtrack sometimes gets tired, but in general it was created cleaner than a lot of camcorder movies.
