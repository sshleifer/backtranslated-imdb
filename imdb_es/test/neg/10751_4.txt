Low budget murder mystery about a Public Defender trying to clean his client of a murder he had been convicted of 12 years earlier. To complicate matters is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction, but the PD believes that the man is innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer. Gig Young as the PD is fine, and James Anderson as the convicted killer is pretty good, but the whole picture just runs off with little suspense and, despite some good character actors in the cast, the performances are usually below Of the level. Director George Archainbaud was apparently more at home doing westerns (he was producing the Gene Autry television series in Columbia at this time), but even if he had tried to inject some vitality into this image, the hacking script would have defeated his attempts. In the best of cases, the film climaxes with a scene in the courtroom that comes out of an episode of "Perry Mason" and is so predictable.
