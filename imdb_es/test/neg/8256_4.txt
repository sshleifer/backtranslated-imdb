I bought this movie because I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that the performance is not of a high level. Stephen Baldwin makes his character look almost delayed at times and other times moody. Patsy Kensit is regular, but not too convincing in some scenes, and the supposed poetry that spits out in a particular scene in your hotel room is pointless nonsense. Ms. Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here, but ultimately, I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this movie. Mrs. Rubins Character is initially innocent, then sexy, while playing the character of Stephen Baldwin (Travis) as a fool. The cast includes Adam Baldwin (no relation to his most famous counterparts) and M. Emmet Walsh, who has appeared in many movies, I also noticed that Art Evans was one of John Mclane's allies in Die Hard 2. The movie is decent and there it is. There are some nude scenes with Rubin & Kensit, a bit of action, but it's certainly not an intelligent or fast thriller. There is a particular scene when you are in the car about to commit a crime and the character of Stephen Balwin wears sunglasses and when you see him again, the area around his eyes, etc., is painted black, then the Sunglasses reappear later when they leave. The crime scene and the police chase him, a very obvious mistake in the edition. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of any of the ladies or Baldwin, then you can find something that you like here, but others should avoid it. This is a reasonable suspense movie but nothing remarkable and really is not worth more than a couple of dollars if you want.
