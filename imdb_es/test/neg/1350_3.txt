I saw him tonight and I fell asleep in the movie. <br /> <br /> That's something I have not done since then, I've never slept at the movies. <br /> <br /> I LOVE the original I've seen it several times and I recommend it to everyone. This may have been the problem, but I do not think so, because there were a couple of bright spots that showed that, if done right, they could have made this movie work. <br /> <br /> Bette had not been used and Anne had finished Used and misused. <br /> <br /> I do not know why English or any other person lets this happen in that condition. <br /> <br /> They considered it as a Sex in the city, but better? It's not an opportunity, I really liked Sex in the city and I was disappointed in this movie. <br /> <br /> So do not waste your money on this movie. Go see all this!
