First of all, I'm a fan of terror. But this "Tobe Hooper" production (come on, the chainsaw man and the original Texas Poltergeist!) Was below standards, even for a fan. The acting was not bad at all, some characters were incredible, but the main ladies were fine. The story was something we've already seen hundreds of times, without any surprising twists or whatever. Never exciting or intense, and do not have any special effects other than splashing blood. The fearsome zombie children are white faces with dark eyes and that's it. That could have worked in the early 70's, but not now. Director J.S. Cardone did not do a good job to maintain the suspense, halfway there is the risk that he falls asleep. My vote is mainly based on the main performance, but this could easily have been called Children Of The Corn 8: From The Corn Fields To The Mines ... Enough said ...
