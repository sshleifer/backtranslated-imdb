I have always said that there is nothing to beat the original form: comics. They have shown me the reason again. This, like all the other films about the Asterix series, did not impress. The creators of this film do not understand that what makes all the others such comics turned into movies (x-men, superman et al.) Is that they all deviate from the original versions of comics and adapt it to do so. more observable. Okay, this movie got sidetracked, in the sense that this movie was a cross of two Asterix books, viz. Asterix and the great crossing and Asterix and the Normans. In addition, not characteristic of the Asterix series (except Asterix and the secret weapon), a love interest was presented for one of the main characters. All he ended up doing was creating an immature childhood story. The funny parts were very few and far between. In short, a total loss of time and money watching this, much less in the theaters, even at home.
