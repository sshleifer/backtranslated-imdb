I saw this movie with a group of friends at the 1999 Melbourne International Film Festival and nobody had a good word. <br /> <br /> I love Bluegrass and country music, so it's not like I do it. I do not sympathize with the subject. But the problem is that deep down is a very conservative film, little more than a filmed story of Mills and Boon. A heartbreaking bodice of the most simple and soppy type. <br /> <br /> It's not just that the love story in your heart, that between Reece and Dr. Lily Penleric is more than a little unbelievable. (Why any man would be attracted to the fanatical nostril who devours Lily is beyond me, and frankly, Mike Harding as Reece seems to be just going through the motions). <br /> <br /> It's simply that the whole The film is too docile and well-educated for its own sake. There is little precious danger, dirt or drama. Surely there is a moment of "emotion" that involves a school run by Lily's younger sister, but this whole episode is more fun than dramatic (it's very badly written and performed). And the film betrays its conservative agenda in the way in which this secondary plot is solved. <br /> <br /> As for the good Reece Kinkaid (now, what about a name like Eberneezer Bumpass?) I ask! Is the end of this movie believable? Fitting with the character that this movie had previously built? I do not think so...
