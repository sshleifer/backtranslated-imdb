This is seriously the worst movie I've seen, from the beginning the movie goes downhill with its corny musical score, poor performance and total lack or real story or plot. Even for a B movie this is terribly bad. After reading some of the good reviews, I thought I would keep an open mind and see it. But all the bad reviews were so correct. I can not understand how anyone could have enjoyed it. I'm a big fan of science fiction and this was much more than I could swallow. Definitely do yourself a favor and move to a different movie. There are many other better films that deal with this topic. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
