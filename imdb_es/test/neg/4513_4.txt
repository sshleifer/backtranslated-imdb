As a devotee of Mrs. Frank, I remember that I was so excited that the work was being repeated for television. That is, until I saw it ... This movie is an excellent example of how important casting is, and how direction plays such an important role in creating the sense of purpose. The casting of any CENTRAL paper is CRUCIAL for a production of this type ... programs like AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA totally depend on the charisma of the main actor. And in the cast of this movie, everything is destroyed by the atrocious cast of Melissa Gilbert in the lead role. There is NOT A SINGLE MOMENT that Mrs. Gilbert even approaches the sensitive and mature spirit of Anne. Mrs. Gilbert is "white bread" throughout the film ... the only time I was about to cry was during the reading of Anne's most disturbing line: "I still think, in spite of everything, that people are really good at heart, "says Mrs. Gilbert so hasty, so unconvinced, that she could have belched and achieved the same effect. Marge Champion, the legend of cinema and dance, was the dialogue coach of this production. I should have reimbursed your salary! Even though Mrs. Gilbert ruined the DIARY, other performances are satisfactory for most of the special greetings to Joan Plowright as Edith, Scott Jacoby as Peter and Clive Reville as Mr. Dussell. Maxmillian Schell does not have the soul and the spirit as ingrained as Otto, like the creator of the role on stage and the film (Joseph Schildkraut), but that's fine. Doris Roberts and James Coco, since the Van Danns are relatively superficial in their parts, they are gaudy and grandiloquent, but again, only on the surface. This COULD be due to the fact that the stimulation of the project is too hasty (as noted in previous publications), this film in 45 minutes shorter than the film version, the difference due to pauses due to dramatic effect, which apparently It is necessary to propagate the appropriate MOOD for the story. This is NOT a mandatory visualization, especially for young people who learn about Anne Frank for the first time, stick to the original version of the film and, or even better, the television production of ANNE FRANK: THE TRUE STORY, starring Ben Kingsley, which is the closest thing to Capturing the anguish and reality of Anne's situation never filmed! Note: Especially frightening is the fact that Melora Marshall, who plays Anne's sister, Margot, is NOT included in the opening credits along with all the other members of The Secret Annex ... she figures in the post-credits along with the actors who play Miep and Mr. Kraler. If I were Mrs. Marshall, I WOULD HAVE ARRIVED!
