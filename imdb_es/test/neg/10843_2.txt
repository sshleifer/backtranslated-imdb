Ben Affleck, about to get married, is shaken by a plane crash and gets involved with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, forcing herself to act like a madwoman). Who is to blame for this inept, ugly mud? It's so badly edited, when I looked at the credits it was not reading the publisher's name, but to see if the person really took the credit! Filled with clich√©s, artifices and Sandra Bullock with raccoon eye makeup, the film does not even care about creating chemistry between the two main characters. The laughs are nonexistent: the scene in the gay bar with Affleck could have had a great laugh if it was not so stupid (the customers of the bar - a large group of them noisy! - scream for Affleck to undress and start digging his cash). It's supposed to have no other meaning than to get Ben to loosen up a bit, but the direction of the whole scene is wrong, and the result is not seen because the idiot editor cuts ... or was that the whole movie that? I had? It's a small moment but it's typical of this movie, an amateur piece of pop products that wants to be a modern comedy but has no guts. It is tailor made for the bottom shelf of your video store. * since ****
