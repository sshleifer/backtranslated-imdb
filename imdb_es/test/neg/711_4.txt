Okay, it's not great either, but just for the good that Laurel and Hardy have been in the past. If this film received a total revision, with an improved image quality, add a new dubbing to the misfolded voices and add a good discreet background music, then this movie will really start to take shape. As it is, it has its problems. People do it because of the boys' age. Quel surprise! They were about 60 years old and had led a 'life'. However, for me, they still had a lot of charms, and although this does not even come close to the feet of their classics (I gave it a 4), it's worth seeing them simply because they are them. To think otherwise would be impostor!
