This movie may be great, but it is a complete scam of the comfort and joy of Bill Forsythe. c & j is one of the sweetest movies I've seen without becoming a diabetic. <br /> <br /> It's fine if you like it, but you realize that EVERYTHING in this movie is a direct scam. <br /> <br /> The original is http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072 I can recommend almost anything for forsythe - Local Hero, Gregory's Girl, That Sinking Feeling. I'd better go rent something tonight. Local has a young Peter Capaldi, and an old Burt Lancaster. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has left the cinema after a really horrible Hollywood treatment. Sad.
