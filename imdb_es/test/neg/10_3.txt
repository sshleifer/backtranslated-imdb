Years ago, when DARLING LILI played on television, it was always the version of panning and exploration, which he hated and decided to wait and watch the film in its proper widescreen format. Then, when I saw a cheap DVD of this work by Julie Andrews / Blake Edwards, I decided to buy it and see it once and for all. <br /> <br /> Boy, what a terrible movie. It's so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start to describe where and when it goes so wrong. Seeing it now, it's obvious to any movie fan that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because many other directors had hit gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc.) but also because Andrews was rejected from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc.) because Hollywood thought it was not sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this dead effort to showcase his wife in a strange combination of spy story / war movie / romance / slapstick / musical comedy. DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities, without knowing who or what is. Some specific scenes are good or effective, but in general, they just do not work at all, to the point of being very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Look, the version on the DVD is the "director's version". ", or in this case," save what we can "of this notorious box office failure.When releasing the DVD, Edwards cut 19 scenes (19 !!!!!!!!) of the original inflated theatrical version in this version simpler and yet remarkably ineffective, the film moves along with no idea of ​​what it is, we are 25 minutes away and we still do not know what is happening or why we are seeing what is happening, what kind of spy is Lili? How powerful is she? Was she ever responsible for someone's death? Instead, we see Rock Hudson, who seems completely bored, trying to attract a Julie Andrews who seems bored. With the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love, why does Julie fall in love with Hudson? Why he and not other men she got involved with? There should be one of her ex circling, trying to get her back or trying to decipher his secret, this would have given us a very necessary contrast with the confusing action. It would also have given us some impetuous to slow procedures. There is not a catalyst in this story. <br /> <br /> One only has to look at the cut scenes to see clearly that Edwards and the writer only had ideas inspired by the previous successes of Andrews (and Edwards). The best (or worst) example is the scene in which Andrews and Hudson follow a group of children singing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channeling the sound of music. No wonder he took it out of the DVD. In 1970, that scene could have worked on a certain level, but today, that moment reeks of despair. There are other elements of the plot directly inspired by other Andrews / Edwards films. The endless scenes of the dog fights are inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE. The musical moment "I'll give you three guesses" was created just to make fun of the person of Julie MARY POPPINS, who became "obscene" with Julie doing a striptease on the spot. The final, bird's-eye view of Julie running to the Hudson plane, is another "nod" on SOUND OF MUSIC. <br /> <br /> All this is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born to a German father and British mother, who lives in England but sings her songs (in English) in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are poorly edited. Like when Julie and her "uncle" go on horseback. They talk and talk and then, Julie, suddenly, runs out in the middle of the sentence. I'm like "what happened here?" <br /> <br /> The bits of comedy are not comfortable and they are worth it. Every scene with the French police is pathetic. Where is Peter Sellers when you really need him? The action is stupid beyond belief. When Julie and her "uncle" go to Germany on that train, Hudson's squad shoots bullets to the train, almost killing Lili in the process. Sparkly. What is also funny about that scene is that the two of them leave on the train in the middle of the night, but Hudson and his squad arrive on the train even though they fly the next morning. That is a slow moving train there. <br /> <br /> The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the whole movie (and the reason why I gave this film 3 stars), but its effect diminishes considerably because it repeats at the end. Speaking of redundant, do we really need to see a can-can dance, Crepe Suzette and Julie's stripper scene too? The "Girl in no man's land" is fine, even if it is bleeding in an obvious way, but that moment does not make any sense because Lili sings it to a group of wounded soldiers in a French hospital, which makes me wonder: how many There are soldiers. Were they indirectly injured by the result of their espionage? <br /> <br /> The whole project is indifferent and without energy. The romance is 100% amazing. Rock Hudson looks too old and tired (look at the museum scene). Julie looks dazed, as if she were in Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is that Julie plays a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome that afflicted his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie, she is not Greta Garbo, who did it so well in MATA HARI. Funny enough, even if Julie plays a German spy, she still appears as cloying and pretty. <br /> <br /> How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since its launch, Blake Edwards felt that he still needed to work on it for its DVD release.
