An ugly and ruthless shit from Hollywood that expects nothing but ugliness and cruelty from its audience. The scenes WITHOUT WITHOUT Spacey reveal how truly horrible the film is. But the scenes with Spacey are so entertaining that you stay there until the end. Yes, he could play this role in his dream, but he does it very well, it's a joy to see him, so believable and wonderfully monstrous. Enjoy it for your performance, but do not expect anything else from this movie. If you want to see a great movie about the evils of modern Hollywood, check out "The Player" by Robert Altman. This small and sad potboiler is not remotely in the same league.
