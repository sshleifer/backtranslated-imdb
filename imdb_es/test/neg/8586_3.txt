I really wanted to see this movie, because the trailer made it look so cool. But the fact is that this movie is boring and totally confusing. There is no plot, and half the movie is fast flashes of football games. Zoom into the shots, which does not give you an overview of the games. I constantly looked at the chronometer to see when the movie was over! <br /> <br /> There is only ONE good thing about this movie. Sound!! The soundtrack is awesome! ............. Do not expect anything from this movie.
