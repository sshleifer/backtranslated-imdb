Although many Billie Dove fans are delighted with their work here, I have to approve. As a socially prominent member of the British intelligent ensemble, his British accent is basically non-existent and his line readings sound like, well, the line readings and his emotions seem trance and heavy. Basil Rathbone, usually a good actor, seems to be unhappy and also speaks with a strange type of accent, in his case something like Italian, although we can not be sure. The script manages to keep its precise ethnicity secret. He is further hampered by the script that gives one of those old diseases of the film, something that has to do with the nerves, which requires surgery. The only real entertainment is provided by the illustrious Kay Francis sporting a lacquered taco with side curls in her role as a depraved countess who devours the men without shame, including Rathbone, and then spits them out. She takes it out with her unique poise. She is the only living thing in this dead sea of ​​a movie.
