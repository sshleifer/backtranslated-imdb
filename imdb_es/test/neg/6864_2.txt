This movie was a waste of the celluloid on which it was printed. It's a disastrous scene, like a particularly frightful train crash. <br /> <br /> Seeing this is like trying to explain the meaning of life. The main point of the plot is that the character played by Steve Guttenberg is a party animal that should not bet, because that would violate his probation. The children he befriends refuse to play with him as a coach for a while, because he plays. BUT ... a few minutes later, after winning the championship, a large sum of money saves your refuge. And where did they get the money? GAME!!! Add this to the spooky scenes at the funeral home (why are there exactly ROOMS in a funeral home?) And the useless peripheral character
