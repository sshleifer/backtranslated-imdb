Oh, how terrible is this movie! I do not know if it's a horror movie or a drama, because the story and both genres are not very well established! History does not move, it is slow, boring and sleepy from beginning to end. This movie really bores me! But I really liked the work with the camera, it's authentic, fresh and clear, the acting is also great, the little boy was the great actor in this movie, but it has not made me jump out of my seat. But this movie makes me grab a pillow, lie on my bed and sleep until the credits come ... <br /> <br /> Bored! It's not worth seeing! I tell you, this movie stunk! <br /> <br /> 1/10
