I love the movies of this horrible summer camp of the 80's. The best part of "Party Camp" is the fact that, literally, it has no plot. It simply releases a weak batch of "characters" in a location and then things happen from time to time. The clichés here are unlimited (SPOILERS): the nerds against the jocks, the secret chamber in the girls' locker room, the hikers who pass through a nudist colony, the concluding contest, the secretly horny camp managers, and the shamefully Silly sexual innuendo scattered everywhere. The only cliché that is missing is the presence of Corey Feldman. This movie will make you laugh, but never intentionally. I repeat, NEVER. A final note, get ready to burst open watching the nonsense that is the "dramatic" scene where Jerry Riviera and D.A. share a beer late at night, spilling their guts together. The dialogue literally does not make sense, and the performance belongs to a high school scenario. Its a classic.
