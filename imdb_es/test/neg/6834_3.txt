I really wanted to see Bruce Willis in this, especially because I remember being hypnotized by the original when I was young. <br /> <br /> This movie is a perfect example of how film companies can take a very good and silly story until it's just another exaggerated formula of the legendary American law enforcement / VS army (the Russians. .. no, I regret that the cold war is over, make it WITH the Russians) VS the TERRORISTS, similar to the 50 other movies. <br /> <br /> Also, treat your audience as a group of idiots. The choice of weapon is good, simply ridiculous, is it seriously expected that we believe that the most feared and experienced terrorist killer in the world would select that for a murder? <br /> <br /> The main point of the original story was the tense dual of intellects between the common detective who is assigned the responsibility and the professional who elaborates a ruthless but elegant plan to reach his goal and then escape. None of that survived. All we have is the tired old CIA / FBI / US Army against the evil terrorist plot, we've all seen it 1000 times before. <br /> <br /> But, of course, the film company's MBAs realized that here is a new intellectual angle. I would lose the income of the short attention gang, so the answer is ... Bruce Willis, BIG explosions and a crippled plot. They assume that the American audience can not relate to a threat to a foreign statesman (where is France on the map), so it is an American? <br /> <br /> Another example of a movie desecrated by the boardroom.
