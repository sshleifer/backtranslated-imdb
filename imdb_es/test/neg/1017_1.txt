The director Fabio Barreto got a strange Academy Nominea for his latest film, O Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna, Barreto made one of the worst movies of all time. His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Do you think with me how the poor Brazilian fishermen speak perfect English? In the movie they do it. There's no script, it's just a very long video clip with beautiful places and lots of sex scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.
