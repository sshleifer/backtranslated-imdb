The people who hit this movie wanted it to be as great and elegant as the first one, which is not the case. It was assumed that this film was totally opposite to that of Ocean's 11. This has been said by many cast members and also by the director, Steven Soderbergh. Ocean's 12, although it lacked a captivating plot, is being beaten because it was different from what people wanted. If it were launched before Ocean's 11, it would be taken very differently, not as a failed sequel. The problem with the sequels is that people approach it with a predetermined idea of ​​how it should be and have high expectations. They should enter this movie with an open mind and not expect it to be "Ocean's 11, again".
