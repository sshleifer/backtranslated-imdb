This was a shame for the FarCry game, had many expectations, but it all ended in a nightmare. In addition to the visual effects that act badly, the trick even the humor used in the film was an absolute failure. The movie is not worth seeing at all. The funniest part was when the girl came and kissed Jack to give him the key to his fists. I guess she got the keys for the wives all the time. I hope some good director converts a new version of this fantastic game into a movie someday. And I will invest some money to get the correct visual effects and scenarios, as well as the right ACTING. But until then do not waste your time trying to watch this movie because it will surely drive you crazy, especially if you are a FarCry lover.
