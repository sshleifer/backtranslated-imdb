Why can not there be better TV movies? I was in a difficult situation today and I saw this movie on a satellite channel in the United Kingdom. What a terrible waste of my time it was. Poor breaks, bad acting and my God, what a terrible flood. What a woman can even overcome a torrent of water too! <br /> <br /> I really want people to make TV movies with better effects, better or at least more credible arguments and much better acting. Killer Flood is fine with bad acting. A few pieces of ham could not work any worse. <br /> <br /> 1 final thing I really agree with the comment about the dog, but I think I would have done it in real life!
