The cartoon of 1940, banned today probably due to the gag of 'Black Beauty', in which Daffy rides a black person as if he were a horse. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place in a bookstore, where the characters in the books come alive every afternoon. So we have, among others, the ugly duck (Daffy) and the wolf of Wallstreet. They end up in a chase after the wolf tricked Daffy with a fake duck (hence the title). <br /> <br /> And the persecution is all there is in this little caricature, which has no real appeal today. Just fun if you're a true Looney Tunes fan, I guess ... <br /> <br /> 4/10.
