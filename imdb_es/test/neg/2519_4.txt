OK, this is a strange movie! Ed Wood Jr. fans will appreciate the "inventive" techniques used by director George Barry as archival material and cheesy voices. He can make a crack in the wall in a plot device! There is more humor than horror here, but I thought it was an unequal mixture. You will laugh and cry, and you will probably wonder why you have this in your hands. Barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this film in 1972 and was completed in 1977, at a cost of $ 10,000. That's 59 months and $ 9,900 too much! If you like your cheese on the side of the countryside, with the vintage "gore" of the 70s, you may find this snack irresistible and strange.
