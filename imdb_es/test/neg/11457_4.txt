Not all the films made in 1931 are crisp, and the fact that it was "Best Film" must have given an even greater boost to the development of television. It is possible to take the whole story to the screen, to say nothing about the development of the character. Dix, so stupid in the first third of the movie, talks face to face, but nobody knows why and it does not make sense. And what about Dunne that makes her so stoic? The scenes of Edna May Oliver are priceless, as usual. <br /> <br /> This film has a role to play in the history of cinema, but it is long and boring.
