The first two Bring It On movies were pretty good in their own way. The first was quite serious, the second was satirical with success, and the third opted for the idiotic and usual comedy that we always see in the movies for teenagers totally unconcerned that Hollywood has left the carpentry. The main point of this film was that the cheerleaders are total airheads who barely know enough to hold a common conversation, and that is the extent of the comedy of this film. LOL. No. <br /> <br /> There is no intelligence skill in this movie, there is no theme, there is no subtext, nothing that entertains anyone with half a brain (and, indeed, I could not sit through all of this)) . If you are the type of person who entertains with jokes, this movie is for you. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
