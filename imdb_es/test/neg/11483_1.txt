I do not know why all the comments above are the approval of this movie. IS, well, not far, but ..., THE MOST ASSOCIATED MOVIE I HAVE SEEN LATAMENTE, full of clich√©s, bad acting, not really ... very bad acting and has an absurd plot ... If I had seen it a cinema would have left after the first 20 minutes. If you hate someone, make them see this movie ... that's how bad it is. A girl who has an imaginary child / friend who abandons a relationship with a real one because her imagination is jealous ... but I think the figures ... she chases her parents who also have mental problems ... plus the character that is I suppose it should be, I think the lot of laughter, which should make you laugh, Cal's roommate is a serious case and makes me feel sorry for him ... and the whole movie
