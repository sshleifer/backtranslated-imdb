I really despair for women when they discuss this joke of a program as if it were intellectually interesting and promotes female liberation and independence. This show is the biggest insult to women next to all those libidinous hip-hop videos. If talking like a group of reckless teenagers over $ 100 lunches in fancy restaurants, indiscriminately buying unnecessary fashion and jumping into bed with the closest man on the site is considered empowering, the fate of Western women may be doomed while We speak. > <br /> Apart from the damage it does to the female gender, Sex and City is NOT ENTERTAINMENT. Not once has it been fun, captivating, exciting or original. The episodes develop monotonously. Each character is factory-produced mannequins that behave in the same way in each episode. Not once has any of these superficial and unattractive women evolved. Perhaps the worst is the main character Carrie Bradshaw. Besides looking horrible, his penchant for excessive analysis of relationships is worth shrinking. In addition to all this, the program shows men as a group of headless bums who can not commit to healthy relationships. Even when there is a decent man, he is somehow painted as a villain. The absolute lack of empathy towards men is clearly the work of some "progressive" pseudo -dominists. <br /> <br /> The saddest part of the whole show is that these women live miserable and unfortunate lives. Any intelligent woman would never envy them. It is a banal show with even more banal characters. The New York tourism board must hate the way this garbage is appearing in your good city! Fortunately, this train is over! Desperate housewives are seen as the appropriate replacement for SATC. While DH can be quite implausible, at least it explores women in more multifaceted ways. In addition, he treats men with more respect and is really entertaining.
