There is a thin line between being theatrical and being simply forced. Forced action Take forced. Forced plot Even forced photography. There are people who say that "the film develops in that way because it is from Asia", but I do not see any type of forced elements in Seven Samurai or Sonatine. There is a thin line between being fiction (and each work of art is, in a way, fiction) and unlikely. In a more personal way, I do not feel anything with the movie, it does not take me anywhere, and I simply can not believe in the fictional world that is proposed. It just does not feel right, there is something inside or why it just does not click.
