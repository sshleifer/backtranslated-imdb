It was praised for being a fast-paced comedy and the best German movie of the year, so I tried it, although I've already seen some Dani Levy movies, or at least part of them. <br /> <br /> I got what I expected: no comedy, unless you think heart attacks are fun. It is a good example of careless screen writing, with a plot and unlikely characters, full of clich√©s that could be true, but surely are not fun either. <br /> <br /> The most annoying character is that of Zucker's wife, played by Hannelore Elsner. She has to behave incredibly strange to keep the plot moving. For example: she does not know a single thing about Judaism, but for reasons very unknown even to herself, it occurs to her to play the farce that she and her family are Jewish laws that obey the Jews because of her husband's family, It really is and of the very orthodox and honest variety. To make it a bit more complicated, invite the four to stay in their apartment in the city, because they arrive from Frankfurt to Berlin without having booked their hotels in advance, something that is not a 60-year-old businessman, it is not really an older German. would ever do This gives the viewer a lot to swallow, but still does not make jokes. <br /> <br /> Zucker and his brother Samuel have not seen each other for forty years, but it turns out that his daughter, now a Lesbians, and Samuel's son, now an orthodox militant, were lovers and he is the father from her daughter. Samuel's daughter, a nymphomaniac, chases Zucker's gay son. Is this supposed to be a somewhat humorous parody of Jewish incestuous tendencies? It's probably just an unreflective way to add some "love action turbulence" that all inflatable comedy needs. And, of course, jokes are not produced either. <br /> <br /> The praise of this film is purely political. Therefore, only people who enjoy watching movies that are supposed to be "politically important" will enjoy this, although "Alles auf Zucker!" It clearly has no importance whatsoever. <br /> <br /> For everything else: do not look at it without a "Fast forward" option. I really missed it.
