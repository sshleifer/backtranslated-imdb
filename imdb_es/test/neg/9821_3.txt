The book gets 10 out of 10 stars ... <br /> <br /> PROBABLY CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM BOTH THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE! <br /> <br /> If you've never read Geoffrey Household's rogue, Man Hunt's source material, he'll probably enjoy Fritz Lang's treatment of the story. On the other hand, if you are in my camp and you have practically memorized the book, the movie will be a great disappointment. I will assume that you have already read a synopsis of the story and will continue with my complaints. Household's little novel is one of the great suspense classics of all time, tense and superfluous, with only a handful of characters to drive the action. Fritz Lang and his screenwriter Dudley Nichols feel the need to include the protagonist's brother and a nice braggart, the last of which reduces the depth of the story by injecting an extrinsic motivation into the script where the novel did not need. In fact, the true highlight of the book was not the escape of the nameless narrator from his underground lair, but his self-acceptance of his true motive for hunting out in the first place. And that's another thing: if David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino can help us through Fight Club and Kill Bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists, why can not Lang? "Thorndyke?" What hat did that come from? Which brings me to my bitterest complaint: the Household hunter is so essentially British that he would bleed a Union Jack if you cut him. But Walter Pigeon, who plays it, is Canadian! He can barely hold the accent, which is a bit deeper and more convincing than that of Kevin Costner in Robin Hood. He looked right on the paper, and was a good actor for the 1940s, but like the reluctant hero of Rogue Male? Let's look at Scepter Island itself for a more compelling version. Remake soon with subtlety and with, please! I will direct it for free?
