"Black Vengeance" is an alternative title for "Ying hung ho hon", also known as "Tragic Hero" (1987). I just saw this on VHS, along with the first part of the story, "Gong woo ching" ("Rich and Famous"), also in 1987. (The poster and the 2 frames that appear on the page are for a set of 4 DVD) of films starring Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist). The fourth movie is called "The Black Six"). Interestingly, while the characters retain their original names in "Rich and Famous", in "Black Vengeance" the character of Chow Yun-Fat is called Eddie Shaw, Alex Man (Man Tze Leung) is Harry and Andy Lau is called Johnny. Also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as the copyright dates in both films. Maybe that was the year they were nicknamed in the United States. According to the launch dates given in IMDb, "Tragic Hero" was released before "Rich and Famous". Was there any reason to release the sequel first? Despite the comments of some users, I enjoyed these films, although they are not among the best of CYF, like "The Killer" and "Hard-Boiled", which are really amazing. However, if one day I find a set of 2 DVDs of "Rich and Famous" and "Tragic Hero" I will not hesitate to buy it. Fortunately, these comments on "Black Vengeance" are clarified, which was also for me, a mystery as to where it belonged to Chow Yun-Fat's filmography.
