As you can see in the other comments, this movie is just the MOST PUNTA movie ever made. Let me see how many different words I can use to describe it: boring, unbearable, laughable, lousy, stupid, horrible ..... <br /> <br /> I could continue with such descriptions but I will probably get the Point. <br /> <br /> I would have given this a 0, if possible - bad acting, bad direction, bad production, bad plot. <br /> <br /> This was done in 2001 and it seems more like 1965. Very low budget, boring plot, horrible acting, really bad special effects, etc ... <br /> <br /> I rarely see a Sci-fi movie that I think is so bad. I mean, this is trash. Nor does he have anything in his favor. As far as a "B movie" is concerned, this is the lowest part of the lot. <br /> <br /> I think you would be more entertained by looking at a blank sheet of paper for 90 minutes. Garbage like this gives the good movies "B" low budget a bad name. This makes Ed Wood's films look good. <br /> <br /> The thing about watching live movies is that, when you think you've seen the worst, you see something worse! <br /> <br /> DJ Perry is a horrible actor and does not have individual characteristics that make him stand out. <br /> <br /> Avoid this waste at all costs! Oh humanity!
