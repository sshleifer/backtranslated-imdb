Perhaps, like most of the others who have seen this movie long after its premiere on television, I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in an old, dark way, which is exactly what 'Slow Burn' is. Except, apart from the nostalgic value, the film itself is not very good. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash, hired by a rich artist, Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry), to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son, Brian, who had been living with his mother, Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) during the last years. In a Phillip Marlowe-esquire style, Jacob Ash narrates what would become more than a simple investigation into Brian's whereabouts. But, once Jacob traces Laine, his discoveries open up with a lot of problems. Maybe because the events in the film move very slowly, there is never much suspense in this little thriller, not even in the end with the final routine of revealing the culprits and their motives. <br /> <br /> However, as stated before This movie is probably one that will draw attention to its relatively unknown cast of actors, which includes both Eric Roberts and the young Johnny Depp, who plays Laine's stepson Donnie. That may be a sufficient reason to try ... if you can find it.
