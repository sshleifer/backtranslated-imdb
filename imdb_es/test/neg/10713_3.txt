For three quarters of an hour, the story gradually develops into a fundamental point of some kind. Although it is overloaded with scenes that seem destined to blunt the viewer and move him away from the real plot, something is happening. It's not much and it's certainly not obvious. The combination of palace impressions and storyline scenes does not add depth or vision to the entire cast of characters. In fact, they keep them sterile since there is no character development. Everyone keeps turning and centered around their own cliché and their role: the cute and stubborn girl; The woman fighter, the aristocrat stretched. The male protagonist does not seem to have any distinction at all, it's a superficial presence, which, in reality, does not even matter, since he's only there because the storyboard required it: he looked like he was on vacation and was caught up. When it's time to turn the corner in terms of what happens, the film goes completely blank for a couple of minutes and then becomes ridiculous. Solve, or better, dissolve, with a Deus Ex Machina, more clichés and some of the most crude plot devices and options you've ever seen. It's history, it's fine. First, the film is a drama, although it is supposed to be comical, and then it becomes a farce. The protagonists do what they are expected to do, and there are no surprises. The first group of somewhat serious antagonists, however, is replaced by a couple who were literally bored. Maybe that was kind of a nod to the audience. <br /> <br /> This movie does not receive any bonus from me because of the underlying philosophical meaning (since it does not exist) or its technical realization. The animation and editing is just and so is the sound mix; but in no way is it outstanding or even above the average Japanese productions of the late eighties. In fact, the visual images seem static, uninspired and not original. <br /> <br /> Worst of all: you can not entertain, even if you do not bother with the characters and all that. There is very little here and the rest is corny at best. Get a real Ghibli, make a feast with it and keep your fingers out of it.
