With No Dead Heroes you get stupid lines like that, because this terrible and abysmal action movie needs to be seen to be believed. William Sanders is saved by his friend Harry Cotter during an extraction in Vietnam, but is captured by the enemy. I advanced ten years and Harry is now a Russian brainwashing agent with a mind control microchip implanted in his brain. His new Russian superior is Ivan, who played with the obscene grip of Nick Nicholson, who might add that not only does he not once try to speak with a Russian accent but he is more like a Kentucky gas station attendant with his teeth stained. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dialogue coach for this movie. Soon, the CIA re-recruits William to hunt Harry. He joins Barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated Ivan's camp in El Salvador and soon the two are exploiting half of South America. Some scenes are so amazing that it's a wonder that this movie has no more cult followers. One of those scenes is the sudden sexual act in the jungle of William and Barbara accompanied by the most inadequate background music I've ever heard. Who would undress completely in the middle of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that also uses the final theme of Blood on Satan's Claw. No Dead Heroes is the champion of magical films of all time, since a shot leads to multiple deaths. In one scene, Harry fires his rifle behind a rock and kills seven guys. I had to rewind it and count. Hard to find movie that has recently received the full HD treatment by MGM. Track this movie and watch it for the stupidity that occurs.
