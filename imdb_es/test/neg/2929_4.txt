Coming from Kiarostami, this visual and sound exhibition of an art house is a surprise. For a director known for his narrations and his keen observation of humans, especially children, this excursion to minimalist cinematography raises questions: Why did he do it? Was it to keep you busy during a vacation on the shore? <br /> <br /> "Five, 5 long takes" consists of, you guessed it, five long shots. They are (the names of the titles are mine and the times are approaching): <br /> <br /> "Driftwood and waves". The camera is almost motionless looking at a small piece of floating wood as it moves by small waves splashing on a beach. Ten minutes. <br /> <br /> "Observe people on the boardwalk". The camera is standing looking at the horizon of the ocean and a promenade. People walk through the frame of the camera, their faces too far away and blurred to make them interesting. Eleven minutes. <br /> <br /> "Six dogs at the water's edge". The camera is standing looking at the ocean horizon with a sandy stretch of beach nearby. Far from the water's edge, six dogs do not do much, they simply relax. Sixteen minutes <br /> <br /> "Ducks in line, herd of ducks". The camera is standing looking at the horizon of the ocean near the water's edge. Dozens and dozens of ducks are transmitted in a single file from left to right. I guess Kiarostami released them gradually. The last two ducks stop dead and suddenly a herd of ducks rolls silently from right to left. I guess Kiarostami picked up the ducks and threw them back at the same time. It is not the first time that it deals with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes. <br /> <br /> "Symphony of frogs, oops, I mean the cacophony, for a stormy night". The camera is on a pond at night. It is a black tone, except for what seems to be the reflection of the moon in the wavy water. It's a stormy night and the clouds run to cover the moon. The screen goes dark. What remains is the cacophony of frogs, dogs howling and, eventually, roosters in the morning. Hit me in the head if this was done in one shot. I saw this segment as a sound composition gathered in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization. Twenty-seven minutes! <br /> <br /> Except for the slightly funny ducks, this exercise in minimalism left me cold. A film not essential for fans of Kiarostami. <br /> <br /> I thought I would rate "Five" with five, but four is what it deserves. <br /> <br /> The film is dedicated to Yasujiru Ozu.
