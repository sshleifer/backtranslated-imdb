It is true that I tuned this in the hope of seeing some photos of James Brolin. Unfortunately, there was only one, at first, and the rest of the movie was very docile and, ultimately, it made little sense. <br /> <br /> The story, what there is of it, focuses on Nick and Julie Atkins, a couple whose marriage of many years is beginning to stagnate. Nick, a successful businessman, focuses on work to the point of neglecting Julie, who tries to fill the void by going back to school. Julie's desire for the passion she and Nick had at the beginning of their marriage begins to take shape in the form of powerful sexual fantasies that block reality for minutes at a time, which causes her to do things like burn breakfast and misplace the papers of her husband. At first, she fantasizes about her husband, but as the film progresses, she begins to fantasize about other men and encounters with random strangers with whom she finds herself. This culminates in the realization of his fantasies with disastrous consequences for his marriage. Can she and her husband rebuild their relationship? Is it worth saving? <br /> <br /> This could have been an interesting premise, but the execution is so bland that one wonders why they got upset. The characters are not developed. The reasons are not explained. The background information is not given. It is not explored how Julie got to the point where she could not control herself, and no explanation is offered about how she will do it in the future. The final product is a confusing mess that is as confusing as Julie's fantasies, which are surprisingly underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> The performance is a mixed bag. Donna Mills as Julie does well with the material she is given, although her continued self-pity becomes strident after a while. James Brolin acts as if he were reading his lines of reference letters, and even his anger at his wife's infidelity is hard to believe, he shows very little passion for the whole subject. The support functions are mostly forgettable. <br /> <br /> Disappointing treatment of what could have been an interesting story. More is worth it, since it does not even offer the sweet eye it promised.
