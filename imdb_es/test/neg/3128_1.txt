This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> We're supposed to like and are encouraged by an arrogant, smart-aleck, morose, bank robber, played by Dale Robertson, and a shy mockery played by the extraordinarily beautiful Linda Darnell in a red firefighter's dress. She must have been sewn on that bodice! <br /> <br /> A senator in the film believes that Native Americans and whites should try to reach an agreement, however, fans win the day. I could barely sit through the endless dialogue of intolerance that emerged from the mouths of other characters. <br /> <br /> Except in Wounded Knee and Dances with Wolves, there are few films that give a positive image of American Indians, and very few old Westerns do. This is exceptionally bad in that respect. <br /> <br /> The romance between Robertson and Darnell made me feel nervous, when he came in abruptly, forcing a kiss on her, while she plays the old game hard to get. . <br /> <br /> There are scenes that are unintentionally humorous, like characters that are obviously not riding or about a stagecoach in several shots. <br /> <br /> A disconcerting humorous incident in the story is The character of Linda Darnell goes out of her way to buy tickets for the stagecoach, only to then ask for a horse to ride, minutes later, for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Another comic scene is when the stagecoach comes to a squeak. stop before the sight of a cowboy hat thrown on the side of the road, and not only that, but ALL the passengers are stacked to see and see. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
