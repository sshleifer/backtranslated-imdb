Bruce Willis, as usual, does an excellent job. <br /> <br /> [warning: can be considered a "spoiler"] <br /> <br /> While my friend thought it was good, he kept looking. My watch throughout the movie wondering when it would end. After watching such great movies as "The Patriot" and "Chicken Run", I was very disappointed with Disney's "The Kid". <br /> <br /> Willis plays a middle-aged man with a tough and realistic attitude by putting a positive spin on people's images (he's an image consultant). An unknown child appears. Yes, it's him, but younger, and even Lily Tomlin can see it. At this point, I remember a cross between a poor episode of "Quantum Leap" and a bad travel movie. <br /> <br /> Kid and Willis try to find out why he is in that period of time. They solve it. They meet Willis when he is older. Do not forget that it's never detailed how old Willis teleports them between periods of time and gathers them together to begin with, how he got that knowledge to begin with, how he came to the conclusion that he needed to do this, and so on. br /> <br /> Basically, it's a very tired, unoriginal and uninspiring argument that has some great actors in it. The good news is that the actor "the Kid" is not as annoying as he is presented in the television trailers.
