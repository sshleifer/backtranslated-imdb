I always say, "there's nothing like a good movie." And I must say, this was nothing like a good movie! Monotonous, boring and tedious. It was like one of those bad dreams that never seem to end, no matter how hard you try to wake up. I do not care about the concept of a movie without words (that is, entering a fantasy or dream world), but there must be something to capture your imagination, not just empty images, which is what this movie is. There seemed to be no development of the character and he jumped so fast from scene to scene that it was difficult to discern a story. (Was there even a story?) You could say that the actors were doing everything possible, but unfortunately, bad management sabotaged the work of all the actors. It really seemed like a kind of cinematographic masturbation ... it only existed to please the director and no one else. Big waste of time.
