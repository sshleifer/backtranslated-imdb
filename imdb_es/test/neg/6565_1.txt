I am aware that there are some fans who may like this movie. I am aware that the idea of ​​'seeking God' may seem interesting to some, however, for me it is really boring. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply boring. When it gets a bit interesting, it becomes stupid. Come on ... Kirk fight god and win? How low can we get? The only good part of the movie is the camp scene in the first 5 minutes, which is really cool, but after that, the movie becomes boring, irritating, with nothing but good music. <br /> <br /> Thank God we have Star Trek VI. (Oops, Kirk hit him)
