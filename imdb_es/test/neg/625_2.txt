When I was 8 years old, and going through my Marx Brothers phase, my father read in the TV Guide that they were showing the Marx Brothers movie, "The Big Store", on Friday night, and set the VCR to record it . . When I woke up on Saturday, due to a bad impression on the TV guide, my father and I discovered that "The History of Mankind" had been recorded in its place. <br /> <br /> "The Big Store" was probably one of the least fun films of all the Marx brothers and yet it is one of the best works of cinema of the century compared to "The history of humanity" " I can almost justify the error of TV Guide, since the Marx brothers (Groucho, Chico and Harpo) appear in both films. Although in "The History of Mankind", they are divided into a series of unrelated scenes: Groucho plays Peter Minuit, Chico plays a guy who talks to Christopher Columbus and Harpo plays Isaac Newton. The Harpo scene lasts about half a minute; Chico only has two or three lines; Groucho's scene is at least funny, but horribly racially insensitive to today's standards. The rest of the movie does not mention. They trotted some of the best actors of the day and made them recite the total trash. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> TV Guide, I sent you a nice letter, I'm still waiting for an apology. <br /> <br /> For the record: "The Big Store" has a bit of physical comedy with the Marx Brothers on skates and a couple of songs by Virginia O'Brien. I really wanted to see it.
