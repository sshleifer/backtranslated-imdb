There is nothing wrong with showing an old man falling in love with a girl. Lolita did it. American Beauty did it. <br /> <br /> But. They did it subtly. They did not make it so obvious from the beginning that the director is preparing them to fall in love. Not as naturally as two people would (Age no bar), but forcing them to be close to each other as if they should be SICK to fall in love. <br /> <br /> In general, there should have been chemistry. I would have solved the biggest problem. People with reservations against the issue would also have been absorbed and perhaps convinced. It would have become the perfect love story, regardless of the impassability. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe Jia's character at times. What I found more difficult to understand, is why Vijay, a photographer and an artist, who seems serious, would have had an interest in such a frivolous girl. Unless he himself has some frivolity hidden in himself, that has not come out at all. <br /> <br /> There is a great use of Dutch angles or angles in which the frame is tilted. It is usually used to show something unnatural or something that could lead to something that is not right. Therefore, RGV considers that the relationship is not natural. <br /> <br /> Camera angles, background score, editing and even the juxtaposition of shots and symbology emphasize and place too much emphasis on their relationship. Is the Indian public so dumb that we need to be told something in 10 different ways for us to understand it? Especially when the two danced together ... it was evident what was happening. What was the need to slow down the scene with dramatic background music? I feel that the theme was very well chosen. But Verma should not have made the film, constantly considering that it is a controversial subject. If it is, then handle it delicately, why do not you do it?
