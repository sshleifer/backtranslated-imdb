Usually horrible movie ... I will not bother you with the synopsis, I'll just build The Core, Armageddon, an evil military officer and one or two Solve-All Nukes and you'll have the movie, if I can call. in that way <br /> <br /> Seriously, nuclear weapons in this type of film are more useful than Swiss Army Knives: <br /> <br /> Is the Big One coming? Destroy some places and it's over ... Does a tornado want to destroy "Insert the name of the important city here"? Nuke "Insert another important city here" ... Is a volcano erupting? Borrow! Is a nuclear weapon close to exploding? Borrow! The coffee is cold? Borrow! Did not you like the Transformers? Stop, but I can not say that this will fix things ... <br /> <br /> In the end, how many more movies like this can be done before they start copying each other? I doubt there are still many things to explode with a nuclear weapon ...
