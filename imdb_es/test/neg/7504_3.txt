Set in the near future, a dark unknown enters a city in the southern United States full of zombies. Settling down with a group of friendly faces, our stranger learns the harsh realities of city life. There are two groups of people; The upper classes who live safely behind the concrete walls of the city are provided by the state police, at a fair price. Then there are our inhabitants with a friendly face. These people of lower class live next to the zombies. The only means of survival is the exchange of goods, which they forged during the day, with the police in exchange for food cans. Our stranger finds out why his world is plagued by zombies. A new dietary pill that suppressed the desire for carbohydrates was the basis. The desire of the human race to lose fat caused the fall of society as we know it. These pills increased the desire for protein, that is, meat, even the pet poodle. However, there was a more serious side effect: after death, people were revived with an even greater craving for proteins, namely, human flesh. <br /> <br /> With what I think is an imaginative introduction, I felt that this film many realize inventive material What better way could explain the cause of the zombie race than with a contemporary idea of ​​people's desire of making any sacrifice to change your body without the hard work of the gym? However, the imagination of this film soon stopped after this exhibition. This film falls into the old trap of "I can not imagine what the world will be like when society collapses". When you watch this movie, you do not escape to a different world like when you see Planet of the Apes (original), Alien, Mad Max or Texas Chain Saw (original). In this film the alternative society is defined by people with hair dyed orange and green. Leather jackets painted face and charity. There is no hardness in life in this alternative society, only healthy faces and zombies made up. Movies should allow you to escape, not remind you to clean your wardrobe and take your old cloths to the charity shop. <br /> <br /> Forget about some of the unfortunate performances or zombies made up. . This film fails because it is too polished, too nice and too predictable. I've seen movies like this since the early eighties. If you are going to make a film of this nature, I suggest you watch again films like Dawn of The Dead (original and remake), Threads or Fulci's Zombie to see and experience that feeling of despair in a devastated society.
