I expected the Man of the Year a little, a couple of girls at my job said it was a good movie, and my mother said she liked it, so I waited for the rent and saw her last night. I must honestly say that this movie was a big disappointment. I just got over it, because, to be honest, the beginning was pretty good and very well accelerated, but then it got too dark and it did not go into the movie I saw in the trailer. It seemed like a good comedy, then it became a very dark drama, which was not even that interesting, considering how many stories of this kind we've had about the government conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with a first-rate program and has an act in which many people would want him to get involved in politics, just because he seems to have good control over what should be improved . So he does, he runs for the presidency, but many people doubt that he can win because he is a comedian, but he does win! But Elenore Green, who makes sure all the votes are accounted for, tries to fix a bug in the computer, but when the government tells him not to fix it, they try to get rid of it, and Tom soon realizes that this may not be the work he does. wanted to. <br /> <br /> The performance was good, the address was correct, it was just the story that did not work in my opinion. Like I said, it just became a dramatic change of genres, because if you watch the trailer, you'd think it was a comedy, and when you start watching it, that's what you get, but then it becomes very different. Dark drama and something terrifying. I really would not recommend this movie, it was one of the biggest disappointments I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> 2/10
