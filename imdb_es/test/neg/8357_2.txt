I am writing this review simply because I am a big fan of the book, Prozac Nation, and I was horrified by the movie. <br /> <br /> I think if you had not read the book, you would have been Lost watching the movie, since it did not provide a real story of Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of his childhood (his relationship with his father, his experiences in the summer camp, his first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression that he has never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling) .. .). That said, if you had read the book, you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken place. <br /> <br /> I found that the book is a vivid portrayal of depression, highlighting Wurtzel's low points, and the experiences he had along the way. However, the film started at Harvard and literally directed the audience without a real explanation of what was happening. <br /> <br /> The events that were important in the book (such as Wurtzel's miscarriage, his summer working in Dallas, his attempted suicide while at Prozac were omitted from the movie. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, this is pedantic, but Wurtzel did not lose his virginity to Noah.The attempted suicide that was shown in Sterling's office was completely different from the book.To begin with, he actually had an overdose of Mellaril, unlike of the para-suicidal gesture shown in the film. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that if you read the book and enjoyed / identified it with that, then do not watch the movie.Read 'More, now, again '(by the same author) instead, or see Girl, Interrupted. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature was the performance of Anne Heche, who I think represented Dr. Sterling very well. she was good, although her performance seemed a bit ... forced, Jessica Lange did a visualization nice, but he saw the opposite of how Wurtzel's mother is described in the book. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Do not bother yourself
