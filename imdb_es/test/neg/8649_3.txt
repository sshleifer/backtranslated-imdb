If it is film noir, then noir must be French for glacially slow. Take a cast of completely unpleasant characters, do not give them anything to say, point out everything with gratuitous violence, and you'll have the formula for an aggravated Dash. It could be subtitled "The Hollywood loafers try to make money with the Chinatown scam." The one minute part of Bruce Dern is orders of magnitude better than anything else in this movie. By the way, I did not like the movie.
