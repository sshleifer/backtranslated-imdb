While Mind of Mencia could be summed up as nothing more than a clone of Chappelle's program, it's really worse than that. First of all, Carlos Mencia is a jacka ** who is as funny as he is original, which does not say much. The program contains fake parodies of television ads and political affairs in the United States, and Mencia's "comic" vision of politics adds to the low quality of this program. In addition to all this, Mencia throws more bored ethnic jokes and stolen Jeff Foxworthy lines than I can count on with one hand. while from time to time Carlos laughs out loud, the rest of the time passes insulting everyone in sight, which includes exploiting the members of his own audience. With the exception of South Park, as a whole, and Friday night stand, this show marks the end of the glory days of the chapel program, which for those of you who have not heard, was before it went to Africa.
