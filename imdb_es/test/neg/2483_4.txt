This show had a promising start as opposed to 'Oceans 11', but it has become a superficial display of T & A. Actually, according to my little brother, that is the only good part of the program. <br /> <br /> The first season was, by far, the best, it was something new and the interesting things went downhill after that. The only point of redemption of this show is James Caan, the other actors are disloyal. The characters lack depth and seem to be incredibly selfish and generally unpleasant. <br /> <br /> To quote a friend "Las Vegas is like Baywaych in a Casino" In my opinion, that's a generous way, Baywatch was much better and much more realistic.
