Watching this movie and then listening to the comment, it is clear that Michael Radford does not understand this work. The first clue that he can not fully understand the work is that he strives to put the film in the Venice of the seventeenth century. What sounds really strange, yes, that misinterpreting the film would mean trying to be as accurate as possible in its location. But anyone who has studied Shakespeare knows that while he placed most of his works in exotic locales, culture and values ​​are always contemporary England. This does not hurt the movie, but it shows the lack of necessary knowledge. <br /> <br /> Where Radford kills the movie is to make it so serious. He manages to suck all the jokes from the script, leaving the entire production flat. Each ounce of passion is defeated by the characters. Even Shylock's speech "We do not bleed to death" is a faint and clumsy speech by an angry man who seems to be saying and doing what he does because he is supposed to do it. The lovers are solemn and too restricted (Joseph Fiennes presents some of the most romantic lines of the cinema this year in a barely audible whisper), Gratiano (who has to promise that he will behave at one point) is more sober and a collector than Bassiano ( who makes him promise to behave), Jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spends his life with Lorenzo pouting. <br /> <br /> In the comment of the bland and watery court scene, the director expresses his surprise that an audience laughed at Portia's phrase "A pound of flesh, neither more nor less"; Ultimately concluding that I had to release the tension of laughter. 'The Merchant of Venice' is a comedy and Radford mocks the idea that the most absurd and hysterical parts of history are not the most provocatively provocative drama. <br /> <br /> The film does not have an intelligible focus, but it cuts out some of the most entertaining scenes. The characters are forced to the great dramatic veils, so they sound like characters of Ibsen who read Victorian poetry. And the comic ending, where all good people go to bed happy, drowns in a dignified despair that feels as if they are finding the peace of the upper lip rigid with imminent death, instead of reconciling with the lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio come out of the movie with their hats as aristocrats. <br /> <br /> The film is badly made because the creative powers that are known do not understand the script. She is stern where she must be hysterical. It is reserved where you must be passionate. It's Michael Radford where William Shakespeare should be.
