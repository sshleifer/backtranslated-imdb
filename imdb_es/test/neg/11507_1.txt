My God, what has Disney done lately? Most of his new shows really suck. The life in suite of Zach and Cody are quite good, but other programs like Cory in the house, Wizards of Waverly Place stink and can not be seen. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Sadie is a little more than stupid and stupid. It's about a teenager named Sadie, who likes science, grows and goes through her everyday life. There are her friends Margaret and Rain and her annoying big brother Hal. There everything annoying and stupid. Especially Margaret, who thinks she's the most popular girl in the school and who's so pretty ... she's just horrible. I hate every season of this program, it's just terrible in every way (although the first season was better). <br /> <br /> If you value your life, you would not see this shit, it's painful and stupid.
