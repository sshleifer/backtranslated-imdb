In his recent and defamed reality show, Mr. Shore acknowledged that his film work is better enjoyed drugged. No, he must have said "best seen". While a healthy toke can see it through the final credits, you can not find much pleasure, avoid some sporadic giggles in the image, not with that. The absence of headlines is the least complaint. Another script, the healthy Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (I challenge you to erase that patina of purity from Saved by the Bell) is a mistake like a rural vampire; She is too round of face for treason. Mr. Shore, himself, occasionally shows the strange talent for mime (I thought I recognized a Jimmy Stewart there), however, it is never used properly. The trivial formula of fish out of water has not been presented with less grace. Our hero, Crawl, has a bit of precious wit to explain in an expeditious and charming way to his agrarian antagonists. Ultimately, I had to announce that it has been found: THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL. PS Like another fish, Adam Sandler did better with "Mr. Deeds". You can take a shore to appreciate a Sandler.
