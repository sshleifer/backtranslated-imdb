The Patriot (nothing to do with the Mel Gibson movie of the same name) came out Steven Seagal was still doing that "save the environment" in his films. Which is right. But it is not good for a good action. <br /> <br /> When the plot (?) of this movie finally came into action, I saw that the turn (?) was approaching. The stance against the Seagal war, the care of the mother and nature is not very subtle. For a film that was originally going to debut in theaters, it was filmed much like a television movie despite some wonderful shots of the country of Dean Semler, the photographer of Dances with Wolves. I like 1 fight scene in the whole movie and it's totally boring. As an action movie fails, as drama sucks, as an environmental message is obvious. Avoid how Ebola meets the plague.
