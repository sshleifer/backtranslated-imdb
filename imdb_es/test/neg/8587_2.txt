This noisy and dizzying football movie by director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the cast; Well, everyone, except William H. Macy, who could have addressed the role played by Mr. Stone, the team doctors or the "fruit cake" that sells cereals. . If you are a fan of the moody, there are some great, profane and downcast phrases, dragged out or dragged, that you can try with friends of two faces and lovers of the road. The movie is sometimes good as a lively party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; it even presents some scenes of MTV-style music videos. <br /> <br /> ** Any Sunday (6/16/99) Oliver Stone ~ Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid
