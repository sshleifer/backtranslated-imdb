The film has a very talented cast that mostly performs well, however, it totally loses the audience, basically everyone is stabbing everyone else and not stabbing them. at the same time because they are stabbing someone else in the back and working with ... did I miss you? Well, the movie is even more confusing, clearly written by a first timer writer, it has some redeeming qualities, although in the acting, especially Famke Janssen shines when Lily, but unfortunately has a lot of time of UNNUDE screen just standing there doing nothing ... the dialogue is a little cheesy and the accents are sometimes irritating, but it's still worth watching them if you're a fan of any of the actors, especially John and Famke, who have more time on the screen. Remember to see it with a notebook so you can write who. It crosses doubly who every second ....
