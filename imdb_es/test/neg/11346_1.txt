This is so bad that I do not know where to start. <br /> <br /> The main role is a good starting point. She is a supreme character of Mary Sue who has few things in common with the original of the book, which was (a little) more credible. No, he is invincible, infallible, indomitable and insipid, even beyond the exaggerated standards that this "chick with a sword" was that our media is turning in recent times. She is a top model in her twenties, thin as a still rich couple, already a leader in her academic field, a kung fu teacher, a natural sniper and seems to have enough authority to beat any officer as the agents of the FBI She is God. <br /> <br /> In order to balance it, it is supposed to be socially awkward (due to its typically harsh education that transformed it into a "Spock") that gives us some charming moments in which it is asked what is "Star Wars" , or "American Idol", but when it's really important, she can reveal herself as a great negotiator and diplomat, because she's very superior, you know. To top it off, it is played by a wooden actress. <br /> <br /> Boreanaz, who has more talent, serves as a faire value token for this construction, acting as an awkward comedian and the house "Watson". In fact, everything there is a pop parody of better works like Sherlock Holmes, CSI and X-Files, from where it tries to emulate the sexual tension between the main protagonists. However, it is cheaper, since it is delivered with all the subtlety of a nudge in the ribs, but a million poor factory women will no doubt buy it, therefore, the crazy rating that this turkey receives. <br /> <br /> In fact, the lowest common denominator goes a long way in this sad puppy, resulting in exciting emotional details from the legion of peers who pretend to pass it as bold and modern, while the overall tone of the program has an evident neoconservative. sight on things. <br /> <br /> As for the story, there is not much here to be delighted, since crimes (which always start with some frightful remains) are solved using non-existent technology while the "strabismus", friendly but so wrong (women less than boys) follow varied theories, all useless since the main character has everything from the beginning, and once it is established, it goes out and hits the guy, typically a really hard man, with a spin kick here and a slap there. The end.
