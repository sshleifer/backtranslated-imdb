The incomparable Paul Naschy, icon of the Spanish horror film, lends his talent to this entertaining, if not outrageous, film. What starts as an action movie ends in a horror story. All I can say is just sit back and enjoy the trip. <br /> <br /> Paul Naschy plays a cold-hearted hitman hired by some somber Japanese diamond hunters (one of whom is his llama, who carries his son)) to slide a stash of diamonds from a Belgian businessman When the action is finished, the charm of the diamonds is too tempting for Paul to fire them, so he kills his Japanese companions. His girlfriend, whose brother Paul killed, swears revenge and pursues Paul through the forest, shooting him and leaving him for dead. However, Paul encounters an egghead with two horny daughters and is taken to his property to recover. <br /> <br /> On the farm, the two daughters, Silvia Aguilar and Azucena Hernández, fight for Paul in his weakened state. with the busty Silvia Aguilar decided not to lose the sweet and primitive Azucena. But things get complicated for Mr. Naschy, who begins to see the ghost of the dead mother of the daughter in the grounds of the farm. Combine this with the Japanese girl who seeks to finish the job of killing Paul and take him out of two sides. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (The story goes in several ways and does not completely satisfy.) The script creates a fight for Paul between the daughters, but Silvia, whose character seems to be assertive and volatile, simply lets Azucena wins in the draw of Paul Naschy without fighting, personally, I would have preferred the story of the ghostly apparition in search of revenge for the Japanese woman) <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You have a set of weapons, a flying baby and pigs that eat a poor imbecile alive.) Gore's bloodhounds will not be disappointed with this Naschy movie). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$$ (Paul Naschy, as always, is fun to watch, but he spends too much time in bed recovering from his wounds.) Starring again for him is the exquisite Silvia Aguilar and the beautiful Azucena Hernandez, who joined Mr. Naschy in the little gem "The Craving." Both girls do a good job.) <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$ (Short visions are obtained from both Aguilar and Hernández, but they are strategically placed, keeping the bits of nothing covered.) Complete nudity is provided by the two less attractive actresses: Japanese woman pursuing Paul and the African maid who works for Silvia and Azucena).
