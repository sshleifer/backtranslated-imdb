Wow. As soon as I saw the cover of this movie, I immediately wanted to see it because it looked really bad. Sometimes I watch Bollywood movies just because they are so bad that they will be entertaining (for example, Koi Mil Gaya). This movie had all the elements of an atrocious movie: a "local band of criminals" that is completely harmless, a scene of bad motorcycles, horrible dialouge ("Congratulations son, I'm very proud that you're a bad boy"), actors play basketball as if they were good and atrocious songs ("I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad bad boy"), inexplicable story lines, why are the friends of Good Boy and Bad Boy? And why is the hot girl in love with the nerd? I've never seen a story so badly constructed with such a horrible thing directly. Some of the scenes actually lasted 30 seconds, like the one in which the Good and Bad Boys inexplicably went through the "gangster" poker game. Congratulations Ashwini Chaudry, you're a bad director. If you want to see a good movie, look at Guru, if you want to see a movie so bad that it's really entertaining, then look Good Boy, Boy.
