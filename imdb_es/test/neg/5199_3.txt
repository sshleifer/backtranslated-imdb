I was pleasantly pleased with the ending. I just watched this movie yesterday and I was going to turn it off, but I changed my mind. It was not in the direction in which I thought the story would end. That is all the positive that I can say about this movie. All the actors are nobodys, especially the protagonist. While she is an attractive young woman, she will never make it big. The writing, the direction and the action are wooded, something like what you would see in day soaps. The filming locations were very smart in making you think that it could be anywhere, instead of flagrantly saying that it was in Canada. As this was filmed entirely in Canada, I assume that the whole lot was Canadian, which is not all bad, since some recent productions of Canadien TV: "Cold Squad", "Stone, Underover" are pretty well done.
