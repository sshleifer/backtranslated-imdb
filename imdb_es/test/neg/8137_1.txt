Barbara Payton is the sensual and sexy young and sexy wife of Chickie the owner of the Geezer plantation somewhere in a lot of jungley located in a cheap studio in Hollywood. Raymond Burr wears his work shirt with the top button unbuttoned like the burly plantation foreman with whom Mrs. Payton is eager to blow up the joint. There's another girl, a kind of peasant slave Burr used to play with, but she gave him the old soot, so the obligatory old voodoo witch is conjuring a good spell to cast on him and Payton's vagabond. I only saw it partly because it's really horrible, so I could not even see the star of the show, which I think is a gorilla that the witch of voo-doo turned into someone or whatever ... who cares . I give a half star of ten possible. It's not even campy, just that bad.
