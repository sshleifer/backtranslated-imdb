I loved the first 15 minutes, and I loved part of the dialogue in the court, which proved to be the best showcase of the director's acting technique ahead of time, but this movie finally disappoints. Even when it is considered simply as a metaphor for the oppressive / oppressed dynamics that prevailed and prevails in the relationship between the US government and its more "disobedient" citizens, it still lacks strength and credibility, and finally it left me looking at my watch waiting for The obvious ending would already happen. <br /> <br /> And for the record: despite the growing rumors against, this movie has never been banned in the United States (I can not comment on the rumors of censorship in the UK, but I'm suspect). Hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial presentation at the film festival, and I am more than willing to believe that the Nixon administration had some influence on this decision; however, the fact that he never appeared on American television is simply a reflection of the rather careful and publicity of this means of doing business. As for the present, you can receive your own copy of the DVD at your door through Amazon in a few days.
