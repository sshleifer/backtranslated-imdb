Martha Plimpton has made some prestigious films, working with River Phoenix and Harrison Ford, but was never able to expand her limited appeal to the same class as, say, Molly Ringwald. This film, which was just released, is just an extension of his attempts to find a character on the screen that was identifiable to viewers, and represents another failure. Plimpton plays a troubled young woman who discovers on her 21st birthday that she was adopted and, worse, that she was actually abandoned when she was a baby at her parents' door! He proposes to find his biological mother and father, but the viewer has no idea why he would want to do it (would mere curiosity give him such determination?). Unattractive material given the handling of comedies; Start with the wrong foot and never recover. Plimpton offers a bitter and sullen performance, but Hector Elizondo and Mary Kay Place are well as their adoptive parents. * 1/2 of ****
