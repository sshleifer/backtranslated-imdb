If you like really impressive movies this is for you. Acting is the worst I've seen in my life and the story line goes nowhere. If you find this movie in your video store, do not even consider borrowing it. The girl on the cover is not even the one in the movie. I gave this movie 1/10 just because I could not vote 0. Avoid it at all costs.
