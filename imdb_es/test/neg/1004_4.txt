When I see this movie for the first time, twenty years after its release, I do not understand it. Why has it been such a big success in 1986? His amateurs drip from every scene. The jokes are lame and predictable. The sex scenes are exploitative and exaggerated (does not mean that Miss Rudnik does not have beautiful tits!). The song is "schrecklich". The only really amusing scene is the big gunfight when gangsters die dancing, a trait that dates from the movie firmly until the mid-eighties. It is really very disconcerting for me how incapable I am to understand what triggered the enthusiasm of the audiences in 1986 (and apparently still today, reading the comments of my fellow IMDBers).
