New Orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in this movie debacle <br /> <br />. Quaid's attempt to speak with a Cajun accent <br /> <br /> (by the way, hardly anyone speaks that way in New Orleans) is terrible. Plot = elementary and meaningless. This image <br /> <br /> refers to itself as a mystery, but a mystery implies a gradual process by which the viewer receives tracks and turns throughout a film. There is nothing of that here. "Big <br /> <br /> Easy" tries to cope with New Orleans stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled, the real Big Easy does not look anything like the city <br /> <br /> that Quaid and Barkin make their way.
