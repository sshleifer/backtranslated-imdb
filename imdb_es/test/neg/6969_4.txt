Directed and written by the famous / infamous Edward D. Wood Jr., using a pseudonym (Daniel Davis) who plays the lead role of Glen / Glenda. This is an almost radical documentary about transvestism; Wood himself is a transvestite with a fetish of angora sweaters. It looks like miles of footage and an incoherent Bela Lugosi is used to lengthen this strange and awkward movie in 67 minutes. The police inspector (Lyle Talbot) seeks the enlightenment of a psychiatrist, Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell), to better understand the emotion and disposition of the transvestites. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast: Delores Fuller, "Tommy" Hanes, Captain DeZita and Wood's sister, Evelyn. Highlights: Farrell also acts as a narrator. And Fuller later helped write songs included in the Elvis Presley films BLUE HAWAII, KISSIN 'COUSINS & KID GALAHAD.
