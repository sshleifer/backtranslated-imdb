Good actors, good director, well acted, well directed but ... Where is the movie? Did they have a script or did they just improvise everything? At least it is a short film (only 80 minutes, including credits). Nothing seems to happen in this movie, nothing at all. A couple of small drug dealers trapped in little time problems, but you will never realize what is happening, not even what they talk about in some sequences of the movie. Tons of "f *** 's" and "motherf *****' s", but nothing more ... <br /> <br /> For people who love Abel Ferrara's films like The Funeral, 'Xmas is going to be a big disappointment, as it has been for me. What was I thinking? Did he really think it was a good movie? And if he did not, why did he do it?
