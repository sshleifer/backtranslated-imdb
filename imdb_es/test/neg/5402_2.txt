A lot of people who have seen this are confused, obviously. The original title of "Cottonmouth Joe" would have put things in a better perspective for much of the audience. Personally, I have experienced the condition of Cottonmouth (often accompanied by a really bad hangover after a weekend) and it is very similar to the movie Skeleton Man, a dry and delicate film that causes regret in recent elections and begs for a burning shower. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the choice of "Skeleton Man" for the title has been finalized by the distributor (probably the work of some nosy Hollywood executive with nothing that did not understand it) and not "Cottonmouth Joe" . Those of us who have seen the film know that Skeleton Man is actually Cottonmouth Joe (a skeletal appearance, not a true Skeleton Man). The deception of the people who commercialize this film is unforgivable, and just for that, I can not give this movie a high rating. Imagine this: when the future filmmakers come together to create the real definitive film of Skeleton Man and need a title, they will be totally ruined and all of us, as serious fans of the genre, will be diminished by that. <br /> <br /> Cottonmouth Joe could have become an icon of the horror movie with Madman Marz, Black Claw, Mansouche, Humongous, "Nature Boy" Billy Conners, Morty, the wooden doll, Boogen, Eegah , The Moon Beast, Bloody Bill, The Killer Driller, Mickey Rooney, and so on, but it will always be remembered as a simulated skull with a sword wielding a bonnet and a face tied next to a would-be horse skeleton man. <br /> <br /> That's very bad.
