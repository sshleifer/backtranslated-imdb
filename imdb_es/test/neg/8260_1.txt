Good,. So I went into this loving RuPaul. I still love her but I think a little less. This is a great movie that shows many male genitalia. This is a parody of the films of black exploitation of the 1970s and is wrongly done on purpose. For me, the only fun part of this is that all voices have linked with those of drag queens, even those of real women. This is more than the best, non-stop, laugh at your back, it's such a stupid and poorly made movie. I would never see this again, but I do appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do. There is no qualification in this, but it would be R or even NC-17. RuPaul has done a much better job.
