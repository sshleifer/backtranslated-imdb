"First Snow" has an intriguing start. A street vendor tells his fortune to an old man, whose predictions are amazingly correct. From this point, the film develops as a bloated episode of "Twilight Zone". I mean nothing more than car trips, phone calls and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is anything but a sympathetic character, ignoring the welfare of other people for the sake of his own paranoia. The end is especially weak, without any benefit to the audience that suffered for a long time. Do yourself a big favor and avoid this one. Not recommended. - MERK
