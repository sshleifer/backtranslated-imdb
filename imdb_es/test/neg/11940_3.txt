When I saw the advances of this movie, it seemed like a good romantic comedy. I expected some light fluffy fun. Instead, I was bored and a little depressed. <br /> <br /> Honestly, there was no chemistry between the protagonists, and the movie had little, if anything, that was funny. The girl was adorable: when she cried, I cried, but I thought that they could have used someone a little younger on paper. <br /> <br /> Either way, the movie was full of long, dull silences or swelling the music of the opera. I'm not anti-opera, but I would have preferred that they spend that time allowing us to meet the characters, who were all rigid and undeveloped. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed in this movie. All the time I saw him, I kept thinking about the best that could have been.
