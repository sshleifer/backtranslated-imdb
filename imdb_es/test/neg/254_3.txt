The usual disclaimer: I do not grant 1-star ratings to movies that are harmless, bad, low-budget and dumb, although they may deserve it. These movies are often fun, and they are classified 2-4 based entirely on the value of entertainment, not as a representation of their exemplary cinematic art. This film fits perfectly with this model. It is a movie of Mexican monsters, plagued by narrations in off and effects not so special extremely weak. The makeup is not so bad, and the acting is sometimes quite entertaining, but this movie is almost as stupid as Aliens vs Predator and the script is not that simple (Aliens vs Predator could get a 1 from me, but I want to see it from new before he commits). <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, but deliciously complicated. If you've read this far, you really should want to know ... A group of notably non-scientific scientists understand the main characters. Most of them are heroes, more or less, but one is (of course) crazy and quite wicked. This mad scientist invents a laughing nuclear energy robot (which looks a little like the Tin Man of Wizard of Oz, but has a human face inexplicably located inside his head). An Aztec mummy, discovered by the same "scientist" whose wife turned out to be an Aztec princess in a past life (do not ask), faces the robot for the great "climax", only the scene of the fight is enough to put the viewer of the most stoic movie on the floor in laughter. <br /> <br /> For its value, given the budget and the absolute stupidity of the script, this is a very funny movie of monsters of the low budget fool's ball. If you like that kind of thing, go for it.
