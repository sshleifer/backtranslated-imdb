Bugsy Siegel was 31 years old when he left the West Coast. In addition to his dreams about Las Vegas, he played with the idea of ​​acting. He was a handsome boy and about 7 years younger than his friend George Raft, so it was not such a crazy idea. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty was 54 years old when he made this film and, despite the hair dye, he is too old for this part. Beatty was a disaster Bugsy should have been played by someone like Alec Baldwin. Bugsy was a tough guy feared by his contemporaries; Beatty simply does not radiate threat. <br /> <br /> This was a vanity project for Beatty, who has not accepted the fact that he is no longer a leading man. <br /> <br /> The other big annoying mistake is Mantegna like George Raft. Raft had a distinctive voice and gestures, none of which Mantegna tries to match. You never think that Mantegna came from the streets. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty and Robert Redford have been pretending to be younger for years by the massive use of hair dye, and now it will be a sudden shock to go gray and play parts of the character.
