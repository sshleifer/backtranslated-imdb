This love story between an American journalist and a doctor from Eurasia does not contain much conflict, since she is very Westernized (after having studied in London), and no artificial fire, since she behaves quite restricted. The little interest that history manages to raise is affected by its wooden dialogues. They are supposed to be two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but they speak as if the words were put out loud by a Hollywood hack that is not much of oneself. The film also suffers from an amazing lack of realism: a completely deserted beach in the small Hongkong, crowded by a million Chinese refugees. And a presumed American journalist in his 40s who does not know what a hysterectomy is? Hollywood ideas. Finally "the song". After listening to him about twenty times throughout the film, starting with the credits, he tends to lose part of his emotional impact, I'm sorry to say.
