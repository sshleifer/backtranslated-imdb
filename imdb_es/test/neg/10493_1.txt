Mixing sheriffs from small cities, high school students, fake rock music and some weird bugs that kill, well, for no particular reason, this movie is essentially a new version of "The Giant Gila Monster", except without the Gila monster of course . <br /> <br /> Now, anyone who has seen "Giant Gila Monster" knows that it is one of the worst movies of all time, often so slow, it's not even funny. And I can not believe that by 1967, "Giant Gila Monster" had earned such a reputation that young directors were dying to work on a sequel, let alone a new version. Will someone please explain to me why this movie was made? The sequence of the dance, by the way, is historically interesting, although about three years ago; but even that is spoiled, since it continues ... and continues ... and ... continues ...
