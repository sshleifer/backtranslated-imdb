Brooke Shields, who retires from her duties as "Suddenly Susan," plays a bitter divorcee who entangles three girlfriends in a weekend "just for girls" in Palm Springs. The problem: Brooke is "detached" and lurking, while her friends are all involved. Hence the implications of the title and the emotional reaction of its "amoral" causes during the weekend. <br /> <br /> Despite some laughter from the relationship authorities of Dan Cortese ("Victoria's Closet") and MTV "Adam Corolla and Dr. Drew Pinsky, this is a shady thing for women only." DB Sweeney , Virginia Madsen and Jon Polito are co-stars.
