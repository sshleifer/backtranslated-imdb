First, the premise sucks ... the child likes to dress in girl's clothes. It reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The jokes are bad and old, you've seen them in a dozen 50 and 60 movies. The whole cast is wasted. I bet people signed up just to be in a Shirley MacLaine vehicle. Please, would anyone tell Shirley that he did his best comedy in TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA? See it ... if there are no repetitions of Andy Griffith.
