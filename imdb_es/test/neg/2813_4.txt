Big D.B. it tries to maintain peace between the settlers and their red brothers. <br /> <br /> Boone (an old man, Bruce Bennett) has to try to prove to the local Indian chief (Lon Chaney, Jr., who seems to be drunk, as usual) that his son was killed by the main imbecile of the tribe that has also been dealing with rifle trafficking when no one is looking. Faron Young sings, though he holds his rifle like a mop. <br /> <br /> OK western-adventure directed by two guys, none of whom has many credits on their résumé, but this movie is not so bad and has a short and pleasant 76 minute run time.
