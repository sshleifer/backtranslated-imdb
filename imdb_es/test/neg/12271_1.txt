For those of you who do not remember the movies - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ - this came out in '79 (I guess it's been enough time so, naturally, Nunzio thought he could just redo this and say you wrote it, yes, okay!). <br /> <br /> The action in this regard is exaggerated: the "tough guys" walk with their shoulders hunched to give the impression that they are bigger than them. they really are, also the "hero" seems to have a passion for snorting, and rolling his eyes like an insect to express anguish / anger at the celluloid eye. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of racial message here, from the Sicilian perspective (keep in mind that this is about the third generation on the line ... the original "wogs" came to OZ after the War and during my childhood, yes, I'm Australian, so the "wogg -iness" has been diluted a lot, they even sound like true blue Australians, it's not a flash of the "dago accent" anywhere (there's another jargon for you , nun!) <br /> <br /> Maori is with sunnies (sunglasse s) at 4 am - it must be great to be blinded by the sun in the middle of the night and it seems like Redfern ... this is the end Tedious of this movie, Nunzio tried to copy the flavor of the Warriors, but left too many holes in the story.What about the matches? <br /> <br /> The warriors had a bunch of baseball players wielding bats, with White face makeup chases the heroes to a train station and they fight against them. illa de Nunzios is persecuted at a railway station by Adhere to the men with whitish masks. The warriors were wrongly accused of firing / murdering another member of a gang; the gang members of Nunzios were wrongly accused of raping the sister of the great Maori gang leader. The warriors are attracted to a room by a gang of girls who attack them. The crowd of Nunzios wants to collide in the house of a friend, who is populated by, yes, a gang of girls. There are almost too many copies of the Warriors to keep them. About here <br /> <br /> It saddens me that people do not want to see other OZ movements because of this gut: what about Mad Max, Commander and World Teacher? Not all films are made by actors who are so bad, they have to finance their own films. <br /> <br /> As for the other actors in this show, it seems that they have followed the example of "the nun", since everyone is as bad as the others: do not bother with this movie! I can not get my money back, so save yours!
