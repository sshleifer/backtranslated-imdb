Has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a new version of the 1933 version, with some of the scenes taken out? It makes me think less about a movie that does that, showing a clear lack of creativity. To be fair, I tend to be predisposed in favor of Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the film seems cinematic plagiarism. The 1933 version was nice and sweet, although a little uncomfortable in the presentation and the transition sometimes, and then this version took the script, the music and even a good amount of blocking the scene from the previous version. I do not understand the point of re-making the film when the method of remaking it was basically to remake George Cukor's film with all the same, except the people who work on it.
