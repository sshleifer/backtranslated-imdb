Mainly unmum mumbo-jumbo biblical that lasts for more than two hours. The only thing that saves this movie from the crown of God (and there is only one God, remember) is the fun and involuntary dialogue, and a good battle scene that comes too late in the movie. During most of the two hours, until the action scenes, there is too much talk; the dialogue is so inept that the film simply asks to be falsified by MST3K. <br /> <br /> George Sanders is absolutely horrible; One of the most animated, too theatrical performances I've seen. Brynner is not much better; His rigid, wooden performance, combined with the horrendous words of the fortune cookie, make Solomon quite bored and dumb. It seems that every time Brynner opens his mouth, something so wise and ridiculously loud and powerful comes to light. To some extent, it is not Sanders and Brynner's fault, due to the bad humor, the comic dialogue and the typically biblical one-dimensional characterization, but otherwise they made little effort. Brynner's accent even resembles Schwarzenegger a bit; This is not an advantage. Only Lollobrigida manages to avoid embarrassing herself, by playing the role with more conviction and in a manner appropriate to a role in such a silly movie. Describing these biblical characters as one-dimensional would also give them an undeserved credit; The characterization is semi-dimensional.
