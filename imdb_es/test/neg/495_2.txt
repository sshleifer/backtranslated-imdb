Without emotion. Bad music (and I am a reformed metal guy from the eighties, so I would be vulnerable to some good things). Everything is half done. The brother is a parody, there is nothing to stop us, except to see what horror of the eighties will stop next. The manager of the tour tries to bring a humanity to the thing, but it is not given enough time. Wahlberg is fine and Aniston is dragging the words. We know that she did not need the money. Is this the only role she could fit on her summer vacation? Surely you should hit your forehead every time it appears on VH1, which is only slightly less frequent than Ozzy. It just qualifies as a television movie. It's hard to believe that it was actually released theatrically.
