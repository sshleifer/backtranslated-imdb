Supposedly, this is the final film of the series Left Behind, which is a fundamentalist preacher and novelist Tim LaHaye's idea of ​​what we can expect in our future in the last days of Planet Earth. If this is the case, we can expect an activist presidency in every sense of the word if Barack Obama becomes president next year. <br /> <br /> The Fantastic Four of the Revelation is back with a cast change, Arnold Pinnock, the one who would most know him as the counselor in Life With Derek, is now the minister who takes the place of Clarence Gilyard . Brad Johnson as an anti-Christ pilot during the day and Christian at night is there as his daughter Janaya Stephens and his investigative reporter Kirk Cameron. These are the only four people on Earth who have guessed the true nature of the Secretary General of the United Nations, Nicolai Karpathy, and once again they are throwing sand into their machinery. <br /> <br /> This time they have as an ally the President of the United States, played by Louis Gossett, Jr. He is having a very bad time, especially the launching of the guerrillas in a role attack in a presidential caravan that kills to Vice President Charles Martin Smith. That's right, the toad is the vice president. Someone really made a mistake here because everyone, including those who would hurt them, knows that a President and a Vice President NEVER travel together. <br /> <br /> It all takes the whole movie to convince Gossett who Karpathy really is. Once again, the best of the film is Gordon Currie as Karpathy. <br /> <br /> We may see another Left Behind movie. However, the door remained open, although people assure me that it has run out of original material. by Tim LeHaye. I guess as long as they make money and these players can not get a job in the conventional film industry. And there are some unsolved plot problems that involve Brad Johnson and Chelsea Noble, who is Mrs. Kirk Cameron in real life. <br /> <br /> One of the Fantastic Four dies in this movie, so it will be the Fantastic Three or they will receive another quarter. Stay tuned.
