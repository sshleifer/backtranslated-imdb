I agree that this film is about sex without seduction or love. In fact, it makes sex seem so boring and I wonder why bother. Actually, I do not think this remotely refers to how the second generations of Canadian Indians feel about sex. In any case, did you know that the first hotel / drunk idea was copied from a Korean movie, Yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or more? That Korean film was really brilliant as a comedy, but at the same time it forces the audience to reflect on the complexity of male-female relationships and the difference between man and woman in experience and thought. I mean that most of the hotel / drunken segment of Neal N Nikki was emulated shot by shot. Can not the creators of Bollywood films try to make originals only, please? Seriously, I never enjoyed a Hindi movie that is an imitator. Those I enjoy have always spoken Indian feelings through Indian cultural media.
