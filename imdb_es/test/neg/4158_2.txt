There is nothing worse than science fiction created by people who do not have the sensation to do it. Clinging to a concept that would not be so terrible in itself (a future where cloning is common enough to make it a crime for you to reproduce with someone too genetically close to you), the screenwriter proceeded to admit its evil. the right imagination to run wild. <br /> <br /> When the character of Tim Robbins could guess the password of a security guard's computer simply by having her tell him something about it, he knew he was in trouble. Later, it was revealed that this ability was due to the fact that Robbins had taken an "empathy virus", since the viruses were used to grant instantaneous (or almost instantaneous) skill updates to their users. Robbins' love interest complained about her own experience with that virus, a virus in Mandarin Chinese, which allowed her to speak Chinese, but as she complained, "I could not understand what she was saying." Okay, first of all, empathy, no matter how intense, is not ESP. Without incorporating some kind of true mind-reading aspect (like a virus of empathy that actively releases virions nearby, it infects nearby people, it recovers fragments of its memory and then it departs for the original host, which is, as You can probably say (a bit on the impractical side) you can not justify being able to determine a specific detail like someone's password simply by "listening to things you did not say." Nor can you acquire the ability to speak a language without understanding what is saying: the virus can not infect your vocal cords or translate it at the moment, because a virus can not "think." To give you the power to speak Chinese, such a learning virus would have to modify your brain. the neurons, and once it's there, it's yours *: you certainly understand what you're saying, because you have to do it, to use your own brain to make a task, you must understand that task (for the most part). Unless, of course, the film suggests that the virus was deliberately designed to implement a bizarre multiple-personality mental schism in which some of its own personalities function as integrated unidirectional translators. <br /> <The mixture of languages ​​spoken by the characters is decent enough, although it is not remarkable enough to justify all the love that other critics have given. In addition, all the multicultural insertions in the world can not compensate for a simple and frustrating fact: the dialogue sucks! It is slow, laborious and unnatural. Once again, I am sure that the followers have convinced themselves that the strange strangeness is simply the result of an inspired genius that creates a truly futuristic form of discourse (and, therefore, subject to linguistic drift) . I do not agree. A good dialogue is a good dialogue at any time, and the same goes for guts. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will revisit the central concept of the film: the prohibition of sex with yourself. Generalized cloning is a classic and enjoyable science fiction theme. This is the global warming that leads to ecological devastation (which also incorporates Code 46). Unfortunately, the two do not go together! If you have an ecological disaster that greatly reduces the area of ​​available housing, do not run around people cloning! It already has enough population problems, it does not add to them by generating new problems. Regular and outdated sex and birth provide the entire population you need, and cloning of any kind would be ruthlessly suppressed. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the movie was not so bad. I had a good cinematography. Maybe if I had seen him silenced, I could have enjoyed it.
