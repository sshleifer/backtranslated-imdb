Made with the movie stock that was left of Nana's production, South to Charleston Air of 1927 is described as a holiday movie for everyone involved, and that's the best way to see it. Jean Renoir seems never to have thought enough to edit the images together. The plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes. in 2028 a black explorer travels to a Paris after the holocaust, where a white native girl teaches him the Charleston (naturally, he assumes that she is a savage whose dance is a prelude to eating it before surrendering to the seductive rhythm of the music of 'White Aborigine'). There are a lot of surreal touches, whether it's the pet gorilla who eats the flowers in Catherine Hessling's hair, the angels the girl calls (Renoir and producer Pierre Braunberger among them) or the fact that the black actor Johnny Huggins plays his role in the pussy of the black face while Hessling. the ability to dance is almost completely non-existent, and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion, but there really is not enough to hold it for two reels. An additional air of surrealism is the fact that this silent musical does not score at all on the new Lions Gate DVD.
