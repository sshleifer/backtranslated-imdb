To put in simple words or rather a word, it would be better for PATHETIC !!!!!! The film begins with a bit of interest in the plot, but, as few minutes for the audience is being disturbed by the baths and sandwiches, or by breathing fresh air out of the dark and closed corridor ... <br /> <br /> It seems as if we were watching a movie from the 1960s in which the colors were off, directed by a debutante and played by high school students! The film revolves around an American actress who tries to return to the cinema by acting in one of the not so great Indian films. His acting is real. Sad, complemented by the worst delivery of dialogues. <br /> <br /> Above all: I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie. I still want to see it. Then, try to see it at home, when a television channel transmits it. believe me, it would be fun since this movie would not have a single ad or sponsors. <br /> <br /> And you better take an aspirin, you might need it if you can not find a remote control to change the channel! P.S. I have no idea, if the other reviewers even saw the movie? I did it and I wasted my $ 10 on the ticket!
