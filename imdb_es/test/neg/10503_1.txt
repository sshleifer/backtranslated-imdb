Okay, I'm usually fascinated by Z movies. Some of the actors, directors, writers, etc. in those films they have a hint of talent. They want to take out that talent so unfortunately for them, they have to associate with shitty people to make their movies. But some Z movies have at least one thing that can be remarkable about them. <br /> <br /> Not here. <br /> <br /> As soon as I saw it, I thought ... 'Wow, a Blade elimination'. Believe me, if this movie had been up to that label that would have made it a better movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, I was subjected to some of the most horrible performances I've ever seen. Master Kao was bad, so bad that I think some of my neurons in my brain exploded trying to understand his performance. I'm still trying to make sense of his enunciation and why he raised his voice by saying certain words ... to add a dramatic effect, I'm sure ... but it was not for an apparent reason. Simply bewildered. <br /> <br /> Oh, and then there's the black guy in the purple cape near the end of the movie. The man in the purple cape fights the hero for about 30 seconds, but it's so bad that he actually looked like he was afraid to fight. <br /> <br /> The main hero and the main villain did decent jobs. The main hero (Derek Washington) seemed to really know the martial arts.
