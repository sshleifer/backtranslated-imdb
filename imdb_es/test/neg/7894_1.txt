With horrible movies like this, even considered, let alone made, it's very easy to see why Hollywood is in serious trouble with bad frames and worse remakes all the time. <br /> <br /> I suppose the viewer is supposed to laugh at their rear ends about the black jokes, the appearance of "padded" and the "Bling". It's so incredible "exaggerated" and so bad that it even surpasses the "So bad that it's funny again" brand and has collapsed into "totally embarrassing for anyone involved." <br /> <br /> I'm very, very sorry for every minute I lost in this one. I want to recover my time! <br /> <br /> Save yourself the agony, DO NOT look at this. The only reason I can give even 1 point in the rating is that 0 was not an option.
