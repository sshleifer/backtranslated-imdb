Now I am a big fan of animation. I love Svankmeyer and, generally, I'm involved in all the stop motion apps, so I had high hopes for it. Then I came to IMDb and I stopped: I always distrust movies with a bimodal distribution of votes in IMDb. Here we have another --- a lot of 10s (any shill) and then some really low ones. I also distrust the 10 with the word "visionary" in them. <br /> <br /> Surely there are visionaries but this character is not one of them. Despite my doubts, I saw this movie and I have to support it. The stop motion animation was fine, but the plots were banal and in general it seemed amateur. Pamper yourself with the real deal, get some Svankmeyer and let this also run on the shelf.
