I'm a fan of low-budget movies and horror movies, but this was too much, even for me. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the weak plot, the cheesy effects and the uninspired performance, then the horrible writing will kill you, or you will want it to. Most likely, the dialogue was written by the high school drug addicts, who thought that saying "sir, yes sir" over and over again, made these boys seem more military. <br /> <br /> The characters were all typical cardboard stereotypes: Gung-ho sarge, another guy with the sensitive side, evil scientist with a secret agenda (bald or of course), a malicious girl who would be fashionable if I will try too, sexy and silly girl with vital information, idiot "genius" nerd, randomly other types of military men who die soon enough, and a spoiler character, a mad scientist who was in charge "until something went terribly wrong "Oh, yes, I almost forgot, there is a secret military submarine (the Navy?) Sitting on the ocean floor, 5 minutes from HQ (or so it seems), full of radioactive scorpions (ok?) And corpses. Your mission is vague and ill defined ... <br /> <br /> If you see this, do not say that they did not warn you.
