If there was an EPA for the movie, then this movie would get its most sincere approval. If we all recycle our "things" up to this point, we would never be left with nothing. <br /> <br /> It's funny how I remembered this movie when I first saw Starwars I: The Phantom Menace. At least Lucas did not recycle his old images. <br /> <br /> This is a failure. But it is a beautiful failure. Cute in points (I liked it when the child said, "damn rocks"). And, if you like explosions (even recycled ones), you will be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Actually, for an obviously "no-budget" movie, it looks pretty good. Acting is weak, but there is a small characterization here and there. The story is predictable, but it will guide you along anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a type of movie that "everybody chases the child", which will probably attract younger audiences. I gave this one 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I dug up my old VHS copy of this movie. I do not think it's on DVD.
