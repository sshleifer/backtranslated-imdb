It is sad that some find it worthwhile to watch this movie. I'm Russian, and I'm disgusted. There is nothing in this film that deserves praise, except cinematography. However, I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this movie is poorly designed and directed. There is nothing more irritating and even irritating than shameless speculation in art (if you can call it garbage art). Balabanov wanted to surprise the spectators with the generalized evil, and managed to create a dark and hopeless film. But the biggest impact is the work of Balabanov's primitive director. I would never recommend any of my friends to see it. Huge disappointment!
