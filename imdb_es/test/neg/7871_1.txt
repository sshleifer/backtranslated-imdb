This is 1 hour and 24 minutes of sheer boredom! <br /> <br /> In this 'Action' movie, even the gun that Baldwin uses (HK G3A3) stinks. The armed forces around the world sent him to recycling in the mid-1980s, and now it is only used by terrorists, bank robbers and military museums. <br /> <br /> If I had known that this movie was so bad, I would prefer to see it. 10 episodes of MacGyver saving the planet. <br /> <br /> No slot, no drive and no feeling. Look at the Tupperware channel? It's more exciting than this sorry excuse for a movie. This movie does not deserve a '0' on the scale. Better luck next time, Baldwin. Until then, will I sit here and watch my toenails grow? Is that much more exciting than 'Target'?
