Man, this is terrible. It does not deserve much comment, so, to be brief, Rebecca DeMornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls in love with the Latin lover Antonio Banderas in a wine shop, the ponytail and prison tattoos. When she lets go, she really lets go. Apart from this torrid affair he is having (and we must admit that the matter has its speed) it is a rather cold fish. Her sick and broken father appears for the first time in years and she throws him out. She is also an expert in keeping her horny neighbor (Dennis Miller) at bay. And there's the prisoner Harry Dean Stanton who is trying to maneuver her into giving him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder, so that he does not have his soldiers pinned to the wall by the serial murders he has committed. <br /> <br /> All these people, and maybe more, are immediately suspicious when strange things happen to them. Someone sends dead flowers. Someone does untold things to your cat. (The next time you see a domestic pet appear in a package or hang it in the closet or boil it in a pot, I will vomit). So, who is doing it? Guess. No power on earth could force me to reveal the end, but a suggestion may help: child abuse. <br /> <br /> The excuse of abuse is an interesting business in itself, much more interesting than the movie. What does "child abuse" mean? Are we referring to sexual abuse? Physical? Both of them? What if you hit a child on the back with a wooden spoon to cook, strong enough to break it? That's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids, as well as other wandering children in the neighborhood. Sexual abuse? That never happened to any of us, as far as I know, although I'm not sure he would have been rejected with any degree of animation. In the village of Samoa that I studied for two years, there was a case of a teenage boy who played sexually with a much younger girl. The girl's family took out hell. The boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village, an exile that lasted two years. When he returned, the incident was forgotten by everyone, including the child. (By the way, the girl we see here is less than five years old, so she is unlikely to remember Dad's nightly visits in any case, since long-term memory is not really established until that date). DeMornay's experience leading to His mental disorder can be called "the social construction of trauma." It is not there unless we put it there. Enough of the psychiatric conference. That will be fifteen cents. <br /> <br /> Do you want a trauma? I will give you a trauma. The film absolutely forces us to identify with the character of Rebecca DeMornay, from the beginning. Then, when she has her first date with Antonio Banderas, and Pio Donnagio's score is hitting us with eroticism on the head, the camera gives us a shot over her shoulder of the naked torso Antonio crawling on us with his hairy chest. Now that is traumatic. It makes any male spectator feel like he's on the laundry floor in the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. Do not get me wrong I do not dislike Antonio Banderas. It's just that I'm not in love with him. There are not enough nude shots of the elven body of Rebecca DeMornay throughout the universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety. <br /> <br /> This is an attractive way to survive this movie. Instead of just sitting there, try to select the scenes that were filmed in Toronto and separate them from those filmed in Budapest. It's a challenge, really, and you can, as far as we know, preserve your sanity.
