While The Twilight Zone was a wonderful show, it was also very uneven, with some great episodes, some lousy and many intermediate. Do not believe the fans, as there were many stinkers and this was definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> In a plot that is obviously meant to be an attack on Fidel Castro, almost similar (Peter Falk (with a lot of makeup and beard) gets a magic mirror that allows him to realize who are all his enemies to be able to liquidate them, although I believe that Castro is a bully and a dictator (and this is witnessed by tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners), it is amazing how this type of pay episode actually makes the public laugh at the efforts Americans for marginalizing the drag and Castro really does look good !! Think about it Serling and company wanted to hurt Castro, but instead they just seemed obvious, preachers and fools in the process. <br /> <br /> In Truth is bad, almost ridiculously bad when you see it today.
