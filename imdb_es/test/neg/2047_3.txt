As Americans, we have come to expect mistakes to be "par for the course" when it comes to HORROR and unknown directors directing unknown actors acting for unknown writers. We really hope that this stinks and when they do not, it becomes a hit during the night. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a success at night, nor is it a success on the weekend or the month. This blows from beginning to end and my only recommendation is this: GO TO KNOW IT KNOW, SO SUPPORT IT, enjoy it for what it is, for what it is not and if you have something better to do, keep it in the back. . It is entertaining to see the elderly cross a busy street during rush hour, but do not expect much, almost never run over by a real car, it's just a lot of problems.
