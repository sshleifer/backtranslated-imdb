they should make the terrorists see this video as torture, and not only because of the disturbing final scene in which to tie and beat a woman with mental problems is apparently a source of comedy. About half an hour of this could convince even the most fundamental fundamentalist to spill the beans instead of sitting for one more minute of this disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. I rented it because a friend told me it was very funny, only to find out that he was talking about the hardest director who made the comments instead of the movie itself. I guess if you find arrogance funny without restrictions, you'll like this. Apparently, it is true that he continues to talk about the girls he has "hit", the most insipid example is when the main actress appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> Actually, CJ Stacy was the only good part of this movie: his charisma sparkles like a diamond in this horrible pile of excrement. Apparently, this is the only movie he has done according to IMDb. I hope she is involved with the theater or the independent cinema, since I think she has the talent and the natural beauty to be really an asset for any production.
