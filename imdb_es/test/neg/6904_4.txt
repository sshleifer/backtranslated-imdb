Let's see ... a dozen Gary Larson gags, as well as his style of illustration, a possibly legally difficult wholesale appropriation of an Aardman character, a sprinkling of the more than generous art direction of several Pixar films, the villains of Lion King-esquire. in what amounts to an elephant graveyard IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY OF FARM, oh, and a stinking 'Riverdance joke ten years after any possible relevance. The children (three and five) liked it, but boy, it was a trip for dad. Just another weak attempt by Nickelodean Films to engage in the explosion of animation. I really wish they had spent a little more money on character design, on rendering, on a script, on a director.
