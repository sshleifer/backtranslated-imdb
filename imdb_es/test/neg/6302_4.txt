"Priscilla, the queen of the desert" is always presented as a masterpiece of Australian cinema. I found it quite disappointing. The main actors are great: Terence Stamp is aging beautifully, Guy Pearce should do more comedies instead of the hard papers he chooses and I've been a fan of Hugo Weaving since I saw him play Oberon eons ago. The cinematography is great, but if you have ever been in the Australian outback, you will know that the air is so clear and the light so bright that they could have filmed it in the film equivalent of a Box Brownie and still would. They have looked spectacular. <br /> <br /> So, what is my problem? Well, three things. First, there is not a sympathetic female character in the whole movie. A woman who has to make a living throwing ping-pong balls out of their private homes in a pub next to the road deserves our sympathy. Tick's wife does not receive much better treatment. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scene in which they sing "I Will Survive" to a group of aborigines is offensive. To try to establish any kind of parallel between the struggles of queens and transsexuals and the almost total destruction of Aboriginal culture, which is what I suppose the scene is supposed to do, shows a level of historical understanding worthy of Paris Hilton. . <Br /> <br /> Finally, and the biggest flaw in the movie is that it's just not fun enough. Did Stephan Elliott really talk to some drag queens when writing the movie? Anyone who knows a drag queen (or three or four) knows that most of them have ingenuity and are not afraid to use them. Now, I can understand that a lot of drag queen banter would probably get the rejected rating of the movie, but Elliott should have been able to gather enough "kid-appropriate" material to complete his film. <br /> <br /> So In short, a waste of a good idea and a great cast.
