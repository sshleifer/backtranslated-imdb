*** GREAT SPOILERS! *** "Flesh Feast" of 1970 is a conclusion more than worthy of the career of the great Veronica Lake. This has a great reputation for being a horrible stinker, and rightly so, I must say. As a big fan of the Horror / Exploitation of low budget, especially of the 70s, I chose to see this, mainly due to the camp image that is seen in this site, but after seeing it I had to recognize that the image really has nothing that see with the movie The image here on this site is the cover of a DVD collection titled 'Flesh Feast' which contains four films, including Sergio Martino's "Mountain Of The Cannibal God" and Sergio Martino's "I Eat Your Skin". What the collection does not include, however, is this boring turkey. "Flesh Feast" is not only a camp and it's ridiculous, but rather tedious, which is even more pathetic in that the movie only lasts 70 minutes. Also, do not be fooled by the title, the movie is not bloody at all. However, it is observable, if only because of its instability and, especially, the extremely stupid ending, but therefore, something entertaining. The film follows a ridiculous plot about Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake), an ingenious scientist who can somehow rebuild young people with the help of worms that eat meat (do not ask how). A group of criminals (or terrorists, or whatever), paid by a radical political group, assigns the doctor the restoration of the youth of a "mysterious" commander. After an endless hour of meaningless nonsense, it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually Hitler himself. Before it was pretty obvious, but I still had to burst out laughing because the end of the movie was incredibly silly and, unintentionally, hilarious ... This is a very inadequate movie like the last movie of a great actress and former beauty queen like Veronika Lake. With the exception of Lake, the performances are ridiculously bad, even for a zero budget production like this. However, bad performances are something I can easily forgive in movies like this. What I can not forgive, however, is extreme boredom. The last five minutes make this visible to the staunchest fans of camp things, but I would still recommend avoiding it.
