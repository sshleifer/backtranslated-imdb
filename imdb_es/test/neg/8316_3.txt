Many good things could have been done with this movie using essentially the same sets, plot devices and story. For example, why not plant a seed of Erica's ability before the murder of her lover? Why not develop Erica's relationship and the police slowly and convincingly? Maybe contrast Eric's metamorphisms by including some other facet after the event, a relationship, etc., in his life that he now rejects? Why not hurt an innocent bystander to underline the injustice in Erica's actions? <br /> <br /> Instead, TBO exploits the fantasy of revenge at its highest level, giving sincere service to the "do not do this at home" messages received just to allow the movie to qualify as legitimate. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Jodie Foster. After exhibiting a certain range in films such as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, NELL and one in which she plays the ordinary mother of a child prodigy, Foster has slipped into a succession of roles in which he plays the same harassed and battered heroine overcoming the evil . This is fine once or twice, but I am getting too used to its close-up of "fight against flight". TBO could have used a younger actress or one who more convincingly accepted being a woman in her forties (instead of Foster playing a younger woman in her 40s). <br /> <br /> TBO is a film with important actors, funding and resources that manages to descend to scrap.
