Lame B-horror, which takes itself very seriously, since its subject refers to an old mistress who has become a creature of the night by a tenant who has come to rent him a room. When the tenant is murdered, Mama has to go out to feed herself and that causes a bit of family tension and also receives the attention of the authorities. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is that this movie should have brought it. THE CHISTOSO. He did not do it even though he had some gentle and gore creature makeup effects to keep the crowd of B movies happy. I've seen worse things, but I would not give this a rec - 4.5 / 10.
