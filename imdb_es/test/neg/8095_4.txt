I mostly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. She played well in this movie, but the plot stunk. The film was not really about anything, but about trying to remain alone after making a pact when one of Jerry O'Connell's friends gets married. The other friends put this money together and whoever is the last to get married receives the money ($ 10,000) from all their friends. Anyway, the film tries to keep going without doing anything since then and trying to make it more fun than doing it. I'm glad I paid only .50 for this movie. It really was not good at all. I rated it **** out of 10 stars!
