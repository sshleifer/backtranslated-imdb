This movie had a lot of potential, beautiful women, nice guys, a beach, a beer, a hot tub, a beach mansion, a pool, a sexy maid who hates her job and really nice cars. However, the film had one thing that condemned it to failure ... a full-length script and a group of attractive women who want to try acting because they think it would be a good idea. <br /> <br /> Let's put it this way ... <br /> <br /> If you're at a party and you have the option of watching this movie or a training video for children of the 70s, choose the training video to go to the bathroom.
