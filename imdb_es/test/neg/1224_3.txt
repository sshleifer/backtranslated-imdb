Lonesome Dove is my second favorite in the west, only The Searchers with John Wayne. I look at Lonesome Dove every 6 months and I never tire of doing it. I have read all the LD books, although I can not remember much of Comanche Moon. I also expected this mini series and decided to record it in our DVR so that we could move quickly through the commercials. Unfortunately, I made a mistake and did not record the first part, but I decided to see the other parts and try to pick up. <br /> <br /> There is no one who can compete with Robert Duvall or Tommy Lee Jones, and I expected to be disappointed and I was. <br /> <br /> Although there were so many things that did not sound as real, the most obvious for me was when Nellie died the day before and Gus was on the street. He left Clara writing a letter from Nebraska telling her how sorry she was that she knew of his death. How in the world could he have known to leave the next day in Nebraska? Also, it was supposed to be 7 years later after his departure and his children seemed to be between 6 and 7 years old, maybe a little younger, but it took more time before they actually moved to Lonesome Dove, and in Lonesome Dove had I been there about 10 years or more before leaving for Montana. When they stopped at Clara's in Nebraska, which probably took another 6 months on the trail, the girls seemed to be between 10 and 13 years old, since they played in the yard like little children. Mathematics simply does not fit. <br /> <br /> I agree that the man who played Gus had many of his manners and looked a bit like Gus as a young man. <br /> <br /> I'm also a little confused about one thing. The captive white girl they brought back, was she the one they captured when they attacked Austin? They said she had been captured 25 years ago, but if she was the one she captured in Austin, only 7 years later, it took place in the movie. Was it captured before? I remember seeing a captive girl after they raided the city and I do not know if this is the same. If anyone can explain it since I missed Part 1. If it had been 25 years, I would probably be over 40 when they found it, since it seemed to have grown on the ground. Also, because of the way they were wreaking havoc when they captured her, it is hard to believe that she had lived to continue marrying and have Indian children. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that there is nothing worse. that John Voight played Call in the sequel to Lonesome Dove or the incredible marriage of Lorena with Pea Eye in the sequel to McMurty by Lonesome Dove, which was never explained. Also, the way he killed Newt was that I heard even though they made the sequel to John Voight without his approval. <br /> <br /> If someone can clarify these discrepancies, I would appreciate it.
