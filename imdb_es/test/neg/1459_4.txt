It is difficult to decide what to say about this. It is not totally, one hundred percent bad. Although the film in a movie is indescribably bad, it is made for the countryside, but it is missing by a mile. However, I'm pretty sure this is intentional. Danny Aiello is perfectly adequate here, and more or less nails his pathetic character. Dyan Cannon was good in a small role. Clotilde Courau was impressive as the last girlfriend in her twenties. And Linda Carlson had a brave topless scene that she performed very well. <br /> <br /> So, it's not all bad, but I do not think it will achieve its objectives. All in all, it is probably worth transmitting.
