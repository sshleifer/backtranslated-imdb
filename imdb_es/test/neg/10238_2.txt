Sammi Cheng and Andy Lau meet once again in their third film, "YESTERDAY ONCE MORE", directed by HK activist Johnnie To ... fans of To's action films will be disappointed to discover that it was not used a single gun in the shoot. In addition, fans of previous Cheng & Lau films, NEEDING YOU & LOVE ON A DIET, will also be disappointed to discover that YESTERDAY is not so much fun or endearing ... <br /> <br /> Mr. And the Mrs. To (Lau and Cheng) are a divorced couple ... both are rich citizens of Hong Kong ... both incredibly naughty ... both are professional thieves: "two birds of the same feather" ... A couple of years before, they divorced because of the inability to find a middle ground to divide the booty ... Now they are remarrying ... with the son of a rich heiress: the son of a total mom (Carl Ng) through of ... The future mother-in-law (Jenny Woo) suspects Ms. To's past and believes that she is only going to marry her son for the family's jewels: the inestimable ruby ​​necklace of the heiress ... <br /> <br /> The necklace is stolen ... is it the materialistic eye of Mrs. To who gets the best out of it? ... or is it your ex-husband, the way Mr. To sabotages the marriage to steal the jewelry for himself? .. <br /> <br /> This is not a film about two people who fall in love or revive a love ... it's about two people who have always been in love but who have somehow been foolish to realize of it ... they let pride and greed overwhelm them ... <br /> <br /> In general: YESTERDAY is a part caper / heist movie and part of a tribute to the classic Hollywood glamor of its golden years, that is, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly TOCCH A THIEF ... Johnnie To is getting too high in Cheng / Lau's chemistry of his previous films ... hoping that the immense popularity and Cheng fan base / Lau is enough justification for this third film ... I think Sammi Cheng is one of the most pleasant / charming artists who work today. . & Lau is definitely the Tom Cruise of Asian cinema ... <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed his first two films and I think that the Cheng / Lau couple is comparable to those classic Hollywood couples of the 40s and 50s. .. but YESTERDAY is not up to the expectations ... the terrible writing, the ridiculous situations, the location of the products in abundance, and all the secondary plots and the secondary characters were not necessary ... now that I think about it ... this movie was not necessary ... unless you simply love celebrity watching ...
