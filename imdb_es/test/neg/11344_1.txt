I am a regular reader of the Temperance Brennan novels by Kathy Reichs. As such, I am extremely surprised that she has consulted in this program. <br /> <br /> It's HORRIBLE compared to books. The character of Temperance Brennan is, in the books, an alcoholic and divorced mother who recovers to the land of a college-age daughter. In 'Bones', she is an arrogant (rhyming with rich), who, in typical PC fashion, is not a mother. The emphasis on his assistance staff, complete with gruesome details of who has had many sexual exploits, contrasts completely with the books. <br /> <br /> In total deference to the movement of the PC, she portrays the enemies of the We as lovers of peace (!). Some of the information is not even correct, for example, having a character from Afghanistan as an active member of an Arab-American friendship group. Since when is an Arab an Arab? I am sure that if negative references were made to "disadvantaged minorities", or women, or GLBT, the producers / writers / program directors would have to issue an apology. However, in the typical style of the extreme left, all racial insults go to the minority group with the highest performance: the Asians, since David Boreanaz's agent Booth continually refers to Angela Montenegro as a "strabismus". <br /> <br /> Forget that thing, and forget about this show. After the episode of 'The Man in the SUV', I thought about trying a second episode to see if it would improve. It only got worse! I do not even care if the teenager in question was killed or committed suicide, and I will not see the show anymore.
