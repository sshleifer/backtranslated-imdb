The dramatic drama starring Pat O'Brien as a fallen reporter who appears in the house of his former boss to ask for money to finance the operation of his son, only to find him dead on the floor. As O'Brien knows the identity of the culprit, he offers to take the rap in exchange for the money he needs. A decent premise is wasted in a movie that claims to have surprises, twists and turns, although in reality it is not. The performances are poorly done in all areas, the film dresses itself as a hard American noir, but the mix of unreliable accents does not work, and the story is hardly exciting. And it contains possibly the least attractive screen kiss of all time.
