The Messengers is a bad, generic and boring movie of "horror". The movie has a big problem: it does not scare. The interpretations and the script are totally stupid. Use old tricks to scare and all supernatural events make you laugh. I would not call The Messengers like a bad movie ... I would call it an accidental comedy because it's so bad it makes you laugh. The only good thing about this movie is that it's short, so this shit will not stay with us for so long. There are many horror masterpieces that have a low budget (such as Subject Two, Lucky or May) that are sadly ignored, while this shit is a hit at the box office. Therefore, do not recommend this weak and pathetic horror movie called The Messengers.
