The most unhappy comedy call I've ever seen <br /> <br /> It's not a patch on the naturalism of the hilariously daring Twin Town <br /> <br /> Vegas I; as usual, but this script is so serious. predictable, so good English in the worst way (in recent years, English movies have been terrible for everyone) Ireland at least produced the commitments, Scotland with Braveheart and Trainspotting 2 stand out as great movies and Wales had Twin Town, Zulu , Last Days of Dolwyn, Torchwood, Doctor Who and Under Milk Wood, etc. <br /> <br /> The comedy is to paint by numbers, the actors are dead men walking because there is no characterization or originality and it is so little fun <br /> <br /> England is falling behind, no matter how many movies from the north produce. It is the old class system that destroys English films. Oxbridge graduates throw endless scripts of clich√©s about working-class people they've never lived with. It's pathetic. Monty Python was not funny, nor was Oxbridge. <br /> <br /> The guys like Jonny Vegas and Peter Kay, Rob Brydon, Billy Connolly or write their own dialogues and forget the archaic class system failed. the people of class and the real talent that comes through the system will appropriately take over the writing and the British and English film industries will re-emerge. What will be the next Prince Edward to write a Modern Modern Oliver?
