Maybe I was too young when I saw him. Maybe I have not grown up with the Grease and Elvis movies. <br /> <br /> I did not get it. I get the "black" comedy (Black Adder etc.). I have irony and parody. However, I do not understand this. <br /> <br /> I set out to find out the name of this movie (enlisting the help of the people on the usenet and the most excellent IMDb Message Boards) so that I can get my first 1-pointer. Horrible!
