Steven Seagal is back! Here with his third film released this year. Of course, as a one-time fan who has become increasingly disgusted, I can say that it's no wonder this is pretty boring. First, the film made headlines due to apparent problems in production due to Seagal. He would arrive late to the set, change the script, the team, etc. and it would generally cause problems for the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talent is his problem!). This also happens in his second collaboration, the next Mercenary, which promises to be as bad as this garbage. This also marks a major turning point in Seagal's career, as this film is the first of his own to really unearth archive footage. There was a bit in Ticker but this movie takes the cookie. Fragments of, The Order (A movie of Van Damme, the biggest rival of Seagals in DTV movies!) Were lent Without a code of conduct, undisputed, and also a complete action sequence of the little known actor starring Peter Weller, Top Of The World. Interestingly, the stolen car chase of Weller's epic, made almost 10 years ago and ironically probably cheaper than this crap, is by far the best action scene in the movie. I was surprised enough when Dolph Lundgren had a brief stay in the world of action videos, which fortunately has escaped. Seagal, however, is the current market leader in DTV action, with Van Damme and Snipes its main rivals. Seagal still manages to sell movies and for my life I do not know how. Surely the fans should be bored with this horror, longing for a return to the likes of Above The Law. The story here is totally boring. In fact, the movie has so many holes in the plot that you do not have to think. For example, at the end of a movie there is a girl who, apparently, Seagal knows in an orphanage who gives a necklace. Why I do not know, but we never see it in the rest of the movie, nor do we hear it mentioned. Seagal has a girlfriend in this film who at the beginning of the film is with a psychic and is harassed by visions, which at the end of the film are never explained and do not mean anything. The film is so ridiculously stuck by a series of meaningless papers that it becomes a headache. This is by far the dumbest Seagal movie! Seagal himself is as wooden as ever, however, to his credit, he is not nicknamed in this for what I can say. Seagal, however, feels the need to speak as if he were a gangsta rapper, which makes me long for the days when he would put on his Brooklyn / Italian-American accent in his early classic films. He also has a painfully inopportune double act with Treach, which I assume is a rapper. It's funny how the producers seem to think that the Seagal combo, plus the hip-hop star, seems to work, because their team with DMX in Exit Wounds was their most successful film since Under Siege. Clearly, if nobody has heard about the rapper, it will not work. However, this is an action movie and therefore the action itself must be judged. Unfortunately, the action that did not come from the catalog of copies of NU Image is strictly routine. There are some small fight scenes with some classic Seagal aikido, but when 90% is performed by your double, who really has a rigorous job in this movie, it does not really impress much. There are also some fights with standard firearms that actually only have a good violent and bloody squibbage in their favor. In general, this is a painfully boring experience and, once again, I am left with the same verdict: Seagal has lost it! I keep asking the question of the years: "why do people keep watching their movies?" That's fine as a question, but the sad bastard I am, still watching his movies with the illusion that he can do something good once more. The possibilities are slim, unlike the always growing waist of Seagal. * 1/2
