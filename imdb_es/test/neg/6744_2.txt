For me, it just did not seem like GI Joe at all. When I saw him as a child, I just did not care. In fact, the part that I liked most about this was the opening credits. They change so many facts and they also change the story. Cobra Commander is supposedly part of this stupid race of reptiles in Antarctica or somewhere that is frozen. Although I always thought he was a normal guy considering every time he saw his eyes in the series, they were surrounded by flesh of normal color and not by the blue that had his face. There is too much trash in this to try to make this a spectacular movie, but for me it simply ruins what I saw in the series in the first place.
