The most self-indulgent movie I've had the misfortune to <br /> <br /> rent. Invisible. Much of the movie is obviously improvised, and it's not right. It seems that Toback took the first shot of <br /> <br /> everything. The movie gets good for a couple of minutes when it appears <br /> <br /> Robert Downey Jr., and then it goes to hell again real <br /> <br /> quickly.
