"Revenge of the Zombies" is a very weak and barely passable zombie effort. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling in the Bayou, Larry Adams, (Robert Lowery) and Scott Warrington, (Mauritz Hugo) are informed that a friend has passed away. In a meeting with local Dr. Von Altermann, (John Carradine), he repeats the idea that they died mysteriously. While they stay there, they realize that the help consists of zombies, dead reanimated people who do the orders of their master. As the bodies accumulate, he reveals that he has been making the creatures to be used in various experiments and they all try to stop him before it is too late. <br /> <br /> The Good News: This here is very wrong. The opening is easily the best, as it has several good marks for it. From where it begins, with the spooky silhouettes that walk in the darkness to the revelations, this work does wonders both for its mystery and for its great images. The big one is a scene really where the creature emerges from a coffin in a long, slow and creepy shot. These here are made before the opening credits and it is a fun sight. The scenes in the middle where the creature wakes up inside the coffin is quite chilling and it looks really cool. The last big positive is the end very funny. With the kind of end that reminds of so many universal attempts, this one fits with that style. From the creepy resuscitation to the real action involved near the swamp, it is fun and really works with others to give you only positive things. <br /> <br /> The bad news: this here only has a couple of flaws. , but they are the main ones. The first is the biggest boredom of the film due to inactivity. Almost nothing happens here, mainly because of the tendency to do everything with talking instead of anything else. There are only intermittent scenes relegated to the zombies, but there is nothing here that dedicates action to the film. This simply does not have any action, and that's what hurts the movie. Rarely generates scenes that maintain interest, and sometimes this makes you feel much longer than it really is. The last flaw in the movie is its pathetic excuse for the zombies. Those who are accustomed to the most modern foods will have a hard time getting a little fear out of these creatures, and in reality they only serve several scenes. This here does not treat zombies as threats, which makes them even less terrifying. The short screen time, the non-threatening nature and the non-modern behavior of these zombies really destroy this. This is what really hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: With bad zombies and almost nothing worth seeing, this is a curious effort. Those who are accustomed to modern zombies will find little interest in this and will be like this, while only classic horror fans are encouraged to try it. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating-PG: Mild Violence
