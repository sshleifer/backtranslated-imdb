Tom Selleck plays an absent son of the "pop" senile Don Ameche and the bored mom Anne Jackson, who compensate for their indiscretions (it is assumed) and receive them after Ameche has burned down his mobile home; Meanwhile, Selleck's work is defeated by the F.B.I., his assets are frozen, his wife and children abandon him, and his hateful sister and his brats have come to stay. The comedy of the pictures painted in bright colors is as out of touch with reality as the old farce of Ameche. Maybe a serious first draft (with scenes like Ameche walking in traffic with two small children) joined a second or third stupider version (with Selleck being beaten, beaten, punctured and eventually losing a toe and a testicle) !). Either way, it's a painful experience, and Selleck's sudden dedication to his father makes little sense; he walks around and howls in pain, but retains his heart of porridge. This movie is porridge. * since ****
