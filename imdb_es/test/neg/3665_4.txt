8 days without a script, that's what the DVD tells you how the movie was made. It was filmed in a blurry video that is sometimes used with good results, but in reality they are partially nude women sitting in a room for most of the race time. He is very well acted and this helps a lot. But the killer only appears once in a long time and the girls / women sit down and regret that they do not try to escape or do something too interesting, so everything stops after about 20 minutes. It would have been a good short maybe even powerful. Even for eight days they do very little. Why? Because they did not have a script. How many movies have been made without scripts. Not many I wonder why it is like that? How many great films have been made from bad scripts. Not many Why is that? Working against this big problem, the management tries and does some interesting things but with what essentially is nothing. The topless girls filmed in a dark and colorless and dull video will remain for a while, but not for the short but too long. The actors again deserve a compliment, if only there was a script. <br /> <br /> In addition, the quality of the video, or the lack of it, is very low, they try to use it with advantage and, sometimes, some shots seem to be from Miami Vice, the recent movie that is. But that does not pretend to congratulate Miami Vice or this failed company.
