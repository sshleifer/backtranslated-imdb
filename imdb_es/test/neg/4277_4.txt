This version of Mansfield Park, while extremely accurate for the novel, lacked the compassion I felt for Fanny, which is crucial and fundamental to this Jane Austen story. This was due to the total lack of acting ability of the actress Sylvestra Le Touzel. It had no appeal and, at times, it seemed to be lost in space or out of its depth. The scene he has with his uncle where he decomposes into hysteria was hysterical. She overcame that crucial scene too much and I really felt sorry that Henry Crawford had taken care of her. <br /> <br /> The opposite pole is the portrait of Mary Crawford by Jackie Smith-Wood. What a wonderful actress, in a very difficult part to make that character is witty and egocentric, selfish but vulnerable to love. <br /> <br /> I've always loved Fanny. He has a kind attitude, but he has a relentless sense of what is right and believes that he is worthy of respect and admiration. The Fanny in this adaptation is too docile and servile, hardly thinking about it until almost the end of the series. As much as I wanted to like this Fanny ... I just could not. <br /> <br /> I suggest skipping this version of Mansfield Park for something real ... the novel. Fanny will not disappoint you ... you will love her!
