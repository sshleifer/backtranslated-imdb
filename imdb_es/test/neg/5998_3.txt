Jackie Chan's films are typical examples of how the offer is bigger than the demand. Well, to be honest, what do you demand? In this, Jackie Chan is what you call it, I doubt you even know, and is a kind of racing driver. Well, he drives 10 miles per hour and then the images are accelerated, that way I can also do all the stunts. During the grand finale, in which Jackie Chan wants to arrest the bad boy by hitting him. In a race, we can finally see how bad this production really is. Chan's fight, especially in the casino scene, is decent, but when we're talking about special effects, dear Lord. And everyone should participate in this race? stupid. And here it's really not safe for drivers, there's not even a concrete wall in the neighborhood. And I do not mean what kind of horrible story it has, I mean, it's Hongkong, it was probably written on the gun. point for children of eight years, but still, what a disaster. I like Chan as much as the next, maybe more since I saw "Rush Hour", but the delayed cousin of his agent really needs to choose his projects better.
