This film was poorly conceived, badly written and badly performed. All the characters were two-dimensional. It was a real amateur attempt. The film was fundamentalist of Christian propaganda. The Christian characters are holier than you and have no compassion for the skeptics or the undecided. The film was a real "gotcha" both for the skeptical character and for me as a spectator, which puts us in a very uncomfortable situation. I complained to the theater management and they gave me a free pass for another movie. I remember another movie about a similar theme, "The Rapture," starring Mimi Rogers, which was much better and professionally performed. I think I'll see "The Rapture" again. If you attend "Unidentified" and do not like it, do not say I did not warn you.
