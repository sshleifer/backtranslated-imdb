Take your video camera, turn off all the lights in your house and film the people who run with flashlights for an hour and a half and you will have the basic idea of ​​what this movie looks like. It is very irritating to see this kind of movies. To be fair, there are scenes of daylight at the beginning and end of the film. I like scary movies and the characteristics of creatures, but this did not do anything for me. So sorry. I really tried to like it. There did not seem to be a different plot to the one we have to find to get out of here. I did not learn too much about any of the characters, so it did not matter if we lost one or two along the way. This is not the worst movie in the world. "Open Water" has that title for now.
