I saw this in Mystery Science Theater 3000, and even that show could not make this film bearable. I could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures. Of course, you expect terrible special effects with such an old movie, but I have seen silences that were better. The story has huge gaps that leave you trying to figure out why you are even in certain scenes. The cameraman apparently does not know what a tripod is, and he took too much coffee, or something more difficult, because the camera is ALWAYS moving. I could not even follow the plot, but suffice it to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: A while ago I saw "Epic Movie" and I decided to give this movie a 2. It's NOT the worst movie I've ever seen!
