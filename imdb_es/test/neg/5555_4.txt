Some will remember having seen the movie Juno, a scene in which Ellen Page has a moment of praise for Suspiria, her favorite horror movie, by Dario Argento. The character of Jason Bateman asks if he has ever seen a Herschel Gordon Lewis movie and, to wit, he has a copy of a movie (I do not remember which one at the moment) and shows it to him. By the time I saw Juno, I had seen Suspiria and some Argento movies, but not Lewis. Now I can see that it is not just another of the references "in" Diablo Cody pop culture, but something that is actually an indicator of the tastes of the characters and, perhaps more subjectively, how to judge them according to their tastes. In other words, the reputation of Herschel Gordon Lewis is maintained many years after he finished doing his gore movies, and that of a Schlock-Meister, nothing more or less. Actually, less. <br /> <br /> It is interesting then to take Argento as a base of comparison, since both filmmakers are approaching, at least in the case of The Gore Girls and, well, any given Argento image, similar material. Where Argento is extraordinarily aware of his craft, involving an audience in whatever little story there is for the movement of the camera, music and style, Lewis takes the easy way to reach the audience, which is an immature script. and (putting it lightly) dull address. The Gore Gore Girls reveals a filmmaker who is not interested in entertaining his audience in a really convincing way like a horror movie, but as a secondary show or brothel. He can not direct worthy actors, he lights up like a porn movie, and for each of them, possibly smart or funny, there are ten that totally suck or are too smart in half or not smart enough. <Br /> <br /> That being said, perhaps as the best that can be said about The Gore Gore Girls, a mystery movie about a detective (a kind of Sherlock Holmes played by Frank Kress, something funny) and a reporter from a newspaper (dummie Amy Farrell) The investigation of a series of murders of go-go dancers is that it serves as a template for innumerable photos of Troma style. However, it may be a slight compliment, and really the best that can be said is that Henny Youngman: "Take my wife, please!", Has some scenes and steals them without having to try very hard. It's sad, since it could be the kind of image that could entertain at an incredibly bad level. But even in that sense, one can laugh more because of the shame of the production, some of the actors (that is, that guy who plays the police, my God) than for a pleasure of guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Even the Gore itself is something of a disappointment. At first, one thinks that Lewis, at least, is fulfilling this end, showing that these women have been murdered in a crazy, cruel and exaggerated way. But with the murders, everything continues more than necessary; I do not mean this in terms of shock value, that's why it's fine. But it is necessary that there is something more to really "stick", to show the faces of women and the eyes of the eyes is fine if you are 12 years old and see this as one of his first "horror" movies. He turns, dare I say it, bored. Dangerously boring for such a "daring" movie called. <br /> <br /> This was Lewis's last film until 30 years later, a seemingly worthy swan song came with a sequel to a movie he made before he took it out of his retirement movies and worked on writing books about how to do business. However, any experience you have had so far is not shown. It's not a failure, but it could have been, and it's just ... idiot. Take it or leave it.
