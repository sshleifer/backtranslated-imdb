I was encouraged to watch this movie because I heard a good word: it was supposed to be this exciting and criminal, disturbing, shocking milestone ... all that jazz. Well, I'm upset because I spent money on that, and I'm surprised that something so terrible that God is really released. That is all. <br /> <br /> This is an alleged "new look" to the family of addicts to the crazy losers of Charles Manson and his murders. But if this is a "new look", then it is probably "new" as in "fresh and totally inept": just looking at it gave me a headache and I had to stop trying to understand it or even understand what the director intended it to be. <br /> <br /> I guess I should say something about the plot, but the fact is that it was so stupid and incoherent that I almost do not remember if there was a plot. Was there something about a "Manson tape" given to a radio DJ (or a television producer?), Then an hour of meaningless random images of "the family" in '69, then the murders of Polanski (which they seem like a bad school work) and finally, an idiotic part about a group of skinheads who get drunk and hit each other in an alley (I do not joke), and then finished (thank God) (do not ask me to Make sense of that. I only remember what I saw!) The performances were also terrible. And how hard is it to make a convincing "Manson"? Get a scrawny scrawny skinny, put on a dirty wig and a hairy beard. There is your Manson. But this "Manson" does not even look good. He just looks like, uh, a guy with a cheap wig and stuck to Santa's beard painted in black. <br /> <br /> Or maybe that's what this movie is about: Manson's family did not make any sense, so this movie does not make any sense, either. It's symbolic! (Yes, to the right) I'm still so angry about spending money on this. I stopped lurking on this site and I only registered to vote 1 for this movie and post this warning that, hopefully, will prevent others from spending their money on this garbage. Get away from that, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> PS. The recent US television production "Helter Skelter" received bad reviews here, but I saw it last month (I also saw the original from 1976) and let me tell you, compared to "Manson Family", that the new Helter Skelter is BRIGHT and WITHOUT CALLS. And I was disappointed! That's how bad "Manson Family" is: it makes a flawed and mostly disappointing television movie look perfect.
