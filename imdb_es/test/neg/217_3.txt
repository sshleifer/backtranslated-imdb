I have to admit that I am disappointed after watching this movie. I had expected much more from the trailers. The movie was absolutely horrible. It lacked a real story and the acting was not exactly the best. Do not waste your time. The movie is not what the trailers lead you to think it is. I should say that normally I do not write anything about movies on IMDb (in fact, this is the first one), but this movie was so disappointing that I just registered to let people know that they should not waste their time or money. The plot of the story is that of a robbery that is going to happen and it seems that it had the potential to be good, but the things that happen in the movie are a bit far fetched to be credible. See another movie instead, maybe the inner man ???
