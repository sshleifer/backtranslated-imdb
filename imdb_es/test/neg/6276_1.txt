This movie looked like the shots of the scenes removed from an experiment in the high school film class. It did not make sense! It was a good performance, but I only felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear on this slope. The alien machines were created with Pentium I technology and without creativity, they were crabs! The little illuminated and barely seen aliens were Frisbees with legs. Where were the tripods? The edition, made by the director / writer / producer / makeup artist / pincer Latt, jumps everywhere, with some scenes repeated several times. Most of it seemed to have been filmed in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The next time Latt wants to make a movie, someone needs to slap him. Only in 2005 he produced 11 movies! That does not include credits for writing, editing, directing or visual effects in other films. If the rest is like this brat, then he is making fun of us. This was a scam from the Spielberg movie, nothing more. I can not wait to see "BackBroke Ridge", "X-Man IIV", "The Hillocks have Eyes" by Latt.
