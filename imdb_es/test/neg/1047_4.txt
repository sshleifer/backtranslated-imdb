I saw this episode with high hopes after seeing it on the "Favorite Episodes" list of so many people. I'm not bragging in any way, but from the beginning, I realized that they were in a kind of toy box, with huge eyes looking at them, even the kind of characters that are there. Although throughout the episode, the questions "Who are we?", "Where are we?", "What's outside?" take the suspense of the episode (which unfortunately I have already discovered), I must say that the different types of characters and the interaction between them made the episode interesting enough. Although the turn of the story may have been harder to guess if ALL were soldiers (toy).
