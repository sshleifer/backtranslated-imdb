First of all I want to say that I lean liberally on the political scale and found the offensive movie. I managed to see all the misfortune of a movie. This movie brings a bass to the original ideas. Yes, it was original, therefore, my 2 stars instead of 1. Are our film writers so unromantic that they can only come to this? Acting was horrible, and the characters were unpleasant for the most part. The protagonist of the story did not have good qualities at all. They turned her into a bad guy and I did not see him at all. Maybe I missed something, I do not know. He was the most relevant character in the movie. I did not disburse any money for this garbage. I almost wish that PETA would come to the rescue of this horrible and offensive film and form a protest. What disgust is all I have to say!
