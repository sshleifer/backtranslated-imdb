R.I.C.C.O. It's the stupidest movie ever made. I can not believe my father bought this shit. This movie should never have been made. If this movie was widely known, trust me, it will be number 1 for the worst of IMDB. The acting is horrible, it's scary, and that's why it's horror. This piece of shit had no horror at all. It's an urban action, which is fun, because I could swear it was a comedy. When people were shot, I could not help but laugh. I'm the only person who reviewed this and I hope it's the last one. With this vote I only hope that it reaches # 1 in the worst case!
