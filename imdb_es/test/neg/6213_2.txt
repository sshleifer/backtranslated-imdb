This movie was recommended to me, so we went to see it together. I would not call it a movie, it's more like a combination of 10 different stories, illogical, not finished, that are not so funny. There are several characters in the film who seemed important at first, and simply disappeared from the story. He is trying too hard to fit everything in 2 and a half hours. I left the program without wondering what happened to this and that boy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is just an extended version of "Hitch", with many more characters and dancing. <br /> <br /> If this is the best movie this couple has done, then I'm pretty sure I'm not interested in any of the above.
