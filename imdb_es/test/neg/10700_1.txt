This is a horrible movie by Norris, with one of the most annoying performances of all time in Calvin Levels and a weak script. The characters were terrible, and almost has no action, even Chuck Norris sucks at this! Christopher Neame is very weak as the main villain, and the story was not very interesting, besides that Norris seemed bored with the whole thing and I do not blame him as I do. The Calvin levels give one of the most annoying performances of a movie, I could not stand it because I had the temptation to start the tape of my VCR, besides Norris and Levels did not have chemistry together! If you are looking for some of the great martial arts movements of Norris, do not approach this, however, if you want a movie with an uninteresting story, almost no action and bad acting look beyond! This is a horrible Norris movie, with one of the most annoying performances of the Calvin levels, avoid it like the plague! The address is incredibly bad. Aaron Norris does an incredibly bad job here, without suspense or emotion working with a soft camera, and keeps the movie at a boring pace. There is a bit of blood and violence. We have 2 bloody impassions, heart ripped, explosive body and some bullet wounds. The acting is really bad. Chuck Norris is not INCREDIBLE since he is usually here and he seemed very bored here, his lineries are flat, and his performance was not so good and I am a big fan of Norris, this is his worst game! (Norris still rules!) Calvin Levels is INCREDIBLY annoying here, his spiteful acting severely annoyed me, I was hoping he would understand, but unfortunately he did not. Christopher Neame is quite weak as the main villain, his voice was great, but he acted in a big way! Sheree J. Wilson is beautiful and did well with what she had to do. The rest of the cast is terrible. In general, avoid this, it's not worth the torture, even if you're a big fan of Norris (like me). PUMP of 5
