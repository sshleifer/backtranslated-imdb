Having loved the novels and stories of Stephen King for many years, I, like most critics, have been constantly disappointed in the film adaptations of his printed works. Some notable exceptions are "Stand By Me" from "The Body", "Carrie" from the novel of the same name and "The Shawshank Redemption" from "Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption". This movie is, by far, the worst thing that has occurred with the name of Stephen King that is attributed to him in some way. No wonder Mr. King has rejected virtually any connection with him. I feel that what most offended me about this piece of badly acted garbage, filmed cheaply and horribly addressed is that they had the audacity to change the ending COMPLETELY. Do not waste time or money on this incredible movie bow! !
