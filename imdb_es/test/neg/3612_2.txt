A group of tourists is stranded on Snake Island after an unfortunate accident with their boat. They are forced to spend the night and, as you probably suspected, it is not called Snake Island because it is so funny to say, it has a history of people disappearing one by one due to the large population of snakes, which is what happens with these poor silent souls. This is a very boring and typical movie with tons of snake attacks off the screen and bad performances by the actors of NO ONE. The only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced scene that can not be seen in a PG13 rated movie, folks. If you like snake movies, check out SSSSSSS, but do not torture yourself with this shit.
