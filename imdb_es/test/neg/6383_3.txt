I know that Terry Gilliam is considered a good director, but to say that this movie is good is silly. What was the movie about? What is a parody? Fantasy? Comedy? Satire? There is no answer there from the script of Gilliam. Totally confused and meaningless at full speed from one historical era to another. I find it funny that some people call this film magically. Is it because they have to praise any film that is vague and indecisive about what it is about? 3 stars for special effects considering that it is 1981. Roger Ebert is right in his criticism. The film is ambiguous and resembles Gilliam's romp with money only to make a vague play of children disguised as a historical story. The film also tries to confuse the possible viewer by giving John Cleese and Sean Connery the best billing.
