This is so cliché that you'll want to turn it off after the first 45 minutes. The beginning is very interesting, with a fair in progress and someone is killed. This movie would have been better, established in this scenario. <br /> <br /> So, Jill Johnson is a depressed runner with boyfriend problems. I do not see the point of adding her breakup with her boyfriend to any of the events in the story. <br /> <br /> As Jill arrived home late, her father sends her to take care of the Mandrakis in their glamorous house on a desert lake. The children are asleep and the maid is cleaning, another empty house next door for her son who is in college. OKAY. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour of walking around the house alone, she has a couple of complexes. Ooh, the ones that are scary. To which her friend comes to the rescue, to propose a couple of lines from the high school about "love" and whatever. The friend leaves and goes to her car. To which then, she drops her keys. Uhhh ... then the music! DumDumDum ..! He fumbles to pick them up, and gets in his car. Which of course, does not start. How cliché would that be ...? Then ... Disappear = D Jill, alone again. UH (Most of this movie is with her alone, so there is not much dialogue) So, the more you hang up, call the police. Who says they can not help you, but call again if you have more problems. <br /> <br /> Then, she suspects that her boyfriend is calling or that her friends are calling. They have only been once. How is that supposed to be very scary? Oh, and did I mention? Your friend just arrived with the caller ID and you hear a creepy man's voice. She is scared and shy. <br /> <br /> Yes, so skip that. She sees that the light in the house of Mandrakis's son continues. So she runs through the woods with the music as her partner and enters. Bleheh <br /> <br /> NOW IS WHAT TO SING CONTINUOUSLY !!!!!!!!!
