The story of Macbeth was one of the most successful that Shakespeare wrote. This may be due to some characteristics that place him close to the slasher genre, murders, murders, murders, murders, gallons of blood, a tense sexual relationship between the main characters, etc. More than this, the original work is very attractive. considering the length (it's only half the size of Hamlet) and the focus on Macbeth to whom we are obliged to take care despite its bloody nature. The work seems ideal to base a film. Not so long that it gives the directors the possibility to explore its many levels, a good actor can play the role of his life, the film has a deep meaning in any historical period. Unfortunately this has not been the case with Macbeth. Polanski's version is quite close but insists too much on the medieval period. Welles' film is too personal, with an interesting twist towards totalitarianism, the television version of 1990 or something like that is too superficial. This 2006 film is no exception. It's a far cry from a Shakespearean film, but it's interesting to see how the director understood the story and where it places it in contemporary life. There are no knights in shiny armor, but gangsters in shiny cars. A lot of drugs and trippy music replace the fear of the night in the original work. Macbeth's idea is so simple that taking it and implanting it in modern life does not need Shakespeare at all. The worst part of the movie are the lines. Most of the moving scenes of the work, such as the dagger scene, are cut out so much that they seem useless. Replacing knocks on the door with bells and horses with cars seems funny. If they wanted to make a movie about power and its temptation, they could have done it easily without Shakespeare. This Macbeth seems to be a loser with a brain injury, not a brave, courageous and ambitious warrior who wants so much power that he is ready to kill and is caught in a web of fear and despair. The film does not make clear what drives Lady Macbeth to madness, gives no reason why some of the characters must fear Macbeth and his "terror" (since there is no hereditary ascension to the throne, which does not throne and everything) and places Macbeth in an awkward position, since the leadership of a gang is as far from royalty as this whole movie is far from any Shakespeare. In conclusion, we have two overlapping ideas that never manage to make this a film that, in the end, does not make sense ... Do not stop in the order of your march but on the march!
