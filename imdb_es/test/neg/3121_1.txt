It's hard to express how bad this movie is. Even in the 1950s, when the intellectual search for the meaning of life was in vogue and the Beatnik rejection of physical comforts, clean clothes, haircuts, etc. It was a common reaction to the presumed middle-class customs of the United States and Western Europe, this movie has been a stinker. The plot is a mixture of several dei dei machina (if that is the correct Latin grammar); the performance consists of looks without expression interrupted by occasional hysterics (both by the male protagonist and by the females); the free view of Catherine Deneuve's breasts (or someone's) are worthy of a Budweiser commercial; the repeated rehearsal of the cacaphonous orchestra in the abandoned building is that I am loaded with meaning in the mind of the director, but for me it is just a more stupid symbol that is included in this film without meaning: I am ranting because I have wasted my time watching this scam excuse for an art of flic. The landscape is beautiful and the sex scene is hot, but under his clothes, this king has no substance.
