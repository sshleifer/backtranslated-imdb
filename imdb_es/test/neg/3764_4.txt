Wow, this was a real stinker. This first science fiction movie has nothing to do with it than the pure camp. There is so much scientific mambo-jumbo in the dialogue that it's laughable. The female character played by Osa Massen is just a plot device for male characters to serve sexist comments throughout the film. Look at it with your girlfriend, I guarantee that it will make her blood boil. The only good thing is the musical score that expertly builds the moods of the film. The special effects are pretty crude, but they are not bad considering the time of the movie. With some good B stars in the lead roles, the acting is not that bad. But the lines given to them must have given them a great challenge. The challenge of not laughing your head.
