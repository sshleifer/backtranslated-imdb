Solitary housewife, disconnected, middle class in the midst of a divorce seeking consolation to reflect on their immediate future. In some type of accommodation and breakfast (well, literally in the sea) the ocean that for some strange reason subsists for the owner. Enter alone, the arrogant Richard Gere. He is a plastic surgeon. He is the only guest at the inn at sea. Diane Lane is the lonely housewife. You will never guess that these two fall in love immediately. A tropical storm makes them true lovers. <br /> <br /> The secondary plots of this melodrama have little or no sense. The places, the photography is fine. Gere is still one of the most outstanding actors in the cinema and does not disappoint. Mrs. Lane must have needed the money, but the phones on her part with grace.
