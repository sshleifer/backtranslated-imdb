The Cheesiest movie I've seen in my life is not scary, it's just bad. First movie made by WWE, and believe me, the only person this film could appeal to is wrestling fans. It has a terrible performance and the worst direction I've seen so far. I found myself laughing at the story and the bad actors. I saw that WWE people tried very hard to put many of the fighting movements in the deaths, and various camera effects. I think they copy much of Silent Hill. This movie is not attractive either, so if you see it, you'll find yourself disconnecting for lack of suspense. The end is the worst, no matter what happens, you will want to recover your money
