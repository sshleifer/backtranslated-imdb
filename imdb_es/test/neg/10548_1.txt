The Toxic Avenger ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this film is that a person that the common population would call this person more relaxed and after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, became a superhero that is completely disfigured sounded good even in 1985. This movie is cataloged as a horror ... I've even read about a cult that goes on with this series ... <br /> <br /> Now, this movie even happened when it was so bad that I could not stop seeing ... the performance is horrible even for an independent film that I think was the horror part of this movie ... <br /> <br /> drug trafficking, sumo, entry to Godzilla ... I am in favor of films that promote anti-drugs ... hell, I even like Godzilla and good sumo ... I do not like them, but I still think that sumo heights would love to give this film the blow of 1000 hands and the salt ground in the eyes of the people who made this movie ... <br /> <br /> Personally, I'm almost ready to write to the film company that did this and ask them for the 87 minutes or less of my life. <br /> <br /> For me, 1 out of 10 is too high, it is very bad that there is not a 0 (zero) or even negative whole numbers to place in a movie here. <br /> <br /> In other words, this movie is JUNK ... I would prefer to see how the paint dries up and deal with the explosive diarrhea and then watch this movie one more time ... I would be the first person who would use not only the package of this film as kindling, but would be prepared for a good recording of scripts and movies.
