I did not like watching DS9 compared to other Star Treks, even Enterprise, but I did not like Babylon 5, and now I know why. They are the same show. I just read the old news that Paramount stole the idea from the creator of Babylon 5, but chose not to sue for a reason that I do not know or care about, but see how a series of Star Trek is based on another even more nerdy program en As much as it is exposed, now I will condemn anyone who even mentions the DS9 when he talks about the series. Original, TNG and Voyager are my favorites in that order. Before I did not understand why everyone thinks DS9 is great and I do not, but I know I know it. It is also because the captain has a real problem of anger, and I hate people who act well, but are scared, out of nothing; and it seems that in each episode.
