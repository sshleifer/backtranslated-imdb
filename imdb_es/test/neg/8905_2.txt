Last night I saw on TV Guide and I saw a movie starring Heather Grahm, which I liked in movies like Boogie Nights and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It started well, but you could tell that the story was missing, and almost in half, it began to deteriorate. I do not remember that this movie was in theaters, and I am sure that if it was like that it did not last long. The performance was stagnant and unconvincing, the dialogue was foolish and predictable, and the story was confused and stupid. Definitely one of the worst movies I've seen in my life, and I like movies like those that have been compared to this as Fight Club, but this one is not close! Heather Grahm has done much better things since then. I gave it a 2 out of 10, but that's because I clicked on the wrong number, I wanted to give it a 1.
