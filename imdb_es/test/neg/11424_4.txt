I, like many, tonight challenged the frigid winter and long lines to see what I expected to be one of the best films of this year. However, I remained sadly wanting in many ways after the credits rolled. But to be fair, there were redeeming qualities (though very few). Let's start with what worked. First, the Lycans: point in every way? from his frightening physicality to his sheer ferocity. The action: sublimely visceral. when it happened Nighy / Victor and Sheen / Lucian: Perfect. Now, what he did not do (and there is a lot). This was less a movie and more a collage of sequences (and do not expect to see any supporting characters from the other films, except for Raze and Tannis). What was missing was a well-written story and some real substance to collect these pieces of film. The story seemed to start right in the middle? on the cusp where Lucian had decided to rebel. Therefore, there was no context; no tension; There is no sense of betrayal ?? The necessary devices to make everything else work. Also, it ended at the point where the climax should have started (which had to be after the fight calmed down a bit). Oh, and it was too short. Purists will also be offended by some of the freedoms that emerge from certain facts previously revealed in the first two films, but judge that for yourself. In the end, this film took too long in what should have been short "background" scenes (for example, several council scenes), and as a consequence we never got to know or care about the main actors ... or the movie ( ouch). -RE
