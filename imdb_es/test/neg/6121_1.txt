This movie was a waste of time. It looks good, nice settings, well acted, seem serious and seem to be leading somewhere, so stay tuned waiting for a significant reward. It does not happen <br /> <br /> I was surprised that you could put so much effort into a movie, which was clearly done very professionally, and has a result that looks nothing less than a b-movie. <br /> <br /> Save your valuable time and see a good French movie like Les Visiteurs (funny), Jean de Florette or Manon of the Spring. I can not remember the language in Europe Europe, but that's another great movie, heavy but worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to promise a lot but offers nothing.
