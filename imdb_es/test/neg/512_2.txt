I think vampire movies (usually) are evil. Even if the movie itself is not that good, I still like it because it has vampires in it. But this sucks. It really gives a bad name to vampire movies. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the cheap really shows. Usually, I do not care about low budget movies, one of my favorite movies of all time is El Mariachi, which only costs $ 7000, but I hate this. The actions are a load of garbage too, which resort to a camera with 'elegant' style that gives you a headache. <br /> <br /> There's not much more to say besides not seeing this. I bought it for Â£ 1.50, since it was an exalquiler and I feel cheated with my money, even for that low price.
