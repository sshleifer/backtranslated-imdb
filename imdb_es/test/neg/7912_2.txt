After having watched all the episodes of the Star Trek television series many times since the 1960s, most are pretty good and excellent, and very few are mediocre, my opinion is that this is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think it runs so badly as to be an embarrassment to the series. It is not that the story is so bad, although it is not particularly outstanding in any way, but the performance is abysmal on the part of the two main characters, that is, those who are not the usual in this case. Barbara Anderson gives her weaker performance as the daughter of a mass murderer, and who is on a kind of mission. She practically calls the role from a phone and does not show real emotional skills here. Although it has generally never been used as a pretty face in most of its film / television roles, usually in small parts, it has done much better. <br /> <br /> Arnold Moss since his father gives a new meaning to the term 'Ham' is the only actor in a Star Trek episode of the 1960s that surpassed William Shatner in this area, and in Reality makes Shatner look excellent in comparison. And he can not help but play a Shakespearean actor, which gives him more impetus to exaggerate, and he does. <br /> <br /> Besides that these two protagonists are so weak, the story is such that anyone with any sense can say who the killer is in the first 15 minutes. I say this because I told my brother the whole plot that ended in the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre-teenagers. His response was: Yes, you're right. <br /> <br /> Skip this and watch the Menagerie episodes that were originally televised just before.
