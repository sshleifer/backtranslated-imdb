Slaughter Trail is a B western with some great pretensions. But it has been seen in Hollywood history for the most ignominious reason. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing this movie with its musical score that can only be described as dominant, I have the feeling that Howard Hughes was trying to make a draft. Cowboy singing for RKO movies. They already had Tim Holt, who was a B-cowboy hero as trustworthy as ever, but he was not a singer. I guess Hughes saw the money that Herbert J. Yates was joining Roy Rogers in Republic and decided that he would get one too. <br /> <br /> So Terry Gilkyson, who was a very good performer and much better song The writer was recruited and sang part of his material, which was neither the best nor the worst, it seemed that they were in the box . But worse than that, there is an annoying chorus that sang a lot of the story and frankly overwhelmed the actors, the extras, even the horses. Needless to say, Terry never became a singer cowboy. But he did write classics like The Bare Necessities and the great success of Dean Martin, Memories are made of this. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns an inner woman in a diligence jewelry robbery. That's right, the outlaws that are Gig Young, Myron Healey and Ken Koutnik plant Virginia Gray on the merry-go-round as a passenger, and it is said that she carries some valuable jewels. <br /> <br /> It's a great act that Gray and Young achieve. Young takes her away from the coach for presumably a fate worse than death and act appropriately offstage within earshot of the passengers, but what he does is slip the loot. Last place where the authorities can search, if she does not escape with him. <br /> <br /> But when they run away from the theft it's on tired horses, so they stop at a cabin to grab some replacement mounts and shoot three Navajos. Whoever opposes That put the Navajos back on the warpath, did not help one of the victims was the brother of Chief Ric Roman. <br /> <br /> That's the situation that Captain Brian Donlevy in the fort has to deal with when the trainer and the outlaws get there to protect themselves. The way everything works is predictable, but in a striking way of overproduction. <br /> <br /> In fact that is the problem with Slaughter Trail. It is a simple B western without adornments that became something almost grotesque. <br /> <br /> But the real reason why Slaughter Trail came into the story is that this movie apparently marks the official start of the blacklist. Originally, Howard DaSilva would play the role of Donlevy and, in fact, could have completed his scenes, when Howard Hughes officially fired him for communist sympathies. His scenes were completely re-filmed with Brian Donlevy at the helm. <br /> <br /> Considering the fiasco in which this movie became, I'm not sure if Donlevy or DaSilva should have thanked Hughes or kicked him in his private preserve
