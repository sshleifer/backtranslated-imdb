Wow, well, do you know those things that they use in hospitals so that your heart beats again? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. It literally took me almost 4 hours in total because I had to take a break and restart my brain to semi-normal functionality from time to time. I mean, this movie is going so well that it's ridiculous, to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue and it would be generous. They just do not talk! And although talking is not everything, and I admit that there were some scenes in which only music was necessary, and that the music is great, that was probably the best part, but then listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie. Many people give these incredible reviews, and for the moment, I would say that special effects and filmography are pretty good, but in terms of the performance, or the lack of them, I just needed a little more, not shots or sex, etc. ., blasphemy is not even necessary, but a little more emotion, these guys were like stones, just sitting there with long faces. In general, if you need something to calm down, simply play the movie, do not even start at the beginning if you've seen it before, just start anywhere, lie back and relax, put it to sleep. .
