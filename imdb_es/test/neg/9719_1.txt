OK ... before beginning the more or less constructive criticism of the film, I would like to say some words that come from the heart ... THIS MOVIE SUCKS !!!! DO NOT GO TO SEEING IT UNLESS YOU REALLY LIKE SWEET BOY-BANDS AND WOODEN MEN, WITHOUT PARCELS. Then, let's see why I think the movie is so bad: 1. There is no argument. There is no plot. The director tried to create a mystery, the feeling was simply not there. 2. It all seems like a great promotion of an hour and a half for some kind of "BSB" gothic band that wants to be, but that still looks similar ... All the boys in the school have perfect abs, not young fat or ugly ... there is not a pretty girl in the movie, not a single one. The main character is wet in the pool, or all sweaty in his bed ... poor man. It must be horrible to go on a date sweating like that. 3. Can those guys do something good with their powers? Anything good? How to put out the fire in that old barn or help your friend who got involved in the accident instead of just running and breaking things and showing off in front of each other. 4. Wood acting. The main character only has two expressions on his face. Expression number one: sad. Expression number two: try to look seductive but still looks sad ... In that boy band there are 4 boys: the main character, his best friend who got involved in the accident, the blondy and the fourth ... which was the name of the room? I think he only spoke twice throughout the whole movie: once at the beginning (he said jumping from the cliff using "power" will not kill them) and the second time at the end when he and the blondy lost the girl. .. The movie could have been made without him and nobody would notice ... Anyway, my verdict: 1 is the perfect score for this movie. Guys - do not go see it. There is very little action, there is no suspense, there are no hot girls. Girls, at least the actors are beautiful ... What I would recommend to you to get a soundtrack for this movie is the only thing I liked.
