I understand that the budget was low in this movie, but in reality it is a really terrible movie. The script is just horrible and that was the free part. The effects are not bad, but this film is presented as a conventional film with R rating with fears and violent violence instead of a gore-fest without unbounded qualification that was intentionally made for video. Who were these guys cheating? This would have been released in theaters. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible. The edition, another free aspect of the film, is beyond the amateur, and the plot, as I said before, leaves little to be desired. There is nothing original in the movie. Gore fans, avoid this one. For filmmakers: try something original next time, or stop making movies all together. You are not good at that. People hate a trashy rehash, especially one of such low caliber. AVOID! It's not even worth making fun.
