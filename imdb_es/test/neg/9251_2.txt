This was shown on a premium channel, so I did not realize it was made for television. Even so, I like some of the movies of a lifetime (lifestyle here in the UK), but it was horrible. The family was so corny, "I love you mom" "I love you even more darling" Then, when they entered for the second time, 10 minutes later, they did it again, "I love you mom" big cheesy smiles, etc. She calls her husband and tells him not to bother going home. They were only meddled by a guy who wanted them dead, they have a madman living next door, who needs help? She has her teenage daughter and a cat (not for long) to take care of her. <br /> <br /> However, as a comedy, I would give it a good 7. I could even show it to my friends and then I have them round. It could be a lot of fun after a bottle of Vodka or 10!
