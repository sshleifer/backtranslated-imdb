Welcome to the world of Vikram Bhatt, the man who once had success and received several successes with small actors like KASOOR, RAAZ and also the multi-player AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA and his only film with Aamir GHULAM <br /> <br /> One sneak peak about these movies is that they are all remakes of Hollywood and some decent ones like the one that once worked <br /> <br /> SPEED is a new version of CELLULAR and that is also terrible <br /> <br /> A look to the stars, we have once salable but now without work Urmila and Sanjay Suri, then we have the flop Aftab, Ashish Chaudhary, Zayed Khan and others <br /> <br /> The film could be a decent thriller but many problems are there The narrative has several cringeworthy scenes like Zayed kidnapping a mobile company and many more, and the stunts are also ridiculous, while the turns at the end are too ridiculous. The movie also took a long time to get to the theaters, which of his spark <br /> <br /> The direction is horrible The music is obsolete <br /> <br /> Zayed Khan screams, grimaces. For what he does, always Urmila is good in his part, Sanjay Suri is not so convincing that Ashish Chaudhary strives in a negative role and he is fine. Aftab is horrible and makes you laugh in a negative role. Surprisingly, the same director gave him his only solo KASOOR, Sophie, it's horrible. Tanushree is not an actress.
