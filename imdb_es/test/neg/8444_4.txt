Obviously, this is not the "Piranha" directed by Joe Dante and produced by Roger Corman. It was not so obvious, when I bought the DVD for only $ 2.95, since the cover of the DVD matched that of the comedy / horror "Piranha" produced by Corman, even the DVD menu (without features, of course), coincided with The cover. Halfway through watching this strange movie, my girlfriend and I began to think, where are the PIRANHAS? Once the movie reached the climax, we realized that we should have been watching the wrong movie, since we had seen the trailer, that it had completely different images, the propaganda on the back of the DVD does not match the story we were watching and the credits (Actors, producer, director) were also completely different. Instead, we got a melodrama from the jungle about a girl and two guys who go in search of diamonds and end up facing an animal hunter. This game of suspense, exploitation, is boring and useless, and it's just a little fun for the value of old-school camp. It's strange that a DVD can be made with the wrong film intact, but I guess it's an easy mistake to show that both are B-grade movies of the same name made in the 70s. When reading other publications made in this film, I noticed that I'm not the only one with the wrong movie on the DVD. How could this be an international error? Is there perhaps, some kind of DVD phenomenon where unsuccessful films try to gain recognition by being placed on the wrong DVDs? WHAT'S GOING ON???
