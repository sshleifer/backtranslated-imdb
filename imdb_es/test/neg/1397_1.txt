I thought that "the puppets that make phone calls" were quite low, but I do not think Carlos Mencia's program qualifies as comedy. Its main objective is to make the public feel incredibly uncomfortable using the word "beaner" as many times as possible. I have never felt obliged to write a review that declares how horrible is what is in IMDb before, but I really hope that this program is never renewed or re-run. <br /> <br /> Mencia is trying to be the next Dave Chapelle, and maybe he was only hired by the network because they expected him to fill those shoes. It is obvious until the tear of the introduction of Chapelle (blues guys vs. mariachi band). However, Mencia has an absolutely * no * attitude, and does not delve into the popular views of Hispanic culture enough to offer her a creative touch every time. Instead, he sticks to a small number of nicknames that barely surprise his Latino peers and "jokes" about immigration. From time to time, he will take advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else, like the cultures of the Middle East. These jokes consist mainly in reiterating every joke or stereotype made against the culture, and perhaps some incredibly old themes (like 9/11), in a relaxed, standing style, while he laughs at himself to cover up the style of the public. . I think he's too afraid to really offend someone, so that makes the viewer feel uncomfortable. He also wins jokes to death. If you've ever seen "Why the fuck is this news?" You will know what I am talking about. It's funny at first, but he only walks again and again and becomes Captain Obvious at some point. <br /> <br /> It's a train that is purely painful to watch.
