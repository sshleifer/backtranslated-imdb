In farcical terms, Gaud√≠'s afternoons can be taken as a mediocre exercise. Marcia Gay Harden and Judy Davis swung a good cast (the weird character of Juliette Lewis has been incredibly taken from reality, I know a young American woman who screams like her!) But GA does not show much more than her exaggerated plot. <br /> <br /> Although the creation of films is about making people believe, there were some notable inconsistencies in the script. Two samples: you pay 14 euros to enter the chapel where Cassandra and Frankie met, NEVER at 7 am, and you can not leave the terrace without paying the bill (they will charge you in the place if they do not know you) or get out of a ESO taxi quickly (Americans always tip taxi drivers if they do not expect it, but the sequences described in the film were ridiculous). Do not believe me, reader: come and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> If you've never been here before, you may not care about all this, but good movies should be credible regardless of your background. Nobody knows about GA here, and I'll make sure that does not change in the future.
