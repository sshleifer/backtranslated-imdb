Last night, I attended a screening of Badland with my cousin. We were a little excited to know once we got there that the director / writer, the producer (his wife) and several cast members also attended and that there would be a discussion and questions and answers after the movie. But once the movie was over and the credits started rolling (and the movie really was not edited well enough and is too long), my cousin and I, without consulting each other, got up and left immediately. Once we started talking outside, we realized that we were both so angry that not only did we not want to stay for the discussion, but we could not even look at the cast and crew that were near the exit and who we were walking. Right when we left. <br /> <br /> I realized that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which Jerry cuts the palm of his daughter Celina with a large knife so that her blood can be used to get out. A false trail It was inevitable to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on his body with the emotional pain he inflicted on his spirit by killing his mother and two brothers in his presence, avoiding her and taking her with him when he fled. I have cut my palm before (accidentally); Even a very superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is very sensitive, and its recovery is very slow if you do not keep it immobile because you keep opening it trying to continue with your life. But after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around the palm of her hand and a scene with a large bandage, it was as if she had never been cut. My anger reached its peak, I will not ruin this moment for you, in the final scene of Celina. <br /> <br /> I got angry because Celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the movie (the actress portrays she is good); I was and can not tell me that a good scriptwriter would not know, immersed in feeling both his physical and emotional pain; and the screenwriter, in dealing with Celina's emotional pain with such courage and disrespect, also treated the audience member with caution and with absolute disrespect. <br /> <br /> Sure, the script has moments of tears for Celina, and a dialogue that tells us she's suffering, somewhere, in some way. But for this moment, we, the public, feel so manipulated that we have closed. The manipulation begins very early in this film, when Jerry's family dialogue explains to the audience that Jerry had psychiatric problems. Rule one, scriptwriters: give your audience a little credit. Let them do some creative work on their own. Tell the story; Do not tell us everything we are supposed to think and feel. We do not like it. <br /> <br /> My cousin also knew that she was having problems with the film from the beginning, in terms of dialogue, when Jerry and his wife had little to say to each other, besides fucking this, fuck, fuck, you. Some couples actually find themselves in such bad relationships that the f-bomb ends with every word that comes out of their mouth. But it's like watching comedians who curse a lot. Some of them are really fun; the curse is auxiliary. But some of them replace the curse with humor, and this screenwriter, to bring the metaphor to its conclusion, is not Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> This husband and wife team courageously chose to tackle a very complex story with a tremendously complex complexity. characters. But it seems that they have not realized that the meaning of a story, especially a complex one, will vary for each member of the audience. Successful storytelling requires paying attention to the important details of the facts, not desperately working to interpret the meaning of the story for the entire audience. <br /> <br /> I worked with Vietnam veterans for five years, I've heard more stories than most, and I'm always happy to see new movies that bring their stories to a wider audience. It is important, in all kinds of different levels, that we listen to them. But I'm not so happy that this narrator decided before the movie started what Jerry's story meant and proceeded to explain it to us with a very heavy hand. Next time, pay more attention to the details.
