I could see this without commercial interruptions, and let me tell you, even for a television movie, it was quite predictable. The actors did a job working with what they had, and the cast was quite successful: Barry Bostwick, Jane Seymour, Frances Fisher, etc. I try and it sounded as if it had been taken out of a third-rate romantic novel. The psychotic monologues of Jane Seymour were ridiculous. I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that someone so scary would not arouse suspicion at all. As bad as Theresa Russell was in "Black Widow" (and she reeked of it), at least she had the good sense to play her pseudo-characters in a somewhat straight way. Seymour is a much better actress, but she did not beat the material here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the musical score is incredibly cheesy. It's almost a satire of its kind, like a fusion of Kenny G. A film with such a mediocre and derivative script should really have opted for something more daring.
