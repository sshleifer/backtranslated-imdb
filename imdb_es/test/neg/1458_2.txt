A bad movie ABOUT a bad movie. Is that original, or what? If so, then that is the only good thing about this. The lovely Ally Sheedy could not stop this bomb from destroying movie theaters and VCRs everywhere. It should also be taken into account that she and the other actors hired by the character of Danny Aiello were considered themselves, as well as the characters they played in their classification film D. Calling it a B rated movie, it is a great compliment and would lead to delusions of grandeur.
