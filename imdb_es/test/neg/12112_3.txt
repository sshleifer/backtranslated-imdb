This movie is bad. I saw the classified and unclassified versions. They are terrible! Now, I know it's supposed to be a low-budget spoof from Spiderman, but Spiderbabe is not good at being good or bad. It's not funny! Not funny at all!! I wanted to laugh I tried to laugh. But this movie disappointed me. At least the unrated version has a lot of nudity to wait for. And it's me, because Mundae is not a woman of great appearance. From the waist down, she's fine, but on the way she leaves a lot to be desired. She looks good in that school girl outfit. Please, if you have to see this spider, rent it first. Classified or not, it really does not make any difference, both are bad for me.
