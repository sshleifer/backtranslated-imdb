First, I must point out that the role played by Wendell Corey was exceptional. Generally, Corey was relegated to support roles, but here is what helps to bring this film so weak. Without him and the character he played, the movie would have been much worse, it would not deserve a 2 or a 3. So, why do I hate the rest of the movie so much? Well, one of my hobbies is when the characters act "too stupid to live". You can not base the main points of the plot assuming that your main characters are completely stupid (unless having a brain injury is part of the plot, of course). But this is exactly what happens in this movie. Wendell Corey is a crazed man who has murdered three innocent people and knows that his next target is Joseph Cotten's wife. So, what do they do? Yes, they provide really inadequate police protection and a plan that makes no sense (no shooter and guys with shotguns that are so far away will probably not stop this madman). And if this is not bad enough, the marked woman inexplicably flees from her hiding place and walks directly to the WORST possible place she could be. Is anyone SO stupid?!?! Arrrggghhhh --- I hate when movies have such silly characters. In fact, I found myself encouraging Corey because I felt that idiots deserved to die for their behavior. In addition to these clich√©d characters, there was also a small player who fainted. Sure, seeing your husband shoot could cause someone to faint, however, in real life this is a rare thing, people rarely faint unless there is a medical reason. Therefore, combining this with previous character problems is a real nightmare for people seeking realism, something that Film Noir films MUST have. <br /> <br /> All of these serious problems are even more irritating, since the character of Wendell Corey is surprisingly well written and conceived. It was his chance to shine as an actor: too bad that the rest of the movie was so weak that Corey and the basic plot sank. This is a movie that could really use a remake, but this time without characters without brains.
