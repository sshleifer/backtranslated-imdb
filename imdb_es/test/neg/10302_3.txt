This movie starts with the wrong foot and never really works. The first scene shows the landing of a Life Flight helicopter and, just outside the window, you can clearly see mountains in the background. For those of you who may have never been to Houston, there is no elevation change. The city is located just above sea level and a 5-foot incline is considered a large hill. To be in agreement with that scenario, any take outside the hospital immediately tells the viewer that he is not in Houston. All the trees are missing leaves or pine trees, none of which Houston has much. Even the hospital itself, on the outside, is very incredible. Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the best hospitals in the United States and is located right in the center of the Medical District, just miles from downtown Houston, however, each hospital's external outlet makes it look like the hospital is in the suburbs or even The field. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that whoever was in charge of the real part of the tropical storm of the film disappeared because the numerous radar shots are all wrong. The first radar image in the film is that of Hurricane Hugo hitting South Carolina. Later, we see Kris Kristofferson quit her job and one of her assistants tells her that Alison is moving back south through Houston, but the radar image she shows shows Alison clearly moving north from the Gulf of California. Mexico to Houston ... probably the initial landing of Alison. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it's not so bad. JoBeth Williams, Kris Kristofferson and Rick Schroder do a decent job considering that it is a television movie. The plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a real story makes it a little more entertaining. My only problem with the performance is the representation of the inhabitants of Houston with great southern accents ... all the actors sound as if they were from Birmingham, Alabama and not from Houston, Texas. <br /> <br /> The movie has its point. and for the general public, it does exactly what it is meant to: entertain. If you are looking for an objective explanation of what happened to the city of Houston in June 2001, you will be disappointed. One thing that should be kept in mind before watching this movie is that it is based solely on the evacuation of the Memorial Hermann Hospital and not on the Alison Tropical Storm and the impact on the Houston subway itself. If you are looking for an objective explanation of the impact of Tropical Storm Alison on the Houston Underground, I would suggest you look at The Weather Channel Storm Stories for Tropical Storm Alison. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of *****
