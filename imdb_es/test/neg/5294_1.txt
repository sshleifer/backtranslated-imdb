I went to the cinema a little apprehensive, I left furious for the trash (going through a movie) that I had witnessed. The actors, particularly Travolta, should be ashamed of themselves for their participation in this. Clearly, the only thing in their minds was the paycheck, regardless of the degradation of their talents and of us. Travolta needs to do some more "Mira quien hablar" movies again, since he has returned to the level of his previous work with Tarantino. This is something when the sequels of L W Talking are better than this one. Travolta is no longer the King of Cool, but the King of Corn. The same Michael Caine admitted to having made bad movies for the paycheck, Trvolta should follow his example if he respects himself!
