... or should I say unintentionally hilarious? Either way, this is one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. I was laughing at the antics of some of the dumbest fictional characters on this side of Homer Simpson. It's just one scene after another, painfully stupid and painful, while the clumsy and foolish cardboard cutouts that replace the real humanoid characters push, pull and drag the "plot" to its inevitable and obvious conclusion. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe this movie to someone, I would call it a mutated hybrid of Fatal Attraction, Dumb and Dumber and Three Stooges, with a "climax" incredibly similar to the episode of Family Guy in which all the Family gets into a fight in the living room. <br /> <br /> Advice for the Benson family: the next time you have a new pet, give the poor animal a favor and DO NOT call it Fred!
