What can you say about a grainy 16mm granular film, badly filmed, where the best and most attractive performer is a German shepherd? Nothing that would be positive. Avoid this farce at all costs. In any case, it would be hard to find, since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal issue in the United States. I recommend that IMDb revise its weighting formula to establish ratings, since a grade of 8.8 for this piece of fecal matter is absurd! I am not, in any way, a rude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70s and 80s; but this is an inferior product even by the loosest standards of the deer's loop (then illegal).
