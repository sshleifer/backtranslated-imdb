My opinion: Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to be a protagonist in an action thriller, even one totally boring. <br /> <br /> Remember Steven Seagal? You are not? Do not worry, there is not much to update. After starring in films that are pleasing to the public, such as UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, Seagal is at the bottom of the abyss of the bad movie. Now, it stars in low-level B action vehicles, some of which are "Movie of the Week" entries made for television that were lost on the big screen. HALF PAST DEAD is among these, shall we say, dead-action movies. A noisy and terrible action film, carelessly directed and lazily written (and, what is worse, badly acted). This is one of those bad movies that I do not need to see until the end to know what is bad. I did not have the guts to die with all my muscles while I wasted time with this. In this kind of bad movies you notice, those other movies you hate are not bad after all. <br /> <br /> The plot (and the stage) is completely separate from a similar image, THE ROCK by Michael Bay. , although similar may not be the word to describe it. Both films are summer films, and should not be taken so seriously. But by comparison, even THE ROCK (which is not so much in the writing department as the lights and sounds) has better characters, a more convincing plot, better sequences of action and, in general, a more entertaining atmosphere. Although there are action scenes in MIDDLE PAST, none of them is exciting. All of which is sometimes tedious and predictable. <br /> <br /> Although predictability seems to be a welcome asset in summer action movies, predictability has never been more acidic in those that are not fun, and HALF PAST DEAD is never really fun, it is often just a pain in the head (listening to the bad rap music repeated over and over throughout this movie makes me want an aspirin every second I hear it). The acting is horribly mediocre, the plot is derived, without convincing or attractive characters at all. The character of Seagal, an undercover agent sent to Alcatraz to arrest a criminal mastermind (Morris Chestnut), a very bored villain, is nothing to get excited about. The character of Seagal also has a partner (played by rap star Ja Rule) and a group of fellow prisoners, and there is no chemistry here. <br /> <br /> If you star in a series of other forgotten action vehicles (What were those movies again?) killed from the Seagal race forever, HALF PAST DEAD is an exaggeration. And the public is warned: you are invited to feel the pain. Advice: avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 5.
