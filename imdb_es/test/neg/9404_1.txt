Pacino and Maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker. I swear, I'm an avid fan and movie fan. I have been a fan of most people in this abortion at one time or another. Until now. The history of the shit The acting of the shit (Rene Russian-Major League was good) The plot of the shit The secondary plot The trash The attempts of the teenagers to relate to the sports betting of scrap <br /> <br /> I have promised to see Romy and The Michelle's High School meeting 2 times a day for the next seven days as punishment for not turning off this film colostomy bag after 10 minutes. I was out of town for a seminar, and this mung pile cost me $ 9.99 and 2 hours. They have cheated me. This director must be in jail for fraud. <br /> <br /> Come with me if you have other review questions. I'm always right.
