*** SLIGHT SPOILERS *** This installment of the Full Moon franchise changes the plot a bit and implements some new elements. First a new master puppet is established. Second, the puppets become good in this sequel. Finally, it also introduces some elements of science fiction / fantasy. <br /> <br /> A new tenant of the infamous bay hotel, his girlfriend, his psychic friend and that psychic boyfriend, run into Andre Toulon's trunk. They also learn about some demon from another dimension that blames Toulon for stealing the secret to encourage those who do not live. So Sutekh (the demon) sends the totems, a group of small creatures that look like gremlines without ears. Then, it depends on the puppet company to take care of the interdimensional threat that is trying to kill new friends. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget films, this movie is full of continuity problems. How were the puppets put back in the trunk? How is it that nobody remembers the last scam of murders in the hotel? Who bought the hotel? Why a contractor in a building with a history of mass murders? All this and many more questions will not be answered ... ever. <br /> <br /> The real surprise of this movie is the performance. Actually it's pretty good. The actors take it with unusual enthusiasm especially for a group of non-full Moon names. Teresa Hill was especially impressive as the shy, nervous, psychic Lauren. Chandra West (Susie) was also a pleasant surprise too. Gordon Hill was a tolerable protagonist. But Cameron was too annoying for the stomach. Thanks to the Norse god who died before the middle of the road. <br /> <br /> The puppets are there normally animated. With some improvements too. There the emotions (especially those of Jester) are much more human due to the sounds that have been given to them. Blade whistles, Pinhead grunts and Six-Shooter giggles have all been improved and sound much better. The stop-motion animation is only average in the best case, especially the totems. They just do not seem to move as smoothly as the previous installment of the series. Also the Sutekh costume is absolutely terrible. How are we supposed to fear a creature with such a humorous appearance? <br /> <br /> The story seems a little juvinile for the series. I think Charlie Band was looking to focus on a younger demographic. The attenuated violence in this movie also seems to speak the same. Gore fans will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the above problem is the main problem that this movie can not keep with many people. It does not have violence for gorewhores. The language is a bit cleaner. However, it is too violent and hard for the little ones. That's why the movie gets low grades. I have to say that the common reviews are mostly fair.
