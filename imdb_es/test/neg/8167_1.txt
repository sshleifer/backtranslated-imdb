It is difficult to make a bad movie with the theme of sport "which finally has little success", but this film has an admirable success. My mind is amazed at how useless and boring this movie is. <br /> <br /> I guess the director could not decide if it was the runner or the coach. It ends up being neither. In short, who cares? None of the characters has a pleasant personality. There's nothing in the movie to worry about anyone. Even the "bad guy" is not really bad. (I think he's in two scenes, and apparently he's in some kind of barbiturate.) I think he asks him, once and courteously, to leave the coach and train with him. Then, later, a little "sorta" asks him to move in with him. That's. Conflict! Tension! What will she do? !! <br /> <br /> -And what about the representation of running? Has the director ever seen a real marathon? Christine's form is so incorrect that it's absurd, as is the supposed "champion" with whom she competes (a character with no lines.) -You may have hired, you know, a real RUNNER?) <br /> <br / > -And the speed at which it runs runs beyond comprehension. Were they running or accelerating the march? Actually, it's laughable. I can literally walk back faster than they were running in the big race. Maybe it was too difficult to move the cameras at a real speed? <br /> <br /> Another nonsense: (Spoiler, I suppose) At one point in the great race, the two women who lead fall inexplicably, at the same time. hour. What they fell into is a mystery. Maybe both of them ran out and fell? -And then they get up, but they do not run again for 30 seconds. Oh yes, very realistic. This ridiculous event does not even add any tension, since the other runners are not close, and also at this point you have been numbed in a state of catatonia. <br /> <br /> - I especially enjoyed how the four of His male classmates, highly trained athletes, give up the big race because of Charlie's horses, or pulled tendons, or something so improbable. <br /> <br /> But who cares? This movie has almost no tension, no resolution, nothing. An old and bored trainer with a past failure that barely hints, discovers a runner woman without any personality. They train a lot. She is not happy. They train a little more. She wins the great race. Woopie <br /> <br /> My description is actually more interesting than the real movie. I just saved you 90 minutes. Avoid this as the plague.
