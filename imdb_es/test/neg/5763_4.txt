"Curse of the Forty-Niner" does not really deserve a long and detailed review, so I'll make some random observations: <br /> <br /> - Great opening credits. <br /> <br /> - There is no argument. <br /> <br /> - Is there anyone who has seen a horror movie before and can not guess, within the first 20 minutes, who will survive and who will not participate in this group of walking stereotypes? ? <br /> <br /> - Hey, the new arrival (Alexandra Ford) is very good! <br /> <br /> - Richard Lynch (about 100 years old, makeup) and John Phillip Law have fun, ironic cameos. <br /> <br /> - Karen Black has a more important role, but it's not fun, it's pretty embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - Martin Kove is on screen for about 40 seconds, but he still has his name on the cover of the video. Was he paid for this appearance or was it the other way around? <br /> <br /> - I hate the cheap effects generated by computer in horror movies. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4.
