Recently I went to theaters to see the new version (2007) of Bridge to Teribithia. Then, I went to the library to rent the previous version to see it again without paying again. I must say that I was very disappointed! I discovered that the previous version had a horrible performance, as well as cheesy lines that included Jessie saying: "I know, dad, but it hurts a lot inside" after Leslie dies. It was pretty horrible and the casting was not much better in my opinion. I watched with amazement all the time saying that it was not surprising that they would redo it. The story is great, but trust me to spend the money and see the new version. If you only see the old one, you may never experience the true magic of Teribithia.
