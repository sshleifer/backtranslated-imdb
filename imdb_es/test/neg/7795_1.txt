"Marathon" has a very interesting premise, excellent environmental sounds and good scenery. Unfortunately, the film, apart from these aspects, falls flat on its face. For a woman who tries to complete so many crossword puzzles in a day, she spends a lot of time standing up, sulking and not doing puzzles. I think that in the film it shows more to walk than his work in these puzzles. Also, while I understand the point of showing so much landscape, there is simply MUCH too. The movie is incredibly boring and unfocused. It is not worth buying, renting, watching on television or watching in any way imaginable. I lost interest so quickly that I'm not sure why I sat in the whole movie in the first place.
