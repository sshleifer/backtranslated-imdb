Bad dialogue, slow history, scenes that are prolonged and absolutely useless. I can not believe that so much money has been invested in such a poorly written film. The direction and the performance could not save this bomb either. <br /> <br /> 50% through the movie and you're still waiting for it to start. Feel the foundations with the opening preface and then spend the next 40 minutes setting up NOTHING. You see 40 minutes of images that have no direction in an attempt to do something, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie is like watching a really bad French movie in which nothing ever happens and the characters are just a kind of boring, lifeless and self-centered life without purpose or care. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. Anyone who recommends it is preparing it for disappointment and, without a doubt, will question its flavor and depth.
