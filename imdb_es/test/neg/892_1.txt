I saw House Party 1-3 and I loved it, but this was not fun at all. First, it can not be a House Party movie without Kid n'Play, right? This stinks and looked more like a black version of Ferris Bueller's day off than a House Party movie. Secondly who the hell is John-John? These new characters can not even be compared with those of the other three movies. know why they put it directly on video. It has horrible music, weak plot, actors without talent and no funny joke. My advice is to watch this movie at night only if you can not sleep. series after House Party 3 since Kid'n'Play split up after that. I hate this, I'm glad my local video store does not have this movie and I never want to buy it or want to watch it on Comedy Central. Just because Chris Strokes has talent in the management of a new R & B group does not mean he has the talent to direct and produce films. Am I right or not? Finally, the female characters dressed up as cheap two-dollar prostitutes throughout most of the movie. The IMX parted a year after this film was released, probably due to the failure of this film and they are almost forgotten today. In simpler terms, this simply old movie sucks !!!!
