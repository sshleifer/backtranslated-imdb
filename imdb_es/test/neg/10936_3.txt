I entered this film with few expectations, knowing the legacy of Uwe Boll as a film director and screenwriter, and I was still disappointed. Uwe Boll finds a way to make each film he is involved in worse and worse. The general concept was not bad, a man bored of his life as a stockbroker becomes a serial killer. But the problem with the movie is that there is no middle ground, it goes straight from the stockbroker to the serial killer. The movie has actors with no name, and I can see why, after watching the movie, I can not see why any actor with a career would want to be involved in this movie. Anyone who rejected him did a favor to their careers. And if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and do not do it. <br /> <br /> I give Sanctimony a 3 out of 10
