If one wants a character in a movie to have a disturbing sexual encounter that would embarrass that character in later life, the only thing left of the audience would be embarrassing: bestiality and now it has been done. Judging from some of the other comments, even that did not succeed as well. I can not remember a funny scene, although I must admit that I had to turn it off before it was over. I saw a part of the director's comment and it seems he was as surprised as anyone that the film was doing well. If you want to get the same feeling you get from this movie but it's just cheaper, stick your head in a pile of manure and breathe deeply.
