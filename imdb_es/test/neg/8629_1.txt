I have seen this movie, having seen the original "Spoorloos" several times, anticipating the chilling finale. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to explain the anger and disappointment I experienced when the ending came and went, and the film continued to have a happy ending. What a waste of time it was to see this new version of EE. UU ... <br /> <br /> If you have an option, skip "The Vanishing" and see the original Dutch "Spoorloos". The suspense is very well built. You feel Rex's frustration, looking for any trace of what might have happened to his girlfriend Saskia, after she entered a gas station and never returned to her car. The search takes three years, and when he finally gets in touch with the person who knows the truth about what happened to Saskia, he must agree to submit to the same thing that Saskia has suffered. The ending leaves you speechless in your chair ...
