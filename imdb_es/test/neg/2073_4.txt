Boring acting, weak script ... the worst Spanish movie in years ... I was attracted to <br /> <br /> the beauty (nude) of Paz Vega, but as an actress <br /> <br /> she is useless , you almost can not understand what he's saying ... <br /> <br /> About the story there's not much to say ... we've heard about it before, but as this is a "modern Carmen", we find some changes: -The French soldier is now a Basque soldier. -Merimee himself is a character in the story. -Carmen is a dangerous "bandolier" in love with a famous "killer" and can speak basque fluently ... <br /> <br /> Can anyone understand this disaster?
