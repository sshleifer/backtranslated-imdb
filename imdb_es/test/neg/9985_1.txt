I found the movie in my local video store and I was surprised to see it on DVD. I had heard about explicit sex scenes, appalling violence and notorious debauchery. I sat and looked and started laughing! The decor and art direction was cheap and fake; the nudity was sardonic and incredibly unattractive; the story was badly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors who were taken hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written. The incestuous relationship between Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and her serenely beautiful sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) can not be taken seriously ... it is not even shocking or repulsive! Peter O'Toole and John Geilgud were obviously taken as hostages during the filming of this film, fortunately they died in the first thirty minutes of the film. The cinematography was a joke and it surprised me even more when they used a Bible quote! The book of Mark no less. If you are looking for shock value, this movie will disappoint you. If you are looking for a cult value in the camp, you will feel even more disappointed. I know what it was I've seen shocking and these are two hours of your life that you will never have again.
