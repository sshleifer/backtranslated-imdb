This is a piece of garbage hopelessly stupid, boring, lacking in imagination, lazy. When you see a direct selection of video, it's fair to expect the movie to be of poor quality at some level, but this goes beyond the garbage. It's just awful at all levels, with a script full of clich√©s that manages to be incredibly stupid and incredibly boring at the same time, an unnamed cast on the actors and some of the worst special effects I've seen. Even fans of slasher movies can not find anything here that makes this movie worthwhile for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on their usual group of young people who decide to spend the weekend on a remote farm in West Virginia that a member of the group has recently inherited. Unfortunately for teenagers, the inherited land was owned by a farmer who made sacrifices to help his crops grow, or something stupid in that sense, and now some evil scarecrows are willing to kill everyone. I do not know anything about the writer writer Paul Moore, but I suppose he's more than ten years old and, therefore, he should be able to find something more original than murderous scarecrows. Honestly. <br /> <br /> The special effects that give life to scarecrows are ridiculously poor. They often seem barely more than Haloween costumes in clubs. Special effects like these would have been considered quite poor twenty years ago, but by today's standards, they are nothing short of embarrassing. <br /> <br /> This is a total waste of time for all viewers, whether or not they are interested in horror films. If you must see a Slasher movie, rent one of the "Friday 13" or "Halloween" movies. Most of them are not very good, but they are certainly superior to this shit.
