Even the presence of Sophie Marceau and the few (very few) good French gags are unable to save this film, otherwise slow and boring! A disappointment. History is weak and so is acting. This movie was announced as the French version of The Mummy, but The Mummy has at least spectacular and pleasant effects ...
