I know that many people will automatically give this movie a rating of 1, just because it does not have the big budget and the special front-line effects they're used to. However, I knew what I was getting into when I put this in the VCR. <br /> <br /> I do not think we have much lower budget than this, unless we are filming a family reunion. The lighting is horrible, the quality of the sound is sometimes incomprehensible and the performance is extremely bad for almost everyone involved. BUT, this is still a funny movie and the plot is interesting enough. It focuses on a fellow named Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt), who has had bad luck with his work. He is very protective of his wife and does not allow him to work, putting even more pressure on himself. As he begins to work more hours, we see him gradually transcending into madness and obsession and suspects that his wife cheats on him and begins to brutally murder the various men (most types of reparations) that he believes that They are responsible <br /> <br /> I must say that Gore's effects are extremely cheap, but they fit with the overall tone of the movie. The brutal way in which Tom Russo comes to kill these men gives us an idea of ​​what happened. It has gone mad. The pace of the movie is also very good and there is rarely a dull moment. The ending does not really follow the rest of the plot of the film, as it seems to want to go from a psycho movie, to an aspiring "The Dawn of the Dead", but it is entertaining anyway and I must give Tim the credit of Ritter for wanting to use an unconventional ending. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I enjoyed this movie, but by no means is it a good movie, if that makes sense. Your budget is your main obstacle and the consequences are almost too big to ignore. I DO NOT recommend this to people who are totally ruined by big budget movies and who can not have an open mind to very low budget movies. You simply will not enjoy it. For others, and for gore fans, I tell them to try. You will find at least something that redeems in him! <br /> <br /> My degree: D
