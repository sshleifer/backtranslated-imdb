Who cares about the store here? How could a producer / network executive / director let a crew stick the most incredible plastic palm trees in the history of cinema in the sands of a winter beach in Canada and try to deceive us like the tropics? Those trees were for real palms, what a pink-tinsel K-Mart Christmas tree is for real fir. And who let Dermot Mulroney go in front of the camera with gray painted hair that had not gone through a game in a high school play? And none of the geniuses who are doing quality control on this thing thought about correcting the (excellent) Canadian actor when he said gaz instead of gas? Everyone involved in this "film", writer, director and actors, have done a good and brilliant job elsewhere. He walked too fast between events and very slow within them, devoid of any emotion except the obvious, expository and artificial. Maybe this just seems like one of the worst movies of Lifetime due to all the hype of the Red Carpet with which it was presented. And I say it as someone who loves Lifetime. What's wrong, friends? <br /> <br /> All this being said, the work of a certain actress in a certain critical turn in the movie (and if you've seen it, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about) was so brilliant that the film would have taken me 10 if that had been the whole movie. Unfortunately only about five seconds were missing.
