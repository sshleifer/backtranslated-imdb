The only reason I bought this DVD is because Cynthia Rothrock is in it. Now everyone knows that she is the queen of martial arts b movies. The problem is that this is not a martial arts movie. Cynthia Rothrock has about a minute of fighting scenes. in this stupid movie. Now, if you were a filmmaker and you had Cynthia Rothrock in your movie, would not you want to have a lot of martial arts action? all he does in this movie is walk around boring the way he was when I saw this pile of shit. I own a lot of their movies and they're all b movies, but at least they had some great fight scenes in them. I am a fan of martial arts, avoid this, no matter what. I'm still angry. I have lost 4 dollars to buy this DVD.
