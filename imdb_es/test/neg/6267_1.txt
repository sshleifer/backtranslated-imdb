I usually finish every movie or book I start, even if they are poor, simply because I hate to give up. It was so badly done, I did not believe it. <br /> <br /> Not only am I looking for the magic of Spielberg, but I also rent foreign films, and I re-sell very old science fiction movies (the most recent Soylent Green, which is worth it). rent). I like both Hollywood action and the development of slower characters. Different films must be approached differently to be appreciated. I could not find any redeeming element for this ... The action was so sharp that it was not in the least. The development of the character was virtually absent: you should not feel sorry for anyone, not even identify with him. Finally, there were so many pieces that simply did not add up. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, it's better to look at the dry painting ...
