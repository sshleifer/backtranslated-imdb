Despite being a fan of shock and gore, this film seemed disappointing, at least. The effects and the puppet work were impressive, yes, and the humor was timely, but ... something was missing. The first act of the film is dedicated to establishing the nuances of the character of Jack Brooks, even though everything we need to know about his aggression is delivered within minutes of the first title cards. As for the narrative and many of the flashbacks: unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The rhythm during the second act was tedious. Most focus on Freddy Krueger eating, then vomiting, then eating a little more, then waving his arms and saying something quick or rude. Meanwhile, the sorcerer is sprinkled with brief scenes of Jack discussing his anger issues with a therapist. (Definitely, the entertaining scenes of the film: an excellent dialogue that is worth lots of laughs). Then, without warning, Jack decides to kill a few monsters. And then it's over. <br /> <br /> In general, as a throwback to the horror films of the 1980s, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer has great potential, but it has no purpose and goes forward without conflict or proper resolution. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, these problems will be addressed before Jack Brooks VII: Jack Goes to Hell or Jack vs. Ash enter production.
