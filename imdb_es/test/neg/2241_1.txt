Countless historical and cultural errors 0/10 <br /> <br /> (1) A Jewish man named OMAR !!! Hahahaha (2) The brilliant detective was going for the least intelligent guy in the movie! (3) Jewish suicide bombers! That was fun. (4) Hitler and his best weapons went to see a movie in the center of Paris! With two guards at the door. !! shoot me. (5) Brad Pitt overreacted and it was painful to see him. (6) Mr. QT is rewriting the story: "Hitler was killed in a theater, seriously!" The funny thing about this is that people "and I mean stupid people" will really believe this plot. <br /> <br /> And finally someone can tell me how this movie reached the 250 best movies of all time! Shame embarrassment embarrassment, I still wonder how anyone can like this movie.
