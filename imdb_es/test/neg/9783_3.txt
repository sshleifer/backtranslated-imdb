"The Bone Snatcher" begins extremely promising, with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil, as well as with the use of the sublimely isolated filming location of the African desert. While checking the pipes in the desert, three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly non-mundane creature that devours its flesh and leaves only a lot of half-eaten bones. The crew of the expedition sent to rescue them discover that the monster is an ant superior queen, and very soon they will find themselves trapped in the strange desert as well. Director Jason Wulfsohn maintains a respectable level of tension until the nature of the monster is identified. Immediately after that, the film quickly becomes a common creature feature with all the characters abandoning the survival race one by one. The second half of "The Bone Snatcher" is unbearably boring; with the inevitable clich√©s of the love story, as well as the total absence of pieces of bloody murders. All the characters are unbearable stereotypes that act and say exactly what you predict with several minutes of anticipation. Is the novice who has to prove himself, the woman with brain capacity apart from their sexy looks, the hateful and experienced boy who redeems himself at the end through self-sacrifice and? last but not least ?? who could forget the black sage who refers to the monster that uses all kinds of voodoo names. Wulfsohn tries too hard to make his monster look like the outer space threats of "Alien" and "Predator." The ant creature has infrared vision and it crumbles when it is shot, yawns! The film actually only benefits from its unique environment and the handful of unpleasant images of decomposed bodies. This could have been a modest gem, but instead it is less than mediocre. Avoid.
