Well, there are some things about this movie. Everyone should see it. You see the nation of Iraq as you have never seen covered by the media, and filmed from a perspective that is almost not considered by most Americans, where the film has its main audience. However, all those glorious things in mind allow you to take a look at some other facts of the movie. There were 150 cameras handed over to the Iraqi people, most of whom consider that the war and the subjugation of the occupation forces are a growing pain for the betterment of their nation. And compared to Saddam, it's just a faint scratch on the skin. In addition, Netflix, as its main distributor, announced it before the fun choice we just had by sending a massive email to your entire list to watch the movie. Many of those that should be labeled as opinions played as facts enumerated by the Iraqis interviewed are wrong. If one has to review the Abu Ghraib torture records of the Red Cross, it was not Saddam's henchmen who were tortured, but a combination of 80-90% of innocent civilians and 10-20% of detainees. It was never revealed that any of that 10-20% was from Saddam's Henchmen or curfew rapists. In addition, the Arab world has never really included "Democracy" as one of its opponents, and more accurately, it is the 6 billion US dollars. UU For Isreal, our military bases in Saudi Arabia and our interest in oil. I agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this movie shows the same distortion. I am afraid that the Iraqi people represented by this film have been edited to speak with a Yankee voice. Yes, it is true that Saddam is a vomit, and that his expulsion sees many for the best. It is true that some Iraqis are paid a good salary. Just as it is true that no Iraqi people have control of their most precious oil and American corporations have it. Nor does it mention that 20,000 civilians have died due exclusively to US artillery. Still 15% of the country that once had running water and electricity now does not. Nor does it mention that, from 1993 to 2003, the UN sanctions designed and created by the US government. UU They killed more than 200,000 Iraqi civilians. Nor does it mention that democracy at the moment in which people decide the government, not a massive war machine that sends the message: "To be killed or to obey". I am afraid that the floor of the cutting room should have a good number of Iraqis who are not so happy with the Occupation. Just as the great majority of the world was not for war. In fact, the United States, Great Britain, Spain and the rest of them are not carriers of democracy, they turned their backs on him when they saw how full their pockets could be. Hooray, Saddam is out of power, but I'm afraid that no Iraqi is still in power. Corporations are in power, the media is in power. Read, do your own research and do not let them blind you.
