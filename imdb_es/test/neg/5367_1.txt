There really are no redemption factors about this show. In a nutshell, it's just terrible. Absolutely terrible. It's just a dreadful reality show. Not only that, it is a frightening fiction. <br /> <br /> Imagine this: a group of overly imaginative teenagers get together one night and leave "Hey! Let's do a paranormal show like" Ghost hunters "and all that!" So they grab a camera, harass local residents and film landscapes at random behind a monologue painfully "trying to be dramatic but failing". This show is basically a group of teenagers running around with a home movie camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary. The only difference is that this show actually has a budget and writers. A wasted budget and terrible writers. <br /> <br /> Oh, the problems, how do I tell you? Well, first of all, let's talk about this from a personal level. I'm not a total skeptic when it comes to the paranormal. I am willing to believe in what is paranormal and what is not, and I am sure there are many people who feel the same. So, if you are going to do a program about the paranormal, you must do a good job to convince the viewer that what they are seeing is paranormal or not, because the viewer can easily believe otherwise. I hate to compare, but I do not see why not at this point. Take "Ghost hunters", for example. In "Ghost Hunters" you can say that the cast is level with the audience. They are not totally skeptical, but they are still willing to take into account the possibility of paranormal anomalies. They have to look at something and be willing to say "this is possible that it is simply nothing". And, with that in mind, they set out to prove and prove that they were wrong. They use technology and various other devices along with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal and the fact that what they may be monitoring is nothing in mind. Not only do they try to convince themselves of what is real and what is not, in the process they try to convince you. That element of doubt is not present in the "Paranormal State". Strike one. <br /> <br /> In "Paranormal State", the cast simply says "there's a creepy place, and it's HAUNTED, so let's find some SPIRITS!" And immediately you know yourself and you say to yourself: "Very well, convince me otherwise". The cast is not professional in their interviews. In fact, sometimes it seems that they are simply harassing the local residents of these so-called "enchanted" areas. They have no real evidence to back up their claims, in addition to assumptions and theories, and the best they can do is someone who "affirms" that they can contact the dead, without anyone backing up who this person is and how valid they are in reality. . They could have easily chosen a random person from the street and say "pretend that you can get in touch with the spirits for our program" and went to it. In the episode of "Mothman", this simply happens. Without any convincing evidence towards the end of the series, they bring this type of individual where he does a randomly and painfully written "reading" of a supposed area of ​​how he "torments" something to convince his audience. Very, very bad effort. I feel that one of the main problems with the program is that it feels scripted. During one of the episodes, the cast is attacked by one of these "paranormal anomalies" sometimes in an attempt to be dramatic. This kind of dramatic sequences would make any skeptic laugh, and even those on the fence realize that what they are seeing is just a bunch of tabloid junk. If the objective of the program was to try and convince your audience that these "paranormal" events are real, they are doing a horribly bad job in doing so. Strike two. <br /> <br /> However, there is always the counter. Just one last point of view to see if the show is really worth something. What if the program does not try to convince you that these paranormal events are real and just try to entertain you with good fiction? It even fails at that level too. If the creators of the show tried to create fiction to entertain their audience, the writing is too poor and even on a fictitious level, it fails to convince the audience that its cast members are really experiencing the unknown in all its hideous glory. The writing is simply not convincing and even, dare I say, boring. Strike three. <br /> <br /> So, what remains of this program is simply a group of teenagers who are too willing or too gullible to believe in the paranormal simply because it is so much more surprising than the reality that they left with a camera. , a bad script and bad actors to make a really bad horror documentary. That's the whole show is at this point. There is no reason to see it, not even for the entertainment factor, and there is no reason to worry about it. To be frank, it's lame. There is absolutely no redemption factor about this show.
