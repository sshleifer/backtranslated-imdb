Several commentators have pointed out the implausibility of the plot, in particular the immense number of problems that Father McKenna should have had, and the absolute impossibility of some of the calculations that he should have done, including the fact that Langdon was going to do it. . Decrypt each track in minutes. McKenna is brand; A few seconds later, he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is (literally) in charge of the operations; in real life, I would be in shock. And, as is usual in thrillers, the killer does not kill the heroes, giving the only unconvincing explanation that they were not on the list of those who were going to kill, as if all the other innocent bystanders he shot were there. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a really horrible movie (the president of the US takes the jet plane and hits the aliens, ha ha), and this effort is coming. For such an unlikely movie, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who did not laugh knowingly when the killer went to look for his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like screaming: "They're going to blow you up." Who did not know that heroin was going to find a body in the laboratory? Who did not see the bad guy? Technically, too, the movie was horrible. The dialogue was often more indecipherable than clear, while the races through Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Also, many scenes looked like mud. The only redeeming characteristic were the shots of Rome and what appeared to be the Vatican, an achievement, because I'm sure Vatican officials would not have wanted this shot of scum around San Pedro, and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magical place, and I enjoyed watching it fleetingly.
