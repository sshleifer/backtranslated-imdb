Obviously adapted vehicle for Ryan Philippe. It seems that the studios expected him to be a tough cop and not have the appearance that he is 16 years old (he can not). <br /> <br /> Heavyweights Jason Statham and Welsey Snipes serve as bookends for Phillippe, but when you're not on Phillippe's screen; His superficial acting style has nothing to bounce back from. <br /> <br /> The script is a typical late-twentieth-century good cop / bad cop with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue drawn from the television police programs of the 1970s, such as "The streets of San Francisco". Snipes returns to play his role as the eternal villain in the black hat, playing a madman a little less crazy than his role as Demolition Man. However, Snipes and Statham did not have much to chew. The character of Statham announces that he had given up nicotine and caffeine, something that this film needed with many injections. <br /> <br /> Truly forgettable moment: Ryan Phillippe expounds on Buddhist dogma: Galloway: Are you a Buddhist? Dekker: No. It's just something I learned on the way.
