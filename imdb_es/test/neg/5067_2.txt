This music is totally out of touch with the film, appearing from time to time as Wagnerian bombing and Lone Ranger in a hurry, otherwise it does not exist. The performance, outside the two principles, is non-existent. It would have been an excellent student movie. Russian soldiers are just models who try to act. The constant interruptions with the angles of the wow explosive camera and the monocolor clips of pieces of people were quite irritating, but that's just a personal feeling. The story line is not worse than others, in fact it is not worse than most, completely ignoring logic, reason and reality. At least no one walked in front of a machine gun for three minutes without being hit. The three bad guys at the top level were campy.
