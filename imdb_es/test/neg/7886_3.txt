The first time I saw a poster announcing this film on a street in Helsinki, Finland, in June 2000, what struck me was the proud proclamation that informed all readers that the film, although it was French, had been " Forbidden in France. " Upon returning home to New York, I discovered that one of the "Art House" cinemas in the city was screening the film, and so (with my Finnish girlfriend) I decided to see what all this fuss was about. Boy, we ever did it. <br /> <br /> Of the comments that are read here, and of the critics that knew that the film was violent and sexually explicit. Not necessarily offended by any of these two conditions, I went with an open mind to see what had disturbed the sensibilities of our Gallic cousins. Presumably, as anyone who reads this will know, the story involves two women who embark on a crime and a wave of murders in France (the film has English subtitles). The resemblance to "Thelma and Louise", however, ends with that; Sex is unusually graphic (and in abundance), as is violence (many footprints to death and lots of blood and other organic matter dotted after the impact of the bullet). <br /> <br /> At the intellectual level, one could argue that the very essence of the film is the relationship of sex and violence (as manifested by the only sex these women know: one is a small-time prostitute and the other earns money from time to time acting in pornographic films, when they, during their descent into crime and murder, have the advantage over their sexual situations, they only react with the same violence and brutality that they themselves know and understand. note, however, that the victims of their uproar are not only creepy men interested in creepy sex (of which there are several) but also innocent bystanders, a woman at an ATM, for example. <br /> < I myself do not understand why the repeated "porn movie" shots were so necessary (except to represent physical contact as cruel, dispassionate and degraded) and the relentless blood turned before tedious after the first violent spasms. <br /> <br /> It is a gross and crude film, but in fairness, it is treated with rude and crude people and equally unpleasant circumstances. From one point of view, the lives of the French subclasses are explored, and it is quite somber; A travel notebook for France definitely is not, maybe that's why the French forbade it. <br /> <br />
