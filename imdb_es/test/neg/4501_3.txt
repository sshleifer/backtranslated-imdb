"Destroy all the planets" ends up "destroy all Tokyo" at the end of the film, while a giant squid-like space monster falls into the reptile oven known as Gamera. Actually, Gamera is saving the Earth from the beginning, knocking down the Varian Space Ship # 1 even before the first series of film credits begins. The scene changes to a camp of Japanese explorers where we find a couple of young meddlesome heroes, Jim and Masao, who participate in the exploits of Gamera after being kidnapped by aliens and thrown aboard their ship in a shield of electrified bubbles . <br /> It is quite surprising to see children convince a scientist to allow them to operate a newly invented submarine that could be defective. Previously, the boy's genius, Masao, had wired the unit to run in the reverse direction of his controls, but Dr. Dobie did not think of seeing that as a possibility. At least that prepared the boys to interfere with the controls of the alien spaceship playing switcheroo with a lot of triangular blocks. <br /> <br /> When the alien boss Viras says 'Activate the Videotron', hold onto your seats to play again. Images from previous films by Gamera where he fights against Barugon and Gyaos. These take up a little screen time, but are no match for the fast forward button if you want to continue with it. For a long time, Viras went to an invisible team, and when they finally appeared, they were Orientals who could fly. Go figure! <br /> <br /> When seeing how these films were made for a young audience, it is surprising to see how horrible some of the scenes are. A blood gamer comes to mind, and how about the pair of space crew members who are being beheaded. When the squid tentacles began to emerge from the headless bodies, I made a connection with the 'Alien' movies; having the individual units merged to form the giant Viras was a good device. <br /> <br /> I guess the attraction for young children could lie in the identification with the two young heroes who make friends with a giant monster. freely in an alien spaceship, and get what you want with the help of alien telepathy technology. Seeing how the movie was presumably made by adults, it could have been a simple case of wish fulfillment.
