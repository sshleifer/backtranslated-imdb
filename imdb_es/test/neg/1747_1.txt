Although the performance was excellent, I spent the whole movie waiting for the nasty boy who caused so much pain to so many of the characters, got his final nemesis and, on the other hand, everyone else suffered, except him, and he got the job of the husband whose wife The death he causes by fleeing his friends beats the girl to whom he overdosed and tried to rape her. Even his friend gives money to his father, but the butterfly effect does not return completely to his cause. <br /> <br /> This is a very dark film since each character that is affected suffers an endless depression. None of the normal avenues for relief seems to be effective and the only thing the authorities seem to do is deliver amounts of pills for stress. <br /> <br /> If this is normal behavior in Finland now, I will never do it. to return alone in case I am affected by a butterfly so amoral and end up as destroyed as were the characters in this movie.
