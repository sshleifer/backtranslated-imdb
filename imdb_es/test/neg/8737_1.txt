A friend and I went to see this movie when it was released in 1980. I was acting in a big theater and we were the only two people in the place. It lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it. It was so bad that we laughed all the time. From that moment, we rated films based on Kill or Be Killed as the worst movie of all time. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's so bad that it's fun. It's not worth a second look, that's for sure. I just do not dare to give more than a 1 because I do not think the creators of the film pretend it is so bad and I can not give credit for an accident. Sorry.
