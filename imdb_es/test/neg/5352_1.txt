First things first, although I think Joel Schumacher is, at best, a mediocre director and more often (as here), most of the blame for this ugly farce of a movie should go to John Grisham whose novel is based. <br /> <br /> Located at an indeterminate moment in time (the 50s? 70s? now?), the film begins with the rape and murder of a child by peasants so caricatured that their The purpose seems to be to reassure the racists that "at least we are not so bad"? Turn to the bad guys who come to court when the girls' father, Samuel L. Jackson, afraid of getting some technicality, shoots them in cold blood before the trial. <br /> <br /> The environment is a 'deep south' that probably never existed: the few black characters live in huts and seem to pick up cotton, the racists dyed wool (Kiefer Sutherland is a cartoon version of a Klansman ) are laughable in their villainy. The issue is the trial: for the defense, they are the "good guys" - a milquetoast lawyer played by Matthew McConaughey as a comatose, his assistant played by Sandra Bullock's breasts (she does not seem to serve any other narrative purpose) and Donald Sutherland as the most demanding drunken lawyer who complains about fighting with the good guys. For the prosecution, Kevin Spacey follows the movements of being a spawn of demons, while in the city in general, crosses are burned, witnesses feel intimidated and local citizens do not care. <br /> <br /> Some of the critics here say that the film is immoral, since surely Samuel Jackson is a murderer and must trust the forces of the law instead of dispatching in a weak oratory of Matthew McConaughey. To be honest, objectionable though the underlying message "Vigilante justice is good" may be, everything in the film stinks: the characterizations are unfortunate, the protagonist active, the sense of direction, the script and the dialogue almost on the verge of the parody. Peter Menzies exuberant, the technicolor cinematography of the 50s is beautiful but derivative. <br /> <br /> And it lasts for almost two and a half hours! <br /> <br /> What remains to be said? This is a waste of 141 minutes of anyone's life, it's tedious, empty and absurd, and, almost like a late occurrence, it's morally disgusting.
