Ravi Chopra wrote this film 40 years ago, he wanted to put Dilip Kumar at the head <br /> <br /> The film was finally rewritten and made in 2003 and, therefore, the subject seems outdated and too superficial at times < br /> <br /> Just like the reason why Amitabh-Hema is too shallow, even the way it is shown to young people is as bad as Gulshan in ATATA <br /> <br /> The message arrives ok but things are presented in a clich√© The character of Salman is the worst, it seems taken from a storybook, while Bachchan's climactic speech is good and also the end of not forgiving the children is good <br /> <br /> Ravi Chopra does a good job Music is decent, the songs sung by Bachchan excel <br /> <br /> Amitabh excels as always, has played a senior and stern father before, but here he plays a victim and portrays her well. His last speech is great. Hema is good in her part. Aman Verma highlights Samir Soni is fine, Naseer and the rest sons and wives are decent, although Divya Dutta highlights Salman Khan is fa Ke, Mahima is fine, Paresh and Lillete are adorable.
