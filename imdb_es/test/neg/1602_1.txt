I thought that the bedroom cell was interesting and exciting to see, until the last episode, when nothing happens, its F ****** BS, Americans portray Muslims as terrorists and Americans as heroes, it's the other way around , I hate that all American television shows become predictable, I expected the bombs to explode in that stadium, but I knew I would not, it takes away the joy of seeing it when you know that the good guys are leaving To save the day, once again , Americans are the biggest terrorists, g is the leader of all of them, he is the culprit of the attacks of September 11, and I am convinced that you continue to launch these shows. , which are all the same ******! I have a good program about terrorism, it's called "The Whitehorse" and Bush is the leader of the cell, it's the same with 24, however, 24 was good, the sleeper cell is a simulacrum and should never be a season 2, it's F * **** joke And you are also American producers.
