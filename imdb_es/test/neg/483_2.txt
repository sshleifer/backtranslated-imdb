"Dolemite" is the moving story of Dolemite (You have to love the movie titles of blaxploitation), an ex-convict who probably should still be in jail. He gets into trouble with policemen, friends, drug dealers, women, prostitutes and society in general. He just is not such a nice guy. The movie either, although it's still fun and worth watching. <br /> <br /> The flimsy premise is that Dolemite (played with as much enthusiasm as the star Rudy Ray Moore can muster) is in jail for a crime he claims he did not commit When a drug hit or a drug bust or a drug is about to fall, the warden releases it to stop him, help him or just look at him. Not very clear All I know is that I did not know that the justice system frees the convicts to allow them to prove their own innocence. I guess my ignorance. <br /> <br /> The plot is complicated and unimportant, basically Dolemite is killing people (usually with badly choreographed karate), having sex and cursing people, sometimes even rhyming. The joys of the film are his total incompetence and his total indifference in the matter. <br /> <br /> I stopped counting the number of times I saw the boom microphone after it was in a scene for the entire duration (approximately two minutes of film). I stopped asking why the director was looking down, where Dolemite was sitting, even after he got up and took a walk, when they cut the settlement shot and Dolemite was inexplicably sitting again. I stopped wondering why Dolemite dressed like this when he stripped down in the street to change, because he did not want to get into his car with the ugly clothes (read: normal) that had given him jail. And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he shakes his hand on a boy's stomach and somehow opens it up. The only time I was nervous and tense was when the filthy, flabby white mayor is walking completely naked with nothing but a towel hanging from his neck that barely covers him. You keep saying "Cut ... Cut ... Cut", but when they do, you're already emotionally marked. <br /> <br /> The movie is ridiculous in every conceivable way. Moore as Dolemite, is funny, great or both. If you are looking for a bad movie, you have found it with "Dolemite".
