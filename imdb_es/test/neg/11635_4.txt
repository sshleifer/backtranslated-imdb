1st seen 7/29/2001 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): the fast and frenetic animation effort of Ted Turner's animation group is a lot like television cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of the nice characters, but definitely has extremely nasty villains. I'm not even sure why children would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know little or nothing about. Mediocre effort at best, despite the praises in the box that compare it to the efforts of Disney such as Aladdin and Lion King. Do not let this fool you, there is no comparison in history or quality.
