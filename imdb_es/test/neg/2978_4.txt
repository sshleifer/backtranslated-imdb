Well, I must admit that this movie caused me some occasional laughter. It's fine, but that does not make it a good movie. Most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and really unconvincing. Not all give excellent acting performances, but some really try, but fail because their characters are poorly written. The perfect example is Julia Koschitz: she changes her eating habits from one talk to another, in a talk she does not drink alcohol, in the next she is allergic to champagne, she feels too beautiful for most people (in fact, she is) but it still ends with the "perfect" fit in terms of appearance, and refuses to give some more "realistic" opportunities, and so on ... The ending is very cheesy, although I like one of the final scenes, when everyone finally stops talking and the director gives us the opportunity to catch our breath. Shoppen is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughs (mainly because it's about sex and relationships, I suppose) and maybe a little entertainment. Still, the whole picture is a big stereotype and nothing is really special about it.
