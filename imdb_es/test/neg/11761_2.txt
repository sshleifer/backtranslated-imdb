CHE! It's a bad movie and deserves its reputation as a movie with no funny intent. Take a serious topic and present it as the version of Cliff Notes or Classic Comics because there is not much emotion or a proper narrative, only episodic segments united with "true stories" mostly stupid transmitted by a variety of yutzes. <Br /> <br /> This is a movie deservedly ridiculed, since it is badly written and acted. However, what I found most interesting about the movie is its apparent gay subtext. Instead of Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro working for a communist Cuba, they seem to be more of a homosexual couple: Che is shy and distant and Fidel is the ardent suitor! Again and again, the film abounds in great lines, as when Fidel begs Che: "Cuba needs you ... I NEED YOU!". I'm not sure if the study intended this homosexual current, but it does not take a brain surgeon to recognize it. I am very surprised that the other reviewers did not point this out. However, if you remember this when you watch the movie, the visualization is much more exciting and even more fun. <br /> <br /> A final note. In recent years, Che has been very elegant, even a fashion statement with hordes of brain-dead teenagers, who have no idea who he was, with shirts adorned with his face. Considering he was a murderer in cold blood and nihilistic (a strange combination for a doctor), this new reverence for man is disgusting. What are you going to do next, put Hitler or Dr. Mengele on t-shirts and posters? Even conscientious Communists should be horrified by the bloodshed Guevara was responsible for, and I find it ironic that people with computers are defending a man who probably killed them if they were given half the chance! <br /> <br /> Considering how stupid and unintentionally funny this movie was, it does nothing to promote the message that Guevara was not a hero. I would love to see a realistic movie made of his life, with the good and the bad, but also with a dialogue and a plot that apparently were not created by chimpanzees.
