The disappointing comedy-drama with a sentimental coating has Michael J. Fox ideally as a former children's star who now runs a talent agency for theater children. Nathan Lane and Cyndi Lauper are his assistants. All this sounds as if it could not fail, however, much of the stage is given to strident Christina Vidal as a street man that Fox believes will be the next big thing. The heads are quickly blocked, and the dialogue of jokes takes them from one side to another to an unpleasant end of formula. Fox and Lane are attractive, but the energy of the first scenes gives way to the core. Produced skillfully, but ultimately rancid. * 1/2 of ****
