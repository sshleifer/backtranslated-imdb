Gargoyle begins one night in 'Romania 1532' when a peasant girl (Daniela Nane) travels with her horse and her car in her own affairs when from the moonlit clouds over a living Gargoyle she rushes and attacks her, she manages to escape from the Gargoyle. And it happens in a castle of some description where an angry mob of local villagers and a priest can take down the Gargoyle, or so they think ... Cut to the present Bucharest where two CIA agents, Ty Griffin (Michael Pare) and Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) are about to negotiate the safe return of the son of a rich American ambassador from his kidnappers. While chasing one of the kidnappers, Griffin loses him on the roof of a building, but finds a large pool of blood and there are no visible signs of what happened to him. Meanwhile, Dr. Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) and her colleague Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) are renovating a church when church worker Gregor (Mihai Bisericanu) informs Richard that he has found some ancient relic, both investigate and They find a cave with lots of viscous cocoons and a very angry and very vivid gargoyle that does not waste time killing them both. Griffin & Wells are in the case when they are missing and soon realize that the local legends of monstrous gargoyles are true with a local priest named Father Soren (Fintan McKeown) who plans to flood the world with them ... <br / > <br /> Co-written, co-produced and directed by Jim Wynorski under his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews Gargoyles is another masterpiece that Wynorski can add to his credits, no. The script by Wynorski, Ion Ionescu, A.G. Lawrence and Bill Munroe is crap, unattractive, boring and as simplistic as it can be. For starters, I would like to know if there was only one Gargoyle left who put all those eggs because I'm pretty sure she could not have gotten pregnant. How did you survive in that hole for 500 years? That ate? How did the priest know he was there? Why has no one else discovered it? Why did the priest want to flood the world with them? To govern it? The Gargoyles are just going to conquer the world and then let some priest simply govern him like a king, and if they do, what would he have left to govern? Like the guys who wrote Gargoyle, I do not think I've thought it through, right? From any point of view, no matter how many times I try to square the circle, the gargoyles do not make any sense and the story has a huge plot. , lapses in logic and it's not so good to start anyway. The characters are boring and clich√©, the action is repetitive and unattractive, while the movie as a whole is a real bore to sit down. People do illogical things and everything that happens is very convenient, like when the priest tries to convince Griffin that Gargoyle exists and one suddenly appears and attacks them. The cave full of cocoons is an Aliens scam (1986) that is shameful and the ending was boring. The part of the big Ferris wheel at the fair was funny when the boy mocked the fear of heights and forced him to climb. <br /> <br /> Director Wynorski cuts costs and steals images from other films, in fact, the best Gargoyle scene is a car chase in Bucharest, but it was taken from the action movie of Jean-Claude Van Damme, Maximum Risk (1996). No shocks, no fear or atmosphere. The special effects are terrible, the CGI Gargoyle seems to belong to a computer game and has little interaction with any member of the living cast, there are many scenes of people looking to the sky and trying to appear marked. There is not even gore that is worth doing that the thing can be seen, there is a terrible decapitation and that is all. <br /> <br /> Technically, the special effects are terrible, but otherwise it is passable, the Romanian locations seem properly Romanian. Gargoyle went straight to the video and he looks quite cheap and looks. Acting is not a big deal, the victim of a personality bypass, Michael Pare, becomes the most boring of boring heroes. <br /> <br /> Gargoyle is a shitty movie, it fails in everything a decent creature feature should strive to achieve. A total waste of 90 minutes as far as I'm concerned, one to avoid.
