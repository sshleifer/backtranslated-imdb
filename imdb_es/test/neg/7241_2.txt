If I was still 5 years old, I might find it scary. It is (I suppose) a low budget movie. The acting is not good, but it could be worse: the filming and the special effect are terrible. The story line is thin and not worth stopping. Too much time is spent in scenes of boring shouting. The persecutions or fights with aliens remind me of children fighting with scary masks. A little blood with blood and parts of the body would scare a 5-year-old boy, I suppose. Apparently, scare some of the people in the movie. <br /> <br /> It is far from reaching something like the movie Tremors. <br /> <br /> This turns out to be an "incident" and we see alien ships close to the ground. It makes you wonder if anyone will do a sequel ...
