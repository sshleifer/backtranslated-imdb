I have read each and every one of the books by Baroness Orczy Scarlet Pimpernel. Counting this, I have seen 3 pimpernel movies. The Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews I preferred a lot to this. He goes out of his way by violence and action, and occasionally completely violates the spirit of the book. I do not expect films to adhere directly to arguments, I stopped being so idealistic a long time ago, but if you have already made an excellent movie from a book, do not remake it with a television movie that includes excellent actors and good costumes, but a barely decent script. Continuing with the 80's version .... Rahne
