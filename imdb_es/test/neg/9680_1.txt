I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER making another "biblical" movie again, if Noah's Ark is going to be the norm. Apart from the horrible and uninspired performance of the entire cast (Voight and Steenburgen, no doubt regret the day they agreed to make this film), the timeline has been completely reorganized. I also missed the part in Genesis about the pirate fight on the ark deck or the peddler who came in his rowboat. Hello? All the rest were dead, except Noah and his family, according to the Scriptures. God piled wood and added plans to build the ark when Noah asked how. I also do not remember reading anything about Noah's wife constantly bothering him during the 40 days, or Noah wandering through his glazed eyes and stunned all the time. The screenwriter obviously had very little knowledge of the book of Genesis, or simply did not care that his abomination of a story completely made fun of her.
