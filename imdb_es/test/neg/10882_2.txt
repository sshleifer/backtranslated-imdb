Obviously, Raw Feed Video is smarter than all of us who waste our money renting this movie. They will earn millions with video rentals and their low budget investment will be rewarded, which will fund "Rest Stop II" (unfortunately). I imagine they spent a maximum of a few hundred thousand US dollars to hire the actors, rent the place of rest stop, burn a truck and drag a motorcycle behind the truck for a little more money for technical things. That's. We should all be as smart as these guys, I will not hit them for having the genius to promote a stinker in good monetary returns. The premise of the film was good, and it could have been a really adequate horror film, but it failed to offer a clear story. I'm always looking for a gem from the newly created film companies, but I did not find it here and neither will you. I only regret losing $ 3.99 plus taxes to find out.
