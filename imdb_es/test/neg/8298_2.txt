This film clearly has an agenda, which could be summarized as: Never, never cross the border (either physical or metaphorical). Let's avoid everything that is on the other side with a wall, a fence or something else, let's pretend that all "gringos" are evil, satanic or drug traffickers. Everything that is outside the country's border (and especially the US borders) is dangerous, malevolent and people there will hate it, envy it or try to steal it or something else. The "fact-based" is just a perverse label that can be put on anything to give it some credibility or, in this case, just to help push the ideology of the film to some naive throats. The perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and everything else to very black and white stereotyped categories: Mexicans become disgusting people, Mexican police in a group of corrupt police, Republicans in the imbeciles of the right, the democrats in the humanists almost hippies and so on. Is there something good in the movie? I just believe it, but you might think differently.
