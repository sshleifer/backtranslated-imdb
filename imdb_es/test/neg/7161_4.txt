After the book I became very sad when I was watching the movie. I agree that sometimes a movie should be different from the original novel, but in this case it was more than acceptable. Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) why the ranges are different (for example, Lieutenant Diestl instead of the sergeant, etc.) <br /> <br /> 2) the final screen is very poor and makes Diestl like a Soldier who is deceived and wants to die. But it is not true at 100%. Just read the book. He was also a bull dog in the last seconds. He did not want to die ruining his weapon and simply walking towards Michael & Noah. <br /> <br /> So this is a happy ending that does not fit at all in this movie.
