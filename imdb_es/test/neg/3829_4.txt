Alice Dodgson, a doctor from New York, suspends her license when she treats one of her patients with an unapproved medication, resulting in the death of the patient. Out of work, Alice is forced to go to Jamaica, where she cares for the brother of a rich man. The brother thinks he is a zombie and is deeply involved in the voodoo practices and rituals of the local people. The "ritual" is a mediocre horror movie. Some blood when someone is killing white people with a machete, but not too much. The cinematography is decent, however, the performance is truly regrettable. Definitely one to avoid. 4 out of 10
