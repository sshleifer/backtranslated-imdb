Uhhh ... then, did they even have writers for this? Maybe I'm demanding, but I like a little dialogue with my films. And, as far as the Slasher films are concerned, only a small part of the character's development will suffice. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, The Prey does not provide anything and, if you think I am being hyperbolic, you will only have to veil yourself. Scene after scene, we only have actors standing, sad and clumsy, abandoned by any sense of a dash. Outside of shouting the names of others when they are separated in the forest (natch), the only cases in which these people say something important is when a character explains the constellation of Orion (clearly plagiarized by Funk & Wagnalls; scintillating slasher food; no?) and another repeats an old campfire story that does not even have anything to do with the plot (wait, what's the plot?) On other occasions, The Prey really has the nerve to film his characters with the mic boom far enough so that we can not hear exactly what they are saying. This way we get complete scenes in which the actors are muttering! Deliberately! Seriously, I've seen more dialogues in a silent movie. It's as if the filmmakers sat in a bar somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga at the height of the 80's craze and one looked at the other and said, "Hey, I have a very sweet idea for a bloody decapitation gag. around him. " And ... well, they did. <br /> <br /> To be fair, The Prey probably had some kind of writer on board. I mean, someone had to write down the sequence of the scene and label the diaries. However, I am totally convinced that this movie did not have any editor of any kind. There are dazzling breaks, boring pictures and a feeling of null rhythm at all times. The filmmakers have nothing else in the "script" to film, so they complete the execution time with exhaustive taxonomies of flora and fauna that inhabit the forest in which our wild and crazy teenagers are cut and cut into cubes . All these bugs are filmed directly, at noon, in a completely reserved way and without any attempt at atmospheric photography. If it feels like a science movie, it's because it is. I'm pretty sure this is all that is shown in nature, all that is missing is a stifled narrative from some National Geographic councilor. <br /> <br /> More exciting images that were gently kept from the floor of the cutting room: a scene in which two men discuss the cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches, and another scene in which a character from Support is removed on a banjo so it feels like a whole minute and a half. A minute and a half! It's a lot of banjo to commit to celluloid to start, let alone insert it in the final cut of the movie! A lot of road, guys! Brevity and conciseness are the real victims of this massacre. <br /> <br /> It is true that the film accumulates a lot of steam (comparatively) in the last 25 minutes, in which a great part of the butcher shop condenses and where the theft of "Music for strings, percussion and celesta" of Béla Bartók gets in the way. The great vaudeville Jackie Coogan makes a funny appearance as a park wardrobe ranger (this was his last role, if you can believe it). And there are some good bloody moments, which include a tearing of the neck and the aforementioned decapitation. The makeup used for the killer (Carel Struycken, also known as "Lurch" from the Addams family films) is also quite effective, and makes it look like a strange hybrid of the young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Also, if you love the extravagant endings of the left field, you need to see how they wrap this puppy. I promise you. <br /> <br /> Usually, I love movies that are at this level of ineptitude, but three-quarters of The Prey are so endlessly boring that they pretty much ruin the rest. In general, this is a largely pale and tedious issue, and, while not all bad, it should actually be seen only by weakened slasher completists. Why do we do this to ourselves, anyway?
