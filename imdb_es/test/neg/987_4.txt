*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS DOWN *** <br /> <br /> What a long and mostly uninteresting movie! Who were these characters? Why did not I care? If I go to see a movie for two hours, I would like to worry about someone or something. <br /> <br /> We know that Salvatore dreamed of the riches found in the new world. However, beyond that, we learned little about most of the hopes, fears, etc. of his family, as they embarked on an adventure into the unknown. <br /> <br /> And why was Lucy even in this movie? She said little; We knew little about her or what she was doing (was she obliged to look after the men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship?) or what were her plans upon arriving in New York. For those who might suggest that they needed it to underscore the point that a single woman, even if cultured, could not enter this country alone, I tell them that that fact is not enough justification to give her so much time on screen. That point could have been expressed in five minutes, with Lucy as a momentary character. <br /> <br /> More questions: Why was the twin brother not on the ship to join the family? We heard about the brother, and some closure on that point would have been useful to give the film some cohesion. Also, how long did the trip from Italy to New York last? Given the conditions on the boat, it makes a difference for the viewer if the trip took five or 10 or 50 days. (Someone said something about seeing a "week" landing at a certain time, but I think it was when they were already on the way). I needed this kind of detail to better appreciate what was happening. <br /> <br /> The only scene I really liked was when the ship, full of passengers, left the dock. <br /> <br /> If you decide to rent this movie, do it with the remote control in your hand; you may want to have the Fast Forward button at hand. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can suggest that, with the correct voice-over, provide useful information about the times and circumstances for immigrants, especially during the slow periods of time. photos of the countryside, people walking, etc., this movie could have been an interesting public television documentary.
