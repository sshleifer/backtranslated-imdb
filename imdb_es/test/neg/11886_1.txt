This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own community on top of a mountain as free men in seventeenth century Brazil. The story is interesting and uplifting. However, this movie, like a movie, is terrible. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. It's Afro-Brazilian pop music of the early eighties. The battle scenes are fought with the sounds of corny pop beats that are left in the disco or bad police dramas. It is true that the letters are popular tales of the heroism of the slaves. The special effects are absurd. Instead of invoking the mysticism of African religion and atavistic beliefs, they simply make the movie look cheap. They are completely incredible, and I do not mean merely in a sense of plausibility. <br /> <br /> Life within the Palmares commune could not have been the way it is described in the film. For this society, as shown in the film, it is a kibbutz on one side, an Afro-pop festival on the other. Furthermore, it is almost shameful to see the director play with the clichés of blacks as talented singers and dancers who simply want to be happy. It portrays everyday life as a series of dance parties in which freed slaves paint themselves with bright colors and revolve around pop music of the 80s. On the other hand, they have a lot of beautiful food, but the viewer almost does not see any work done. The king violates private property in a hackneyed and clichéd manner. When a man complains that people are taking the vegetables he has grown for many months, the king says: "What comes from the land belongs to everyone, since the land does not belong to anyone. to take yours. " <br /> <br /> I'm glad I learned about this episode in the story, but I'm relieved that a movie with such low production values ​​and exchanges with such worn-out stereotypes probably will not be made today.
