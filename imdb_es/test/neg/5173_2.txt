Having had more than a few colleagues, I suggest you check Rise of the Footsoldier out, eventually I got to that last night. Undoubtedly, the story that Colton Leach has to tell (and did in his autobiography) is a compelling story of the rise of a man from Terrace boot boy to a villain of the connected underworld. This film sadly compromised in quality for the bad results, the frightful accents and the unfortunate performance. Ricci Harnett in the lead role of Leach does a reasonable job of conveying the transition from crime to serious criminal, but his accent is everywhere. As his voice provides the narration of the stories, it is something that after ten minutes was driving me crazy. Terry Stone as Tony Tucker provided the unintentional comedy with an ill-fitting wig (or the worst Barnett on the march), a dialogue so disturbed that it limited the youthful and an exaggerated vehemence in the line, which reduced Tucker to parody. This film was that the pre-filming events in Rettenden, Essex and the formative years of Leach are of genuine interest to crime fans and football fans, so this story was sabotaged by the lack of credible accents and the acting left me. Feeling an opportunity was lost. Roland Manookian and Frank Harper provide the only source of authenticity of the films. On the positive side, some of the rhythm and construction films flowed well and kept the attention. The violence was well choreographed and, apart from relying too much on the red projectile syrup for blood spatter, it was generally realistic. If you liked the movie, it's worth taking a look at Essex Boys telling a similar story from a fictional point of view and also with Billy Murray.
