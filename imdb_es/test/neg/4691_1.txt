Not many people remember "The Carey Treatment", and I can not say that I blame them. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards did this during his years of scarcity (that is, between the "Pink Panther" films) and by one The story of a doctor turned detective (Coburn) who works to solve a murder In your hospital, it's actually quite forgettable. <br /> <br /> Coburn is reliable as always and O'Neill is beautiful as always, but it seems so. Something that is missing in the process. The twists and turns of the story do not imply much, and even the climax, which is supposed to be harrowing, is heartbreaking instead. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity completely, and unfortunate, since it was based on a book by Michael Crichton. <br /> <br /> Well, at least Crichton did not write a sequel to it. <br /> <br /> One star. "Carey" in, Coburn.
