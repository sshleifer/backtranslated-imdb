Edge of Madness is a tale about a woman in the 1800s who is chosen by a dirty Scotsman who can not keep his penis in his pants. He happens to have a younger brother who is against the rape and kills him, but he continually says it was an accident. This makes his wife go crazy, she delights and she falls in love because she loves George too much. <br /> <br /> As I said, these kinds of things have already been done before. This is simply more "artistic" because it is Canadian and is an independent production made on a low budget with little-known actors (except that a Lassie child, yes, is in that). I do not know if this was going to be for Oscar bait, but it was very boring. And this is based on a 40-page story. Half of that short story is incorporated into this movie, and I'm glad. Otherwise, I would be bored to death. Unfortunately, I had to see him in my Media Fundamentals class, and I had a task in him. Read the short story and compare and contrast the movie with the story. BORE. <br /> <br /> You know, it's harder to answer the questions in the movie when you do not like the movie. Oh, well, I hope this is the last type of assignment that I and my class receive. For what it's worth, Annie Herron was totally sexy, she had a nice, soft ass and I liked the nude parts of her in the movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for boring, Oscar bait performance and graphic sexuality ..plus nudity.
