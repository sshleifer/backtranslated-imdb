This movie was so bad. If someone who has participated in the film is reading this, including the director, I HATE YOU! LOL, that blond woman, who was running away screaming through the woods. At least he cries instead of screaming and keeps doing the DODGY PESTEO BREATHING! and, oh my God, if it was the director who solved the cameras in this case, then he returns to a normal job. Nobody wants to be looking at the chin of a scared woman along it. Damn, DO NOT THINK about renting / buying or even having a copy of this within a radius of 100 meters from your house, as it can be detrimental to people who like good movies ... When I got home, I thought that I had rented a pron movie for the performance and style of the camera.
