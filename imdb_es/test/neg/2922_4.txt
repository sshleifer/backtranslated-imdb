This film would receive a much higher vote from me in general and I will talk about why, but above all it receives four stars and should remain in four stars due to the ridiculously insipid description of rape and sexual assault. Not far from the film, Oyama sexually assaults a woman he rescued earlier, and although she feels a bit annoyed by his actions, this attitude only lasts about five minutes before the loving adoration is established and leads his character to throughout the movie. I know many will argue that it is not so important in a kung fu beat-em-up, and as a fan of the genres I can not say that it is so unusual, but that does not prevent it from being completely insipid. The moment I see it. <br /> <br /> What I am going to say in defense of this film is that it is somewhat comforting to see martial arts, or even action movies of any kind, that do not offer a real hero for the viewer. stay behind. Oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer; a marginalized society whose only student becomes completely unbalanced mentally before being killed by the police. The final shots of the film leave one with the feeling that Oyama himself is ready for a major crisis and it seems that he no longer cares about the woman he first assaulted to love him and since then he followed him with devotion like a puppy . <Br /> <br /> Whether this was really the intended message of the film or not, one can not help but feel a little hopeful that Oyama may be on the verge of suicide when the film ends. This is a rare emotional treatment of the martial arts genre and it is interesting to see a movie that leaves you with the feeling that you should not celebrate your violence. If only Karate Bullfighter had dealt better with the issue of sexual violence, either by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved, or by excluding it completely, this would have been a much more interesting film.
