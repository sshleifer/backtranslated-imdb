<br /> <br /> I rented this movie on June 20, 2001 and saw it for about 45 minutes. I came to the conclusion that looking at a blank screen would be a delight in comparison. There was not a single person in the cast who would have shed a tear if hell had opened and swallowed the whole group. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I sent an email to all my friends and relatives warn them, and I take the time to urge everyone who can see this note to avoid this movie like the plague! I have seen some really bad movies in my time, but NEVER one as bad as this one.
