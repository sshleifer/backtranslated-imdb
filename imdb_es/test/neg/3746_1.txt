I left the cinema after having suffered this movie after 30 minutes. I left two friends trapped by a big fat guy to support the rest. <br /> <br /> As soon as the opening sequence of the film unrolled, I felt something was wrong and it was not long before I stopped. I hid under my seat, shrugging in embarrassment. I do not like movies, however bad they may be, since they usually have some redeeming characteristic, but this suffered a catalog of bad direction, bad performance (character of the bar 'Bruno' and the impeccable Jean Rochefort, according to my friends), a horrible edition (in terms of theme and meaning), a terrible soundtrack and a correlation of images that seemed to make an art placing the wrong peace of music on the image and the scene at the wrong time. The worst crime was his general insipidity and his disbelief (a result of the aforementioned atrocities). Why was it so horrible? I do not want to waste more time explaining. I would say that you see it and see it for yourselves, but I do not want to fill the chests of this project more than necessary. Oh, the screening had a redeeming feature: my friend was leaning over the rows of seats in silhouette with his umbrella hooked on his arm while trying to calm down: more pathos, tension and entertainment in those few moments than in the 125 minutes of this effort sadly terrible
