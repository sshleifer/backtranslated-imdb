Well, they sent him on television between midnight and 2:00 a.m. It seems to be the right time to see it and then go to bed ... <br /> <br /> No, it really was not up to par. to my expectations I think the Dogma concept is good, because the film is closer to what is really happening between the characters involved when you cut all the unnecessary effects and the music that creates the mood. But, again, this concept requires an interesting action among the characters. <br /> <br /> I can not say I know King Lear very well (Shakespeare's version), if I had known the play, I probably would have been able to predict much of the film. <br /> <br /> Well, a crisis can bring the best and worst of a character on display, and we certainly see some negative aspects. Oh, yes, the painting of civilization and culture can be very thin, and behind this painting you can find an animal. <br /> <br /> If you then compare it with "Italiensk for begyndere" (Italian for beginners) or "Mifunes sidste sang" (the last song by Mifune), you see the same thing but the opposite: a crisis can certainly make People see their life in a more constructive way. And if you dare to do it, you can win. <br /> <br /> When the movie ended, I thought: "Oh, that's why I have not seen it before ..." The film has its own beauty. The quality of the work of the cameraman, actors, etc. It's good But the script might need something more. A plot maybe would not hurt.
