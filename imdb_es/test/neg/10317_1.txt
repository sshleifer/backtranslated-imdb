My first warning should have been that this DVD was for sale for $ 5.00. But since I had Sandra Bullock, who I generally like, I bought it. My disappointment with the movie started almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and rigid. The color is distorted. I continued adjusting the volume to listen to the conversations. The acting is amateur. Even murder scenes are a failure. Twice, the dead moved their legs. When my daughter, deficient in cash, offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, I obeyed immediately and with joy. This is an incredibly bad movie. Tomorrow I will give this DVD at the Christmas party of the white elephant of the company.
