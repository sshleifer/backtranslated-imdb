I have tried to see this program on several different occasions and each time I found it completely pale with humor. <br /> <br /> The reason, to mention one thing, is that it relies solely on ridiculing everything that Republicans have. fact. In short, it is basically political opinions of the Democratic party that are promoted as humor. <br /> <br /> All Mr. Stewart does is comment on anything that Republicans have done and that the public has been involved in forced laughter. <br /> <br /> My opinion is that the left is so devoid of any real substance that they have to be defined in terms of how much they hate the Republicans. <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> _____________________________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
