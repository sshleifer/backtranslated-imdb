Words can not describe how horrible this movie is. Well, maybe they can. I'm going to try: 1 - Sorry. Hollywood makes more talking animals set in graphics. Apparently, the script and the plot are no longer necessary. <br /> <br /> 2 - Violent. Film for children but, nevertheless, one of the characters is brutally attacked and killed. <br /> <br /> 3 - It's shamelessly stupid. Actually, the film shows farm animals with human skills. In Nemo, the fish could talk, but for the most part, they are still fish. We only listen to English as a translation. In Barnyard, animals actually speak an English that other people can understand. <br /> <br /> 4 - Not smart: there is no intelligent story, not even intelligent humor. (Ok, the 13-year-old dog with crutches was fun). <br /> <br /> 5 - Culturally insensitive: the "black" cow is actually played by a black actress. The pink cow is played by a white actress. The black cow was playing a stereotyped black person. <br /> <br /> 6 - Ignorant: there is no such thing as a male cow that I know of. I think we call them bulls? If we are going to expose our children to drek, I could have the simplest facts correct. <br /> <br /> 7 - Boring and Borish. My 4 year old son made us leave after 45 minutes. He practically fell asleep. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie will make millions, which is unfortunate, because it only shows Hollywood producers that the American public in general is full of fools who expect to pay $ 8. Just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two. An unfortunate circumstance. Why should producers spend real money when the returns will be the same?
