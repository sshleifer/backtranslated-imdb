Well, it's a standard Hollywood show that can be seen a mile away. It's nice in parts, but it's so predictable. I must confess that I did not really enjoy it, but I am quite difficult to please and many of my friends loved it. <br /> <br /> It's very sweet and the actors give good performances. It's a good backdrop and the sweet eye is pretty good. But the plot of irritating predictability, unoriginal and quite boring slows down the movie. Personally, I can think of better ways to spend a couple of hours of my life. <br /> <br /> The genre of chicken films receives a bad press, but there are some really good girls movies; this is not one of them
