I rented this tonite from my local video store. It was titled "Black Horizon." I think someone thought this was good enough for a relaunch in 2004 ... Unfortunately, Micheal Dudikoff is not a ninja in this movie, one of the main flaws of this movie from the beginning. Another major flaw would be that the Ice-t action scenes are stolen from other films, particularly the first scene of their rescue, which is directly from the Wesley Snipes movie "The Art of War", with Ice-T edited. I hope you paid for the images. <br /> <br /> The plot is horrible, the special effects had little effort (I love the cables that hold them in space), the performance is made of wood (I also love the accents of New York / Russia). The fact that Ice-T is in the film does not make sense. These guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in space, but I guess they were not worried about that. <br /> <br /> Micheal Dudikoff should go back to doing what is "good" and doing American Ninja 6.
