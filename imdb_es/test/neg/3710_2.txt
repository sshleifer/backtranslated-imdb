A horrible B movie at best with a video quality similar to Dead Alive. I challenge anyone who is a fan of the movie "Aliens (James Cameron 1986)" to tell how many times the lines or almost complete sequences of the first two Alien films were ripped to make this classic piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> Cast members like R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the leader "Jack Scalia" was really absolutely horrible. I think he was thrown out because of his huge cleft chin. I was also annoyed by the stereotype of the only black man on the set John Toles-Bey, who must watch this movie and just ask himself. Watch him at some point, since he has made many interesting films. <br /> <br /> But in this movie: The script, as I said before, was a modified Aliens scam and turned into an underwater thriller. It included lines like "I have a bad feeling about this" and "Kill Me", since a member of the crew is infected by one of the mutants and his belly begins to do the "alien jump" just before it leaves his stomach. There is also a scam of the classic "get some!" through Bill Paxton. We also have a lot of naval grunts running through caves with creepy crawling bugs jumping off the walls. Even the explosions of the mutated creatures are very similar to the outburst of aliens while they carry the marines in the movie "Aliens". And the good thing is that some of the mutants spit acid (instead of having acid for the blood). There are many more important examples. So if you want to see this script well done, look at the first two classics, Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver). It will have a more pleasant time. <br /> <br /> The plot could have been interesting and done better if it were not for confusing sequences at the beginning of the film and a generally poor edition. The shots of the camera were quite boring and, honestly, it was not very difficult to stop seeing them and walk around the room to buy a sandwich or check the email. Many of the interactions between the characters had little or no meaning and did not go anywhere more often. The entire command structure between the crew and the captain was poorly made. I'm not even sure if there are captains in the army who have total control over nuclear submarines. In general, this only shows that little research was done to obtain background information that makes the film look at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (such as immersion depth, etc.). <br /> <br /> If I like horrible movies or you're a big fan of Alien and Aliens and you want something to laugh and shake your head, then this movie may be for you. As for me, this is coming back to the shelf ... permanently.
