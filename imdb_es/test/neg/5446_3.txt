This is just one of those movies that continually make you moan and wish you had finished. The problems are many and the good points are few. I feel that the main problem with this film is that it has what amounts to a cheesy plot and they try to be an epic movie, a film about evil and intelligent monkeys that sign that it is not epic, it is cheese. When you have cheese you make the movie more fun. Of course, the final scene with the monkeys and that laser was very nice to see and more things of that nature were needed. Instead, the actors are doing a job so serious that you feel that the movie only has a cheesy plot in the middle of all the serious tension that the film is trying to configure. The plot revolves around a woman who tries to find what happened to her ex-husband disappeared while also looking for some kind of legendary diamonds. She uses these two boys who trained an ape to sign language and now wish to return her to the wild as a cover to enter the country and begin the mediocre adventure of her life. The only things that make this film tolerable is the character of Ernie Hudson and the laser attack at the end.
