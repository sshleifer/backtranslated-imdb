Anna Christie (Greta Garbo) returns to see her father Chris (George F Marion) after 15 years. He is the patron of a ship and she stays to travel with him. During this time, she meets Matt (Charles Bickford) and they fall in love. Matt and Chris do not look each other in the eye and Anna has a secret to confess ..................... <br /> <br /> What a boring story. ..... begins badly with George F Marion and Marie Dressler playing drunks in a bar. The scene continues forever and both are terrible. It is also difficult to understand them. In fact, it is difficult to understand the entire cast. I missed entire sections of dialogue between Bickford, Marion and Garbo because it is incomprehensible! Garbo is obviously something special, since they attract you every time he is on the screen and his presence gives this film the 4 stars that I have given him. But nothing really happens, it's a boring story with atrocious accents. You will do well to stay awake.
