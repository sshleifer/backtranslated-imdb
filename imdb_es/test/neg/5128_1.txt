I was a sophomore in college when this movie came out and I had never seen it until the night before. I finally decided to watch it because I like to dance and because the film had a great cultural impact. After watching the movie, I am completely baffled by how it had any other effect than putting people to sleep. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty absurd when you think about it. Does anyone really buy the idea that that beer full of curious old steelmakers and teamsters could keep their clientele with the high-concept dances these girls were doing? Everyone would have gone to Zanzibar faster than you can say "performance art". Can you imagine the reaction of the real-life versions of that audience to that strange television that sees the dance of the theater that she did? Please. <br /> <br /> It seems plausible to me that there could be a woman who worked in a steel patio and was also a dancer; after all, both are physically demanding jobs. But I did not buy for a second that girl who worked in a steel yard. And I did not buy for a second that I was looking at a real steel patio. The work of steel is dangerous. You do not keep your work area as a junkyard and you do not end up losing a limb. I love some of the inane shots like when two welders are sitting on welding large corrugated tubes. What the hell are they doing there? Or when you're cutting six inches off a rusted steel bar with a cutting torch. Obviously, she went together and started cutting things randomly. <br /> <br /> But the holes in that story can be overlooked if the movie is funny or at least stimulating in some way. However, Flashdance offers nothing to balance it. <br /> <br /> The dance is horrible. It's the spasmodic style of contraction and posture that ruined American musicals until ... well, have we already got over it? The sensuality that the film tries is ruined by the complete lack of personality of Jennifer Beal. I mean, I'm a 42-year-old man and when she was supposed to be eating lobster, my only reaction was to think I should have a lobster bib. <br /> <br /> You can not really be behind Alex and she dreams because her character is so stupid and superficial. The dog had more things than her. <br /> <br /> The love story is flat. He presents himself as nothing more than a boss with the enemies of one of his workers. Zero passion. <br /> <br /> Even the final scene where he dances for Orville Redenbacher and some other stiff things is not satisfactory because the reaction of the panels is so incredible. What serious dancers would not roll their eyes at Alex's cheer routine? In short, the film had nothing but leg warmers and large sweatshirts. Oh, yes, there is a good deal of nudity when Alex "rescues" her friend from being a useless erotic dancer (a giggle of hypocrisy). Apart from that, the movie is a waste of time. I would like the MST3K team to still be in business. This would be a good fodder for them.
