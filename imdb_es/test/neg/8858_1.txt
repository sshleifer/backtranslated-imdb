If you have seen Pulp Fiction you do not see this movie. This movie is not funny. This is the worst parody movie in history. This is a bad attempt at parody movies. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad. The movie is bad. This is one of the worst images ever made. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend Plump Fiction. I prefer the original Pulp Fiction of the great Quentin Tarantino. This is one of the worst parody movies that have been made. <br /> <br /> Plump Fiction is not a good movie. It's not funny. It's so silly and vulgar.
