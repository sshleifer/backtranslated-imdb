After looking for this Bruceploitation for months, and then buying it by accident, it was disappointing. I heard it on a DVD-R site and it sounded crazy. <br /> <br /> But no, what I got was a pretty bad martial arts movie. Kung fu was not that bad, but the rest of the movie was pretty horrible, and it made the movie really look very long, much longer than the 85 minute run time. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, the ape was funny for a couple of seconds (especially when I think they took the only close-up of his face from another movie), and the black man that appears halfway It was fun because of the one sentence he said: that alone made all blacks look like complete simpletons. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately it was not enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
