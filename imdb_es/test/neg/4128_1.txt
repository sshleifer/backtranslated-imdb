First, I just watched a movie on SHOWTIME called Survival Island. He says it was a 2006 movie with Billy Zane, and since I like it and could not sleep, I thought I'd check it out. It seemed interesting. I saw it, and I decided to look in the IMDb who was this new face Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG, I could not believe it, this movie has changed its name to THREE and it will be a new movie. It is playing again in 1 hour and 30 minutes on the Showtime channel again and this date is May 28 and the time of the EDT or of Florida. You can review your showtime listings by title and see them. I will not go into details so you can see the movie, but in a moment there is a woman in a white bikini who gets into the water, she takes off everything, you see her naked body ... when she comes running out of the water again your funds in It's funny, there are also many other problems. I can not believe by chance that I decided to look for this movie ... Imagine! I wonder if the people who changed his name sold him to a movie studio to publish it, but he's already on Showtime, haha ​​Good laugh. I give it 1-1 / 2 stars. C-, D + film.
