This movie was not so good at all. Here's the first clue and it's not going to be a strong movie, Harrison Ford's name does not only appear first, it's also bigger than the title. The music was nominated for an Oscar, what the hell was that? That music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie. The acting was bad, at best, except that the Amish boy did a decent job for being so young. Then you have the story that was weak and a bit exaggerated, and won by adapted! The music was horrible, I know I already said something but it was very bad. The place was really good and should be redone. Well, that's all I really have about that. <br /> <br /> Your average type of movies, <br /> <br /> -Trover
