This train crash begins with Brujo y Alma crossing the border with Mexico. Alma suffers from a horrible curse that makes her vomit garden snakes and Nickelodeon Gac every few minutes, as well as clench her teeth and mumble nonsense. Apparently, Alma has this guy in Los Angeles who knows about a cure for her. They get on board a train to get there and, luckily, a friend of theirs pays them. Alma and Brujo remain in the luggage cart the whole movie, since they can not afford high class seats. Meanwhile, in the upper class, we see a lot of nobody heading to Los Angeles for any reason. A bald man on a business trip, two girls, one of whom carries $ 5 billion and a wad of cocaine, three drug addicts and some Mexicans. The Mexicans fight with Brujo and try to take their "herb", which apparently is a sedative for Alma's snakes that slide inside her. They realize that snakes do not attack, they enter your body through your veins! Very crooked and B-Movie. Sorcerer saves the boy by tearing the heart (Temple Of Doom style) and get the snake. For some reason, he can not hurt the snakes or hurt Alma. While this is happening, a narcotics expert tries to arrest one of the girls and puts on some topless action in exchange for not reporting his drug shipment. A mysterious guy appears and has a gunfight with him. As a grand finale, Alma becomes a vampire, bites his man and then becomes a giant pathetic excuse for a CG serpent the size of the train, eats the train and becomes a whirlwind of nuclear bombs in a whirlwind and disappears . Everyone goes to Los Angeles on foot. <br /> <br /> The credits say at the end: "Any similarity with real people, alive or dead, or real events is purely coincidental, and very strange, we suggest moving and / or taking a plane." Oddly enough, one sentence in the bald movie is "Yes, I hate airplanes!" The credits continue saying that "No snakes were hurt during the production of this script, only a small child, but it's great." In fact, there were MANY real snakes used in the movie, and all very tame. Actually, there is not a CG snake scene attacking anyone unless you count the big one, but then you just eat the train and the other fake snake is just the head and looks like a muppet. Snakes do not really attack anything, they're just ... there. You actually get off toilet paper! <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny, it's not scary (since there is no real snake attack), and it's just a "quick charge" that is when a low-budget film company finds out about a big budget Hollywood release, then they rush to publish a similar movie, or even a parody version, for release just before or simultaneously with the big name movie. The effect of this fact is that many people confuse one with the other, and they will see the faster ones than the "big ones" or, they will want to see the two, for whatever reason ... like me. Avoid at all costs.
