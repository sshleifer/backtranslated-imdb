I had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on Broadway with Kathy Bates at the helm. I only saw another work in the 1970s and 1990s that had an emotional impact as this work did. I really wanted the work to become a movie, but I was very disappointed when I found out that Kathy Bates would not play her role in the film again. I guess the power of the stars is Sissy Spacek Sissy did a proper job in the lead role, but it was not up to Kathy Bates in any way. I love Anne Bancroft but she seemed too young for this role. The plot of the film was faithful to the work. Anyone who has contemplated suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation in those who are left behind.
