There's a fantastic song in Killjoy 2 that talks about how clowns are usually really nice and funny, but Killjoy is a killer. I do not remember the song in the first movie, but when the singer Olimpia Fern√°ndez sings 'Killjoy, yes, Killjoy 2', it sounds as if the 2 had been added for this sequel. The movie is much worse than the first movie and that was very bad. This time, the cast, including the generally excellent Debbie Rochon, has stopped trying and the director Tammi Sutton does not create tension and simply presents a boring and constant film. The images of the full moon produced this during its "urban" phase, none of which was very good, but none as bad as here.
