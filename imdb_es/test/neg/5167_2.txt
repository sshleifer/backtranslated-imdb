This was like watching the trailer of an upcoming movie, except there was no movie to come. The movie is so unsatisfying and obviously unfinished that it's almost ridiculous. The theme of this movie is in a very short period of time and, frankly, not much happens in the 90 odd minutes of the screen. I was waiting for the definitive Australian movie about our soldiers in World War II and how they fought against incredible odds in terrible conditions. This certainly is not. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the performance was excellent and the locations authentic. This could easily have been a great movie given a lot more money and time, instead of that it is not even mediocre and I can not recommend it at all.
