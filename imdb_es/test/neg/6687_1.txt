Seriously, I could not find anything that constituted a rational human thought in this movie. For some reason, the writer decided to have a group of actors in random places that snarled, crawled and shouted like Cro-Magnon's bipeds. I understand that it was gymnastics, but seriously, what about all the roars and human bleatings? I also saw at least five actors with hyperactive terrets syndrome and syphilis in stage 10. <br /> <br /> Although this film has real human acrobatics, I must say that it is surprising that I can make a movie like this without having intelligible. the patterns of human speech. This is truly a milestone in the history of cinema because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express more than a timely Urrrrr! or Rfff! Sound. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
