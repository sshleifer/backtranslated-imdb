I was living in Barstow Ca. in 1968, when the movie The Killers Three came to the local theater. The trailer was enough to pay the money I earned so hard to watch this movie. I really expected a Bonnie And Clyde movie and I got Dick Clark to play a shy nerdy guy, while Robert Walker and Diane Varsi played a poor attempt to reenact Bonnie and Clyde. Needless to say, it never went well. Maybe that's why he never came to video. Even as a child they left me something that I cheated when I left the theater. After all the best parts in the trailer of the movie. The movie was boring and pretty useless. By the way, Dick Clark is killed, so it was not a total disappointment.
