The enthusiastic and verbally abusive boss of a film studio directs his male assistant with requests for nit selection, keeping the youngster firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment; After a year of office terror, hard work finally breaks down. Writer and director George Huang has possibly bitten more than he can chew here. His "Swimming With Sharks" is not a tirade against Hollywood, nor is it a tribute to the person who works hard ... instead, it is a trick to make movies with a touch, a pony of a single trick with tunnel vision. The setting does not look or feel like Tinsel Town (perhaps due to a limited budget), and we never have an idea of ​​this stressful environment as a movie making entity (it could be the office of a real estate agent in the Valley , for everything we do) know). Leader Kevin Spacey, who was also one of the film's producers, offers a controlled and focused performance as the crazed tycoon whose ego is out of control; He does a good job, and yet, the character does not sound real. We learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and his high rank do not coincide with what we see; To whom does this man respond? What drives it beyond humiliate others for sport? What projects are you juggling with the script we see past? The film is so atrophied and so sparsely populated, that it looks like a play for the big screen, but without enough characters or motivations. Maybe Huang wanted to keep things simple, but instead, his film looks like a half-baked project that needed a lot more perception, humor and atmosphere. ** since ****
