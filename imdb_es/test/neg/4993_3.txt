Rise of the Undead begins as a huge nuclear-type explosion tears apart in an anonymous US city, some people survive in a building by leaning on the door to keep it closed and maintain misery (!). They argue among themselves for years, then a monstrous thing comes out of nowhere and begins to kill them one by one ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbell. One has Saying Rise of the Undead is terrible. The script takes itself very seriously, but it makes little sense, the first thing I asked myself was if there is a huge explosion of nuclear type, which destroys the entire city. Why are these people I am seeing still alive? Why the building where they are still standing? Then I asked myself when something really was going to happen, the first 20 full minutes are fixed in a room, in reality that is a little generous, it is more a corridor, as the main character argues. Then it becomes a scam of Return of the Living Dead (1985) with a government-created virus that turns people into zombies before one of the most abrupt, meaningless and seemingly random turns of the plot occurs. I have seen, what makes most of what you have just spent a complete waste of time. Then, during the last odd 30 minutes, Rise of the Undead turns into a strange science fiction-type thing, like something that resembles a ball of energy floating around everyone, was he the only one asking what this ball is? floating energy and where did it come from? since? Going back to what was happening outside, what was the reason again? Oh, that's right, we're never told. Rise of the Undead is a disaster, the characters are horrible and do not even have names, the twist halfway will make you start your hair with frustration, the dialogue sucks, nothing is explained and there is practically no story here. The last 10 minutes (maybe a little more) of Rise of the Undead do not present any kind of dialogue and the film ends suddenly. <br /> <br /> The directors of Horton and Hubbell were obviously working on a low budget, the full movie is located in approximately two rooms and three hallways! The photography is awful, they use seemingly random annoying color filters and, sometimes, it really seems that Rise of the Undead was shot on a camcorder. There are no special effects, there is some fake blood spattered but there are no actual make-up effects to talk about. There are some CGI shots of the city engulfed in flames that look good, but the floating ball of the energy creature looks terrible. There is a disconcerting shot from the start where two people are sitting against a wall in the hallway and talking, for some strange reason that their heads are cut off at the top of the screen! Only their lower bodies are seen from the neck down, but nothing else happens in the frame, they do not move and there is no more there, but for some strange reason their heads are cut off by the upper part of the frame while talking between yes! Actually, it is something very strange to see. <br /> <br /> With an ultra low budget of approximately $ 10,000 and according to the IMDb filming in two weeks, I have to congratulate the manufacturers for having finished and distributed Rise of the Undead, but that's where my Congratulations stop because, otherwise, they have terrible production values ​​and they are located in about three corridors that are somewhere in New Orleans, in Louisiana, where Rise of the Undead was filmed. The performance sucks, so I will not stop there. <br /> <br /> Rise of the Undead sucks, it sounds like a zombie movie, but honestly it is not, everything is wrong and I know it. the filmmakers were working with a low budget, but that's not really an excuse as far as I'm concerned. Definitely not recommended.
