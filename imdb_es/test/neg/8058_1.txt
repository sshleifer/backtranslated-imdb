This movie was incredibly bad ... It's bloody, but the violence is too much to the point where it looks extremely false and predictable. As everything is shown to you, there is nothing left for the imagination. And the plot ... what plot? There really is not any! The pace is incredibly slow (despite the random acts of violence) and the script must have been written by a crazy 12-year-old boy who kills kittens for fun. So this movie was banned in 31 countries? I could see why ... not because of the blood (boring and trite) but because it was a terrible movie. It should have been PROHIBITED from existence. Avoid this as the plague. 1 out of 10
