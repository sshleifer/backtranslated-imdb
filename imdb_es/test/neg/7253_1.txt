And I'm afraid I can not imagine why. It really is a genuinely serious and exceptionally boring movie. In a way, it recalls primitive science fiction when all the sets had been destroyed in a Hollywood lot of what was out there. From the tiny and unconvincing set (the snipers seem to be about ten meters away) seemingly made of plaster, to the actors who are apparently also made of plaster with "fun" stereotypes painted on the top, to the strangely warm pool in a frozen cave, to the survival of the cast unharmed when the artillery shells exploded a few meters in the open, and finally the horrible script that reads like a training manual more than a movie ... I can not really say what boring that is. Even the chance to see if young James Dean survived was not enough to keep me watching for more than an hour. This is really one that should be avoided at ALL costs.
