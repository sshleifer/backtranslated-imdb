Overrated, poorly written, badly acted. Did the academy even see this? I suppose not. The political content guaranteed him an Oscar nomination - Indo -Pak Border - A little boy, terrorism. Anything with the word "terrorist" draws attention in <br /> <br /> this post 9-11 world. It's like the holocaust movies that are guaranteed an Oscar nomination regardless of their merits. <br /> <br /> and, please, cinematography does not mean photographing landscapes that are beautiful in the first place. you have to be a rotten shooter to fuck you doing the beautiful desert. At least this did not win the Oscar. They had that right at least. It would have been a farce.
