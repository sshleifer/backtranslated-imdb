At first I thought it was bad because I had high expectations for this movie, but after thinking a bit, it's so bad. I was almost caught up in the promotion of HK's bad stars in bad movies. The new generation of actors and actresses of HK, not to mention the bad scriptwriters, is crumbling the industry. At this moment I am still trying to figure out how gross so high. Normally you can not lose in a movie with Donnie Yen and Ekin (forget about Jackie, he has already passed his best moment). but then I should have discovered it when the twins were on the cover. It's cheesy, corny, very cheesy, I try to laugh at some of the jokes, but not only the effect is minimal, but the jokes are very recycled and not funny. I'm sorry, I bought the movie. The only reason why some people think it is so good is because they have been brainwashed so that the twins are adorable and everyone likes them, and that everything they do is good and fun. and if you like twins, then you're up to date ... <br /> <br /> sigh ... I miss the good days of the hk movie when the movies of jet li and stephen chow dominated the box office ... br /> <br /> Mainland Chinese films are much better than this, and are recorded for lower budgets.
