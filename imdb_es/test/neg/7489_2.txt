Last night I saw this movie on television, waiting for a realistic explanation of what could happen if there was an outbreak of some highly transmissible disease. I was disappointed, and I think the movie was garbage. It did not seem real to me. Some of the performances were horrible, particularly the doctor's. It was the worst I've seen. All this played as a 'worst case scenario' for CNN. Even the obligatory bits of human relationships from the disaster film did not seem sincere. I've seen some disaster movies, particularly the weather ones, which are actually so bad that they're fun. This is almost as bad, but it's not even fun, it's tedious and boring. Do not worry about this.
