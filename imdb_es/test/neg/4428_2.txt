It is known that the director Lo Wei read the roles of the races and took naps on the set. It tells us something about his "approach to filmmaking, is not it?" The reviews I've read are divided into two categories: 1) this is such a bad movie it's funny, or 2) this is such a bad movie that it's boring . <br /> <br /> Then we go to the point where we all agree: this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> I vote for category 2.) The story is almost incomprehensibly complex, and is More fragmented and twisted by the camera's remarkably deficient work and editing, however, Lo Wei was so in love with him that he slows the pace so we can all have a look for a long time, whether we want to or not. <br /> < Maybe Lo Wei was upset the day (or two) that this movie was made, I just wanted to make everyone suffer, the cast, the team and the audience. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the agony.
