I was 12 when this movie was released and I loved it. The songs were inspiring and made me feel good, watching them several times in the movies. In fact, I had the soundtrack album and I played the song over and over again. <br /> <br /> 26 years later ... I am ashamed. I just sat and watched him with my 2 daughters who enjoyed it a lot, but my cynical big eyes hated it. It is very poorly run in many places and considering that it was Lionel Jeffries who really wanted to enjoy it. The animation of the characters was so rude, but the backgrounds were pretty good. I remember that the critics at that time said it was a poor movie and I was horrified, but now I agree. <br /> <br /> It's an old movie, yes, compared to what can be achieved now, maybe that's why I thought. It was good then. But that does not excuse him for his bad performance, direction and disorder. The voice of the main child actor seems bent, which also distracts a lot. I can not see what they were trying to achieve when it was made, everything that became a weak movie.
