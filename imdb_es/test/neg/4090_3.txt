This movie was a failure like comedy and a movie in general. It was a very slow-paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a clich√©, a hopeless mess to begin with. This film falls into a shameless environmental point, and even tries to destroy an SUV and promote Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> As I went through this, I could not help noticing that Steve Carell had no more. than a single really fun line. The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the lamentable attempt to give comic lines of relief to Wanda Sykes. His character gets frequent and cruel lines where they can not fit. <br /> <br /> Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty blows his full budget on special effect graphics devices that turn out to be just as the plot progresses. The film passes the first half until the construction of Evan's ark, but in the end, we learned that the ark had no meaning, and the plot was just a ship for the stupid gags and even the most stupid messages. The film concludes when we learn that the entire ark, flood and animal harvest was only a weak political statement from God. Yes, God was trying to influence politics.
