No one in this movie has much to do. These are probably the longest 65 minutes I've spent watching a movie. The effects of makeup on the pianist with macromeglia are quite good, but that's the only thing that prevents this from being scored with a 1. The doctor's assistant experiences extreme mood swings from passivity to hysteria in seconds and then seems to forget where he was at the next scene The director put together many of the right ingredients for a movie of crazy doctors, but somehow he forgot the skeleton of a story to hang them. Unless you meet someone in the cast or team, I would not recommend trying this one.
