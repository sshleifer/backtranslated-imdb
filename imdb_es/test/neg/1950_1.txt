I had noticed that this movie had been a lot in Cinemax lately, so this morning I decided to watch it. I had just finished the Infiltrator, which is a great movie, and I thought it looked good too. From the description that the cable had, at least. This movie was horrible. It's slow, the pace is horrible, it feels like it lasts 4 hours. There is no real plot to talk about ... agh! How can someone say something good about this movie? Rickman is good ... but always is ... the other two characters work well, but there is no real story that supports any of that. After 2 hours, and you sat there wondering what the hell is going on, where on earth is the plot, ends with a surprise that frankly made me sick. Do not bother with this.
