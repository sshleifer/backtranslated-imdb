While reading the script online, I thought "Capote" needed a cut. After having seen him on PPV, I can tell him that he did not cut himself, that he was sacrificed like that poor family! Example: in the script, Truman dubs Shawn "Adorable One"; Here, he is the "Mr. Shawn." <br /> <br /> It's bad enough for the fans behind this film of -e flapping Capote and hitting his circle (we must believe they thought so little about Nelle, that they smashed opus like a disgusting joke?), They make Perry Smith such a sensitive victim, even when he shows himself dispatching the Clutters. One thing is to falsify the facts, another is to let go of the ball: the executions were carried out between 12: 45-1: 19 AM, April 14; Truman shown in prison 22 HOURS LATER! <br /> <br /> I was totally disappointed by the "performance". Keener does not even try to sound like an Alabama native. Because of the way Cooper kept shouting "Alvin!", I was waiting for the Chimpmunks to appear! Hoffman does not give us the lovely magical fly, but a pathetic aspiration that sees a horrible act as his ticket to the great moment. When Hoffman complains about being "tortured" by the endless appeals, I wanted to give him a shotgun to do us both a favor and break his brains!
