There are good and bad movies, and then there's Moscow Zero, a film so bad that makes spending a month alone with an insurance salesman an attractive alternative to entertainment. <br /> <br /> With an incomprehensible plot about the gates of hell that open inside a labyrinth of tunnels under Moscow, the film is a chaos of repetitive and meaningless takes of a girl running through tunnels , red lights floating around and strange wall shadows, none of which serves to mount any fear or tension, but instead provokes the reaction of "here they go again with the girl (or lights)" of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Directed by María Lidón, who for reasons that I can only conclude as a shame, was announced as Luna, movie stars Vince Gallo as Owen, an American priest who travels to Moscow in search of Sergei (Rade) Serbedzija), a friend and colleague who has disappeared in the tunnels. Recruits the help of a number of locals who, with the exception of Oksana Akinshina, are represented by Spanish actors who try, with limited success, to accentuate the Russian accents. <br /> <br /> On the way they cross paths with members of a leather-covered religious mafia underground led by a valiant Val Kilmer, whose career seems to be in such a free fall that he has resorted to appearing in dreck as well , and the henchman Sage Stallone (Sly's son), who seems to have been chosen simply so that Stallone's name can be included in the marquee of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to seeing the company try to navigate through the tunnels with the help of a comically drawn map and repetitive takes of them. or eluded by a pale-faced young woman, not much else passes by. The dialogue changes routinely between English and Russian, with actors who take turns frequently in each language, and whole conversations are expressed half in one and half in the other, with the only apparent reason for feeling this way, adding a frustrating dimension to the viewer, more and above, trying to decipher the madly improvised story. <br /> <br /> The only thing that Moscow Zero does well, however, is its title, which could only have provided a more accurate description of this film if the word Moscow had been omitted.
