This television movie is about all the clichés you can create for a disaster movie. The only problem is that it is not very well done. <br /> <br /> My brain is still insulted by the scenes in which Brian Dennehy is supposedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather patterns data and showing on that monitor are stock footage scenes of commercial wing weather turbulence of the time channels. Why seeing local news images of a faded side street gives an idea of ​​global weather patterns? You got me. <br /> <br /> Also interspersed during the first two hours are some of the worst CGI effects known to man. Watch for the semi truck and the plane that looks like they were rendered on a Commodore 64. <br /> <br /> All the foreshadowing in this "movie" is done with the subtlety of a hammer, the dialogue is forced and I can not think of a nice character with whom I want to survive the second half. <br /> <br /> The character I hate the most is the stupid wife that her husband cheats on. Maybe if she raised a finger at any time during the show instead of being a helpless woman staying in the same 10 square feet of the kitchen all day, her husband would not be sleeping with the public relations representative of an energy company rival. She is so helpless, in fact, I want to get her out of her and out of my misery. I hope everyone in this "movie" dies in the second half.
