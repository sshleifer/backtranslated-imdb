MARY, MARY, BLOODY MARY is a good time killer. It has a cast of uniform appeal, the action is rarely boring. There are many murders. And the production values ​​are not bad. But in the end, it plays like a standard television episode from the 1970s with a bit of nudity. The film is the final product of an "author" who tries to make a purely commercial film. There is very little depth here and the film spends too much time with chases and action scenes. Except for the scene on the beach with the old man, MMBM is almost devoid of any fear, suspense or fear. The director has very little understanding of the horror genre. <br /> <br /> It can be seen although it does not leave a lasting impression.
