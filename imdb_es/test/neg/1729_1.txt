This is a disaster movie, in both meanings of the word. Each character, each role, each conversation, each turn, everything in this movie sucks big. It's a shame to see the talent of Dennis Hopper wasted in this terrible movie. I can give you hundreds of examples, but you will see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Or, better said, no.
