I'm surprised that all the "hated" ratings are six and seven, still above average. For me, this seems like a case of "the emperor has no clothes". I understand that this movie was produced on a very low budget in the early 70's ... However, it became a struggle to sit and watch. The DVD that I saw had some subtitles, but about 75% of the discourse is not subtitled. Some of that is hard to understand. The Jamaican patois was great to listen to, but you struggle not to disconnect after a while. Some of the shots were nice, and the realism was there, even if some of the performances were not excellent (Jimmy Cliff did a good job) The plot is not bad, but it's pretty predictable. In the movie 1:43, the highlights are Jimmy Cliff (Ivan) singing for a scene, and a couple of shootings and a fight. Probably 15 minutes or so. The rest is pretty boring. By the way, near the beginning of the movie, there are some strange cuts with the character of Ivan that seem to be an editing mistake, which made me laugh a little. One critic said that this film has been cut so many times, that there are few copies of the original theatrical version of 1972. The ending was quite interesting, since it shows how media from an early age influences people, it could also be A general comment on the influence of colonialism / white man in Jamaica. Other main themes are poverty, corruption, church, ambition ... To finish, the soundtrack is definitely worth it, the film much less.
