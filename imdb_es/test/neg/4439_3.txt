"Quinteto" is definitely not a movie that most people find fun or even interesting. There is no scene development, dialogue, acting or argument that ignites a spark. The frozen world is one thing, but the confusing plot is something you really can not stand. The characters are not only three-dimensional, they are not even one-dimensional, there is no emotion and there is no sense in anything that happens. There is a world locked in the ice, where no one is doing significant work, except playing Quintet, and the rules of the game are not even understood. The houses have no heating, there is even electricity, but who and what produces it? There is wood, but there are no animals, except dogs, so where does the clothes come from, or the shoes, because apparently there is no industry, and everyone is dressed as in sixteenth-century Europe, which contrasts with Pavilion not so futuristic as a backdrop. The whole film seems to be trapped within Altman's imagination, and he never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with the audience. The desolation or despair have nothing to do with the lack of appeal of this film, the world "THX1138" by George Lucas is not a brighter place and the characters are not more fun, but history has its way. In Quintet, there is no obvious way or even insinuated, and in my opinion does not even cause to think about the idea behind everything, as, for example, a similar film, "Zardoz" by John Boorman. It's not even made in Altman's unique style, so it does not attract fans either, and I'm one of them. All in all, Robert Altman had a dream, and woke up without telling anyone what it meant, not even for him.
