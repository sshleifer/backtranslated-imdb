I can not believe the high ratings that people have given to this movie on this site. The writing is incredibly bad with people who arrive just at the right time and reveal exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape. (Do not you hate it when that happens?). And the acting is so, so bad, that you can have a splinter in your eye of the whole landscape that is being chewed. <br /> <br /> A nut holds her hostage, children are outside the open screen, so she moans. for help instead of screaming when just a moment ago he was brave enough to break windows and yell at these same children. <br /> <br /> She is finally free and alone in the house. Your opportunity to ask for help, then, what does she do? He wanders around the house and goes to bed. She is in the basement, locked up. So what does she do? Take a little nap. Come on! Most of the movie is the crazy one who walks away and finds her sitting there dozing when he wakes her up. Four times! What? If the writer is too bored to write a real plot, why should we pay attention? I think the key here is that it was originally a game for the radio, so they were filled with the heroine just sitting instead of pretending to be screen writers and writing any action. <br /> <br /> And the end It's horrible. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is completely implausible, it is horribly written and it is almost comical. Be careful with this movie at all costs!
