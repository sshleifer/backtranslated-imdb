You're Dead is an unspeakably horrible attempt at a British gangster movie. It does not have a single original idea, since it is an atrocious copy of several elements of Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. The acting and the dialogue are absolutely unbearable, the plot is ridiculous and completely predictable in spite of the constant attempts of turns of plot, and it contains nothing more than common characters and one-dimensional clich√©s. He has some good actors, but they are out of shape, and they can not do anything with the terrible material they are working with. It is an absolute torture to sit through this nonsense.
