While this is horribly outdated, I MUST insist ... PLEASE DO NOT REJECT! Frankly, it will not help, since there is nothing that can be added or changed, at the same time, to improve this cinematographically. <br /> <br /> The novel on which it is based, was atmospheric, well-written, truly spooky work, but in the film, it simply does not translate. Most of King's written masterpieces do not translate into a movie. I'm not sure why this is so, but when you see this work, if you see it, you're likely to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> The book? It is wonderful. It is not a masterpiece, but it is more than entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie? Do something more You can thank me later. <br /> <br /> Rate a 3.1 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
