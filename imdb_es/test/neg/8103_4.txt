"Black Dragons" is a second World War II propaganda film popular at that time. It's not as bad as some would make you believe. <br /> <br /> A secret meeting organized by the respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke) is interrupted by a mysterious stranger named Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Soon after, the participants in the meeting begin to appear murdered, placing their bodies on the steps of the Japanese Embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspicious. Federal agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders' niece, Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay), who tries to help him. The reasons behind Colomb's actions are not explained until the last roll. Until everything is explained at the end, the story is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, which at the time had been reduced to appearing in a series of low-budget rapids, is pretty good in this case. He is not allowed to act as much as he usually did and the credit for this has to go to director William Nigh. The character of Lugosi slips through the shadows and remembers his Dracula even to the point of the close-ups of his piercing eyes. <br /> <br /> Clayton Moore, a one-dimensional actor at best, would become the Lone Ranger on television. some years. Joan Barclay is a good heroine. <br /> <br /> Although a bit outdated now, "Black Dragons" is not a bad way to spend an hour.
