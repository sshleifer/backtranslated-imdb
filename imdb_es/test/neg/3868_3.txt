The seven collaborations between the director Joseph "von" Sternberg and the star Marlene Dietrich were so different in appearance and tone, and so different from what was happening at that time, they almost seem to be a subgenre of their own. Like any genre, they have their masterpieces, as well as their absolute turkeys. It's time to send the blonde Venus to the farm. <br /> <br /> After the seductive seductive successes of The Blue Angel, Morocco and Shanghai Express, in which Miss Dietrich established her screen image as a cabaret-singer-prostitute, someone at Paramount decided it was time to that Marlene will play a mother. There is nothing wrong with that in itself; As an actress, she lived up to it. It's just that nothing else about the format has changed. It's like the blue angel plus a child. Quite well, the story of a woman dragging her son along in his sordid adventures is a solid premise for a tragic drama, but that is not how it is played. Dietrich's journey is played as a kind of adventure, using his wit and accomplices to stay ahead of the law. This is not a blatant example of pre-code libertarianism? It is just strangely unpleasant. <br /> <br /> While we can accept that Marlene is an affectionate mom, there is no way we can buy Sternberg as the director of warmth and commotion. Despite being one of the few images for which he also obtained a writing credit, Sternberg simply can not get the arc of the story. The emotional reward of the film is supposed to be the final reunion of the family, but even at the beginning this is not established as something worth returning. As usual, Sternberg's interiors are dressed and shot so that they look like brothels or crazy fools. The Faradays house is actually a pretty creepy and dirty environment, and it's a wonder that little Johnny did not wet the bed and ask to sleep with the light on. <br /> <br /> But as everyone who knows her will know The goal of an image of Dietrich / Sternberg is to make Dietrich look fabulous, and in this sense, at least Blonde Venus is a success. Marlene is introduced emerging from a forest pool in a bright and bright foreground, and even when she is reduced to rags, the camera still loves her. The same can not be said of the rest of the cast, whom Sternberg tended to see as moving stage pieces. The normally sympathetic Herbert Marshall is reduced here to a grumpy grouch lurking in the shadows. Even the soft and animated Cary Grant becomes a simple and boring bubble in the background, and it does not seem interesting enough for Dietrich to escape. <br /> <br /> The only highlights in Blonde Venus are the routines of Marlene's song and dance. , especially the famous Hot Voodoo number where he parodies his own personality of surrealist scenario emerging from a gorilla suit. But even these feel as if they have been cut and glued to a different movie. Sternberg fans can consider it another masterpiece, as they usually do, but for the average attacker it is a big disappointment. The audiences of the time were not left behind as they had their previous successes, and this announced the beginning of the end for Marlene's apogee. A year later there would be a new queen in Paramount ?? Mae West.
