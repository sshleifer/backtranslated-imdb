I was very disappointed in this movie. Mrs. English, who says that she is a fan of the original film, seems to have taken a great artistic work and transformed it into a "ho-hum" of flat lines in which the production of babies has come a long way. I tried to like Meg Ryan's Mary Haines, but she was just bored. She did not seem to feel anything about the matter of her husband. There was no emotional struggle, no deep pain. In the original film of 1939, Norma Shearer, Mary Haines felt betrayed, shocked, vulnerable, confused and angry. The production of 2008 was more about a false theme of brotherhood, (Actually my wife's words) and it did not make you shed a tear or even laugh. The only performances worthy of mention are those of Debra Messing and Bette Midler. (I wanted more of Bette). There really was no protagonist in this movie. The character of Sylvia Fowler had too many secondary themes. And Crystal Allen did not have fire. The new version of the department store meeting with Annette Benning and Miss MÃ©ndez was Luke warm. Also the pace was slow too. Obviously, the 1939 version needed to be updated, but this was not the correct one. The reason why the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with "man" problems. A subject by the way that is not outdated. The magic of the original movie was that the film dealt with both sexes, whereas you never saw men.
