One would make you believe that this game is about a man obsessed with a number. And sure, it's an interesting topic: can a person be so obsessed with something marginal as a simple number that completely loses contact with reality and becomes irrational and paranoid? <br /> <br /> Well, maybe someone makes a movie about that sometime. Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with the above, no matter what the trailers (or even the movie itself) want you to believe. I'd like to say that this number is just a MacGuffin, but it's not even that. Meaningless. A trick. A hook for a confident audience. <br /> <br /> What is the movie about? A dog hunter (Carrey) who becomes obsessed with a crime book noir corny because he feels that somehow reflects his own life. There. Sure, the character in the book, Detective Fingerling (sigh), is (for some reason) obsessed with the number 23, and Carrey himself becomes obsessed and begins to see the number everywhere ... but it's just a quilt and it's totally irrelevant to the story. In fact, you can delete the 23 references and make the main characters obsess over the cheese or something and you'll have exactly the same story. It is painfully obvious that all the "23" things were written in waay after the story had been finished, rejected and sent to "rewrite." <br /> <br /> Which would be fine .. I guess ... if the movie was not boring, boring, boring Half of the movie is narrated, for chrissakes. You're not watching the movie, you're listening to Jim Carrey telling the movie. Approximately a quarter in Carrey begins to read the book, and from that moment to the end horribly clich√©, we are forced to see real-life scenes from the life of the dog hunter (where nothing happens) interspersed with the narrated artistic book noir-ish "" scenes that will leave you laughing or simply depressed. It is like the "city of sin" of a poor man with all the violence cut off, narrated by Carrey and shown in slow motion. Ugh. <br /> <br /> This is a simple case of a C movie script that was somehow filmed with an A movie cast ... probably due to the "number 23" hook that I think sounded like Enough interesting in the paper to guarantee the Hollywood premium treatment. However, as, as I said, the film is about the number 23 as well as about the production of cheese in Switzerland, one can not feel more than cheated. <br /> <br /> I give "Fingerling - the movie" 3 out of 10, because I think it did not insult my intelligence as much as it did "Forsaken" or made me downright suicidal like "Battlefield Earth" did and the background of the scale must be reserved for such abominations. But do not fear, this is still a pretty bad movie.
