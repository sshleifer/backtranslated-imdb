If you are looking for a cinematographic masterpiece, this is not all. If you are looking for one of those horrible movies that are so horrible that they really are good, then this may be for you. There are so many unintentional laughs in this movie, that it could almost be considered a comedy. Let's start with the initial titles, which say "Jack-O," and then add the word "Lantern," as if the viewer could not discover that the movie was about a pumpkin with the giant pumpkin on the cover. And in the opening scene of the film. After that, the movie goes in about 20 different directions, none of which makes much sense. Jack-o is everywhere, he's in people's houses, in the woods, and yet he never seems to do much for anything. He does some murders, but the long accumulation of those murders is so badly acted and constructed that you almost wish Jack-o would bring out his rage against you, the spectator. Apart from that, the plot consists of a bad performance, gratuitous nudity and a ridiculous plot. The performance in this movie is among the worst I've seen in my more than 35 years of watching movies. The boy who is the protagonist of the film (the director's son) has as much emotion as a corpse, and almost all other actors / actresses are just as bad for many reasons (especially the lady with big eyes and bigger eyes). what the dishes). But, having said all this, if you take it for what it is (it's a pile of smoking dung) then you'll get some laughs from this movie. What I also found funny is that the creators of the DVD considered it appropriate to release a "10th Anniversary Version" of this movie (as if the original was not good enough). And someone really had the idea to make a mini movie "behind the scenes" that is also included in the tenth anniversary edition (I'm not sure why) ....... I give this 3 crushed pumpkins. 10 ...
