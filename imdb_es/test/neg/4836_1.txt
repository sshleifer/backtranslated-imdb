and it's only January, I'm still sure about it! <br /> <br /> By far, this is one of the worst Swedish films I've seen and, to be honest, Swedish films are not that good in general. It has been claimed that it is "original" and maybe it can be considered for people who have never seen an English-speaking film, for us who have been in the cinema for the last 10 years, I can not help but feel like Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein has been sitting a weekend reviewing the most successful films of recent years and tried to squeeze everything into a single Swedish package. What can I say, the result can be ... poor. First, the story is weak to begin with, even worse when it is not just a bad story, it is a desire to combine very poor stories: first, a failed attempt to do the Swedish action to the Matrix and then combine it with a very bad moral history And if you thought it could not be worse, you would notice all the "great things" that have been thrown there for no reason at all, rather than in a bad way, trying to prove that Sweden can also make Hollywood movies, that No We can not even try to do it. For example, the main plot is tried to deepen by allowing young people to play a computer game called Storm that has absolutely nothing whatsoever with the story or, for example, how there is an Internet side about "Storm", while suddenly they are only the main characters. Awareness: I really do not think that neither Stein nor Mårlind can see a point with three quarters of the film, more than just trying to boast of the poor additional effects. For the actors, I must admit that Eric Ericson does a pretty good job, except that he does the same work throughout the film, even when Storm tries to be a film about DD's personal development, it does not change anything in his acting. Jonas Karlsson, to be honest, I thought he was a well respected actor, but judging by Storm ... he really just has to be ashamed of this movie, his character and his scar. Finally, Eva Röse is beyond criticism, both for her character and for her performance. The only reason why Storm succeeds in not getting a 1/10 is for Eric Ericson and, what can I say, at least he tries.
