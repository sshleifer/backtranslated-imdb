I really wanted to like this movie, however, after a few fun opening minutes, I could barely smile. I agree that there was no chemistry between the two drivers and the other characters were surrounded by clich√©s. The script completely squandered the talents of Bud Tingwell and Kim Gyngell. <br /> <br /> However, it must be said that there was a lot of laughter around me and even a bit of applause at the end. Maybe I just could not relate enough. I'm glad I went on cheap tickets.
