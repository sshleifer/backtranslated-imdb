As an early depiction of the turmoil of the 1960s that followed, Diane Arbus (Nicole Kidman) can be excused as an early flower girl. The film itself does not deserve such latitude. The lack of character development, motivation and justification of the character's behavior make the film very disappointing. I sat looking and waiting for an explanation of the strange actions only to discover that Shainberg was allowing me to take a look at a story that must have been a joke. The fact that the few facts presented did not coincide much with the life of Diane Arbus did not help clarify things either. <br /> <br /> The worn Art Direction in Diane's 'normal' life was very well contrasted with the bright colors in her 'Awakening' life with Lionel. And the trapdoor ladder was a good demonstration of Diane's attempt to inject her new life into her current family (however, I do not see how that trapdoor on the ceiling of her dining room could connect directly to Lionel's apartment, which was two flights) of the stairs upwards from hers). <br /> <br /> Perhaps my analysis is a bit too literal in the search for some character development and understanding of the relationship that goes beyond a sentence or a comment. I would also have liked to see at least one of Diane's photos. I will not wait for the sequel.
