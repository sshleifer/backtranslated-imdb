Do all fake films require pure stupidity and lack of ANY kind of intelligence for humor? Is there already only one parody movie really FUNNY? All I see are zero-quality films that look like a couple of drugged high school students who got bored one day with a video camera. These movies are not funny, they are not smart, they are not entertaining, they are useless in every possible way. <br /> <br /> The Comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its horrible level of trash. For not calling himself "Sports Movie". Although it is the same. There are some different writers for these films, the Wayans did some, Freidberg and Seltzer did others, and I'm sure there's another pair. I can not even tell the difference in direction or humor to be honest, it seems that the same people wrote and directed them. I can not say if the Comebacks were made by the people who made Scary Movie or the guys who made Epic Movie, or someone else, are the same jokes of everyone else. <br /> <br /> If you have ANY fragment of flavor or value for humor, do not watch this movie. If you have self-esteem, do not bother to see it. If you have ANY respect for making movies, do not even consider seeing it. Do not see it in an abandoned and abandoned theater that can still take it, do not rent it, do not ask it on Netflix or Pay-Per-View, do not redboxee it and do not even look it's free in OD. Avoid it like the plague. <br /> <br /> The only possible reasons I can see to watch this movie are the following. <br /> <br /> A. Masochism. If you like to torture yourself, there are very few better ways. B. See a good example of why to avoid ANYTHING that says "Fox Atomic". C. You are being paid a considerably high amount of cash. <br /> <br /> I would not really see all this if someone offered me $ 100 to do it. It's just a mental and mental torment that collapses. <br /> <br /> It's better that you look at Zohan.
