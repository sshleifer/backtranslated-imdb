I'm still trying to figure out what the purpose of this movie was: 1) Whether it's to show how stupid, disorganized, unprofessional and arrogant the police are (I could probably add several adjectives here, but I think my point of view is clear). 2) Either to show how a twisted mind thief who does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos. 3) Should I show if a persistent detective will solve a case by simply asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again until the criminal responds? 4) Or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called MOVIE? This was one of those movies that, somehow, did not disappoint me. From the first 10 minutes, I realized that this movie will not be nominated for the best film award, and surprisingly, right? This was consistent all the time. It was stupid enough to make it worth waiting to see how stupidly it will continue and end. And I was not disappointed there either. <br /> <br /> Was it a full waist of time? YES. What is your question? WHY DO I LOOK AT EVERYTHING? Well, I was trying to fall asleep, and I thought this was a great candidate for that, but unfortunately, did I drink a lot of coffee before that?
