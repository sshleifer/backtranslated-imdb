Horrible, frightening, frightening ... <br /> <br /> I loved the original movie. It was fun, charming and had a heart ... this scrap piece DOES NOT have ANY of those things. <br /> <br /> Jokes reused from the original movie, stupid frames, bad animation, different voices (with the exception of Kronk and Yzma) that do not sound ANYTHING like the original ones (especially Pacha ... * shudder *) . <br /> <br /> The characters are out of style, the animation is flat and boring, it's just a bad job everywhere. <br /> <br /> And why is Kuzco an idiot again? I thought it had been reformed ... but since when are these TV effects loyal to the * original eye rolls *. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can exchange for this ... at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
