Sometimes the full moon makes entertaining movies. This is not one of them. The full moon is like a low profile troma. His films are not so violent or extravagant, but usually they have no talent. The acting in this movie is not terrible, but the script is pretty bad, and in general it's pretty boring and does not even contain nudity (like many Full Moon movies) to redeem them. Skip this, and go rent "Head of family".
