Three young university students, Simona (Iva Krajnc), Alja (Tanja Potocnik) and Zana (Pia Zemljic), go on an adventure on the Kolpa River, dividing their Slovenia from neighboring Croatia, in this 2002 Slovenian film by Maya Weiss. What could have been a version of Eastern Europe of the well-known and exciting "Deliverance" of 1972 was, for me, totally boring with representations of flat characters who denied the sympathetic identification with the characters. <br /> <br /> Alja and Zana are not convincing as students, although Alja expresses the desire to be a writer, and both use what I thought was an excessively bad language. Alja is bored with her boyfriend and seems to be wandering in life. Zana, even less erudite, is an adventure seeker who absorbs herself and is attracted to other women. I felt some sympathy for the relatively innocent Simona, conservative and starry-eyed. The very idea of ​​these three traveling together simply does not work for me. The disdain that Zana and Alja show towards Simona does not make any sense: why would they choose her as a traveling companion to begin with, since they must surely know their attitude and attitudes? <br /> <br /> The three begin a carefree journey down the river in two canoes, undeterred by a news of the disappearance of a woman along the river. Things get darker with the mysterious, sometimes real and sometimes mind-blowing appearance of a rabidly conservative fisherman politician (Jonas Znidarsic). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the scenes along the river and the small villages that the trio visited. . It may be due to a lack of cultural understanding, but the movie did not move me in any other way. I was surprised to see that the film has won some awards.
