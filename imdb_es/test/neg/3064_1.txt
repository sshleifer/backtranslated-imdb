Like Michigander, I got jokes from Michigan. Very funny: make fun of Pontiac, Ann Arbor, all those poor neighborhoods of Detroit. Yes, yes, I've heard these jokes a million times. I'll give you credit for accurately representing Grosse Pointe's limp. There could not be more white. Did you hear those lovely nasal accents from Michigan? Where girls talk so fast you can not understand a word that comes out of your mouth (nose) ...? As much as I love Michigan, I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> I have never met a Grosse Pointe person that I liked. Listen to that horrible live band and that annoying and horrible background music! What is that? One of the Homeboy band from Gross Pointe? Probably. Wow, what a great "Detroit scene" you have there. It's funny how the people of Grosse Pointe always say they're from Detroit. They are so white and rich, they wish they had something to complain about. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a hit. All the way, from the funny lame about the girls in thongs to the terrible development of the character. Oh wait a minute, do you mean that the whole basis of a character is that he often says the word f? What a deep personality. Great job, Grosse Pointers! And I love all the sexist jargon, like the way the narrator calls the first girl who dies, that we never hear "naive b * tch". That is really lovely. <br /> <br /> And those homemade masks with Marilyn Manson contact lenses are really cool. And I love how it makes sense for cyclists to pass and kill people. And how did your master narrator play such an obvious role in the movie ...? The main boyfriend was so bored that I fell asleep watching him. The three idiotic guys (or were they two or four? How can I know, they all look and act the same way!) They were desperately trying to make me laugh, but Beavis and Butthead already got my laugh out of humor in 1994. And What about gay jokes? No wonder this movie has been wrong: everyone involved should have some minor problems with their masculinity, huh, guys? <br /> <br /> The only savior of this movie was the main girl. Despite what other people have said here, she was actually a good actress. The teenage girls talk as she talked. They really act like she acted. His performance was very natural and credible. I really thought I was an employee of the Grosse Pointe convenience store. .. maybe she is! And yes, she had big tits, most of the women here have. Michigan is the fattest state in the union, you know. In all aspects. <br /> <br /> So, those of you who think that this is a representation of Detroit, are not. They are the suburbs of Detroit. They are very white and full of adolescent anguish without direction. Limp Bizkut, ICP (yes, ICP is from one of our suburbs) and baggy khaki pants for $ 75 all the way! Lick rich children who are angry because they have a lot of money and nothing to complain about. And they also make bad movies. <br /> <br />
