In the animated series: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel who was completely separated from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, caustic, confident, sarcastic, lethal, indomitable, ambiguous at the same time. The original Aeon had layers on layers of depth. She almost never allowed her personal emotions to show. The original plot was delightfully ambiguous and stimulating. You could never tell what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist, while Trevor was a radical idealist, because of this they could never have a semblance of stable relationship. <br /> <br /> In the film: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux works for Los monicanos and his political and personal motives are very clear. She was beautiful, affectionate, vulnerable, easily domesticated, emotional and very predictable. The Aeon in the film had a depth layer at most. The plot was obvious and artificial. Everything is completely designed for you from the beginning. Virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophies. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides. <br /> <br /> The movie was a horrible disappointment to me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of ​​one of my favorite animated characters of all time, they took out all the depth and personality and filled it with Hollywood clichés. The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not give this movie a "1" is because the images were incredible. It was great to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye made with CGI.
