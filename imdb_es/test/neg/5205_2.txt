I think this was supposed to be shocking or something ... All I can say is that ... POOR GOAT! This movie is so badly made that the parts that "should" shake and rebel seem ridiculous. The characters are so lame and 2 ... wait ... 1 dimensional, that I applauded every sick death ... all but that POOR GOAT. <br /> <br />
