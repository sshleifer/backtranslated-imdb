I am a collector of films starring Ms. Weaver, so I bought this just for her participation. I find it really strange that his early career is full of so many horrible movies. She started with an incredible promise in Alien, but then she had a lot of bombs. These bombs include this movie, Deal of the Century, One Woman or Two and Half Moon Street. He also appeared in The Year Of Living Dangerously, which was not a bomb, but his performance was less than remarkable. In the time between Alien and its 1986 sequel, Aliens, the only movie that made it worthwhile was Ghostbusters. Before the release of Aliens, I'm sure everyone thought this woman was dating. Fortunately, she was not. <br /> <br /> However, back in Eyewitness, the movie is boring. Do not create any suspense. William Hurt looks like a cardboard stand, and the atmosphere is just to dry. Sigourney is decent, but there's nothing worth remembering. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if necessary, but do not go in with the expectations of a decent movie. Watch better movies with these two stars as Accidental Tourist and Working Girl.
