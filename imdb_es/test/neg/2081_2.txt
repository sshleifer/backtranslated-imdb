Paul Mazursky fails in this movie. The writing, the direction, the casting and the performance (with the exception of Victorio Gassman) are out of place. I remember that the criticisms of more than 20 years ago were mediocre, but I thought it would still be worth seeing them. With notables such as Susan Sarandon, Raul Julia (who plays in most of his scenes) and John Cassavetes, understandably expected much more. The music chosen for the film is jarring, the cuts between New York and Greece are confusing, and the overall rhythm leaves much to be desired. Why Paul Mazursky felt the need to update this story, or add his touch, is disconcerting: this account of Prospero and his daughter has very little importance in the work and does not add much more. The play is not one of the best of Shakespeare anyway, and to eliminate it even more does not seem like a good decision. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend in this movie.
