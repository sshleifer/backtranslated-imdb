It is not surprising that so many young people have an attention deficit disorder. It seems that the theatrical (dance) productions these days have to do with the number of cameras and camera angles that a director / editor can squeeze into a 1-hour show. Is there a special Emmy category for this feat? Try to count them sometimes to do something different to do with this, otherwise, a completely unquestionable show. <br /> <br /> I tried to distinguish at least some faces from some of the other dancers in the production. That was impossible. They did not seem to have any faces, they just looked fuzzy, it was just Michael Flatley's face, Michael Flatley's bare chest (good shine!), Michael Flatley's feet and that patented image of Flatley over his shoulder, coming to repeat the infinite squared As I was an executive producer of this cut and paste job, I suppose that was to be expected. You do not have to wonder too much about who your target audience is. <br /> <br /> Riverdance was a much better production, since it tried to present the show almost as it can be seen from the audience, not from the runway, the lateral wings or the perspective of the nails. If I'm not mistaken, I think Sir Michael has retired. Thank God for the little blessings.
