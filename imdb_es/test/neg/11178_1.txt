The most disturbing aspect of this film is not that it is a load of nonsense (the CPUSA was never really a threat of espionage like the one in the movie). The troubling aspect is the way he launches the totally unpleasant tactics of the FBI and the Activities Committee of the United States. Secret informants, gossip turned into accusations, searches without a warrant: these are the kind of things that the criminals of the secret police, as the KGB did, and presumably, against what the good American patriots fought. However, the FBI did them and did not blink. That is the only realistic part of this movie, and they present it without any feeling of shame. Add to this the undermining of the Constitution itself, making only the Communists invoke the Bill of Rights. The film also makes small accusations that the black civil rights movement was inspired by the communists, another pack of lies. It is extremely difficult on this day to excuse such scandalous propaganda, even understanding the paranoia of the times, when one realizes how harmful it was to real people at that time.
