This unbearably boring and ungraceful movie made me think that Chaplin was the real Hitler, since only someone as evil as he could torture people with this gut. I saw this remastered film, which only made more severe the suffering inflicted by this atrocity. This film is just a pathetic and repetitive film, which instead of provoking two hours of laughter, induced two hours of suicidal impulses. After the first 10 minutes of this, I began to wish that the gas began to filter through the theater's speakers. <br /> <br /> If I could give you a zero of ten, I would gladly do it. Avoid at all costs!
