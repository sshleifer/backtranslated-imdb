Detective Burt Williams has been following the trail of Poe's infamous killer for nearly three years. His daughter Kris Williams, homicide agent for the FBI along with his partner Sean Michaels, takes charge. Burt withdrew from the case and withdrew. Over the next seven months, the "Poe Killer" continues his rage until Kris discovers that the killer uses Internet chat rooms to seduce his prey. She is registered as Annabel Lee and is quickly captured by Poe's killer. It's time for Burt to find the sadist and free his daughter before it's too late. Amateur horror movie and extremely brave without suspense and a little unpleasant blood. The acting is tremendously terrible, the characters are terribly foolish and the killer is not threatening. Still I've seen worse indie horror movies .3 out of 10.
