This movie was a complete disaster for me. There is one thing that movies must have in order to see them, and that is * a * psychological credibility of the characters ... unfortunately, this is not the case here. Most of the time, the main characters behave irrationally, and even if they have some reason for such behavior, the director does not reveal it to us. The character of Sophie Marceau is particularly irritating, taking pictures of everything throughout the entire film, when one might expect something more rational (for example, to meet with her mother in the hospital) ... and why did she get married exactly? with this guy? (no, this is not a spoiler) The plot sometimes seems to have been ripped from a telenovela, and while the performance of the actors is not bad, this does not help much. All in all, I just could not find a way to connect with this movie. However, I did not try too much after the first hour. I have never left the cinema during a movie, but this time it was the closest in my life until now.
