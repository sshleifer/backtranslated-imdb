Val Kilmer is nowhere in this movie, what luck for him! Play maybe 30 seconds of screen time and your paper is completely irrelevant. After watching the movie I could not tell you what "role" he plays in the movie! OK ... they suck you in the first hour by submerging you in dark underground tunnels. Scary movies filmed in dark underground tunnels easily absorb most people to last from the first 30 minutes to an hour. Then they will begin to wonder: "why am I seeing this?" I remember thinking how easy it must be for a director / writer to use dark underground labyrinths to make a movie. Simply film the people who roam the dark tunnels and you will have instant "suspense". But that's where this movie goes no further! We all wonder what happens in the night, but there is nothing in the dark in this movie, but more darkness. The story is even worse. Apparently, there is an underlying story in the movie that I found out about "after" watching the movie. But the film uses a dialouge so poor that it was never seen clearly during the screening. I still do not understand what the writer / director meant. Some children trapped underground by a deceived sister in Russia? Why? Are they in our time, at the same time as the characters? Are they ghosts? <br /> <br /> This was an absolutely horrible movie that led me to write my first IMDb review to warn others to avoid it.
