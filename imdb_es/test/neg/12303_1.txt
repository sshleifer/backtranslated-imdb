Shame Shame in UA / DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I was horrified. <br /> <br /> Do NOT take the children to see this movie. Humor is totally inappropriate for children, plus they will be bored and disappointed. Certainly * all * we have read Theo's wonderful children's book and we certainly have expectations ... but this is pure rubbish. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and, of course, he would never have given his "approval" in such a bold attempt to take advantage of a classic. <br /> <br /> What a pity. <br /> <br /> Spend your money in the book. If you have a copy, buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program. This movie is NOT worth seeing "for free". <br /> <br /> Stay with the book. The cartoon television version works well if you want a visual representation: save your money ... seriously. SAVE your money: it will be on the wire on Saint Patrick's Day. <br /> <br /> What a shame, what a shame!
