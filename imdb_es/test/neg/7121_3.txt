I loved the first Grudge, I saw it in an empty theater, and in all honesty, I got scared. I had never heard the unique audio of chilling sounds before, it was really exciting. <br /> <br /> The Grudge 2, however, had a couple of good jumps, but the story was really messy, and not totally believable. and everywhere, with a couple of scenes, (like a woman who pees out of fear, or another of a young woman who drinks a jug of milk and then vomits it again) that really did not make sense, and she did not . It helps to improve the creep factor of the film. During these scenes, and a couple of other people, the people in the sold audience laughed out loud. That was a good indicator to show how this film lacked emotions, chills or chills. The performance was decent, the emotions portrayed were credible, so I was proud of the actors, but the messy story and its lack of direction was something I could not avoid throughout the entire film. It bothered me more than anything, the same old arching noises, a couple of quick and unexpected scenes to make me jump, but in general, I was very disappointed.
