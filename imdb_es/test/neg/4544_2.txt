Wow! Quite boring, and they could have filmed it in black and white, it was so colorless. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a moving text that explains cryogenics and asks if God or Satan are behind it. There are some protests outside of a cryogenic laboratory. Some people rob a bank and many of the thieves and guards are shot. The father of one of the thieves (I think) makes arrangements to freeze his son. There are many jumps at the beginning, from scene to scene, introducing characters without knowing how they relate. <br /> <br /> There is a blackout, and the lightning bolts that contain the frozen people are struck by lightning, and emerge as zombies. They all wear silver mylar-like suits, and their skin is dark green and wrinkled (I have no idea why they look so bad, since being frozen does not preserve their appearance), and they have silver eyes. They go around killing people, sometimes staggering like zombies, sometimes moving like normal people. <br /> <br /> Linda Blair keeps popping up every once in a while, for what purpose I'm not really sure. I think his character works in the cryogenic laboratory, but it's not very important for the plot, and his role is very small. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with some frozen frames with text captions that tell us what happened to the characters below, which are pretty dumb.
