This remake is titled "That Darn Cat", but D.C. the cat is more a secondary activity than the main character. Patti Randall did not like anything in this new version either. It reminded me of one of those high school goth idiots you read about who have been angry since the day they were born, so one day they ended up opening fire on the rest of the school. The federal police officer, Kelso was fine, but not as good as the original. I guess Disney was trying to turn Christina Ricci and Doug Doug (or whatever the ridiculous name it is) into stars, but they do not hold a candle for Hayley Mills and Dean Jones in the original. I am an animal lover and a cat lover, and I do not blame D.C. that the remake is much lower than the original movie. After all, they almost eliminate him from the whole movie. In short, a very poor remake.
