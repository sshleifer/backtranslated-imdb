The chupacabra, according to this mockumentary, is a mysterious creature <br /> <br /> that has been killing and eating Hispanic goats in America <br /> <br /> for years throughout America. One has crossed the border into <br /> <br /> South Texas, and an intrepid and sympathetic cryptozoologist (no, I did not invent that word) went to an isolated ranch to find one. . Your uncle <br /> <br /> was killed by the creature, and there are some grainy video images of the monster <br /> <br />. She takes a black guy with a gun and two cameramen <br /> <br /> (for an easy-to-edit cover), and they go to hunt chupacabras <br /> <br />. Ten minutes into the movie, they find it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film has the documentary team attacked by the bloodthirsty monster and the forced dialogue. At one point <br /> <br />, the team encounters a couple of sorceresses who take them <br /> <br /> to the chupacabra nest ... for $ 100. If only the FBI knew how to < br /> <br /> cheap Tex-Mex witches could be bought as informants. The entire decades of reports of mythical beasts could be clarified with a blank check <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> In the end, after the bloody deaths of the characters, do not give him a <br /> <br /> goat patoot, a chupacabra is captured, killed and <br /> <br / > autopsied. The only point of the autopsy scene is to highlight the makeup department's efforts in such a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> The film was shot on video, like "BWP", however the cameraman's characters <br /> <br /> never recharge their tapes or recharge their camera batteries <br /> < br />. The main actress here is horrible. The beauty of the "BWP" average of <br /> <br /> was its use of improvisation during production. <br /> <br /> Here, all the lines are written, and are delivered poorly <br /> <br /> Rehearsed Christmas essay. <br /> <br /> The movie is also tinged with racism. The only African-American <br /> <br /> here is a high-powered gun nut. At one point, when the crew breaks into an abandoned house, they find a trio of illegal immigrants who <br /> <br /> comically ask if they are from the INS. Chortle, chortle. <br /> <br /> The monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit, and nothing else. For <br /> <br /> such a clumsy and uncomfortable beast, it is able to sneak in <br /> <br /> the cast quite silently, whether they have been locked in an idiot way <br /> < br />. in a giant cage like bait, or it seems you can not start your <br /> <br /> only vehicle. <br /> <br /> The gore is frightening, but when it is surrounded by this kind of <br /> <br /> stupidity, it loses all its effectiveness. I do not know if this was filmed before or after "BWP", but I can honestly say that this is the worst movie ever made in South Texas about a mythical beast. . Pray <br /> <br /> there is no sequel, I will start a campaign to send letters to <br /> <br /> Troma. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for its physical capacity, strong violence, violence with firearms, strong <br /> <br /> blood and blasphemy. <br /> <br />
