The central themes at play (God & Satan / Good & Evil) can be and should be tremendously convincing (as demonstrated by thousands of works of art / music / literature / cinema). The end of days, unfortunately, is nothing more than a 2D dimensional caricature. Byrne's acting ability is so evident that it contrasts with Arnold's lack of corresponding skill and is underlined by a plot full of nothing but stereotypes. The character of Gabriel Byrne and his subsequent interaction with his wife? Girlfriend? It is both erotic charged and repellent, modernizing vampire themes, the seductive power of evil.
