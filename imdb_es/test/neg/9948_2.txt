Two little girls make friendship. One tries to convince the other that she is a witch. The other is a pushover that bends to the will of the witch. Again and again in the film it is prolonged with the meaningless interaction between the two girls, with many dramatic cuts, as they pose "shocking" questions. You know, little, sweet kids should not ask, like, "How do you make a deal with the devil?" Oooh ... spooky. <br /> <br /> In the end, the push is tired of being controlled by his witch friend. Her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end. But when the time comes, you will not mind in the least. <br /> <br /> I imagine that this film may have been terrifying for a very religious Mexican filmmaker of the 60s, but it does not even hold up a charming relic. It simply goes on. It's boring. It's useless You can not see it. <br /> <br /> There are many here who have many good things to say about it, based on their knowledge of the other works of the director and, of course, that common denominator that everyone says about meaningless movies: "Ah! , the cinematography is wonderful! " Those reviewers probably have a point. But for those who found this movie without prior knowledge, who do not care about their "photography", their "atmosphere" or their ... whatever else they have, for these viewers, then, who just want a * good * movie that will entertain you for an hour and a half, do yourself a favor, friends: <br /> <br /> Saltala.
