In this quagmire of mediocrity? You are much better than this. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, Frostbite is worth nothing. Bad performance (and I use that term lightly), minimalist "plot", sophisticated humor and snowboard without shine. There is not even a sample of feminine neatness sufficient to arouse the interest of socially inept males, but of red blood. <br /> <br /> Top Gun had spectacular flight sequences to watch. Thunder days had an exciting racing action. Even Point Break had parachuting scenes under his belt. Freezing does not have any of these. It's not worth your time, my time, the time of Traci Lords, the time of Carmen Nicole, nor the time of anyone involved with this destruction of celluloid that would have been perfectly usable in something worthwhile if it had not been wasted in this forage for the recycling center. . <br /> <br /> The world will be a better place when we forget that Freezing has existed.
