There are three main problems with the movie. Or rather, there are three reasons why not even one contestant deserves more serious consideration. <br /> <br /> First of all, and this was always going to be true, it's not as good as books. However, at least we could have expected to reflect something of Sapkowski's wit or depth. <br /> <br /> Second, we have the production. Fantasy movies are, in my opinion, the most difficult to produce well. Everything, from the accessories to the costumes, the stage, the acrobatics and (especially) the CGI, is deficient. <br /> <br /> Finally, and this is very subjective, I just can not take acting seriously. I was not brought up in Poland, so I really can not judge, maybe my lack of familiarity with Polish films. Anyway, the lines seem to be delivered in a very amateurish way ... The casting could also be better. <br /> <br /> In short, the only possible redeeming feature of this film is the rest of the plot that shines through: no diamond ring on a rotten corpse is any different. <br /> <br /> On a separate note I heard that the books are coming out in English. I have not seen them yet, but I can not imagine how one could begin to translate them ... I would ask the Anglophone reader to keep this in mind when judging the book.
