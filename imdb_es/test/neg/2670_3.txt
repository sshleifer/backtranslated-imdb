Avoid this one! It is a terrible movie. And what if it is very exciting? All that is are senseless murders. And all with the curse of Thorn and Michael, that was the worst they could do with the series! Why could not they leave Michael's story a mystery? It's supposed to be the Boogeyman, not part of a stupid cult! Ugh! Thank God for Halloween H20, which eliminated Halloween 3-6! Everyone stunk! But anyway, if you watch this movie, do not expect more than senseless and gore murders.
