After watching the film, I feel that the father and the mother are reasonable people, although they are not quite perfect. On the contrary, I do not like the author, and his two sisters. <br /> <br /> Is a person's diary a precise portrait of herself? No. Most of the time, people only write problems in their diary because they want to solve the problem. So a diary is always a more negative side of a person. In this film, the author judges the life of his mother according to his diary. It is not a wise choice. <br /> <br /> The author's older sister is very ugly, external and internal. First, she said that her father's second marriage is "not fair" to her mother. Then, she said that she does not love her mother. So, she does not love father as much as mother. I doubt she loves anyone in the world. His face is so ugly, just a reflection of his heart. Throughout the film, I feel that the author and his sisters lack love and respect towards their parents. However, I feel that parents are mothers, they are very affectionate with their children, even the author tries to portray them as cold and deceitful people.
