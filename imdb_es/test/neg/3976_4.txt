Actually, the movie was not SO bad, especially in regards to the plot, but the muscular (and hairy!) Actor who chose for the lead role was a bit clumsy in the acting department. I would have chosen someone else. The idea of ​​"going to the United States" was very clever, and the main character who questioned everything he had known made him quite friendly, but not so much when there is a sticky stain for a main actor. <br /> <br /> The plot was interesting. It raises the question of how the issue of cloning will be handled in the future. Certainly, cloning would not be allowed for the purposes of the film, but it remains a valid argument even for today. The clones are still people ... right? <br /> <br /> The film was not especially special, but it is still much better than some of the cheeses launched during the 70s. Let's not forget the "invasion of giant spiders". I give it a 4, since it FULLY does not suck, but the MST3K version makes this movie a 10. (I still like Dr. Super Mario!) You will like this movie, but it will not be your favorite.
