I am one of those people who respect all the filmmakers who have achieved, to every film I see, I generally respect (although I admit that I select carefully) and I stand for what it is. No longer. This is really one of the worst scripts I've seen produced as a movie ... so much that I felt compelled to warn others about this. The dialogue was really incredible, the main protagonist was about the last person that I would like to know more. A scene in which an old friend of the school "says as it is" made me laugh only because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtext of a plot already concluded. The direction is simplistic at best and, at worst, in the realization of films by numbers Compare this film with the atmospheric majesty of a movie like Five Easy Pieces is a parody.
