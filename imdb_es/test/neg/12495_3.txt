CyberTracker takes place in Los Angeles in the near future, where bodyguard Eric Phillips (co-producer Don 'The Dragon' Wilson) saves Sen. Robert Dilly (John Aprea) from an assassination attempt on a group known as UHR, the Union of Humans. Rights, who are angry with Dilly for leading the Computerized Judicial System in which robots called CyberTrackers are sent to determine and impart justice to the perpetrators. Anyway, Eric saves Dilly, who is very impressed and decides to see if he can trust Eric in his somber activities as the cold-blooded murder of a traitor, being the standout guy that is Eric. He is not impressed when Dilly kills a woman. You are asked to keep it quiet. Eric escapes and prepares to take down Dilly, however, Dilly has many powerful friends and uses his influence to frame Eric and send his CyberTrackers in search of him ... <br /> <br /> Co-produced and directed by Richard Pepin I think movies like CyberTracker give movies a bad name, I did not like it very much. Jacobsen Hart's script is quite predictable, does not excite, steals most of his ideas and themes from other better science fiction movies and the mix of martial arts action and science fiction does not fit so well. There are some fights, some car chases and a couple of shots, but everything is quite insipid and forgettable. The film lacks imagination considering that the film is set in the future and deals with robots, technology and the way in which society is managed and its judicial system in particular. Speaking of which the fantastic Robocop (1987) brilliantly mixed its violent action and its intelligent social comment, but CyberTracker does not even try to make any relevant social statement or tries to represent a significant moral message about the application of the law, the script basically uses The concept for robots and shots that Robocop also did, but also managed to include a good story. There's very little in CyberTracker that I can say was entertaining and that's what movies are about, right? <br /> <br /> Director Pepin is fine, but nothing stands out, everything is quite forgettable and it is not particularly exciting. The elements of science fiction are nothing more than the robot side of things and, in general, the film does not seem so futuristic. The action scenes are fine, there are some cars that explode and some shots, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> Technically, CyberTracker is average, for a movie that is supposedly set in the future, it looks old-fashioned and the special effects are poor. The performance was bad. I wonder if Don 'The Dragon' Wilson signed checks with that name. <br /> <br /> CyberTracker was a waste of time, there is nothing original or exciting, and the action can be forgotten instantly. Poor and that is all there is to say, it is not recommended.
