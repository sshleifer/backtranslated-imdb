Hopper has never been worse as if he felt that this movie only deserves a grade B performance and offers a very good one. Outside of Madsen and Hopper, the acting is horrible; You've seen better at your local high school. The sound and, sometimes, the editing and the camera shots are of low-end B-movies. The scene with the furtively looking tom is one of the best free nudity scenes I've seen in my life (it does not even come close to the movie). The script was probably a great summary of 10 pages, but when it comes to a long film there are more holes than the corpses left by Madsen. I have to say that Hopper, dressed in a nice Hummer suit, made me laugh out loud, but I do not think that was the intention. Yes, there is a bit of style, and Hopper can always attract my interest. However, the interesting concept of the plot is never worth it and you are left wondering why you wasted your time watching this.
