"Kicked in the Head" has to do with the character of Corrigan, a man in his twenties in a quest to find himself, and his involvement with a handful of extravagant characters. This thin and ambiguous story, written by Corrigan, has a makeup feel and a script that smells like an uninspired low-budget indie. Despite that and some annoying interjections of the Hindenburg scene, the film has an extravagant and quirky charm that may be attractive, in some way, to people with a similar sense of humor. Not for everyone, not for most, but maybe fun for some. (D +)
