I really wanted to see this movie and, therefore, I felt extremely disappointed when I found it completely and completely wasted. The direction of Akerman is both heavy and clich√© (how much more cliched can you get than Paris at night?). The male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for his renown to the self-portraits laden with anguish by Egon Schiele. However, the themes of jealousy and betrayal that should have been the main focus of a film of this type remain virtually unexplored. What remains is a turgid melodrama that takes an age to start and even more to finish. The only advantage with this type of film is that it makes you realize how good Goddard and Truffaut really are.
