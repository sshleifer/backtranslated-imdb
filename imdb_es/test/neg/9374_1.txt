After some pretty good Dutch action movies, like Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Verhage wants to make a film about the life of a Dutch mobster. Well, mobster is a great word for Klaas Bruinsma. He is not a true international player like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He is just a bassist from Amsterdam who made some money selling soft drugs. Things often explode in the Netherlands, and this movie is just another example. But even then, the movie could be very good if the story was well told. Now there are great jumps in time: one day KLaas is just a normal junkie, the next hit seems to be a great player in the drug scene. No one knows how that is possible (except for those who read the book). The acting is really bad, the non-Dutch spectators see one of the worst actresses in the Netherlands: Chantal Janzen. When you think she finally gets naked, then you're seeing a position in the model. Then: bad acting + bad editing + trash story = De Dominee. <br /> <br /> Please, do not see it, even if other people say it is good, because it is not. I warned you
