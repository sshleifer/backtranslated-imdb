Sometimes, when I listen to a cast of the A list, they will get together for 2 hours in a movie, I hope, and I pray that it will be good, not for the sake of my 10 dollars or 2 hours, but for the good of these actors. professional careers In the case of "Be Cool", everything was wasted. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, John Travolta (also known as Chili Palmer) and a music executive played by James Woods drive in a car talking about movie sequels, and as most are not good. If it seems that happened, the fact that this scene was filmed in the same way that Quentin Tarrantino filmed the scene of his car in "Pulp Fiction", and listen to the dialogue that can not stop thinking if this is 1) a disclaimer of Responsibility for the audience that this movie will stink, or 2) An attempt to make the audience laugh at the pure humor of 2 people who talk about sequels in a sequel. Oh, the irony! (In case you ask, option 1 is the correct one). The brilliant and clever Chili Palmer of the first and good movie "Get Shorty" is revived to play a professional music mobster. He steals a young singer (Christina Milian) from his ghetto and his Jewish manager (Vince Vaughn), and turns it into a singing sensation. Of course, a film about an ex-mafioso can never be complete without new mobsters that wreak havoc. This time, the elected mobsters are Russian, played by American actors who can not act like Russians if my whole family hits them on the head with their own Russian hands. <br /> <br /> As a Russian I was not much offended by the way this film portrayed the Russians, but as a writer I was more offended by the horrible dialogue. This movie worked too hard for the audience to laugh. It turned potentially good lines into a redundancy. The Russian, black and gay jokes were the same ones that were only redesigned a couple of hundred times. After calling the character of The Rock af ***** (plays a gay bodyguard Vince Vaughn), and the character of Cedric the Entertainer, a ***** (played a black rapper with a retinue that threatens those who do not play their fingerprints with guns) I wanted to leave the cinema, because it was painful to sit down. If it were "Get Shorty", none of this would have needed to be in the movie to create drama, or a really bad laugh. <br /> <br /> What was missing in this movie that was not "Get Shorty" was Chili's spicy attitude. He is a completely different person in this sequel. On the one hand, the old chili would have had more dialogue. John Travolta does not have more than 20 lines that speak in "Be Cool", because he is offstage for the repetitive lines, and the appearances of one hundred and two cameos by the most random celebrities. I will not ruin the impact by revealing all the comments for those who really plan to see this movie (PLEASE DO NOT DO IT !!!), but I will always be surprised that these people have agreed to be in such a movie. <br /> <br /> What was even more stupid was the very scanty dance sequence with Travolta and Uma Thurman (he plays the widower of James Woods, whom LUCKILY dies in the first 10 minutes of the film). Tarrantino never did Pulp Fiction for an idiot like the director of "Be Cool" with whom to play. This dance number was boring, long and simply throbbing. The Black Eyed Peas that played in the club with a total of 10 people did not make the scene memorable. <br /> <br /> There were so many holes in the plot that I left the theater wondering WHY ?! Everything about this movie was a big question mark. I just did not understand the point of nothing. I could not even explain to you why the Russians were persecuting everyone, or why this movie was made because I'm baffled. All I got out of this movie was that everyone in Los Angeles has a partner, and the only way this movie was funded was through all the ads for Diet Coke, Yahoo !, Honda Insight Hybrid, T-Mobile, Trimspa (Even the same spokesperson is in the film) and the Writers Guild Bad. The holes of the plot, the stupid dialogue, too many random cameos, the horrible performance (even by the professionals) and a not so entertaining attempt to imitate "Pulp Fiction" make this movie the worst movie of 2005, and It is only the third month of the year.
