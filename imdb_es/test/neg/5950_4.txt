He just finished watching this movie. I could not imagine seeing this on VHS, as there were scenes where I needed the subtitles to listen through an accent or sound effect, although the scene itself was in English. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is quite attractive. The few CG effects were very obvious insertions, but the effects of prosthetics / creatures were not bad. It's not perfect, but the photography and editing (which were pretty good) made up for it a lot. The acting in general was bad, although I can not say how much of that the director can be blamed, since he had never seen any of the actors. The exception, I believe, was M. GÃ³mez (Uxia). She stole all the scenes in which she had a part, and not only for a very pretty face, but there was something similar to an urgency in her performance that none of the others had. The writing could have been much better: the plot was still unequivocally Lovecraft, and many details of Lovecraft were written, but personally I could have done it without most of the dialogue.
