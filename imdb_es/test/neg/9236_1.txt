Altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all its titles, from the worst to the best. He does not care (or has no idea) about art, all he cares about is making people think he has a kick in the groin when he sees his films. The problem is that the effort is too obvious and, as the events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration that is amassed, the effort fails. <br /> <br /> In this "Turkish" movie (who knows where the original is or the originals were made, since I thought it was extremely Hollywood), Altioklar is trying to be a kind of Tarantino. (Mr. Tarantino, if you are reading this, watch the movie to see the best comedy of your life!) He does not use subtle movements to do that, all he does is use extreme things and it becomes unbearably absurd and laughable. <br /> <br /> Levent Üzümcü as the forensic guy with cow-licked hair is simply hilarious. I hope to meet him in person and ask him how he felt about this film. Because I really found the role insulting to him. Demet Groping his genitals was also out of place, and he did nothing but make everything look fake. Another specifically idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100% defective rhythm setting. When things must be taken slowly, the scenes flow abruptly. And other times, it makes you sleepy to see the slow ridiculousness. <br /> <br /> If Altioklar is so enamored with the superficiality of Hollywood, he should use Michael Sixarrows as his name. Even such a move would not be as ridiculous as what he has done in this movie. First you must learn not to imitate directors whose levels you will never address, then realize that you are not in Hollywood and then take private lessons from Zeki Demirkubuz or Reha Erdem on how to unfold the flow of ideas in the plot. This useless movie could not be saved even by those, but maybe I can make movies to see in the future by taking these steps. <br /> <br /> By the way, I've seen some infamous bugs like Propaganda and Otostop. , and I still can not stop saying that this was the worst Turkish film in history.
