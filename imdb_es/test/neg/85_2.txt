I have no idea how anyone can give high marks to this movie. I did not rent it thinking that it was the next great horror movie, the next great parody of terror or the next great parody of low budget terror. Obviously, this is not meant to scare you, but a fatal error with production completely undermined the joy of the visual experience. The sound editing was horrible. I had to work the volume control of the entire movie. You can imagine how difficult it is to get into something, even a low-budget parody, when you raise or lower the volume or try to anticipate the next time you have to do it. The regular dialogue is very low, and all the screams, noises, etc., are VERY noisy. We are not talking about alternating between 5 and 7 in volume control, finding a happy medium in 6. We are talking about alternating between 2 and 9 in the volume where it is practically impossible to leave the volume alone. Once again, this movie could be a good example of what it should be, but it will spend so much time adjusting the volume control that you will never have the opportunity to enjoy it.
