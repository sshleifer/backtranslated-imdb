After the opening credits on a sheet of black paper with spots of white paint sprinkled, oh well, I will be generous and call it a star field, we are witnesses of an alien ship that crashes into a meteorite and is forced to land on earth. A terrible-looking spacecraft lands in a terrible looking model field. Three nearby campers investigate. From the burning spaceship, a reptile with the appearance of an extraterrestrial, the 'Night Beast' emerges, that's fine, so I lied that it's a guy with a rubber monster mask and a silver space suit. Campers are quickly killed by Nighbeast's laser gun, which shoots terrible special effects at people. Sheriff Jack Cinder (Tom Griffith) of the cities is informed. He alerts his assistant Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian) and gathers a group of men to investigate. Meanwhile, Nightbeast has killed an unfortunate motorist who stopped on the side of the road for a leak. His two annoying children run for help. They approach a house, inside two young people are kissing, the girl says "someone running towards the house". The boy gets up to look and is attacked and destroyed by the Night Beast, also kills the girl. Then he manages to kill the two children with his laser, maybe the Nightbeast is not so bad after all. Once the Sheriff and his men arrive on the scene, they have a gun / laser battle with the Night Beast. After possibly the most exciting weapons fight in film history, only the Sheriff, his assistant and a local man Jamie Lambert (Jamie Zemarel) survive. But the nocturnal beast is still alive, the bullets seem to have no effect on her. The next day, the Sheriff visits the mayor of the city, Bert Wicker (Richard Dyszel) and his girlfriend Mary Jane (Eleanor Herman) to obtain permission to evacuate everyone in the city. He refuses to say that you can not cancel a party he celebrates for the Governor (Richard Ruxton), and that he does not want to create a panic situation. The sheriff evacuates the city anyway. Two doctors, Steven Price (George Stover) and Ruth Sherman (Anne Firth) are attacked by Nightbeast before they can leave. However, they manage to scare the night beast and survive. Together with the sheriff, his assistant and Jamie, they decide to stay behind and fight the alien. Written and directed by Don Dohler, this has to be an amateur movie, made with family and friends, look at the credits and see how many Dohlers are involved. For that reason, I should probably reduce it a bit, but that still does not stop it, or excuse me from being a completely horrible movie in every department. It does not have a story or a purpose, things just happen to waste time, what happens with Drago (Don Leifert) who strangles his ex-girlfriend Suzie (Monica Neff)? This and many more scenes do not add anything to the movie. The script does not have logic, why does the Night Beast stay in the city once it has supposedly been evacuated? The special effects are embarrassingly bad, just look at the effect when Nightbeast shoots someone with his laser, a computer effect of which the spectrums of the 80s would be ashamed. There really is not much blood or blood, an open and torn stomach, an amputated arm and a decapitation, but they all look predictably poor. Credit for what is owed, the Nightbeast itself looks good for the most part. There is a scene of sex between the sheriff and his assistant that must be seen to be believed, music that even a pornographic woman would be embarrassed and two really ugly naked people make this sequence difficult to see. Less than stellar performance, photography, music, lighting and editing make it a real task to sit down. And the worst of this movie? You commit the mortal sin of being bored and not being fun in the least. I'm sorry, friend, but do not give up on the work of the day! Definitely one to avoid.
