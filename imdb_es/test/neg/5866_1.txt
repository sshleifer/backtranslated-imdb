The man started, everything about this Caricature of the Episodes, the Stories, Script, an Animation is for me the most stupid, dummest and most annoying caricature that Walt Disney Television Animation has ever CREATED and DONE, I am so happy that both Disney Toon (2006) and Disney Channel will stop broadcasting it in the US UU From this month of May 2008. <br /> <br /> Believe me it is a wise choice to omit this plaster and a black cloud of a caricature, if you see it, don Do not say that I did not warn you or warn you. <br /> <br /> You stayed with A Boring and Down right Dull and Confusing Time, I wish and I prayed, I did not even see 1 episode of this Cartoon Buzz Lightyear Of Star Command. If I could, I would remove the part of my brain that remembers seeing it, yes, it's that bad.
