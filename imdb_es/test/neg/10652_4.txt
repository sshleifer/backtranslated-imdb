I just bought this movie because I love donating to Operation Smile, the charity on which the film was based ... but the writing of the film seemed very strange to me. It does not really focus as much on Operation Smile or similar organizations as The Smile Train and its Herculean efforts to alleviate the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries. No, it focuses on a volunteer American teenager, Katie, whose "privileged" life in Malibu, California, includes a mother who takes her to a doctor to have birth control pills before she goes to bed with her boyfriend. . What is this nonsense about birth control supposed to do, stimulate the audience? It's 2005. I would be more surprised if in 2005 a Malibu teenager was not in control of the birth rate, and even if it were, who and who cares? Katie, in contrast, is the character of Lin in China, a girl with a facial deformity who missed last year's chance to have an operation and does not want to have one this year. None of the characters is written in such a way that the audience can really identify, much less understand the motivations of either of the two girls. On the other hand, the actors do an adequate job when trying to play the bad hand that was distributed by who wrote this ridiculous script. The best performance was that of the gentleman who plays Lin's father, although much of his dialogue is in Chinese and subtitled. Operation Smile deserved to be honored by a much better movie than this one!
