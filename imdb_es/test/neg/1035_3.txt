A frustrating documentary. The son of Louis Kahn, who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of only one of the three separate families that his father had created, takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of its architecture and its life. It seems like a great idea for a documentary, but it ends up flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic problem is that Kahn's son, Nathaniel, is not just one of the protagonists of the film, he is also a director, writer, producer, interviewer and narrator. Nathaniel seems too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to perform well in any of these roles. Also, although he seems to be a pretty nice guy, he does not have a lot of presence on the screen, so the fact that he is the only constant in the movie becomes exhausting. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel also introduces himself as an unsuspecting and amateur interviewer, there are several points in which an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts an image of Nathaniel that offers little more than a blank look . and a kind of shy "uh-huh", as if he had a bit of panic about having to find something to say in response. Sometimes, I was ashamed to see people who might have had really interesting things to say about Kahn (or at least better things to do with their time) who seemed to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who would trust them. to direct the conversation. <br /> <br /> The double role of Nathaniel as a documentary filmmaker and as a lost son seems to do more to damage the film than to help. One feels that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to open up to the negative aspects of Kahn's personality and career, probably because it is not clear whether Nathaniel is searching for the truth or simply wants to hear good stories about his father. - Preferably those who will confirm their hope that their father really cares more for Nathaniel and his mother than seems likely. Your passive approach as an interviewer can come directly from this conflict. The only person Nathaniel presses is his own mother, but those conversations tend to look a bit like a bad teen drama (Are not you angry, Mom?) And do not offer much in terms of helping us (or Nathaniel) to understand Kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him. <br /> <br /> What the film desperately lacks is shaped by an independent and experienced hand, not to exclude Nathaniel, but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience. Could have moved away from the material, more attention has been given to what the interviewees could contribute and, it is hoped, they have eliminated those parts of the documentary process that simply do not work, like the strange segment with the guy who claims to have seen Kahn. dying (what looked like Nathaniel was being cheated by some wacko) or everything related to Kahn's first cousin, who had nothing to add about Kahn or Nathaniel. s Nathaniel forces us to see him standing or near a building button Kahn Ng strangers to tell them that his father was the designer. (Ahhh, it's nice, sir, Umm, I have to go now.) I understand why these things can be important to Nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting, but this is one of those examples of when documentary can be TOO MANY. <br /> <br /> As an aside, I thought the written score for the movie was great! (But, one of the strangest moments of all this was when, during the tour of the Kimball Art Museum, the voice-over cites Kahn as a comparison between architecture and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. the same time? THE NINTH Beethoven's Symphony: A mistake? A mistake? Who knows? It made me laugh.) <br /> <br /> Kahn was a great architect and it is clear that he was an unusual human being and I had an intriguing life story. There is definitely a good documentary about him. One sympathizes with Nathaniel's search for the father he did not know, but I'm not sure that THIS is an interesting story. It does not work that well in this movie either.
