Frankly I met the real Han Su Ying and I saw her represented by an American actress who does not look anything like what the Chinese people do when they see this movie. Why can not Hollywood get Nancy Kwan instead ... at least it's more? faithful to history ... because, for the love of God ... Dr. Han Su Ying is Chinese. I know because I've met her in person <br /> <br /> and I've seen the whole cast ... very few Asians The faces in a movie about an Asian love story also make me think. <br /> <br /> I think the acting is good, but without real Asian faces in an Asian love story it makes the plot so corny and a whole load of Baloney <br /> <br /> It's like another movie I know from "THE CONQUERER" Imagine my eyes open when I see John Wayne as Genghis Khan! I want to see the worst. ... how on earth can a man born and raised in MONGOLIAN STEPPES present a Southern Alabama accent? !! and a cheap imitation of anything Asian. <br /> <br /> Good Grief <br /> <br /> It does not surprise me that one day I see Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. being played by one of the black boys. and the white minstrels show <br /> <br /> I'd love to see it <br /> <br /> and laugh at the whole roof! <br /> <br /> Regards
