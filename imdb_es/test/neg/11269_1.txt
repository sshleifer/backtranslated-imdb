"Yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (let's just say "The Shogun's Samurai") is somewhere between horribly boring and hallucinatoryly painful to watch. Like a historical epic, it could have had many more chances to be a rich saga ... but in reality it's just another cheap action movie from the 70s with a story based on real events and a sports Sonny. Chiba Before the midpoint of this movie, I even had the temptation to commit seppuku! The music is like a thousand dogs in heat that are heard in your ears with a melody composed by Ennio Morricone (which is not an insult to Morricone). The use of cinematography with zoom lenses is more nauseating than fascinating. And in terms of action, it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and, oh, no, they did not clash. What a terrible movie.
