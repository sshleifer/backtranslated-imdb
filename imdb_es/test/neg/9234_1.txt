Altioklar: master of thieves. <br /> <br /> Watch a movie, steal some parts of them, write a script ... It must be very easy to be a director in Turkey. I think Altioklar saw "Identity (2003)", "Saw (2004)", a few series that deal with crime, murder, etc. then he said "Eureka, eureka" (I found it!) After that, he wrote the script. of the movie. <br /> <br /> You can guess the killer at the beginning of the movie. It only took me 10 minutes. He shouted "I am the murderer, I am the murderer". There is no mystery <br /> <br /> Tamer Karadagli is the same (sux). Exaggerated mimics, funny male man. <br /> <br /> There is only one good thing in the movie. The performance of Demet Evgar is very good. You can watch the movie just for that.
