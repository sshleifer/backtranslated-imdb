With David Arquette starring you, you would immediately think that this is a stupid movie. Well, it's a stupid movie with a horrible script. But the F / X, that is, the eight-legged monsters, makes this movement a cry to see. A tribute, although on the foolish side, to those great mutant creatures characteristic of the 50s. Arquette and Sheriff Sam (Kari Wuhrer) call for help to fight the giant spiders induced by toxic waste that wreaks havoc in their small town in Arizona . Also in the cast are Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and the lovely Scarlett Johansson.
