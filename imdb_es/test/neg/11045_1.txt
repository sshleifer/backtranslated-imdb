Please, do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I'm in Korea (please excuse the bad English). I am sad to see these films that make Korea seem obsessed with blood and sex. It saddens me even more to see animal murders and to hear Americans say that this is Korea. We do not eat live animals !! So, please stop excusing the film for its crime by saying it's culture. There are scenes with man eating live animals and non-Koreans think it is normal. It is not disgusting to us, too. The director is a maladjusted and ill person who is obsessed with murder and sex with family members. I hope America and France stop glorifying this bad man who is laughable in his own country. Please, watch ANY other Korean film, which will give you ideas of how artistic we really are. This movie is trash.
