This movie has a lot of action and little heart. Let's forget for a minute that almost every aspect of the Russian Revolution is wrong; After all, we only have less than an hour here to tell our story. In fact, the Tsar abdicated after the First World War proved to be a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to govern as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war . Now, let's go back to our history. <br /> <br /> Here we have the revolution that is "rumored" in the Russian newspapers in what seems to be a functioning country until violence suddenly erupts and disrupts the life of the noble Baron Nikita Nikki. 'Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). He runs away from home with his former servant Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll) on his back, and they begin to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution, the baron made a regular habit of doing a work for the girl, not because of a real passion, but because of boredom as a form of entertainment. The revolution does not change this, and he keeps trying to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. It certainly does not make the audience like this guy watching him playing with her. Tanyusha follows the baron because, literally, he has nowhere to go after the revolutionaries take control of the baron's house, and he has known no other life than waiting for Nikki's hands and feet. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly tires of life as a penniless worker, and is when she meets her former lover, the Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan to take them to Paris, where the Czarists have gathered after of the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha, Vera's plan does not include her. <br /> <br /> This movie manages to completely waste the considerable talents of talkative actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with what little she has to do, but that's not much. Lilyan Tashman is the outstanding one here, although she only has a small role as the Russian vampire Vera. Lilyan was given supporting roles as often as she is here, but her earthy voice and glamorous appearance make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. Guy Kibbee is even funny as an American tourist who is curious about Russian royalty that has been driven out by the strength of his homeland.
