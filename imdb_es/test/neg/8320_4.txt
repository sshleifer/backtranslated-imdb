The Brave seems to indicate that the main character, of course, is brave. I do not agree The most courageous thing that can be done in a situation like the one that happens to her, who is brutally beaten along with her girlfriend who does not live a day later, is to persecute the criminals without resorting to a distorted vision of the society. The character of Jodie Foster, Erica, is a personality of the radio whose niche is to walk the streets and record what happens. We are not given a real depth other than "she had someone she loved, he died, the police do not chase him, she gets a gun, yada-yada-yada, she gets a little bit but not really involved with the main detective "in the character, and so they were left with something that was left over from past movies: the code of vigilant justice, where taking power in one's own hands is all there is. But we're never quite sure if Erica is healthy or not, if the filmmakers take a position one way or another (that is, until the end, which is such a stupid message anyway, including the dog as a dominant metaphor) , while we do The city of New York today, which has become much safer than, say, twenty years ago, it looks like you will be stabbed or hit if you go down the right alley or just sit alone in a subway car. <br /> <br /> There might even be a little better film in the middle of all this, maybe only in the minor plot with the detective Terence Howard, who is involved in the custody battle of a child who It is not yours and a woman who is not connected and is a stepfather who I do not know what, apart from owning parking lots and being a bad guy, but leaves us a script that is both full of logic and bewildered. For example, it becomes laughable to see that at first the logical side of Erica is unable to shoot correctly, as was seen in her first shooting at a convenience store at the convenient time of a wife stealing from her husband, and then giving way to the illogical of his shot when shooting a pimp who drove a car towards her and killed him and crouched just in time not to be run over. It does not help that Jordon's style with the camera becomes a little more than unbearable: it's called stedi-cam for a * reason *, not because it can get in and out. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the script and the direction become very good, or rather they work the best they can in the desired circumstances: by looking at the scene of the beating under the bridge, caught between a point of sight recorded on video by one of the criminals by the regular film camera A rhythm that is perfectly disorienting. And when Erica returns to the air for the first time on her radio show, she freezes trying to do her old trick and talks out loud about how scared this scene is, about Foster's performance, the clear direction and script, It is the best scene in the movie. But aside from that, there are a lot of postures in a psychology that is weak: is she a De Niro in Taxi Driver or a Bronson in Death Wish? We have her narration about scenes, part of her has nothing to do with her radio program, observing how upset she is about walking at night, nothing more than her self-imposed task of cleaning the streets. But unlike Death Wish, a film that contained more ambiguity and never contained an answer at the end in a scenario of revenge, the path of endless violence only obeys a message, one that will not be news for anyone who has seen a second of Lifetime Melodrama from the movie of the week. <br /> <br /> The actors are satisfied with what is given to them, and in the end it becomes much more frustrating to try to stay with the anticipated, the plot trills turns, and the old and simple inexplicable (besides the hilarious without want, like a few insults shouted by Howard after being shot in a scene), and the temptation to leave is getting stronger. It is a very problematic image, with only a few moments of genuine interest and a clear inclination to the convention.
