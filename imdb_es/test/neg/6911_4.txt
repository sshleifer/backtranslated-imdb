It seems that there is a whole subgenre of old and cheap sex "comedies" that say the same of middle class couples. Something like friends, but with more soft porn and no wit. This film is not an exception, I had situations so familiar that I died of deja vu. Did people sit in armchairs, creating clich√©s about sex and relationships? Check. Monogamy versus cheating with some woman / man who would never actually look at another woman / man twice? Check. PORN THE BADDIES !!!! 111? Check. Any boy or girl in it that's the only reason you're seeing this crap? Check. The lesson seems to be: when you doubt, make an old sex "comedy" about people that nobody cares about, in order to make a statement that everyone has heard three thousand times before. That will make your movie done. It will even attract some comedy to anyone with a bad wig!
