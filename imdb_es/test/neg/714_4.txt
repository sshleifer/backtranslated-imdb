It seems to me that Herzog's documentary work is very uneven. Fata Morgana, a kind of classmate of Lessons of Darkness, lacks not only the heartbreaking spectacle, but especially the eye of a discerning author. By comparison, the aimless pans that look like amateurs to the left and right along the desert are the kind you'd expect from any German tourist equipped with a handheld camera. fences, abandoned buildings and dirt patches that pass through the lens in random order, interspersed with shots of sand dunes. At one point, Herzog encounters a group of hungry cows that rot in the sand, but the image is presented in the same way as you and I, perhaps worse, the camera that looks by hand from one cattle to another. For a documentary that tries to be a visual celebration, a hypnotic and surrealist excursion in unexplored landscapes, it lacks the visual orchestration and the conviction of a disciplined author. It is all over the place, half and tedious, the myths of the Mayan creation are recited in voices in off, then some other text that Herzog imagined for literature. It is not until almost the end that Fata Morgana jumps with life through a series of strange encounters. First with a man and a woman playing music in a room, the man singing in a distorted voice through a microphone, both apathetic in their task. A man holding a turtle. A group of elders trying to get out of some holes in the ground. Apart from that, this seems to have very little substance to offer or visual splendor to offer.
