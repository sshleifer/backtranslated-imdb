In New York, on a morning near Christmas, an upper-class father and mother go in their BMW to a private school to see their daughter's work. Then they go shopping and then return to their luxurious apartment in Manhattan. At night, they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood, where they prepare drugs for distribution. On Christmas Eve, when he buys the Christmas present for his daughter, the father is kidnapped and his wife desperately tries to raise a large amount of money to pay for the ransom requested. "R Xmas" is a misleading film by Abel Ferrara. The main characters do not have names, they are anonymous, and perhaps their intention is to say that in the bosom of a neighboring family in their building there may be drug dealers; or that drug traffickers can also have families and can be loving people; or that there are many dirty cops, probably worse than criminals; Or is it a simple apology to crime? Whatever is! However, this humanization of the criminals is a horrible message, and I really did not like this movie. In Brazil, for example, many drug dealers and criminals help their communities, due to the absence of the State in poor areas and marginal neighborhoods, but this procedure does not make them model citizens. In this film, we see a loving upper class family in the day, providing drugs as a means of livelihood, but the destruction of members of other families is not shown in history, and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any character. In the end, I wished everyone dead. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Gangues do Gueto" ("Gangs of the Ghetto")
