L'Auberge Espagnole is less fun and less interesting than any episode of Dobie Gillis. Where is your Bob Denver? Do they even have a Dwayne Hickman? A Frenchman moves to Barcelona to attend classes. He moves with other students who are not more interesting than himself, and they do and say uninteresting things. This movie is incredibly smooth. The only bright spot was a cute French girl who played a Belgian lesbian. He places his hands behind his head and reveals shaved armpits, not the usual tufts of dark, smelly hair. But naked armpits do not make a good movie. L'Emmerdeur was fun, just like La Cage aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard make you wonder what's wrong with French comedy.
