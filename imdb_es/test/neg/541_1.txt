This yawning low-budget kitchen sink is the kind of film that can only be made in the UK, since in any other part of the world there should be a market before a green light is issued. Most likely, it is self-financing, this is clearly an attempt to solve important problems but, ultimately, undermines its point of existence in the sense that it is necessary to plead, who could invest money in distributing this and, secondly, if there is no market audience to observe Buy or rent this movie, why would anyone bother in the first place? My opinions may sound unfairly harsh for a director for the first time, but this is the kind of film that only serves to undermine commercial viability and the quality standards that have just been maintained by a British film industry. Revised in Edinburgh. 2 out of 10
