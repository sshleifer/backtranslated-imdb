Artificial melodrama with a script adapted by Mel Dinelli from his work "The Man" refers to a pension hotel owner who is dedicated to a maintenance staff with problems that can be homicidal. Despite the solid work of Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both try their best), this tedious thread is not very inventive in its first set (which quickly becomes visually boring) and a sparsely populated cast of characters (however, there is an intelligent dog that detects the worst!). Hokey and humorless, with a forced direction from Harry Horner (maybe I should have directed Lupino?). Where is all the suspense promised by the ads? Dinelli was also a co-producer. * 1/2 of ****
