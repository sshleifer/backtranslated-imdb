This film presents a pretty decent FX sequence from a 1936 earthquake. The reason why you have not seen it is because the audiences of the 30s were in love with the "Jeanette MacDonald image"; in which the star of the same name made its way through innumerable songs, while the plots stopped completely. The FX crosses time very well. MacDonald's songs do not, and the awkward insertion of those songs to show his only typical talent is not good. <br /> <br /> The canine device of two friends growing up to become a priest and a bully is repeated on the machinery (Manhattan Melodrama, The Departed). At the 30 minute mark, you've already heard the song 'San Francisco' three times. Entertainment in the thirties is generally an accumulation of irritation. Only the Great Hotel of the decade renounces the nuisance to the degree shown in San Francisco, dinner at 8, Little Caesar, Stagecoach, All Quiet on the western front, Les Miserables, etc.
