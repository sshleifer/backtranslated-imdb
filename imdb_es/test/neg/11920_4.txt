!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The premise is the following: a store is burned and the father of the man who started the fire asks the assistant Sergio to take the envelope to which Sergio accepts. <br /> <br /> Up until now, fine, but there is a fair amount of logic. Sergio agrees to do this for the sum of $ 25,000, but why? Come, boys, if you were a good white boy, would you run the risk of having a long period in a harsh prison (a very real possibility of a fire) for 25 thousand dollars? I know I would not, and since you would have a criminal record, no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole, is that the same as $ 25,000 for a lifetime of work and welfare checks? There is also something else that seems to have gone without warning of the premise, since Mr. Lumpke has told Sergio that his son made the fire, he seems not to realize the possibility that he knows too much. Would not the alarm bells ring in your mind about someone who wants to keep you quiet if they tell you something? <br /> <br /> I guess we're not supposed to think about such details, since A PYROMANIAC's love story is not supposed to be an intelligent thriller, it's a lighthearted romantic comedy Probably the best appreciated like a girls night in. Looking through this page of comments, it is obvious that the film has its defenders, but as a cynical man I was not too impressed and William Baldwin is exaggerated.
