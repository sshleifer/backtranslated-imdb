This movie was filmed with a digital camera, and it looks. There were enough annoying digital tricks to alienate the viewer, also with the help of a terrible score. As if that was not enough, the performance was also terrible. Now, in Hartley's films, acting is always peculiar, but here it was just BAD, especially by Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) and Harvey, who (thank God) can not say much. After all these external problems, it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not so good either. The jokes are predictable and incredibly simple, and events simply happen from one incident to another. The so-called book of life with Armageddon inside is not much more than an excuse to watch the actors fight to say their lines. In general, this movie is a waste of time, money and effort. Thumbs down.
