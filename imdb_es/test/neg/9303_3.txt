The book is great. It's one of my favorite books. The movie, on the other hand, is incredibly insipid and bad. When I heard that Damon would play Ripley, I knew that this production was doomed. But I did not expect it to be so bad. The actors spin and act very showy. Except for the Law (and even he is guilty of some striking performance), all the actors here are almost amateur. Talking Italian and moving your arms or hair should not be considered as acting. Damon is a disaster. It is too rigid for a character who is supposed to be a chameleon. Paltrow is forgettable and Hoffman plays another effeminate and thin character. Talk about the box. <br /> <br /> The really unforgivable part of the script (written by the overrated director) is that he completely renounces all the subtle details of the book and presents many of his own, and none of them works. ! The addition of Jazz music stuff is totally INCORRECT! I suppose that Minghella's idea of ​​Italy in the late 50's, early 60's is tarnished with images of Chet Baker wandering the Italian countryside and spreading further. Yes, Minghella is a true visionary. The movie is so bloody obvious. That silly scene when Ripley drives down a narrow street full of mirrors. Very laughable Yes, we get the point! Each point or detail appears a mile away, so much so that the film could give the audience the false impression that they have psychic powers. We know, for example, that the character of Blanchett, introduced at the beginning of the film, will come back later and only complicate things. And the soundtrack, sometimes, is totally inappropriate. Whimsical when it should not be. The film continues for too long and in all kinds of meaningless directions. There are too many boring characters populating the landscape (many who were not in the book). This movie is bad! Really bad! <br /> <br /> Apparently, Minghella's son told his father that Ripley's novel was his favorite. Mr. Minghella then proceeded to direct him as a favor of some kind to his son. Well, the director achieved what was proposed: the talented Mr. Ripley, with his aspirations of Hitchcock, is a film strictly made for children of 12 years!
