I had not heard of Soap Girl but I saw a poster with a five-star review of Film Threat outside the theater, so I thought, how bad could it be? Well, I found out soon. My God, this movie was horrible. The most wooden performance I've seen outside of a porn movie. Absolutely agonizing dialogue I just can not understand how this was done and why someone agreed to be part of it. And it seems completely incomprehensible to me that this was actually shown in a theater and that money was loaded to see it. How did this happen ????? And most importantly, WHAT WAS THE FOOT OF THE FILM MOVIE DANGER?
