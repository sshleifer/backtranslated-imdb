This is a Hollywood remake of a classic British movie. Everything that made the original "Italian work" entertain itself has been bled from this rough sore of a film "written by Donna and Wayne Powers and" directed by "F Gary Gray." I'm surprised that Troy Kennedy Martin (the scriptwriter of the original film) has allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig's ear.Martin has worked on some of the best film and television projects of the last 40. Even being vaguely associated with this stinker is NOT A GOOD THING. <br /> <br /> The humor is forced, the drama is laborious, all the characters are very nice criminals (with the exception of the unlikely and beautiful Charlize Theron) safe cracker / driver rally) and the plot only matches the original in the following points: <br /> <br /> (1) Three Minis (modern versions manufactured by BMW, but Minis, however) <br /> <br /> (2) Use of the Croker and Bridger names for 2 of the main characters <br /> <br /> (3) Disrupt the traffic control system of a city to provide a safe route through it. <br /> <br /> (4) Er, that's all. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, what you get is an American film by the numbers, boring and implausible, in which a gang of happy pirate friends will end up defeating their evil associate. . Believe me, it feels like a long time before they do it. The cast gives its best with what is given, but it seems that everyone accepted it as an exercise to polish the grass after reading the script. None of the original features of the film and the distinctly British taste have survived being fed on the Hollywood burger machine. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch the original movie of 1969 instead of sucking this wound in the chest. It's a wonder that Noel Coward did not make an aunt Nelly, jumped from his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this warm remake in the middle of their throats. <br /> <br /> Italian work? More like the Italian Jobbie.
