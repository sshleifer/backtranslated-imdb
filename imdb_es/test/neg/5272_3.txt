Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor of all time, no doubt he is in the lists of others and in regards to the great actors. He even achieved a good Irish accent in the Ordinary Criminal Decent as well. But Kevin Spacey, as a mafia leader? Or even a thief? I'm not so sure I can go that far. For me, the movie did not make any sense and the part of the story did not feel resolved for me. <br /> <br /> I know once again that IMDb will make me write ten more lines. But I'm not quite sure what I could say about this movie because I'm still trying to figure it out. Silly, is not it? But I'm pretty sure that more than a few of you IMDb users have been in the same situation I am in now, where you only want to say one or two lines about a movie, but now you have to make ten lines? Wow, that should do it. : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
