It is painfully obvious that the people who made this "movie" have never seen such brilliant skits as "The Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots". This movie is terrible, and so are the actors. They would not know how to act even if they hit their faces, as I wanted to do while I saw this pile of garbage. <br /> <br /> The movie is stupid and has no humor at all. I'm sure I could make a better movie with my friends. For me it is incredible that a film could fail so much. Not a single smart or funny line. There is no trace of intelligence behind him. It's a pathetic movie and I'd like to meet the person who really likes this movie. Gross
