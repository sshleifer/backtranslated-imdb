I do not usually see the drip of Hollywood, but I was dragged along with some friends to see this, which turned out to be fun in some places but without any originality. Do not worry, you will not have to think: Tarantino's story leaves us clues too obvious for us to correctly predict where this will go about fifteen minutes before each "turn". I stayed there worried that the movie was developing. Very good for a Hollywood movie but I would not have anywhere to go in the climax. And boy, my fears realized: YMCA could not save this one, but Liv Tyler almost did it. I guess being a man and in my twenties helped me, but she had a very good performance. Obviously, he did not have to do much except look incredibly sexy, but what he did was fine! McCOOL'S is certainly not going to fall as one of Hollywood's greatest hits (or should I say "should not" because the American film industry is not going anywhere at this time, and for at least a decade, save it.) Hit like AMERICAN BEAUTY, TITANIC and SAVING PRIVATE PRIVATE RYAN, and even those had major flaws), but if you are a teenage male, do yourself a favor and see Liv: she is a very good girl. Score: 5/10. See also: anything Quentin Tarantino, any American teen film in the last decade, anything with sex as its main selling point.
