I do not know why this has received decent reviews since it could be the weakest horror comedy I have ever seen in my life. Englund is only here for a cameo and his acting is as unnecessary as most attempts at jokes (and fears). The direction is terrible and the performance is worse. It seems that every year the producers try to make another Evil Dead, but these weak little original attempts are only treading on the memory of a true horror classic. <br /> <br /> If the filmmakers say "this is not a remake but it is a throwback of the 80s (which is just as unoriginal in my opinion - Hatchet) or people trying to connect it with other horror classics. It's still deceptive and will not make up for the lack of terror, comedy or even a decent movie for that matter. <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL COSTS!
