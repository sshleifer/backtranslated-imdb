This movie has more nonsense than any other movie I've seen in my life. The special effects are damn terrible. For example, near the end, when the Concorde falls off after the loading door comes off, the thing rotates like a toy. The special effects of Airport (1970) are much better than this shit. Also, the force of a Concorde that opens up to the height and speed would essentially make the thing stir. (That's if it would even open at all) But the movie has its good points. Especially when it ends. That is also corny. E.g. The thing lands on a loose snow bank, if it did, it would splinter into a million pieces. In general, 2 of 10. Instant flop. Great movie of laughter.
