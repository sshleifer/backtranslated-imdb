Yes, absolutely terrible, and this comes from someone who loves bad movies, but there is a limit. I enjoy all kinds of horror / suspense movies, and I've seen some wonderful works by European filmmakers. Broceliande is unfortunately not among those wonderful pieces of movie making. The camera work is worse than the amateur. It is not the type of MTV camera "of rhythmic camera and unstable fashion" of MTV that many filmmakers use to camouflage their lack of talent. This is simply a bad picture composition and a terrible picture composition. The performance is ridiculous when it is not entirely two-dimensional. The dialogues are forced and unnatural, even more than his usual horror / suspense film that delves into pseudo-mysticism. I think what most discouraged me were the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film. These were bad to the point of being ridiculous. I've seen what a small budget can do, and it can do wonders. This was just a bad movie. Very very sad.
