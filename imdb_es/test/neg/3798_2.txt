This movie is in a tie with the original of the worst movie ever made. I think this may be a little worse, anyway. SPOILER ALERT !!! Here are these survivors on a ship that has been overturned for a long time. Unlikely? Not impossible. The whole premise is laughable enough not to be funny. There are some pretty big names in the movie, and even they could not save this sad thing. I really think it's a waste of good celluloid. After seeing this, unfortunately I also decided that it had been a waste of time. Do not bother with this. Or the original for that matter! I gave him a 2, mainly because they throw votes of 1 out.
