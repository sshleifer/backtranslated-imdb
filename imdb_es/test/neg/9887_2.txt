I read the book after watching the movie and I did not care, I found it somewhat trashy; But books of poor quality often make good movies, and this certainly could have. The story of a teenage girl's exploration of her attractive power over children, which she finds as irresistibly stimulating as it is dubiously controllable, and that has even stronger control over her than she would in a normal girl because it affects her through your werewolf. -This story would have an obvious appeal to the young audience for which films are made: one type of attraction for girls and another kind for children: and I do not understand how filmmakers could be blind to that and change their minds. the story in one with little appeal to anyone. <br /> <br /> To begin, take the title (which is the best of the book): it has been extracted from a quote from Hesse, also used as an epigraph, about a person running in fear and savoring blood and chocolate in his mouth, one tasting as bad as the other. This is a wonderful metaphor for the status of the heroine: divided between her human and wolf sides, savoring each but equally fearful of both. The film dispenses with the epigraph and, instead, presents the character who works in his aunt's chocolate shop! I can understand how the title of the book could have suggested to movie makers the chocolates erotically loaded with "Like Water for Chocolate", and led them to want to link the same symbol with werewolves. But they did not; So, why is it in the movie? In the book, the characters are in high school, or inside and outside, as in the case of the Five, a gang of teenagers who prefer black jeans and T-shirts, and fall somewhere between the nemesas of heroin and your manias. In their twenties they have become decadent. In the book, the heroine is 16 years old, barely of an age to discover how her sexuality operates in the boy she wants, as well as in herself; she is the one who initiates the contact, then backs down, restarts and so on. In the film she is no longer a girl but a woman, and the boy is no longer a high school poet on the margins of university life, but a fugitive from the law (and a comic book artist, to boot), he is who appears. for her, in a way as unattractive as her cousin's with worms. At first she discourages him, but then surrenders, since she trusts that he will do it: hey, you know that you love him. I would have thought that a female director would have taken advantage of the opportunity offered by the book to show a protagonist in a proactive and incomprehensible role; but no. <br /> <br /> In the book, the heroine clan is expelled from their home due to the delinquent behavior of the Five; in the movie it's because she went running (!). She is a great runner, prone to kick from the construction of walls, and both she and her clanmates scale buildings in an instant; as heroes of martial arts movies and very different from wolves, or anything like them. In the book they do not become real wolves, but in things greater than the wolves; In the movie they are just ordinary wolves. In the book they metamorphose in style "Howling", with crunching of thorns; This is one of the things that makes the heroine realize the pain that her body produces, as well as the pleasure. In the film, the werewolves have become magical acrobats, have made great dives in swans and have transformed themselves into the air, shining like the yellow Tinker-Bell; It looks good, it does not mean anything. <br /> <br /> In the book, the clan is a slightly white family that has moved from West Virginia to Maryland. In the film they live in Bucharest, but they all speak in different accents, not Romanian. In the book, almost the entire pack wants to lead a normal life and accepts that to ensure that, and in fact, their survival, a need is to keep their true nature secret from humans. And so the characters keep saying in the movie; however, the clan chief is a kind of clandestine boss, but apparently he is not a crime boss, since he despises criminals, and has a permanent agreement with the police, which provides him "meat" for the pack. This seems a great exception to the rule of preventing humans from knowing; but perhaps the police are considered safe due to their known tolerance to eccentricity and to cult murder. <br /> <br /> At the end of the book, the heroine realizes that it can not be something that is not when, in her effort to live. a divided life, is trapped between the human and animal state, unable to be one thing or another. Her boyfriend is not sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is, the herd can not risk having him around and the two are forced to separate. In the film, she rescues him as Lassie, and they go to Paris (why Paris?), In a final with a smiley face but not very happy, since the conflicts between their natures, between their natures, remain unresolved . <br /> <br /> But the difference in the movie that makes it harder to enjoy is that while the characters in the book behave in a conventional way, in the field of novels for young adults, the characters in the film have been Made as annoying as possible. Any other line is a threat or some other type of skill: you will regret it; you do not belong here; you will not get rid of me; I gave you your opportunity; etc. I prefer to stay away from people who deal that way. <br /> <br /> There have been many good vampire movies, never a good werewolf movie. If this one had stuck to the book, it could have been the first. <br /> <br /> But no.
