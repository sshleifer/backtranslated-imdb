Apparently, a massive head wound is the cure for homicidal tendencies, turning a murderous sociopath into an adorable dog and dog hunter. Also (in this case for the ladies), it seems that the main door of a psychiatric hospital is a hot spot that is overlooked to meet potential partners. Those are just two of the approximately 23 absurdities that we must accept for this film to have any meaning. I love movies and I thought, as I suppose many Americans do (forgive me if I'm wrong), that Hollywood was the best product. I came to learn how sadly naive and brainwashed and 2) how much more sophisticated is European / Asian cinema compared to its American counterpart. <br /> <br /> I saw this supposedly disturbing psychological "thriller" the Night after watching a Japanese movie called Suicide Club. When the camera vanished into Walter Sparrow's happy little family enjoying quality time at the prison visiting room table (not to mention the fatherly voice that exalted the virtue of "doing the right thing"), suddenly I had a revelation. I had just finished watching a movie that made me feel like I had just had a glass of water when I really wanted a beer. My thirst was satiated, but it was strictly utilitarian. The premise was slightly interesting, but the story itself, with its innumerable "coincidences" (How do we explain that it has found the book?) We will only say something like "... Or the book found it?" I will buy it, the huge holes in the plot (why did they take the skeleton?), the predictability and the obligatory happy ending, turned out to be just another Hollywood pirated work.In addition, the casting of Jim Carrey was simply wrong.At any time, I felt it was able to break some tricks of one of his stupid comedies or In Living Color ... Jim Carrey as a tough tattooed police detective who enjoys slavery and rough sex? I did not buy it for a second. <br /> <br /> Do you want to disturb? Deeply disturbing? Watch Suicide Club.The story surrounds the mysterious suicide en masse of 54 girls from the school.The film begins with a group of laughing high school students studying on a sub train platform. Then we watch in horror as they line up, take each other's hands and throw themselves happily in front of a rapidly moving passenger train. Needless to say, there is a lot of chaos. So far I go with the story because I encourage the reader to see the movie. In fact, I'm not sure I can outline the plot even if I wanted to. What begins as a simple mystery quickly descends to an asylum of grotesque images. Did I understand the movie? No, initially I do not like many of the foreign films my girlfriend introduced to me. So, naturally, I thought it was "bad". But this one stayed in my mind. I went to bed thinking about the movie and woke up the next morning and looked for it in IMDb. I read some of the comments of the viewer and I was surprised 1) the perceptions that others had derived from the film and 2) the fact that I had lost the subject of the film. I realized that I was so accustomed to receiving the "message" from Hollywood, that when I faced a film that required the viewer to participate so that he could think for himself, he had nothing. It's as if I had been conditioned to "check my brain at the door" of the theater. <br /> <br /> Am I saying that Suicide Club is the best movie ever made? Of course, no. It has its flaws, many of which were skillfully reported by critics of IMDb. Am I saying that all American films are bad and all foreign films are good? Once again, of course not. My point is that there is a whole world of cinema outside of Hollywood, a work that involves the viewer; it forces them to think and question the films that do not telegraph the turns of the plot, follow a strict linear sequence and, above all, do not insult the intelligence of the person watching. I hope to expand my mind as I explore this new world of cinema that "does not think for me".
