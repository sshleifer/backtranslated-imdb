I saw it for the first time when it came out in the theater. Although he was only 13 at the time, he was an avid reader of "hard science" science fiction stories. The technical errors of the film are recorded in my memory. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may have significant spoilers. <br /> <br /> Even as a young man, I knew that the premise is silly. The rocket takes off for a lunar mission, in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (although loose objects float as in zero gravity) and because of that, the "cabin" (the area with the controls, whatever its was called gyrostabalized to maintain the "correct" orientation (so that when they landed, why did they not land on their heads?) and where, at least in near-Earth space, the rocket engines had to be running continuously - with the propellant burning without an oxidizer - when the engines died down, the rocket stopped in space and could not start functioning until a doctorate chemist determined it needed some oxidant.This time, the rocket recalled I had an impulse, and the next thing our heroes know is that they are close to Mars (even a 13-year-old nerd knew that a minimum energy trip would take more than 200 days). <br /> <They landed, They found that the air was breathable (although at the time the scientific data revealed that the pressure, even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen, would be too low to do anything good). They decide to camp outside the boat, and even build a campfire. They come armed, although they supposedly went to the Moon, where they would not need guns. <br /> <br /> They see a collapsed civilization, they meet street martians who look like people, they develop a philosophy against nuclear war and those who survive try to return to the planet of origin and die in the attempt to crash against Earth! To do so would require such a long orbital period, they would have starved long before approaching their destination. <br /> <br /> The movie that preceded, Destination Moon, used real science in the most effective way (although "rescue" with the oxygen tank forgot the moment when the arm passed from the center of gravity of the tank to the outlet nozzle). This film showed regrettable ignorance of even the most basic science. Only the most illiterate technologically should think that it is a science fiction movie: it is on par with the old series of Flash Gordon where their rockets took off from their bellies and went up in spiral, and whose engines were always on. <br /> <br /> The story about this that I considered banal, and I can recommend this only as a movie that will be shown to students to select technical errors.
