Essentially, this is a terrible movie with some features that may or may not be traded for you, depending on how much you want. In the "opening" of "The Red Green Show" for the big screen, the filmmakers abandoned the rustic charm carefully perfected during a decade of episodes set in Possum Lodge in favor of a "road movie" photographed with a frightening image.
