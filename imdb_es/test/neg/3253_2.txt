Have you heard the theory of cloning redundancy, where a copy is poorer than the original? Caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of that. They try to duplicate everything from the first movie. Now, in some cases this work. Robert Stack is actually a little better than Ted Knight, when they essentially play the same character. In fact, I like Randy Quaid, who is not more or less offensive than Bill Murray in the original. But Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield, and what's worse, C2 proved once and for all that Dan Ackroyd is one of the worst comedy actors of all time. There is very little in what I like, and C2 closed the coffin in his "comic" career as far as I'm concerned. He seems to feel the same, clinging more to the drowsy ones, like Driving Miss Daisy and the host of Psi-Factor. Apart from that, it's more than anything, "I've already done it, done that" for Caddyshack 2. Look at the original twice instead of each version once, and you'll get more for the rent money.
