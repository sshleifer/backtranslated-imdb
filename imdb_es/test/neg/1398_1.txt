This is the most regrettable excuse for a comedy show I've seen. I'm confused that this guy was given his own show. It smells to complete and absolute desperation on the part of the central comedy, trying to fill the void left by the talented and incomparable Dave Chapelle. It's a piece of advice from Ned's gold comedy bag: is not it a funny auction? Do you need to give an extra boost to hilarity? F *** ING screams at the top of your lungs. Simple, no? And as an added bonus ... finish half of your jokes with ... THEN YOU ARE RE-TAH-DED !! or DUH-DU-DUUUUHHHH! Oh man Very funny. Beaner ... hilarious. Wetback ... does the laughter stop? <br /> <br /> To illustrate my point in a more cerebral way, I will cite an example. Mencia jokes about how "delayed" it is to rebuild New Orleans, because it is very close to the water. Genius. The line of distinction between a great comedian and a hack has never been drawn so clearly. While a good comedian would find humor hidden in the tragedy, finding subtle ways to make a joke about something we can all laugh at and feel comfort, Ned bets on the obvious. Move the city. Cool. Wait, is it funny? Ned does not have the intellectual capacity to find the deepest meaning of things. The hurricane did not flood the city, ned. The dam project lacked sufficient funds and had a great need for federal dollars ... and here! They broke. I guess that's God's way of telling us we should not be there. After all, he has a seat in the congress. What a fool. <br /> <br /> Chapelle was a master at turning a tired racial comedy spin into his head. He did it effortlessly, and at every point, we laughed with him. While Mencia talks about blacks not being able to swim * yawning, * Chapelle took him 300 meters further with the black and white blind supremacist. You do not have to be scathing to be nervous. You have to be original. <br /> <br /> Mencia and her legions of fans are like that confined gay guy who laughs too emphatically at gay jokes, thinking that he somehow masks his own insecurities. Except, of course, with Ned, he is laughing too emphatically at the "delays." Du-du-duuuuh.
