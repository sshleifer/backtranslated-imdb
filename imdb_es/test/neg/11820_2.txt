Some of the films produced by Roger Corman's New World film company in the 1970s represent the best type of B movie, where the limitations of the genre act as a kind of liberating influence on writers and directors. From this environment emerged classic "drive-in" movies such as "Deathrace 2000", "Hollywood Boulevard", "Grand Theft Auto" and "Caged Heat". Unfortunately, their former colleagues at American International Pictures were running out in the 1970s, particularly in the absence of Jim Nicholson, and often produced second-rate imitations of Corman's films, sometimes featuring their own stars. "Black Mama, White Mama" is one of those movies. It's basically a cheaper imitation of "The Big Doll House with some of the same stars doing many of the same things." Yes, this is a John Ashley co-production (yes, the same John Ashley who was the hilarious Elvis who wants to be "How to make a monster" and together with Debbie Walley in "Beach Blanket Bingo") with all the hallmarks of their productions: women's prisons where all but maybe 2 or 3 main characters, including the inmates and the guards, are Filipinos actors in mostly non-speaking roles, where we see women of supermodel type assuming the role of revolutionary militants, and where the main joy of the film derives from the rudimentary exploitation of S & M. <br /> <br /> impression that I saw the most recent was horribly damaged by light (the good ole Will Viharo described it as "Yellow Mama, Yellow Mama"), but I think that even in the best conditions the photography and the direction n Extremely routine. There is also very little visual value here. Corman should not have had much to do wi The movie itself because he was always astute enough to give at least an extra production value when filming in free public spaces that would make the movie look more impressive. This movie does not look impressive, it does not have an impressive soundtrack, and you feel embarrassed by anyone who shows a hint of talent. The only remotely interesting performances come from Pam Grier as a fucking fighter to escape from life, the Filipino actor Dindo Fernando as his grotesque self-indulgent pimp, and Sid Haig as a mercenary in the style of a cowboy. The story places Grier and his co-star Margaret Markov in a low-budget female version of "The Defiant Ones", but it does very little with the melodramatic possibilities offered by that premise. Basically, it's just an excuse to guarantee that the two protagonists can still stop for a good fight battle in the mud while trying to escape from prison together. All this is in the spirit of good fun, but the film eventually fails, even as exploitation, because there is a certain advantage and rawness that should be present in such scenes that, instead, are replaced under the hand of this director with a kind of great forecasting capacity. <Br /> <br /> So the film will have little value for fans of hard core holding value? At least in the version I saw, it's not more explicit than "Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!" For more than a decade, and much less interesting visually and thematically. For those who simply enjoy laughing at "so bad that they are good" movies, this might provide some fun, but it is not at the top level. People would be better advised to search for "Caged Heat" or some of the others who revel in their own brutality to the point of becoming a camp; This is more similar to less ambitious efforts such as "Los Muthers" by Cirio Santiago. Unfortunately, the best thing about this particular movie is the title and the presence of Pam Grier, who was better in other films at almost the same time (particularly "Coffy" by Jack Hill). This film perhaps illustrates an intermediate point in Miss Grier's journey from Corman's secretary to Queen-For-AB in film B, but apart from its historical "meaning", it will have little value even for the big Grier fans because they give it Very little to work here. <br /> <br /> It's worth jumping, unless, of course, you can see it in a movie theater with lots of friends and lots of beer like me. And even then its value is questionable.
