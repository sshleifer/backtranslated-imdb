I decided to watch this movie because it has been considered the "most terrifying movie in history", so that's what I expected. Unfortunately, what I discovered is that the film did not have a single moment of fear (and I'm the kind of person who jumps very easily). The film was nothing but terrible clich√©s and every time there was a moment of jumping it was incredibly obvious. The advantages of this movie would be the music and the strange scene that was filmed well (like the last scene when you open the door and see Tun in the reflection and when you turn to him, you see the ghost on his shoulders). In general, this film really did not add anything new to the genre J-Horror and in general lacked creativity and fear.
