I'm seeing a pattern here. If you see a movie in Mystery Science Theater 3000, it is likely that if you enter IMDb.com there are many hordes of movie lovers, however, it was selected to be in that TV show because it was very bad. I'm sorry, but I read a lot about Rocketship X-M as a historical science fiction film that emphasized realism. Well, if that is the case, I could write several paragraphs on how, even with the knowledge of 1950, this movie is completely wrong. Gravity could be the first obvious observation, or as MST3K did as a parody of "selective gravity", also about when they are sinking to death and they are just standing there looking out the window, um the boat would not be upside down effect that scene? I would like to think that they started with good intentions and that it worked over budget or something like that, but I think this movie was just cheese, like in the one under the guy. Just compare this with "When Worlds Collide", which was released in 1951 to see the true place where this film is classified, there is no comparison. The movie gets a 2 or maybe a 3 on its own, it's not even fun to see it on its own. It gets around 5 or 6 as an episode of MST3K since there is no action or much to make fun of, just bad, bad, bad, oh, I mentioned it, it's bad.
