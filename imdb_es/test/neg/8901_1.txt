If this film won the Lumiere Award for the best film in French, what kind of garbage is coming out of France these days? <br /> <br /> The issue is important: how African economies are held hostage by the international organizations that are supposed to help them, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About 40% of the government budgets of several African nations are used to pay the Western debt, while its people suffer from diseases, dehydration and illiteracy. <br /> <br /> ... but the subject was treated in the driest way A way that could be conceived by man, drier than the Sahara that surrounds the country of Mali in which this film is developed. More monotonous and lacking in action than any documentary I've seen (and I'm a fan of the genre), one "witness" after another appears in this "trial" that is "captured" in a film that condemns the world Bank and IMF. Some critics may locate the colorful visual views within the film, but they were out of place and did not have a complementary soundtrack when they were on the screen. They belonged better in a coffee table book than in this movie. <br /> <br /> Even the characters in the film say something like "This test is boring" and "When will it end?" Everyone in the theater laughed. Were those people on the screen reading our minds? <br /> <br /> Danny Glover had a brief appearance in this movie. It is a televised film within "Bamako" and was set in Morocco or Mali. It was also more ridiculous than any western spaghetti I have tried to avoid. The only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was when a bad Caucasian man accidentally shoots an African woman carrying a baby and shows no remorse at all. Maybe it was to symbolize the insensitivity of the World Bank and how it is involuntarily killing Africans. <br /> <br /> And one last farewell technical photo, the subtitles were difficult to read with so many clear colors on the screen and not enough black outline for the subtitles themselves. <br /> <br /> I have already summarized the film for you. Do not be fooled by the hype. There is no need to watch this movie. You will never return to these two hours in your life.
