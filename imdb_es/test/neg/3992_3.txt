In the same way that Lamberto Bava was a poor facsimile of his father, Mario (who was an extremely overrated director), Michele Soavi is a deficient director in the mold of Dario Argento. "The Church" has at least one thing to recommend, incredibly detailed artistic direction, but absolutely nothing else. The movie is long, full of one-dimensional characters and it almost puts me to sleep several times. There is a thin line between "art" and "pretentious shit," and while "The Church" is not completely useless, you'd better see something else. <br /> <br /> 3/10
