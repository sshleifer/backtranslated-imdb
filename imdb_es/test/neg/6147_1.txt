More frightening than any horror movie ever made because you are in control of this blood festival that makes it more frightening than watching other people do it on the big screen or on your TV screen. This game has two CDs that make the game much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> Each CD contains a different character with a completely different story that makes the game much more fun. I recommend buying this game and the first game too (it's not as good as this game, although it's still fun) <br /> <br /> **** <br /> <br />
