First there are some holes in the plot in this movie. We see from the beginning that a child dies when playing the game. But who was tied up in the mail truck delivering the package that contains the game? How did the driver place the package in the mailbox when it was attached to the steering wheel? It's not like it's Mr. Fantastic. Wow, that's only in the first 15 minutes ... The actors are second-rate, they take the "Bad Guy" played by Patrick Kilpatrick (who?). Exactly, he has appeared in an episode of everything on television and some supporting roles in bad movies (like this one). So most of the performances are like TV dramas, I can live with that, but the graphics or the special effects are horrible. The disembodied voice of "Game" sounds like a poor clone of Hal from "Space Oddessy 2000". What they called Zombies was more like shadows that jumped like monkeys from the Planet of the Apes. The aliens had transparent bodies like the shadow zombies. In most cases, the film was predictable since it had no hook or hidden agenda. The story was a good idea, but like most of the good ideas discussed during lunch, it never developed beyond that stage of good idea.
