Probably not the same version as most other reviewers because there is no real hard sex. What do people with hard sex mean? The hard-core sex explicit seen in films starring Traci Lords and "Big" John Holmes? Well, anyway, this is a really bad movie, I doubt I've seen so many big-name actors wasted in a movie. The script is really deficient and without plotting, the direction and the cinematography are horrible and the editing does not exist. It really is an absolutely horrible movie. You can see this ten times and still not understand what the hell it is. The only memorable scene is that in which people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawnmower approaches and decapitates them. Yes, you read correctly, a film set in Roman times has a scene with a head cutting a giant lawn mower! <br /> <br /> Trivia point. Many years ago, a pirated copy of THE THING (1982 version) was doing the rental rounds on my island and was copied on a CALIGULA rental tape, which means that the pirated version of THE THING starts with the first seconds of CALIGULA of the man and Woman walking through the forest, then the sequence of the title of THE THING begins. This led people who had seen the pirate tape to believe that the forest scene was the premiere of John Carpenter's movie in 1982 and they were very confused about what it meant. Well, that's what you get for renting pirated videos. But having seen all CALIGULA I do not know what it meant either
