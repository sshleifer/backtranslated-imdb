This movie is essentially a "how to do" on how to be a well connected pedophile. I'm surprised that so many people, especially other gay men, have seen this movie and read the book, and no one has mentioned the fact that if Weber were not an influential photographer, he would be in jail, making time for child abuse. Poor Peter Johnson. Weber took this poor and naive (although incredibly handsome) teenager he found in a training camp for high school wrestlers in the Midwest, took him to live at home and took thousands of homoerotic photos of him, many of them in its entirety Naked, throughout Johnson's adolescence. That is not art. It is child abuse. And what's worse, Weber made a lot of money with that, and poor Johnson will have serious "problems" for the rest of his life. Weber's lustful love of the child is downright scary, as are his ramblings about the famous (and not so famous) people he meets while trying to complete Johnson's "education". Spooky, and then just boring. The only thing I can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of self-deception. But I can not help but wonder why no one considered the effect this was having on "Chop Suey" (Weber's nickname for Johnson).
