Ahh, nothing like cheese, explosion, semi-porn, disguised as horror ... This starring Jaqueline Lovell (sometimes Sara St. James), the nubile star also seen in "Femalien", "The Erotic House of Wax "and that favorite of the" Nude Bowling Party "family. He is now a member of Surrender Cinema's untalented film range that stars in mindless exploitation and soft porn movies. "Head of the Family" actually tries to be a true moovie. A swindler and a vagabond try to tell the husband of that vagabond. They address an evil genius with a big brain in a wheelchair, and his family of moronic misfits, who use mind control to send zombies to do their evil desire. Said-genius has a giant head, hence the film's witty title: it's about the scope of the movie's humor. But, basically, it's an excuse to show the broad talents of Lovell and Dianne Colazzo (Ernestina). Tied with some of the strangest dialogues, it can be a pack (what the heck is "plowing the oats?" Someone else.) The MooCow says to avoid the dispossessed, unless you're looking for a rental at T & A / horror night .: = 8P
