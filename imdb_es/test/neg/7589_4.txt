Butter Battle is an entertaining story about two fictional cities and their arms race. It is also an erroneous allegory about the Cold War and arms races in general. Yes, it's a children's book, but like so many of Theodor Seuss Geisel's works, it hits people in the head with their morals. <br /> <br /> And that moral is what, exactly? Of course it is praiseworthy to encourage us to concentrate more on what unites us than on what divides us. It is even good to encourage international cooperation. But equalizing the differences between the Warsaw Pact nations and the West NATO with a difference in the application of butter is simply wrong. To point out the obvious, many Warsaw Pact nations enjoyed intermittent periods of shortage of butter and bread; They would have been happy to eat it sideways if it were available. On a less literal level, and whatever its political inclination, Soviet socialism versus Western (particularly Anglo-American) democracy is not a mere matter of preference and custom. <br /> <br /> To further clarify things, nuclear weapons did not develop in a cold war with the Soviets, but in a hot war with the Axis powers. There is no doubt that Germany was developing nuclear capability during the war. Should the United States have abstained from investigating nuclear weapons and trusting in its (less than inevitable) victory in conventional warfare? Once the weapons were developed, they were used against the enemy that attacked us in Pearl Harbor. What does a nation do at this point when the genie is out of the bottle? In addition, the retrospective is from 20 to 20, which means that there was no way to ensure that another crazed dictator did not appear with his eyes on the development of nuclear weapons. The second Gulf War has demonstrated the incredible difficulty of determining credible threats and neutralizing them. <br /> <br /> In any case, the caricature is little more than a simplistic propaganda that does little to explore the nuances of the ethical issues behind nuclear weapons. armament and instead tries to inculcate the fear of weapons technology in children.
