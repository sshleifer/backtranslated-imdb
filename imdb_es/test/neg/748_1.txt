This movie started quite well, keeping the mood of the book pretty good, even if the performance was not top-notch. The soundtrack was torturously bad. Saxophone and electric guitars? It was pleasantly incongruous. The singer was positively sad! In the second half of the film, the story takes a decidedly darker turn. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey has become a dark and terrifying place, while in the book it was disappointingly tamed and modernized for Catherine's eyes. <br /> <br /> Who the hell is this marquise with the frightening makeup and the wig? A totally strange and unnecessary character. <br /> <br /> One of the key elements of the book is that the General is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherine's books. His monstrosity is much more complicated in terms of the oppression of the spirits of his children and the treatment he gives Catherine based solely on money. He does not lock his wife or kill her, but he does send Miss Morland on a 70-mile journey alone in a rental car with not enough money to pay for the way home. Only the consideration of her friend, Miss Tilney, by giving him some money on the way through the door, prevents her from being stranded. All this point is seriously confused in the movie. They make the general too dark from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Peter Firth should not have sung! This part was painful to watch. His description of Tilney was not so bad, but in some places it was a bit dark. Henry Tilney, from the book, had fun with Miss Morland's imagination on a trip to Northanger, but it was never dark. Firth would have benefited from better management. The young woman who played Isabella needed a better acting coach. John Thorpe was appropriately hateful. The vest and striped skirt combo he was wearing was horrible. It certainly fits with your character. <br /> <br /> I think the movie would have been much better with a completely different soundtrack. He cast an oppressive pale over the whole movie. If I see it again, it will be with the sound deactivated and the subtitles activated. Maybe I would give the movie a 4 then. <br /> <br /> The sound quality of the DVD was quite poor. The quality of the image was not much better. This is notoriously evident on a digital television. <br /> <br /> When I think about what this movie could have been, I think about Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.
