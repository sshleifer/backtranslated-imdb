The biggest problem with this movie is that it does not look like Bruce Allmighty at all. The first film showed the fantasy of each dreamer awake to be able to control the environment that one considers convenient. However, Evan's experience is completely different. He has none of the controls with which Jim Carrey is deceived and, instead, the story focuses on the power of belief. Now, this would have been fine, since the first movie was preaching the same message. The problem is that the sequel preaches at the expense of comic relief. And to add insult to injury, he also gets into politics in the plot. You have the clear feeling that there is a clear message with this movie, and its main objective is not to make you laugh. To summarize things, this movie is a failed mix of Eddie Murhphy's "The Distinguished Gentleman" and Charlton Heston's "The Ten Commandments." I'm not sure if Steve Carrell is to blame, you have the feeling that it's his character that limits his abilities as a comedian, the former news anchor Evan Baxter is not supposed to be funny, he's basically an antagonist turned protagonist. that in this case it only adds to the confusion of what this movie message is supposed to be about.
