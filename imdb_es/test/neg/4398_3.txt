My God, when I heard that this movie was a NATIONAL LAMPOONS, I thought it was going to be amazing, but I really could say it was a disappointment. I have seen most of the films they have made, from the Christmas holidays to Van Wilder, and this is the worst movie of their name, very bad actors and a very intense movie. This movie is probably good to see if you see it with a multitude of people worked and the ability to laugh at it, but if you like good comedy as I am, I do not suggest this movie, I would prefer to see it van wilder for the second or third time, that to see this movie ... has been warned.
