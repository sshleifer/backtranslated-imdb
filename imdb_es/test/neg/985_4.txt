The most generic biography at surface level you can expect. Busey's impersonation of Holly is accurate, but who wants to listen to Gary Busey sing "Maybe Baby"? Typically, members of Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (Smith and Stroud, respectively) instead of people or even characters. When Holly uses a string section, the old Jewish-looking men who come tell her that she is using the same techniques as Mozart. It's just this kind of blatant statement that makes the biographies of movies like this (and "Amadeus", about the aforementioned Mozart) so useless. Some entertainment can be derived from the excellent styles and songs of Holly made in a version B.
