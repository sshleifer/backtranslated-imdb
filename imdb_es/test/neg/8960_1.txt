This movie is horrible, I'm sorry. I bought this to get Star Worms, and I really hoped it would be better after how disappointed I was in Star Worms. Oh, just kidding, it turns out that this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The acting is trash, not that there really is any, and the main character is a big stupid box that is attacked by similar things or something like that. I really can not say. The special effects are so bad that you can not even see the dinosaurs at war, which certainly do not fight, but simply stand up and move their mouths, or whatever those things are. The movie is a headache. It is very obvious that the director is trying to establish a universe. Hahahahahahahaha ... Actually, this movie is abominable, even by Troma standards. The only good thing I can say about it is that it has an introduction by Lloyd Kaufman, since it tricks us again so we can see something that is not suitable for consumption.
