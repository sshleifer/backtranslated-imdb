I'm terribly sorry! Where the picture of Lubitsch was charming, wonderful, full of spirit and elegance, here it only has color! Lana seems to be 51 years old (in fact, she was 31 years old at the time, but obviously she was depressed) and tries to be a shy and boring girl. Think of Jeanette McDonald, who gave the role of widow a double side "playing" with Count Danilo. That Lana had to play an operetta even though she could not sing - crazy! She just sings a song: the main role of a Lehar-operetta, that's really fun! The only really good thing is the great waltz scene at the end: glamorous! And, after seeing this scene, check out the introduction of the waltz scene in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"! Any similarity?
