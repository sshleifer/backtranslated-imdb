In a word, frightening ... too many holes in the plot ... um, yes ... Who takes his son to unearth a corpse in the middle of the night? and what about his wife stealing the skeleton ... who does that? Why, exactly the shrinkage was stabbed in the neck? And that dog thing ... I mean, really! Having narrated Sparrow from the beginning also completely destroyed the suspense for me ... I mean, if he is telling the story, he has clearly lived to tell it, so there is no possibility of his being released ... where is the suspense? there? <br /> <br /> Of course, you hope to make holes in a movie like this. But, there are so many that I lost track of the story completely because of them. What kind of name is Fingerling? Or Toppsy? Why did the wife unearth the body? (Who does that?) Or go alone to that spooky insane asylum? And where do all those candles come from? Why does the writer have his PO BOX in the damn book? I mean, come on ... And the book just finds its way to the bookstore next to the wife's bakery? Very convenient ... Oh and happy birthday, honey, here is a book about a serial killer. What THOUGHT THOUGHT! The book has about 20 pages, half of which are blank, and he takes it as ENCHANTMENT that he ALWAYS reads it. If you are really obsessed with this book, would not you have read it all at once? <br /> <br /> A little convenient for him to run into his future wife (carrying a cake!) About 23 seconds after being released from a psychiatric hospital ... how old was he playing? 36 ?? <br /> <br /> Was I the only one at the end who took the bus to really run over the guy? It's not good when you're encouraging the protagonist to bite him in the end. <br /> <br /> It seems that this was written by a committee ... I imagine that the first draft probably has nothing to do with the number 23 ... It seems like they need a hook to fool the audience and to make him think that there was something supernatural, when in the end it did not seem to have anything to do with anything. I mean, I did not expect the Godfather or anything, but everything about this movie was a total disappointment. Without all the things related to numerology, this movie could have been fine, instead of a stupid Se7en trite. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, unintentional, hilarious and otherwise a total snoozer.
