I think the production value is fine ... it probably deserves a movie 4/10 or 5/10. Traditionally filmed, with attractive people with model quality and a little class ... <br /> <br /> but the premise leaves me upset ... a decent woman would make such dirt? I mean, are you going to marry a man who would have sex with another woman? <br /> <br /> and what is more serious, is also active in behavior ... only in the mind of De Laclos ... the film also has many aspects that make Eastern Europeans look immoral < br /> <br /> after all, it's just a movie, if you do not intend to degrade women in general, I'll give you one more point ... but obviously, it does <br /> <br /> conclusion: a unpleasant piece of garbage with a little bit of flavor
