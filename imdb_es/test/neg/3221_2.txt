A friend of mine decided to rent this thing, luckily it was not my money ... Although I wasted my time. A story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by an incredibly bad performance and a horrible editing / direction. Maybe it could become a classic due to all the strange exaggerated performance :) (the character of Gary Busey, for example) All the exaggerated characters were actually the only thing that made this movie a little interesting, as they attracted their attention ( for all the obvious reasons obviously) where the movie itself failed miserably. In short: a waste of time and money <br /> <br /> 2/10
