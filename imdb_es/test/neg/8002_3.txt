Mockney comes to Brighton; In spite of a bad reception from the British press and the British cinema financed by the state and written on all sides, I was hoping that we would get some of the grimy, hard nose of London by the sea by Graham Greene. /> <br /> Do not even aspire to this. The characters that come directly from their cloned and criss-crossed trailers reproduce Guy Ritchie types. The format looks more like a British television series than a movie (Brighton is a gold mine in the background, wasted in a plastic studio job). <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in search of a good performance of Famke Janssen ... it's a bit of a skill for this company, its impertinence brand on the big screen belongs more to box office successes like Deep Rising. As for the performance (even a role!) The search continues. The circus is boring. 3/10
