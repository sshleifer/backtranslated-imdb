11 years after this movie was released, only 5 people have reviewed it here in IMDb. There is a reason for this lack of interest in Across the Moon. It is coherent, but it lacks any cinematic virtue. Watch this movie to see examples of terrible production in all aspects. Opening credits, for example, are white letters that rise mechanically from a red background. The ending shows Michael McKean looking out the prison window saying "There are many mysteries out there". followed by a musical clip / video montage of all the uplifting moments in the tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield. Everything in the middle is horrible. I struggled to find some value in this movie and I have remained empty. Although it's hard to believe, even a cameo by Burgess Meridith (who always pleases the crowd) disappointed me even more. This movie is like a mockery of what is special about movies. On paper the film is below average. Women living in a trailer. But what actually happened was almost impossible to see. The film tries to branch off in many directions, but never goes ahead with any. The unpleasant conflict of having their boyfriends in jail is never resolved. No conflict is ever resolved. There really is no conflict. Women try to become prostitutes, but that never happens. Instead, they get jobs as bartenders and a storage rack. It sounds exciting? It was not. It was stupid. And most of the movie is the two women who talk and generate an artificial conflict. Women are capable actresses, but the script was more than poor. Useless. This was a terrible movie, but it is even worse that they have left their retirement home Burgess Meridith to achieve it. Bad from start to finish. Like the toothless lion, this movie has no bite.
