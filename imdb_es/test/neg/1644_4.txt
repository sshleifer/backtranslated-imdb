Good grief ... to think I've seen it all ... Danny Thomas looks so out of place in this hodgepodge. It seems really uncomfortable. He can not sing and it's worth it, and when he's paired with Peggy Lee (Â¿PEGGY LEE ???) she easily ... EASILY leaves him out! Maybe the director saw it and made him do the really bad comedy routines he sometimes does in the movie. Peggy Lee is fine, but everything is chaos. Good to laugh, maybe.
