Seriously, friends ... I was preparing to write the Razzie Council and recommend this movie as Razzie Champ for 2007 ... until I got on IMDb.com and I realized that its copyright date was 2006 and not from 2007. Seriously, though, This movie could easily have been a Razzie Champ. This movie stunk! How in the world this piece of shit was overlooked even for a Razzie nomination in 2006, because it could easily have competed with Basically, it also sucks, for the 2006 Razzie Championship. <br /> <br /> I rented this movie, on the recommendation of a neighbor of mine who told me: "Oh, my God, after watching this movie, it will be a long, long time before I ever stop at a rest stop." I could not believe how horrible and horrible this movie was! Possible spoilers then, it's not that you're missing anything. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all ... the problem ... the rest stops. Obviously the director of this piece of garbage does not know the first thing about women. The toilets at that rest stop were on the same level as the one in the movie Trainspotting. I do not pretend to know everything there is to know about women, but one thing I do know is that women, for the most part, are total and complete hygiene / fanaticism. Given the choice between taking a crap in any of those toilets and possibly catching something or squatting in the woods, a woman will choose to squat in the forest. I know, because I've been camping with them before, and they have no problem crouching in the woods. So right there ... great plot and falsehood. <br /> <br /> Secondly ... she leaves the rest stop, and her boyfriend who was driving the car is nowhere to be found, neither he nor he his car. He just left. She starts screaming her name, wondering where she is. Ummm ... hello? You're standing on wet mud ... Did you ever think to look down for some tire tracks? I mean, his car is gone ... not only got up and flew away. And actually, that makes me think ... I was actually looking down at his feet, and there were no footprints in the mud. How ... exactly ... did that happen? <br /> <br /> Third ... the Bible hits the family of the mobile homes with the abnormal dwarf on the back who takes photos of Polaroid ... Wtf!?! ?? ? They did not make any sense at all, and it's as if the director had thrown them to be strangers because they were strangers. They did not make any sense at all and did not even take place in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fourth ... Oh, my God, this ... I mean, finally ... near the end of the movie. ... finally see the escape hatch on the roof inside the rest stop. I'm like, "You ... silly ... bi ** h. You've been locked in this rest stop all this time ... and you alone ... now ... you see ... the escape hatch on the roof? "I mean ... it's like they throw that away just because the killer threw gasoline on the floor through the window and was preparing to light a match. Then she needs to get to a higher place to avoid getting burned, and ... Oh, look! A perfect reason for her to reach a higher place! An escape hatch in the roof! It's like ... Why did not she go through that before? Most people in that situation would have seen him from the moment they were locked in that rest stop and got the Dodge crap. When they showed the escape door at the end of the movie, I said, "You have to be kidding." <br /> <br /> Fifth ... what was the deal with all the people you met? Continuing simply disappearing? The girl in the broom closet at the rest stop? The silly policeman? She at the end of the movie when she herself ended up in the broom closet? It was never explained. Personally, when they did this, I thought, "Oh, Christ in a cookie, it's her, she's the killer, wonderful, she killed all those people, she does not remember doing it, and the writers of this movie just started a certain horror movie French that I can not mention on IMDb.com or that I will be blacklisted for giving the ending (that movie was a shit, by the way, also the people) ". But it was not like that. She was not the murderer, and the whole deal with the disappearance of the dead was never explained. Oh, for the love of God, people, get away from this movie! This movie sucked balls, and now I have a serious bone to choose with my neighbor. It's in the 2-rack for $ 1 in Family Video, do not even rent it if someone gives it to you for free!
