If you like bad movies for the entertainment of watching bad movies, bad performances, bad productions, etc. Quality Mystery Science Theater 3000 ... you'll love Pacific Inferno. Jim Brown will always be remembered as one of the best soccer players he has ever played in the game ... as an actor, he will always be remembered as one of the best soccer players in playing the game ... I'm not sure who he is Rolf Bayer had ... but I'm hoping he was 15 or 16 years old when he directed this, maybe it was the next Spielberg in the making ... because if he was a grown man directing this ... a 15 o The 16 years of age could have done better ... The basis or plot of the film probably had some historical merit and perhaps even accurately, but the real movie may be one of the worst movies made in the history of American cinema ... I continued waiting for Lee Marvin, William Holden or Charles Bronson to appear to somehow save the "face" that was left of this film. I would have loved to have been on the red carpet, the gala black tie for the opening of Hollywood when this movie was previewed ... since this movie had to have many spectators laughing and shrinking under the breath ... in the ten-cent racks DVD now ... look for entertainment value ... this movie is so bad that it's too good to pass up ...
