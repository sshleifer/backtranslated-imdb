The beginning of the film is promising. When Jeanne Pollet (Anna Mouglalis) listens to the story of the incident that occurred on the day she was born, which raises the possibility that she is the daughter of a famous pianist, André Polonski (Jacques Dutrone), she set out to find out if it is true. or not, and given the fact that she also plays the piano, it's not such a remote idea. Jeanne meets André and his wife "Mika" Muller (Isabelle Huppert) and their son, and on the way they discover the fact that this family has some secrets. <br /> <br /> O.K. We have seen it before and it has been done in a more interesting way than here. The character of "Mika" Muller is left without us understanding his motives for his action and is not interesting enough to take care of her. The piano scenes seem false and the whole secondary plot of the piano adds nothing to the perception of the character, but makes the film longer than it should have been in the first place. <br /> <br /> In summary, A very disappointing departure from Chabrol, who can do better than this.
