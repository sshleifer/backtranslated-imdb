One of my favorite actors, C. Tom Howell, stars in this torrid WOTW remake. It runs a lot, while a spider machine generated by CGI is killing everyone. The budget for this, obviously, was quite low. It was also one of the productions of El Asilo. Have you seen any of those? Oh! I'm not sure why anyone would have done it while Spielberg's big budget version was killing them at the box office. And if the truth is told, no version is that good. George Pal's version of the 1950s is still the best representation of the novel by H.G. Wells, primitive special effects and everything. Maybe because Gene Barry was much more convincing in the lead than Howell or Tom Cruise.
