I do not know how expensive the creation of this movie was, but the effects were terrible. Half of the film was filmed on the stage in front of a canvas of the film (it is certain that the blue box would not seem so artificial). When traveling in a boat, the background canvas moved imitating the movement of the waves, but the characters did not move. The CGI effects: terrible (I'm not sure, but I think the effect was created with Paint and a GIF sequence was made of them, the next time the creators had to hire a professional team of CGI makers) It seems that the creator of CGI I would have drawn on the strip of images with trembling hands. Horrible, that's for sure. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I thought it had been created in 1983. One of my friends told me the correct date: 2005. I was speechless, I was so impressed that I thought I was joking. People, I recommend you skip this movie, the story is also twisted, you will not enjoy it.
