The actresses hold in a locker room, well, I guess they are preparing the small children for the change of room? (Boys, you should close your eyes to that scene.) A gigantic bra (34C that is definitely not the size of an actress) hanging and supposedly talking in. Oh, do not worry if your child takes your bra and then the naked boys (a girl pulls a boy pants) to reveal his boxers: children try it at home and at school Hitting a girl with male underpants: nothing wrong.The series likes to show underwear (panties below), actress, at an age under 18 in a revelation, bikini, mom, can you buy me one when I reach puberty? There are many sexual advances to learn: for example, "Do not doubt my skills with the ball". <br /> < "I like to dance, with my shirt off." <br /> <br /> "Wet and sticky is very icky, Sticky and wet makes Mommy angry". <br /> <br /> "Solo I want to put my face in this cake and go 'bbbbbbuuuub.' "<br /> <br />" I can think of my best ideas when I'm wet ". <br /> <br />" He cut my banana! "<br /> <br />" Come on the boy, let's do it "<br /> <br /> you'll never guess where I found this fish" <br /> <br /> "I'll leave you two to do .. is "<br /> <br />" Carl and (about Sam): She just got rid of iCarly to go play with Jonah?! "<br /> <br />" You will not get respect if your back is not upright. " <br /> <br /> "How it hangs" <br /> <br /> "What can I say? I'm a great ball handler" <br /> <br /> "Watch me whip your dad ! "<br /> <br /> Spencer: That's great. Freddie's mom: Thanks <br /> <br /> "Hey, could you keep your hands off my computer?" <br /> <br /> Freddie: Oh, and last night, I slept with my socks on. Sam or Carly: And? Freddie: ONLY my socks <br /> <br /> "They did not want to be part of me or my fights" <br /> <br /> "Freddie, you know how I feel about handling tools" <br /> <br /> "You do not even want to know where the batteries go" <br /> <br /> "It's like she put waffle cones in her bra!" <br /> <br /> Spencer: "Well, it spread ... to places." Freddie: "where?" * Spencer gestures for Freddie to approach, then whispers in his ear. * Freddie: "Ugh!" <br /> <br /> "Wow, you've always seemed ... so willing." <Br /> <br /> "I have to take my daughter to a special doctor" <br /> <br /> "I send many children, to many places" <br /> <br /> "Yes, you have I have been having all kinds of fun this morning. " <br /> <br /> "I'm looking for some 'cheap entertainment' ..." <br /> <br /> (Mom, I learn how to say **** indirectly today!) In general, very educational for Small children. Lesson to be taken: if you want to know more than where the babies of the children come from, watch this show!
