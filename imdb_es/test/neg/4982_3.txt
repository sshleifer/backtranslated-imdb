Good things out of the way first: <br /> <br /> The performance of Underdog's voice was FINE. But the fact that Jason Lee is amazing, that's not a surprise. <br /> <br /> Peter Dinklage (Barsinister) also did well, for the garbage that was given to him. He played the part surprisingly well. And so did Patrick Warburton, the moronic assistant. Now, I was an idiot character but he acted very well, actually I liked the character better than the protagonists. The lines given to him were childish but ingenious. <br /> <br /> However. Alex Neuberger did very badly and hopes that he will never act again. His "scream" was so disgustingly false. Silence. Silence. "aaahhhhhhh." In the scene where he hears the dog talk, "oh no, impossible!" It would have sufficed instead of the pathetic false cry. <br /> <br /> And then there was the girl and her dog that chased Patrick's character, Cad, on the roof. At first this makes sense, she is a "Reporter". A school reporter, but still an inquisitive mind independently. But why, why the hell did he take his dog? That had no value and the damn dog did not even say anything but a heartless "oh, helpless!" His presence was extremely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> In general, the script was pathetic. The only reason I give this movie a 3 is Barsinister, his help and the voice of the loser.
