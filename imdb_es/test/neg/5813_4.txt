I love Hedy Lamarr. I think she was very underestimated as an actress during the 40s. She was the Nastassja Kinski of that era, and the critics did not take her seriously. Having said all that ... this movie is a BORE. When I saw it for the first time, I was surprised by the lack of continuity, not only in the story, but in the makeup and the costumes. Hedy's makeup changes from one shot to another. The same goes for hair length and style. Reason: this thing had so many writers and submitted to so many stops and beginnings, it is incredible that they have ever launched it. His "Lady of the Tropics" began filming AFTER it started, but was released before "I Take This Woman." In fact, at that time, he was known in Hollywood as "I Re-Take This Woman". That should tell you something. I'm also a fan of Spencer Tracy, but he's BEAUTIFUL here. I've read in several movie stories that absolutely despised Hedy Lamarr, and that's perfectly obvious in the movie. There is no chemistry at all. The story wanders through one roll after another and, finally, it just arrived in a very strange way. I can not recommend this at all.
