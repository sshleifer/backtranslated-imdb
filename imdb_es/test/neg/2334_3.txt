How much longer will we persist with this erroneous belief that once a director produces an excellent and innovative work, all future work "can not be so bad, after all, he did such things". <Br /> <br /> Mulholland Drive is an example of this, and in fact it is an unmitigated garbage. The performances are excellent, particularly from Watts and Theroux, but a good movie that they do not necessarily do. What Lynch has clearly forgotten is that just making an unnecessarily bizarre movie only works when you surprise the audience. When the audience expects the movie to be meaningless, then the film must have some substance to keep the audience interested. Lynch succeeds in the first half of the movie, with the murder mystery created with many twists and false leads, and then ... plop! The story becomes a quagmire of strange hallucinations and meaningless segments. Methinks Lynch realized how confusing the movie was becoming, and threw out lesbian and mastobatorial scenes to awaken the audience, and to prevent viewers from stopping and leaving. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie in the preview, I was surrounded by Lynchophiles who had no idea what was going on with me, but left the theater commenting on the "layers and layers" of film making Lynch. Excuse me, but these people are the same imbeciles found in art galleries who look at canvases painted white, commenting on the "courage of the artist to paint such a brave work". <br /> <br /> Films like these are made because (a) Lynch is negotiating in his previous job; and (b) because people convince themselves that the unintelligible movie is art and, therefore, must be good. I asked some of the Lynchophiles what they REALLY liked in the movie and the only answer I got was that the type of response was not broad and that they liked it when the "chicks took off the kit". <Br /> <br /> Nuff said.
