The number 1 was really a great fun summer popcorn. It was the modern Jaws. <br /> <br /> The number 2 is best summarized by Jeff Goldblum in the movie about being the stupidest idea in the history of stupid ideas (or something like that). /> The number 3 is the obituary notice ... JP has achieved everything he will ever achieve. <br /> <br /> Once they realized that they had no new ideas, they should have let the sleeping dinosaurs lie. <br /> <br /> That said. The movie is fine if you do not mind knowing that you've seen it before. <br /> <br />
