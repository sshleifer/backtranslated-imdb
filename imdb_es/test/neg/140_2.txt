The success of the original French series "Emmanuelle" (I've only seen the first, which was not so bad considering) led to a series of imitations; The Italian counterpart, who even changed the race of her heroine, was clearly less polished and more exploitative, descending more and more towards vulgarity as the series progressed. Incredibly, there were 16 "Black Emanuelle" movies in total, with the heroine even changing the spelling of her name to avoid copyright issues! However, Laura Gemser, the titular object of the wish, became an icon almost as big as the original Emmanuelle, Sylvia Kristel (although, personally, she is too thin for my taste). Here, it is even considered as "Emanuelle" instead of with its real name. With the director, too, it becomes "Albert Thomas"! <br /> <br /> In itself, the film offers little interest: in fact, one would do everything possible to approach it as a travel notebook with some decent images of African wildlife. Regarding the sex scenes, I do not know how complete was the version that I saw but, although there was a lot of nudity, none of them was very explicit, not even exciting (the scene that came closest, perhaps, was when Gemser, who works as a photographer, and her partner Karin Schubert turn on the camera, naturally, without clothes, in the middle of the jungle.The film also presents an artist made to look like Salvador Dal√≠, but, fortunately, his scenes do not take much time to execute. Nico Fidenco's score is typically insipid pop of the 70s and, in reality, it's nothing special.
