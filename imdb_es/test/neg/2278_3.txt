This is what used to be called an "image of women" and later a "girl's movie" when times and movies became more youthful. The plot is just a telenovela for women and will only attract those guys. The only attraction for most men is if they want to see Mary Tyler Moore, too thin as a railing, in leotards. (If you are of a certain age, like me, that might be enough to take a look). Otherwise, MTM offers another of its typical interpretations of numbers that it has been giving since the 70s when it took it. in the background that she was the love of America. Christine Lathi offers another of those abrasive and unpleasant performances that seem a real part of her as a person and probably only attract those of that type. (Sorry, but it seems true). Ted Danson is too young like MTM's husband and, in general, emits a somewhat spooky appeal unless he has a partner who can soften him. And it does not happen here. Allan Burns wrote and directed, and probably did it all because he worked with Mary before, he wrote it as a project for her, and she had the juice at this point to do it. It seems that it has no other purpose.
