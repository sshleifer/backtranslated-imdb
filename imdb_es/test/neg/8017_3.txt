Remember the non-dramatic literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst? You will do it when you see this piece of chocolate box, wide action and involuntarily hilarious. The most guilty of all is Catherine Z-J, who, although undoubtedly pleasing to the eye, replaces a large dress and looks sexy for having a performance. Played face to face as a melodrama, or Cold Comfort Farm without jokes, this screenwriter has no chance to dialogue and you lose the feeling of irony or tragedy of the novel. A shame, given the quality of acting talent that is offered: Joan Plowright, Claire Skinner, Steven Macintosh deserve something better than this.
