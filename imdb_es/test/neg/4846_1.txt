I had never heard of Dead Man's Bounty when I saw it in the DVD store a few weeks ago, and I thought I had run into an unrecognized gem, since I had Val Kilmer in a truly unique role. Unfortunately, it did not take more than ten or fifteen minutes of the film when I realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions. The first clue you'll see of how genuinely horrible this film is is at the beginning, when you have a lot of garbage bags in an old room laughing like a group of hyenas in a scene that lasts about five times. It's amazing how bad it is. And, unfortunately, there is nothing better. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmer appears prominently in the box on the cover of the film, perhaps to deceive him and make him believe he has a role in the film, but unfortunately his strange role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a group of scammers half wit and the most inept conceptualization of a single city sheriff I've seen in a movie. He is played by Boguslaw Linda, who can not or is not interested in covering his Polish accent, which makes it impossible for the film to take place in the old American West. <br /> <br /> Does Poland have this kind of border past? I do not know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong point, but I can tell you that the Sheriff, as he is known in the film, is the worst representation of law enforcement that I can remember seeing in a movie. He is presented in a really ridiculous scene in which he wears a kind of bandage and a large number of men take turns to punch him in the face. Before they start hitting him, he explains that each one can hit him once, and then, after the first round, they will hit him again, and if he can identify who is throwing the punches, they lose. What the hell is this shit? I can not explain why a scene like this would be included in any movie. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the Sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten, bruised, drunk and abused, until in the end he does nothing but appear from time to time, stumbling on the screen and muttering "no? without ... the Law?" You see, there is a lot of conversation and preparation to hang, whose details do not make sense like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> It takes place, by the way, in a city that consists of nothing more than two dilapidated wooden buildings facing each other across a bit of flattened ground that is more a road than a road . As I understand it, it is a part of Poland that is supposed to look enough like the southwestern United States, where none of the characters, except perhaps the dead one, could have come. <br /> <br /> I have heard that Val Kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role, and also by the minimal use of dialogue by director Uklanski in favor of a dependence on intelligent image juxtaposition in montages unique visuals <br /> <br /> Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that Kilimer could not overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling he should have obtained when he was offered the role. Personally, I would really feel that I had reached a certain level of success if someone approached me and offered me a few hundred thousand dollars to sit still for a while. I like to think that he did not even read the script of this mess, because if he did, I can not understand why he accepted the role. <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie starts. with a man who brings the corpse of a man, played by Kilmer, in search of the reward. Soon he finds himself involved in an absurd love story that involves the city's prostitute, the alcoholic sheriff and a lot of chaos involving a series of stupid and stupid characters. <br /> <br /> There is also an extensive and absurd lack of understanding of American rituals. In one scene, a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and crushes the halves in Kilmer's eyes (so I can not imagine it), and then, a man makes a brief speech about Kilmer's corpse, in which he explains that he was "one of the best men we've ever had", and then proceeds to cut off his head with a shovel. What the hell?? <br /> <br /> Still not convinced? Here are some more reasons not to see it. In one scene, the Sheriff appears to be covered in ash, except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only be described as a bright red lipstick. A man has a wound on his head that soaks his head and body with blood. Dazed, he cauterizes it with gunpowder. Smart. Near the end, the Sheriff seems to have a broken arm. Sitting on the bar, he places a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm, and uses his good arm to pull the rope, raising his stirred beer glass on his bad arm towards his mouth, instead of using his good arm. to drink. It is also intelligent. <br /> <br /> Why do not you use your good arm? I have no idea. That, like everything else in the movie, does not make any sense, like the title. Summer Love? Are you kidding me? Avoid this mess at all costs. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, here is something for the IMDb Goofs page ?? <br /> <br /> Errors committed by the characters (possibly deliberate mistakes of the filmmakers): This film was made. SAY AH!
