This film begins the way each film should begin, with a group of hot girls in a bedroom walking in underwear and / or topless. A couple of them take a shower. I'm enjoying it so far! Unfortunately, then we are or main characters. They just are not particularly nice. Generally, in these films, the actresses do not really act, they offer very "natural" performances and they are very nice, fun and pleasant. Not here. They do not have much personality and I did not care much. <br /> <br /> Some of the girls go from camp to school. On the way, they stop at a gas station and meet a gang of motorcyclists. The biker gang really should have stayed out of the movie: it was cheesy before, but now it's just stupid. The main biker looks like a middle-aged man disguised as John Bon Jovi for Halloween. The girls go out into the woods and then the biker gang follows them. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what the hell is going on after that. There are a lot of things about the end of the world because it is the end of the millennium, then some of the motorcyclists are killed by a mysterious Indian guy who keeps disappearing. Someone who eats for a corny Lock Ness Monster thing while he's swimming in a lake. A kind of dumb makeup is apparently a druid, and you need to sacrifice some of the girls to prevent the end of the world. Or maybe because of the end of the world, I'm afraid I was not paying much attention. First, you saw the girls with animal skin underwear. <br /> <br /> It could have been a very funny corny movie, but the biker gang ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so scattered that it did not even meet my Z grade expectations schlock. They really should have eliminated half of the elements of the plot and only focus on one or two things. Instead, it's all over the place. In general, if you're looking at the late 80's, I guess you could do worse. If you tried very hard. There are a lot of nudes at first, but the characters are a bit unpleasant and the plot is too absurd to be even a little satisfactory.
