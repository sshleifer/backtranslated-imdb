Ups. I contracted this because I thought it was a bitter crop (1981), which was recommended. After the appearance of the atrocious Patsy Kensit, I checked the recommendation and discovered my error. Okay, you can see, because the main characters are very sexy, but the acting is horrible. Stephen Baldwin looks grumpy all the time, which is understandable, considering his co-star. Does Patsy compete with Liz Hurley for the title of the most obviously useless actor on the screen?
