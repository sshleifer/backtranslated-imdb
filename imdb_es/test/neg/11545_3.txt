One of the problems with popular culture, especially when it comes to the popular culture of the 1970s, is that the mass media, especially television, is usually about four years behind clandestine media, mainly music. . Many people think that the "Woodstock Generation" continued to be important throughout the 1970s; in fact, everything had ended in Altamont in 1970. In 1972, the "underground" rock or the "counterculture" moved east to England and Led Zepplin, Black Sabbath, and David Bowie, the first metal bosses and so-called " glamor rockers ", who were all" peace and love ", no. Nor, in a very different sense, was the "family" of Charles Manson. <br /> <br /> This obvious pilot for a television program (which, fortunately, was never picked up by the networks) is trying to come to terms with a culture that was already as withered as the flowers of yesterday. The script must have For some years, the writer Carlino had already achieved recognition of the difficult tales of revenge of the mafia, and all cultural references are "Easy Rider" and Woodstock (1969). The music that is referenced in the soundtrack is actually, before 1966/67, Woodstock Hendrix, Canned Heat, and Sly and the Family Stone had ruined this kind of folk-pop to oblivion. <br /> <br /> The film is about a middle class family that goes on the road to meet hippies. Go, man, far away, out of sight, it is an amazing fact that happens in a bag. However, politics does not count at all: Vietnam? Some place in Asia, right? <br /> <br /> This average TV movie (that is, obsolete and empty) is only exchanged for the surprising and mature interpretation of Jeff Bridges As the young university student who leaves school, he convinces his parents and his grandmother of "discover" (hippie) America. The rest of the performances are the standard television show of the standard television actors of the time. The director uses a good photograph of the place, but, otherwise, the film is a bad way to spend 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I knew it was over when Sal Mineo comments on a young fugitive (who tells the other characters that they are not really there): "She is a latent existentialist." Wow, far, wonderful. <br /> <br /> A couple of extra points for being "so bad that funny", but if you do not mind the television version of the 70's of the 60's, get away.
