Alexandra Ripley wrote a horrible sequel to the book of Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece published in the 1930s. The heirs of Margaret Mitchell sold their rights and for a lot of money they allowed Alexandra Ripley to write a scrap book even worse than romantic novels by Barbara Cortland. I was a big fan of Margaret Mitchells's book and Alexandra Ripley's fake sequel was written only to charge for money. <br /> <br /> Although I always admired the talent of Joanne Kilmer and Timothy Dalton, this is a really terrible movie. The script is horrible and full of clich√©s. The cameo of Ann Margarets since Belle Watling is so horrible that I wanted to slap her. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth doing in the movie is Sean Bean, who presents a masterful performance as the sexy and wild villain, Lord Fenton. Sean Bean's performance is similar to "The man you love to hate" and represents an insecure sexual symbol. <br /> <br /> But Sean Bean is alone in the first half of the movie, so you must be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6-hour movie with an unbearably boring script. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie, unless you're a Sean Bean fan and just look at it for its wonderful acting.
